I really wanted to take the Holmgren under at 19.5 points but without Shai, I was too nervous. Chet averages 18 without Shai and 17.7 on the season. Durant is averaging 26 on the season. With both being good defenses, I could see this being low scoring; however, both have enough shooters that if either teams gets hot and an early lead, it could be a track meet. Comparing Durant to Holmgren for the last eight games, Durant covers 3.5 in 8/9. I expect Chet gets 15-20 at most, meaning I just need Durant to get a minimum of 24, which he has done in 6/8.</td></tr>

Write Up: The Olympics have begun! I’ll be starting the Olympic journey with women’s hockey. Sweden who are one of the top teams, are facing off against Italy, who aren’t really known for hockey. That being said, Italy pulled off a great win against France, winning 4-1. Sweden are potentially going to make this line hit with just them alone. But if Italy can play like they did against France this line hits 100%.

Parlay : Cirstea ML + Newcastle TT Corners o5.5 @ 2.67 (0.5u)

Writeup: Leg 1 - Cirstea been the better player, has been broken lesser times and hasnt dropped a set while Raducanu comes here after a difficult match and took some MTO&#x27;s and while she clutched up and looked fine , she cant afford any lapses against Cirstea who gets free points on serve , is more aggressive and will have the crowd behind her. Value on Cirstea here in my eyes as Raducanu folds against players who hit the ball harder and this should mean much more to Cirstea than Raducanu who should be fighting for it but I just think Cirstea is better and can clutch the win.

Leg 2 - Newcastle has seen this event hit in 5/5 last games in the PL. Hope we hit it this time too.

Serie A is back, after some scary matches from copa Italia. A very well rested Napoli, (lot of injured players tho) faces a very unpredictable Genoa, this will be a very physical game in the center of the field, Napoli has much more muscle and quality here, also Rrahmani is back, one of the key players of this squad, Napoli&#x27;s quick wingers should create a lot of opportunities, Genoa on the other hand, relay on Malinovskyi for the creation and long shots since the attack line is very limited.

Odd: -145

Reasoning: Great Britain is really the Scottish team, which are ranked 1 in the world. They are undefeated this tournament and playing an overrated Canadian team. Canada beat Italy, the reigning champs, from scoring 5 in the first end. Italy lost the match, Canada didn’t beat them. I think Great Britain wins outright and probably covers the -1.5.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Tennis - WTA Cluj-Napoca: Sorana Cirstea H2H v Emma Raducanu 3u** $1.75 1:30AM AEDT

* Cirstea is honestly destroying this tournament. 15 BP faced on her serve over 4 matches. She just destroyed Daria Snigur, who is in red hot form, in 55 minutes.
* She had a 2 hour battle with Potapova before that but a lot of that was drawn out games, not because it was tight on Cirstea&#x27;s serve...she generated 21 BP opportunities against Potapova but only converted on 4 - a lot of games to deuce, advantage and back to deuce etc.
* Raducanu has been dominant as well this tournament but pretty poor before that. At her best, she probably is the favourite here but given she&#x27;s had soft opponents except for Oliynykova. Oliynykova beat Xinyu WAng and Bondar to get to the semis and I honestly thought she&#x27;d take Raducanu out too.
* Raducanu generated 14 BP opportunities against Oliynykova but had to save 13 herself. The form on paper is probably misleading when you look into how Raducanu and Cirstea&#x27;s winning %s look like on 1st and 2nd serves.
* This is Cirstea&#x27;s retirement tour and I think she&#x27;s a better chance than the bookies say she is of getting this win. But she is 35, so we&#x27;ll keep it at 3U and not go any higher.

Remember to bet on a bookie that will pay out retirements and void the other side.

Event: Nick Ball vs Brandon Figueroa, 5PM EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Ball to win via technical decision

Odds: -140

First time posting here, have made some good picks in the past with mostly boxing.

Nick Ball will be defending his featherweight title tomorrow against Brandon Figueroa over in the UK.  Despite the massive height difference between these two (Ball is 5’2”, Figueroa is 5’9”), height and reach won’t be an issue for Ball to overcome as Figueroa prefers to sacrifice his reach advantages to fight in the pocket.  This puts Ball in prime range to score rounds over Figueroa.  In addition, Ball throws punches that are more attractive/flashy to the judges as opposed to Figueroa, who despite throwing with high volume, throws many punches that get smothered.  Figueroa has one of if not the highest stat for being hit by his opponents’ power shots in the sport, so he is wide open for punishment at all times.  Figueroa has also never been knocked out and has an amazing chin which can take a lot of punishment, so I expect him to make it the full distance of the fight.  Ball has a knockout percentage of a little over 50%, which isn’t very high at all, so I do not expect him to be able to knock out one of the fighters with the best chin in the division.

The event is being hosted by Frank Warren and Queensberry Promotions, and is being held in the UK.  Frank Warren is on a roll with building up British fighters and getting them to world level, especially at heavyweight, so while I’m not claiming fraud or cheating to take place, I fully expect Frank Warren to have had some degree of influence in the choice of ref and choice of judges (see Ball vs Goodman, Wardley vs Parker) in order to secure a win for Nick Ball, who could potentially see a unification bout with Bruce Shu Shu Carrington in the future.</td></tr>

* If anyone needs help finding the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> or a place to bet esports can always reach out!
* These two lines both seem too high given the circumstances/the matchups they are in. League model putting this between 75-80% chance of hitting at + money, meaning it is incredible value/ROI play

***Hazel U 4.5 Kills Map 1 (-200)*** (Teams: Karmine Corp Blue (KCB) vs. Shifters)

* Shifters are -260 favorites coming into this game, Hazel is on the worst team in the LEC, basically eliminated from playoff contention and nothing to play for tomorrow, meanwhile Shifters are in a bad spot, but can contest playoffs, but need a big weekend and that starts with beating KCB, to move up in contention.
* Hazel is averaging 2.4 kills per map, the worst amongst all adc&#x27;s and by a relatively signifcant margin as well. He has had very poor laning stats, with a -750 GD/15 and a -6.3 CSD/15.
* While Shifters haven&#x27;t been great either, they have a big bright spot imo in Paduck, their adc who will be going h2h with Hazel in lane. Paduck is averaging the 5th most kills of any ADC in the LEC at 4.9, despite his team having the second lowest winrate overall, he also is averaging the most damage of any adc in the league at 32.8% over 1.5% above the next highest.
* Hazel has hit this line in 1/9 maps this split so far, 1/8 in losses and 0/1 in wins overall. Taking out his anomaly game in a map loss, he is averaging 1.85 kills per map loss. Even going back to when he was playing in tier two much lower leagues/worse competition, he had only a 5/14 hitrate in Summer, and a 4/14 hitrate in Spring for a combined 9/28. Shifters have only won 3 maps but have limited the deaths more then most teams in their wins so far.

***Baus U 3.5 Kills Map 1 (-263)*** (Teams: SK Gaming vs. Los Ratones)

* Baus line seems like such a free square to me, pretty hard to state how much I love this line, Baus is averaging a league worst 1.2 kills per map as a top laner, this guy was previously a challenger streamer, and while I respect tf out of him for making the leap out of his comfort zone, he is nowhere near a pro level top laner.
* He has been awful at this tournament so far, averaging a -1010 GD/15, -1062 XP/15, and -16.9 CSD/15, all the worst metrics in the league by far. He also gets next to no jungle help/resources because his team knows he is their weakest player so he is left on an island to soak resources and hopefully let the ex pro players Crownie/Nemeis carry games. Baus champ pool is mostly tanks/bruisers, he has shown next to no super strong champs outside of Gragas/poppy and decent team fights on Kled
* Baus has a 1/9 hitrate this season so far, taking out the anomaly gragas game, he has put up 6 kills in the other 8 maps he has played averaging 0.75 kills per map, with only one game coming close to this line with 3, **every other game has been 1 or less kill**.
* While tier two data isn&#x27;t as relevant because they were winning &gt;80% of their games so his stats got inflated and allowed him to play crazier and <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> up more kills, he still had a low hit rate on this line, hitting it in 0/27 map losses in his pro career, while hitting in just 43/92 map wins, giving him just a 36% hit rate</td></tr>

Paderborn face Nürnberg in an important league match where early goals look very possible. Both sides play attacking football and create many chances from the start. Paderborn at home usually begin with high pressure and fast tempo, while Nürnberg struggle defensively in opening minutes. Recent meetings between these teams have produced quick goals and open play.

Creighton now gets to take them on at home and that game definitely hasn’t left their mind. On the road this season in the Big East, Seton Hall is 2-3. Playing at Creighton is arguably the hardest in the Big East, right up there with Uconn. I get Creighton has been shaky recently but if there’s one thing that they do it’s protecting their home court. This time of year with Coach Mac? Absolute no brainer for me. Don’t let the records fool you, Creighton is a lot better than their record suggests and looking at the records is how Vegas fools you. Let me know if you’re tailing!!

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Falcons vs XG 

Map 1 Duration OVER 39.5 Minutes @1.71

Recap: RCY absolutely had a banger and cleared the line easily as expected. 3 in a row now and 4-1 in my other <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> on esports daily picks post. So let’s keep the streak going

Write up: These two teams already played during group stage and the game went up to 55min game. Falcons has been playing very slow and careful this tournament. Most of their games have gone over this line and I don’t see why it wouldn’t happen again. Both teams play slow, tend to go for late game, farm a lot and play really well from behind.


Going for map 1 because historically teams play cleaner and more careful in map 1 to not give the lead early on and delaying the game by farming, map 2 tends to be faster because the losing teams starts tilting or the winning team starts playing too comfortably and make mistakes that causes the game to finish faster, so I rather take map 1 over than map 2 .

**Event:** LaLiga, FC Barcelona v Mallorca, 10:15 am EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Mallorca +2.0 Asian Handicap, +120, 4 units

**Write Up:** I think y&#x27;all know what time it is. The last Barca fade was actually successful and I&#x27;m feeling another sneaky one here. Mallorca are having a pretty quiet midtable season, but they can&#x27;t be underestimated. Their striker, **Vedat Muriqi is the league&#x27;s second highest scorer** with 15, only behind the pen merchant himself, Mbappe. He&#x27;s a powerful, tall forward with **elite movement,** exactly the profile the Barca players struggle to contain.

Mallorca are headed into this matchup with a boost after **stuffing Sevilla 4-1 earlier this week,** and they&#x27;re going to put up a fight against the **tired Barca team that barely defeated the second tier Albacete** in their most recent outing. They still have the same **injury concerns** with the likes of **Pedri, Gavi and even Raphinha out** (yes, again). **Chance conversion remains an issue** too. Additionally, I expect a great deal of **rotation,** or at least **early subs** of the likes of Yamal and de Jong, who just can&#x27;t keep playing 90 minutes every time. Barcelona have more important games coming up, so they&#x27;re not going all out <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.

Just like with the Albacete game, I do have to point out that *Barcelona are the clear favorites here* *and should be winning this,* but again, it&#x27;s not going to be a blowout, and I think the +2.0 AH at these odds is good value. BTTS Yes is also an option: I think Barcelona are almost certainly going to concede at least once, while reliably finding the back of the net themselves. Very confident here and what&#x27;s better than a big Barca fade on the weekend? BOL and let&#x27;s finally get the better of Flick for real ☘️🫡</td></tr>

BOURNEMOUTH VS ASTON VILLA

Date: 07 FEBRUARY 2026 at 16:00

BET ON: Over / Under- Over +2.50

Odd: 1.70



\- Both Bournemouth and Aston Villa project this tie toward an open, goal-rich game, making over 2.50 goals a persuasive angle. Andoni Iraola’s Bournemouth are built around an aggressive, high-intensity attacking identity — a hybrid press that consistently forces turnovers and drives rapid transitions into the final third — and this isn’t just hype: data analyses show Bournemouth rank among the Premier League’s most intense pressers, winning the ball high and creating opportunities directly from these turnovers, a pattern that regularly produces goals for and against them. Although injuries to key players like Tavernier, Brooks, Adams, Soler, Kluivert and Doak weaken Bournemouth’s depth and defensive balance, Iraola’s philosophy means the team still presses forward relentlessly, even without its full complement — which increases the likelihood of both scoring and conceding as space opens up.

\- On the away side, Unai Emery’s Aston Villa combine structure with attacking intent that regularly produces goals at both ends. Villa’s midfield creativity and direct transitions have seen them feature in high-scoring encounters far more than shutouts, and sportsbooks’ statistical models flag that Villa matches frequently hit over 2.5 goals and both teams score patterns. Emery has publicly emphasised his desire for a balanced yet forward-orientated setup, pushing his side to sustain pressure even when defensive lapses appear, and while he prioritises solidity, his pragmatic philosophy still leans toward creating chances rather than grinding out sterile draws — especially away from home.

\- Both squads are motivated to attack: Bournemouth are chasing European aspirations despite a growing injury list, and Villa are fighting for top-table positions with players like Ollie Watkins returning to fitness, giving them attacking breadth. Tactically, Bournemouth cannot sit deep given their style and personnel losses, and Villa’s structure often entices opposition into transitional spaces that lead to goal opportunities. With both sides inclined to take risks, concede chances, and press opponents high, the conditions strongly favour a match that exceeds 2.5 total goals.

**Units:** 1 Units

**Explanation:**

Kotov is a top player, who has been out with an injury and is now back on track. Kotov is known for his really hard serve and fast gameplay. Kotov has won his 3 first matches in this tournament 2-0 and played quite solid. Schoenhaus is not on the same level and has won two of his 3 matches in a third set and not played anyone on Kotov&#x27;s level.

I believe Kotov is going to win a solid 2-0 win, as he is really difficult to break with his strong serve and has seemed to return quite well in this tournament so far, with 3 solid wins and lately against Rehberg who have played amazing this year.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:
Ludogorets ML @ 1.55 (1u)

Write Up:
Ludogorets are the dominant force in Bulgarian football with 14 consecutive league titles and a clear gap in quality compared to the rest of the league.
Currently sitting 7 points behind leaders Levski, this is a must-win situation with zero room for error at this stage of the season.
Levski are expected to take all three points at home against Botev Vratsa, which further increases the pressure and motivation for Ludogorets.
The club’s entire project is built around consistent participation in European competitions, making any further slip-ups costly both competitively and financially.
The current gap does not reflect a true decline in quality but rather temporary underperformance, making the away moneyline a strong and logical play.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Mateus Fernandes 1+ SOT (+105) 1 unit to win 1.05 units

**Write Up:** MGW comes through for us right before halftime to land us a sweat free win to tee up the weekend. 

I love me a battle of teams with bad defenses. <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> we&#x27;ve got the 19th place team in the league hosting the 18th place in the league. Burnley are statistically the worst defensive team in the league by most metrics, other than goals conceded which West Ham holds the honor of. Don&#x27;t expect fantastic football here, but I do expect some offense. 

Burnley, as I alluded to above, concede the most SOTs in the EPL, averaging over 6 conceded per game. Matteus Fernandes plays in the same role as our favorite player to back Enzo. He is less of a box crasher and more of a fire from range kind of player. When he hits them he hits them. He had an absolute screamer for a goal vs Sunderland. Fernandes does not take a ton of shots, but he has been trending towards taking more shots the last few weeks and I think coach Nuno has been encouraging him to shoot more frequently. He has landed an SOT in both of their last two matches (Sunderland and Chelsea), and took 5 shots between those two games. I like him here against this Burnley side to continue the streak. 

BOL and happy Saturday!</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Over 2.5 Goals@1.89 (Coolbet) | **Stake: 4u**

 **Write Up**:

A new season is upon us, well kind of, but not really. Japan is transitioning from a February - December schedule to a more  European fall-spring schedule. This has resulted in the *J-League 100 Year Vision League!* Which means the team has been split into two, the WEST and EAST division. This will run until the final in June.

There is a fair bit of money on the line if you are one of the smaller teams in the league, plus the winner of the EAST/WEST division meets in a final that rewards a spot in the ACL!

There is also another big difference from the normal league format, a draw = penalty shootout! 

* So a normal win = 3-points 
* A win in the penalty shootout = 2-points
* Lose in the penalty shootout = 1-point

Also there is no relegation/promotion on stake until the season starts proper in August. It will be interesting to see how this tournament pans-out. A lot of teams seemingly want to use this tournament to give some younger players a chance, so there has been less transferactivity than what one might expect.  

\---

**For the actuall game:**

JEF United are one of the “Original 10”, but despite being one of the founding members of the J-League and spending 44 seasons in Japan&#x27;s top division, they have spent the past 16 years in J2! So what better way to start their comeback in the top division with a game against regional rivals Urawa Reds.

Urawa Reds with another disappointing performance in J1, if we can still say that after a disappointing 2024 and 2023 and 2022 and 2021 and so on and so on and so on… Urawa haven’t done any big business for this “Pre-season Thingamajig Cup”, but they have lost Marius Høibåten in the defence who has been very good for them in his time there. 

So there is kinda no big reason to believe in them again… However, they do have a pretty decent squad with individuals that can do things on their own. I also believe Urawa will play some more young players in these games  which will introduce more “random” into the game.

For me, this is probably the most fun game we have from the J1 sides <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. The atmosphere is going to be amazing, not only are they back in J1 after an eternity in J2, but they are also up against local rivals in Urawa Reds. 2-2 maybe?</td></tr>

Time: 9:00 AM EST

​<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Spirit ML @ 2.00 odds (3u)

​Write Up:

I’m honestly surprised we are getting Spirit at these odds. The market is overreacting to that group stage loss, but we aren&#x27;t gonna fall for it.

​Now we are in the Play-ins. It&#x27;s a Best-of-3 elimination match, and that changes everything.

​My only real concern here is the draft, I just hope they don&#x27;t get outdrafted again like they did in the groups. But realistically, Yandex relies heavily on Watson having a perfect game to win. In a full series, it&#x27;s much easier for a team like Spirit to ban out his best heroes and shut him down.

Even though Spirit is still getting used to playing with Mirelle, I trust Yatoro and Collapse way more in a do-or-die spot than I trust Yandex.

​This is a BO3 elimination match, and we all know how it usually goes for Spirit in these spots.

​BOL.

Prev: Lopes WITD 🅿️ + Saint-Denis ML ✅



Event: UFC



<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Jailton Almeida ML + Kyoji Horiguchi ML 5u to win 5.26u



Jailton Almeida&#x27;s got wrestling on lock, and while his striking&#x27;s rough, he&#x27;s got knockout power when it lands. Almost all his wins are stoppages - he&#x27;s that guy who comes in hot, grinds for takedowns, and chokes people out. Only been to decision twice in the UFC, and he dominated both times. And yeah, that last fight against Volkov was a total robbery.

Kyoji&#x27;s opponent Amir had a tough time with injuries, probably caught in a post-prime slump, in his last showing he laid an absolute egg against Moreno. Given the circumstances, I&#x27;m going with Kyoji Horiguchi - his footwork and movement could be a game-changer. Not expecting a repeat of his last fight, but he&#x27;s got the skills to pull it off.</td></tr>

**CET 16:00 Football Premier League**

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>: Wolverhampton vs **Chelsea -1,5 handicap** at **2,85** odds

Explanation: It is the absolute bottom of the table Wolverhampton vs a Chelsea who deserves a top 4 here for the Champions League spot. Wolves are already done mentally from this season and Chelsea are sitting in 5th position currently. Wolves will be sitting back mostly, and Chelsea will lead the way with their chances. I do expect a great performance from Chelsea after going out vs Arsenal in the Carabao Cup, where results such as 0-2 and 1-3 are highly likely. Of course Chelsea can turn up and put a higher gear here with bigger scores such as 0-3 or higher, but we will play it safer with only -1,5 handicap here. I’m not impressed by Wolves at all and never saw it coming this season. Chelsea on the other hand keep growing and only turning out better for each season as expected from their younger purchases.



I also had other games in my mind to bet on, but they didn&#x27;t impress me as much as this game. They were pretty similar in terms of odds and picking style as well. My goal is to have something around the 3x odds barrier or higher. This one qualified well and we will always aim for long term gains. I will try to post another <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> on Sunday as well and I really want this one to go in. But anything can happen in football and good luck everyone.

Bookie: **Coolbet** and a **5** unit bet. Gamble responsibly!

**Soccer** | **Argentina Liga Profesional** | **Double Parlay**

### ⚽ <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Rosario Central DC (Win or Draw) + Belgrano ML @ 2.53 (+153) - 1.5 Units


**6 IN A ROW.**. After crushing the Argentinian reserves and hitting our Saudi <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, we’re heading back to the main stage of the Liga Profesional with a high-value parlay.

* **Leg 1: Rosario Central DC (vs Aldosivi) - Feb 7, 8PM (GMT)**
Central is the current champion and they have a world-class leader in Angel Di María. While Aldosivi is a tough nut to crack at home, Central is clearly the superior side in terms of roster depth and tactical setup. I’m taking the Double Chance (Win or Draw) here to stay safe, as Aldosivi tends to park the bus, but I don&#x27;t see them winning this one.

* **Leg 2: Belgrano ML (vs Banfield) - Feb 8, 01:15 GMT**
Belgrano at home is a fortress. They’ve started the season unbeaten against very tough rivals and their attack, led by Zelarayán and Uvita Fernández, is one of the most dangerous in the league right now. They are facing a Banfield side that has struggled defensively, failing to keep a clean sheet in their last 9 matches. The home crowd and the quality gap should be enough for the 3 points.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** 12. AUTUMN BREAK - WIN - $1.95 (Betting 3.5 units)    
**Write up:** Going with AUTUMN BREAK <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, a horse returning for its second prep and is the current second favourite for the country champs. Horse is unbeaten in all 3 runs, and is even unbeaten in trials/jump outs, with its latest one being an impressive 3 length win over a horse called SPARRING who ran quite well yesterday in a stronger race.      
    
Highway races can be a little messy, as it’s a big field and a lot of the form is hard to line up with a lot of different angles to compare, however I feel the best way to attack these races are with horses on the up, and catching them the first time they come to a city race. AB draws perfectly here in barrier 5, and has shown great tactical speed in all starts so we will be able to capitalise this good draw and settle in a forward position.     
      
AB hasn’t really been fully tested in either of it starts on good ground, and the trainer is adamant that this horse has improved over the last break, so we could see a really good performance here. We’ve also got T Clark on board, who is a natural go forward jockey, so all together I’m fairly confident with <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today’s pick</mark>. GL!</td></tr>

Write up: It’s here, the biggest day of the year, the best rivalry in all of sports (yes I’m a bias Tarheel guy), Wilson vs Boozer - Model has this as the highest confident percentages and hit rate for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Will add some personal information in this write-up as well.

• ⁠Model has UNC +5.5 at 51%

• Model has Houston ML at 50% 

•I am just going to start this writeup by saying Duke is the better team. Okay, with that said, I like my Tar-heels +10.5 here - I believe Boozer &amp; Wilson will cancel each other out in this game - You will have Dixon on Evans, Trimble on Foster, Young on Sarr, and Veesaar on Ngongba - I really like these matchups for Carolina - I think between Wilson &amp; Veesaar, they will limit Boozer and Ngongba on the boards - Carolina is at Chapel Hill, giving them a edge as always - I’m not saying it’s a crazy edge, but in this rivalry, whoever is home, always has a small edge - the key for the Tarheels in this one, I believe, is Stevenson, Bogavac, and Powell - these 3, if they play to their standards, will make an impact on this game - I expect Hubert to enter this game with his game-plan yet, with a focus on limiting Boozer - Backing the Tarheels in this one due to 3 things - One, they should be able to keep Duke off the boards and win the rebound game, Two, if Carolina can get out into the open floor and have some quick transition, they can control the game, Three, this game is being played at the Dean Smith Center

• Houston is the better team. Houston is playing great ball, BYU is not - Although BYU has the edge at home, they are also 1-4 against ranked teams coming into this one - BYU hasn’t answered many questions this season, and although they do have the firepower, and they are home, I can’t put money on them quite yet - Houston has won 17 out of 19 games this season when they have been the moneyline favorite - In every Houston write-up, the first thing I talk about is their defense - they will be able to stop BYU’s 86.7PPG % - I think Houston’s defense will be able to slow their offense and Dybamtsa down just enough for them to cover our +7.5 - Truly, I think Houston wins this one here, but BYU is way overdue for a good showing and a win - I’m not completely sold on Wright III &amp; Saunders yet either, if those two can put together production more consistently to help AJ out, this team will be very very dangerous - Houston’s defense averages 63 PPG, and it’s hard to not take them in any of their matchups strictly because of this - they grind out their opponents and capitalize on every mistake made

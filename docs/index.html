Newcastle TT Corners over 5 (Asian line) @ 1.84 (1u)

Writeup: Newcastle has hit the o5.5 line in their last 6 matches &amp; with a weak Tottenham, I expect the away side to be on the attack, hopefully leading to corners. Taking the over 5 Asian line for safety, where 5 corners from Newcastle guarantees money back. Lets hope we hit this.

Hope we get the W &amp; BoL</td></tr>

Last pick Kuniev ML 4u +150 (WIN)

**cs2: OG ML, 1u, +100**

I like OG here just playing one unit might increase, following rationale:

\-fnatic lost four straight matches haven’t played for 3 weeks

* OG new roster but won the last two matches convincingly
* I know all of OG’s players and three of them are cracked wheareas on Fnatic I’d say they have one maybe two players with big firepower
* overall I’d line OG more like -125 to -150 range with a median of -140ish

Only watch out is both teams are experienced and there’s a lot at stake.. might go to three maps (in a bo3) but I like OG to prevail nonetheless

Xinyu Wang - Elena Rybakina

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Xinyu Wang +5.5 games at @1.80 (-120), stake 100$ (1U)

Xinyu Wang has looked solid in almost every match this season. For example, at the Australian Open she caused Anisimova quite a few problems, in a match where she could have won the first set. Here, in her opening match, she cruised past Arango, only facing some difficulty in the second set when her serve dropped below her usual standard. However, she possesses one of the best serves in the world, and I don’t think she will concede breaks easily <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.


Elena Rybakina comes into this match after winning the Australian Open title, where she defeated Sabalenka in the final. She is an exceptional athlete, but I expect a slight dip in her level. Often, after winning a Grand Slam trophy, players tend to be more relaxed at the next tournament and somewhat less motivated. I believe this could be the case here as well, leading to a more modest performance.


Therefore, I believe Wang will not lose by more than a 5-game margin, and my prediction is based on this idea.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Olympic Hockey: Canada (W) v USA (W), Both Teams to Score 2+ Goals (2u to win 1.33u)

Write Up: This games going to be a tight one. Canada v USA, age old rivals. Both teams are going to be giving it their all for this one. Canada has great goal scorers. USA are the favourites to win. This <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> comes down to goaltending. I think this game ends in a 3-2 score for either team.

Tuesday’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>- Manchester United win AND Bruno to score or assist +133 (1u to win 1.33u)

Who is ready for a haircut? ManU are going for their 5th straight win and currently sit in 4th in the premier league standings. They will be motivated to keep this streak going. After this match tomorrow, they will be off until 2/23, so they have a bit of a break coming up after this one. 

Since coming back from injury, Bruno has been outstanding. In their 6 matches played in 2026, he has scored or assisted in all of those games.

West Ham have actually played pretty well as of late and are also equally motivated to get out of the relegation zone. These two teams played in December at Old Trafford and they drew 1-1. With that being said, ManU controlled a lot of that game and I think it’s safe to say this team is currently playing with a different confidence level than they were in December.

Good Luck!</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s Event:** English Premier League (Soccer) | Chelsea vs Leeds (11:30 AM PST)

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Enzo Fernandez 1 + SOT (-125) 1.25 units to win 1 units

**Write Up:** Back in the green yesterday as our guy Malen came through clutch with 2 goals on 7 shots. Got a touch sweaty as Malen had a bunch of shots blocked, but he came through for us again. Appreciate the love friends, and good to see a lot of you cashed yesterday! Let&#x27;s see if we can start a streak. 

We&#x27;re playing back one of our favorite plays <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> and backing Enzo Fernandez to land a shot on target. Enzo, as many of you know, is one of my favorite players to back and fits the style of player I love to back to a T. He&#x27;s always working hard, chases every fast break, takes free kicks frequently, crashes the box well, and isn&#x27;t afraid to shoot from distance. This is lower odds than I usually like to take him, but I absolutely love this spot for him so we&#x27;re not going to overthink it. 

Leeds sit 16th in the table and sit right at 16th defensively as well. They just conceded 6 SOTs at home to Forest and 9 SOTs at home to Arsenal. The reverse fixture at Leeds ended 3-1 in favor of Leeds, and while Enzo didnt have an SOT he did have 3 shots which is rare for him to not find the target. 

Enzo has been on a tear lately and is in the running (maybe favorite?) for midfielder of the year in the EPL. He has scored 4 goals in his last 7 matches, and landed an SOT in each of his last 3 matches. I expect Chelsea to dominate the ball here at home and im turn get their shots in. I&#x27;m also thinking there&#x27;s a chance Palmer is rested in this game and Enzo will play further forward where he has thrived this season. Even if he plays further back, I still see him getting his shots in. 

BOL!</td></tr>

Al Ittihad vs Al-Gharafa, over 10.5 corners @ 2.38

Al Ittihad and Al Gharafa are two very attacking teams that play fast, wide football. Both sides rely heavily on crosses, set pieces and constant pressure in the final third. Recent matches for both clubs have regularly produced high corner counts due to their aggressive styles and open games. With plenty of attacking talent on the pitch, this contest should see many goalmouth situations. Over 10.5 corners @ 2.38 looks excellent value.</td></tr>

&gt;**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Great Britain ML @ 1.77

&gt;Great Britain and Italy play for bronze Tuesday morning. We are playing against an overrated Italian team again that continues to make poor tactical decisions. Some very questionable shot calls really hurt them in a couple ends in the semis. On the other hand, Great Britain have played well all week, particularly when their opponents have hammer. Great Britain won 9-6 in the round robin when these two teams played and I expect something similar in the bronze medal match.</td></tr>

Any game that involves a team pushing for champions league qualification vs a team fighting relegation brings a chaotic early 45’.

Hertha covering 11+ in 8/11 games at home in the league, covered in 1/2 home games in the cup, failed to cover vs Elversberg where they went 1-0 then 2-0 up, <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> they should not win as easily vs Freiburg, meaning they should put up goal attempts.</td></tr>

**Event:** Premier League, West Ham v Manchester United, 3:15 pm EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** West Ham +0.5 Asian Handicap, +110, 1 unit

**Write Up:** Never back Manchester United when the matchup seems favorable for them. **The last time United strung 5 wins in a row was over two years ago** and I think West Ham have enough in their locker to stop them from repeating this feat.

Yes, *Manchester United are playing well at the moment* and there&#x27;s a sense of optimism in their ranks that hadn&#x27;t been felt in *(what feels like)* forever, but West Ham come into this game in great form themselves. **They&#x27;ve won 4 out of their last 5 games,** proving they&#x27;re going to be anything but a pushover. Their forwards seem to be in great form, with the always incredible **Bowen scoring 3 goals in the last 5 games against Man United,** while **Summerville&#x27;s scored in 5 games on the bounce in all competitions.** In contrast, while Manchester&#x27;s attack certainly isn&#x27;t looking too shabby at the moment, they still have **issues fitting the likes of Sesko into their system.** Here&#x27;s an even better stat though: **Manchester United have lost all of their last 3 games at West Ham&#x27;s ground.**

This <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> is essentially **West Ham to win or draw,** but my book offers slightly higher odds on the Asian handicap versus the +105 on the double chance. Do some line shopping and see the kind odds you can snatch. BOL and let&#x27;s enjoy some Premier League football on a Chewsday for whatever reason ☘️🫡</td></tr>

**Explanation:**

Tien has really moved fast up the rankings and is currently number 23. He did well in Australia and lost to Zverev where he even took a set. Furthermore, Tien won against Cilic a couple of weeks ago. Now he is playing on home court in the US and I believe he will win this match as he is the favorite, he is an upcoming star player and he literally just won against Cilic.

Even though I am tempted to go for a 2-0 win, I am playing it a bit save here as we haven&#x27;t been too lucky with our 2-0 bets.

Good luck!

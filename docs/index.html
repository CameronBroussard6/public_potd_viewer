AARHUS VS MIDTJYLLAND

Date: 12 FEBRUARY 2026 at 19:00

BET ON: Asian handicap- AARHUS +0.00

Odd: 1.89



\- AGF’s motivation edge in this first cup semi-final is grounded not just in form but in mindset. Jakob Poulsen has repeatedly stressed the importance of consistency, mental sharpness and belief in his press interactions — emphasising that his side must “play their game and stay focused for all 90 minutes” and not assume anything is won before it’s earned, even against elite opposition. This reflects a clear tactical identity: Poulsen’s 3-4-3/3-5-2 setup is built around controlled possession, progressive wide play and overloads in transition, which has historically allowed AGF to generate superior expected-goals metrics against Midtjylland at Ceres Park. Meanwhile, FC Midtjylland arrive weakened defensively, with key defender Mads Bech out 4–6 weeks, and additional players sick or doubtful — a major disruption to their back line stability. The Wolves’ coach and leadership have talked more about survival and managing energy than domination — an indirect admission that FCM might be cautious away from home and prioritise avoiding defeat to take a result back to Herning. Danish coverage has highlighted Midtjylland’s reliance on structure and set-pieces rather than fluent attacking play recently, especially when missing personnel, while Poulsen’s setup is proactively constructed to exploit those exact weaknesses. With AGF chasing a historic first cup win in 30 years and visibly buoyed by their resilient late victory over OB — where substitutes changed the game — the psychological and tactical groundwork strongly supports AGF avoiding defeat, making +0.00 a convincing angle going into this semi-final tie.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Alex De Minaur total games u12.5 vs Stan Wawrinka (-104 odds via FD) 1U

Event: ATP Rotterdam Round of 16 7:30 A.M. CST

ADM came out with a very tough R1 matchup here in Rotterdam against Arthur Fils but his overwhelming consistency and strong baseline game took care of business. In his next match, I&#x27;m expecting a pretty straightforward match here against a player well past his prime in Wawrinka. Not much of a H2H here with ADM winning the only meeting between these two with ease. This matchup took place in 2024 on clay where Stans game actually has been pretty solid but now, indoors, this should suit ADM much nicer. De Minaur has been playing exceptional tennis lately with his only loss in his last 8 appearances coming to Carlos Alcaraz. In the last two years in this event, his losses have came to Alcaraz and Sinner, which tells us he feels pretty comfortable in these conditions unless he is playing top class players, which Wawrinka is not anymore. Give me a straight forward win for the world number 8.

**Switzerland Super League @ 19:30pm GMT**

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** **FC Thun ML** vs Lausanne Sports **+ Over 2.5 Goals (4u)**

**Odds:** \+162

**Write Up:** I&#x27;m back! Bit sweaty on the O&#x27;Sullivan <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> but he cashes us nonetheless. Took a break for a bit - as a Seahawks fan I couldn&#x27;t be happier! Feeling good after the break lets get back to cashing some lays.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Todays pick</mark> goes to the Switzerland Super League, FC Thun (1st) face off against Lausanne (7th), Thun are the home team here with a total record of 7-1-3 (W/D/L) but most recently winning their last 6 home fixtures. On the other hand are Lausanne going 3-4-4, recent away form of 2-2-2. Thun are simply in too good form for Lausanne, only losing 5 of their 23 fixtures and with the home advantage, coming in on a 7 game win streak and Lausanne winless in 3 I think the quality gap will see Thun through for another 3 points. 

For the second leg O2.5 goals we have seen this in the last 7 head-to-head fixtures, Thun have seen this hit in the last SEVEN games. The away team have hit this 3/6 last matchups. Another good substitute for this line would be BTTS as Thun have gone 7/7 and Lausanne have gone 5/6 last fixtures, with 6/7 last head-to-heads. Given both of these lines have a good hit rate, in addition to both of their attacking form being relatively decent (despite Lausanne&#x27;s results) I do see both teams scoring and both of these lines clearing with somewhat ease. I&#x27;m going to go with a 2-1 Thun dub. 

BOL and always bet what you can afford to lose!</td></tr>

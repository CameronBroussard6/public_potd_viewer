<tr><td class='post'>Record: (121-83-11) \[+7.79\]

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>⭐️:🏈Patriots -3 (-118) \[BallyBet\]

Start Time &amp; TV 3:00pm EST (ESPN)

Units: 3.5 Units

Reasoning: For Sundays <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick of the day</mark> well be heading to Foxborough, Massachusetts for this AFC divisional playoff matchup between the 2 seed New England Patriots (15-3) against the 5 seed Houston Texans (13-5). I like going with New England in this one because this Patriots offense is extremely more efficient than this Texans defense. These Patriots rank higher in overall yards per game coming in 3rd in the NFL with 380 yards per contest compared to the Texans coming in 18th place with 325 yards per game, their passing game is more efficient ranking 4th in passing yards per game while the Texans rank 14th, their rushing game is much more effective ranking 6th in the league while the Texans rank 22nd in the NFL with a rushing game that can be stagnant at times and an offense that is 2nd in the league in scoring putting up 29 points per game while the Texans come in 13th place with 23 points per contest. In terms of offensive DVOA these Patriots rank 3rd in the NFL while the Texans rank in 19th place and these Patriots have a yard per play differential of +1.11 while Houstons yard per play differential is only +0.47. This Patriots team is also paired with a very solid defense as this Patriots defense ranks top 10 in most defensive metrics and they rank 9th in the league in passing yards allowed per game, 6th in the league in rushing yards allowed per game and 4th in the league points allowed per game only allowing 18 points per game. CJ Stroud did not do a good job taking care of the ball last game as he turned the ball over three times so I can see this Patriots defense forcing more turnovers out of him in this one and he will be without his top receiving target in this game as Nico Collins is out with a concussion as he leads the team in receptions, receiving yards, yards per catch and receiving touchdowns so I see that effecting their passing game in this one. I see the Patriots moving onto the AFC Championship game with a win here at home in front of their fans.

Prediction: 26-17 Patriots

Last pick:🏈49ers +14/Broncos +7💩I cant even believe this 49ers team beat the Eagles last week with how they played.

Best of luck to everyone tailing and remember to bet responsibly! Lets cap off this weekend with a nice playoff dub!!🍀💜🐉

<tr><td class='post'>Record 5-0 

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Rockets -12 $1.80 **(I Bought down to a push as 13 feels much)**

I hate big lines like this but I feel like this one can be justified, I think .

The last time these teams met the Pelicans actually won in overtime by 5. Here&#x27;s the catch in overtime, the rockets were leading by 25 and just completely choked in the last quarter. And guess who was responsible for it, Herb Jones and a legacy game from Saddiq Bae. This was also during the 5 game win streak at home, when they were on fire. Now though? Not so much.

Rockets on the other hand are a stinky team rn, but that&#x27;s the best part. What else better for a .500 team who also is 13-3 at home to bounce back from. Also this match up is heaven for the rockets, they suck at threes and score mainly within the paint. Pelicans are one of the worse teams to guard the paint as Derrick Queen is a rookie center who isn&#x27;t a 7 footer or rim protector and Missi is also not an amazing protector. Amen, Sengun and KD will absolutely eat this team alive and this team has always shut down Zion Williamson. With no defensive goat aka Herb Jones, I think KD and Sengun will be able to single handley win this game. If you really want to be safe you can wait for Tari Easen to be confirmed if hes in or out as well.</td></tr>

Last pick: Kenneth Walker over 1.5 receptions, cashed in the first half 


Event: Texans at Patriots 


<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Treveyon Henderson over 8.5 carries (-120), 1 unit (always 1 unit) 


Write Up: posted this in the Saturday thread like a moron. 


Most obvious evidence in favor of this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> is that he&#x27;s gone over this total in 10 of the last 11 games. Henderson has come on in the 2nd half of the season, and the Patriots are using him more and more. 


I thought about going over on his 32.5 rushing yards total, but the Houston defense is amazing, and especially so in their last 3 games (only 71 yards allowed per game!), so I&#x27;m taking the attempts route. It&#x27;s also supposed to be snowing all day in Boston tomorrow, and I think that makes for more rushing attempts but lower rushing averages. I may end up regretting it, but attempts seems more likely to hit. 


New England ranks #6 in the league in rushing attempts per game with 29. Houston ranks #2 with 23 rushing attempts allowed or game. Part of that is winning a lot of games, which means the other team spends a lot of the game passing to keep up or in NE&#x27;s case, they&#x27;re winning and therefore run a lot. Even if they meet in the middle with 25 attempts, I think Henderson can easily get 9 of those. 


Between the weather making more rushes likely and TH going over this number 10/11 games, I think it&#x27;s a safe bet he&#x27;ll clear. He&#x27;s averaged 13 rushes per game the last 11, and I just don&#x27;t see New England falling behind enough to abandon the running game (I think they win). Other than somehow getting blown out, I think TH gets his normal carries or even more from the snowy weather. 


Treveyon Henderson over 8.5 rushes.


Edit for whomever does the tracker. Firstly, thank you! Also, this and all my picks are 1 unit. </td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: (2 <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> parlay) Bryce Cotton 3+ 3PM 
&amp; Zylan Cheatham 9+ Rebounds @ 2.41

It&#x27;s going to be the Perth Hoopfest Bryce Cotton show at the RAAC Arena once again, but this time the fivetime MVP doesn&#x27;t have to put a dagger in the Wild Cats fan side (his former team) doing it for Adelaide against Perth, because this time he can do it against Southeast Melbourne, which is much more enjoyable for them to watch. Now Bryce Cotton has put up 25 plus points against Southeast Melbourne at RAC Arena in the last 10 games, and if he&#x27;s going to do it, he&#x27;s going to do it from the three-point line. So I’m backing him with good odds at 3 plus threes for the match. Now, Southeast Melbourne live and die by the threepoint shot. They have taken over 130 more three point attempts and have actually made 45 more three pointers than anyone else in the league. That&#x27;s huge. But they come up against Adelaide who have the best opposition three point percentage in the league and also have
the best three point shooting percentage in the league. So it&#x27;s why Adelaide have beaten them twice this season. They&#x27;ll shut down their three point shooting which opens up the door for another prop in Zylan Cheatham. He&#x27;s had 13 and 15 rebounds in the two games that he&#x27;s played against Adelaide. He basically just sits underneath the rim and watches them miss their three point shots and cleans up the scraps. So 9 plus rebounds for Cheatum, which is his daily effort these days and shouldn’t be a sweat.

Last Pick: Sebastian Korda -4.5 games vs Michael Zheng (-125, 1 unit): TBD

Tennis | Australian Open (M) | 9:50 PM EST (estimated)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Stan Wawrinka vs Laslo Djere | **Djere ML at -102 (FD). 1 unit.**

Write-up: Korda and Zheng are set to take the court in 5-6 hours, but I already have a new <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> for tomorrow, so I&#x27;ll update my record when that one finishes.

There&#x27;s no doubt that Stan Wawrinka will attract a big crowd at this year&#x27;s Australian Open. The 40-year-old 3-time Slam champion recently announced that this will be his last year and tour, and he was granted a well-deserved main draw wildcard as a result. Wawrinka started the year well at the United Cup, as he was able to play multiple strong players quite close, but the best-of-5 slam format is a different beast. Different players decline in different ways as their careers wear on - some retain much of their endurance, but start to drop off in terms of agility and explosiveness, whereas some can still come close to their old level for a set or two but then drop off quickly after. To me, Wawrinka falls into the latter category. His last couple years on tour have been mixed, but one constant has been faltering as matches go to three sets and beyond. Since the start of 2024, Wawrinka has only managed a combined 7-21 record in matches that went the distance, several at the Challenger level. He has also gone just 2-6 in the best-of-five format in that span; both of those wins were more than a year ago, and they came against a nearly retired Andy Murray and an inexperienced Charles Broom. While Stan deserves respect as a former champion here in Melbourne, he has also lost in the first round in four consecutive cracks at this event (2025, 2024, 2023, 2021). 

Of course, it would only be fair to note that Djere has a 1-8 record in AO main draws, but he does have some more recent wins under his belt (Heide in 2025 qualies, Bergs in 2023 MD). Djere had a somewhat disappointing 2025 that was partly the result of injury disruptions, but he got this campaign to a solid start in Hong Kong, beating Ymer and Nava in qualifying. Sure, he proceeded to get smacked around by a resurgent Giron, but I thought his short price (+120) was a sign that the market has some newfound confidence in him. Djere&#x27;s slightly enlongated groundstrokes are most effective on clay, but he his strong serve and flat backhand give him a decent floor on hard courts. He also won the most recent meeting between these two players in Belgrade 2024, at a time when Stan was making waves on indoor hard. The market has already pushed him down from a +114 opening priced in this match, and I believe it is for good reason. Djere&#x27;s form is nothing incredible, and nobody expects him to make a deep run here, but he has the game, and more importantly the legs, to beat a 40-year-old in a grueling best-of-5 match.</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>**POTD Record: 2-4**

**My Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:**

**Liga MX | Tigres vs. Toluca**

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Toluca -1 Goals (-130) (pending result)

—---------------------------------------------------------------

**Liga Portugal | FC Porto vs. Vitória Guimarães**

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** FC Porto -1 Handicap (-122)

Porto’s defensive consistency has been unreal — just **4 goals conceded in 17 league matches** tells you everything you need to know about how disciplined and structured this side is. They control games, limit chances, and rarely allow opponents to build momentum.

They’ve also been nearly flawless in terms of results. Porto has **only tied once all season**. That result feels more like an outlier than a trend, especially with Porto’s current form and control in matches.

Vitória is a solid side, but this is still a massive step up in class. Porto’s ability to dictate tempo, apply sustained pressure, and stay defensively sound makes the **-1 handicap at -122** a strong number.

If Porto gets ahead, they’re built to see it through — and often add another.

Backing the quality, the structure, and the consistency here.

Back home after missing todays games. Tough loss with Gainwell. Almost did receptions instead but we bounce back.

Rolling with one of my favourite picks Caleb rushing. Cleared in 3/4 and the Rams have allowed 20+ to multiple mobile QBs this year. I expect a close game with a lean to Chicago trailing and opening it up for Caleb.

**NFL - LA Rams @ Chicago Bears, 6:30 PM ET, NBC**

***Colby Parkinson o19.5 Rec Yds (-114) 1.25u***

The divisional round finishes up this Sunday with an enticing match up full of **prop-tions** - as much of a Kyren Williams Stan as I am, for me Matt Stafford’s security blanket is the easy choice

Easy and upfront: **Colby has covered this 8 games in a row &amp; 9 of his last 10, averaging 3.7 targets per game, and 27.6 yards on 2.8 receptions**. Matt Stafford has always relied on having a 4th option for safety reasons dating back to his Lions days, and in the recent development of the Rams offense, Park has been a piece of that puzzle: **A consistent enough 9.4% target rate - but he’s a very solidly targeted 19.0% in the red zone** - rates that shouldn’t deviate despite the return of Davante Adams.

Bears pass D? **25th in the league**. Bears against TEs? **They gave up the 8th most receptions &amp; 14th most yards** - not exactly awful, but a combination that seems drawn up perfectly for the Parkinson’s short to mid cut routes.

Depending on how far back you wanna reference, Parkinson has recent “success” against the Bears: Week 4 last season, **4 receptions on 7 targets for 33 yards**. Pretty much all we need. We’ll take a copy/paste game plan for this one. 

Last play review:

Buffalo Bills +3.5 (-167) 2u ✅

(What, a, game - I guess the reality is everything I predicted for this game came to fruition: if Buffalo was going to lose this game, it was going to come down to Josh Allen protecting the ball, the running game being effective, and despite both being good enough for us to cover, they weren’t good enough to win it all. Huge graduation game for Denver, and win number 20 for me!)

And we&#x27;re right back to an ATGS play <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> as we back Aston Villa&#x27;s main striker Ollie Watkins to find the back of the net at home as they host Everton. Villa Park has become a fortress this season, and Villa have won their last 8 home matches, scoring 18 goals in those matches, averaging over 2 goals per game. I expect Villa to take care of business again here <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. 

But that&#x27;s not our play, we&#x27;re backing Watkins to find the back of the net. Watkins has been in great form, and while he failed to score in their last match (away at Palace), he has scored 4 goals in his last 4 EPL matches including 2 at Chelsea and 1 at Arsenal, both very tough defenses. If you step back to last season, Watkins scored 3 goals vs Everton - 2 at home and 1 away. 

To sum it up, I&#x27;m backing a striker in form, who has a great track record scoring vs Everton, on a team that plays incredibly well at home. BOL and happy Sunday!</td></tr>

I&#x27;m expecting a playoff style game like they did last time they played this season (2-1 for Tampa). Both starting goalies will be the same as that game with Jake Oettinger and Andrei Vasilevskiy.  They don&#x27;t play often but their last 4 games against each other went under 6 goals.

Tampa Bay are finishing a long road trip with their last 3 games ending under 6 goals.

**Event:** LaLiga, Real Sociedad v Barcelona, 3:00 pm EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Real Sociedad +1.0 Asian Handicap, -108, 3 units

**Write Up:** We&#x27;re not done until I say we&#x27;re done. I really believe <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> is going to be the day my Barcelona fade strikes gold. Real Sociedad have really picked up their form, remaining **unbeaten in the last three LaLiga games** (including a draw against a strong Atletico Madrid side) and they&#x27;ll be looking to cause another upset at home against Barcelona. The recent *H2H really doesn&#x27;t look too promising with 4 losses in the last 5,* but they did record a 1-0 win in late 2024, while the losses were pretty bearable for the most part. **Barcelona didn&#x27;t look too good against a second division side** in the cup a couple of days earlier and they&#x27;re going to be feeling the effects of that game <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> - in fact, they&#x27;re probably still a bit **fatigued from the Super Cup madness** and this all aids our case. I feel this match should stay fairly close with both sides finding the back of the net (here&#x27;s your BTTS angle) and the Asian Handicap of +1.0 gives us some cushion in case Barcelona turn up. I feel a fine game coming from **Mikel Oyarzabal** in attack, as the Spain international has already registered **five goals and three assists** this season. Sociedad at home is always going to be a tough nut to crack so I&#x27;m feeling confident about this one and I want to end the week on a high - staking three whole units.

AEK vs Panathinaikos, over 2.5 goals @ 2.02

The Athens derby between AEK and Panathinaikos promises a fast, aggressive contest with goals expected. AEK typically push the tempo at home, creating plenty of chances, while Panathinaikos have the attacking depth to respond and exploit spaces on the break. Derbies bring intensity, mistakes, and set-piece opportunities, all of which favor scoring. With both teams needing points and rarely settling for caution, over 2.5 goals offers strong value here.</td></tr>

Aston Villa are still on a run at home having won 11 in a row at Villa Park. With City and Arsenal having dropped points this is a huge game for them which they will want to capitalize. Away from home Everton are not too bad (4-2-4) and they have only lost just 1 in their last 5 road games.

Even with all of this they will still be heading into this clash with a 3 game winless streak having even been kicked out of the FA Cup prior to this. In the H2H Villa are even 7-2-1 and at home Villa have won 4 in a row.

Villa have showed that they can get back on track fast, having won their home game immediately after that Arsenal defeat. An 11 game home W streak combined with a 4 game home H2H streak might be too much for Everton <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Atlético ML + Barcelona ML @2.00 (4u) 

**Write-Up:**

Atlético Madrid have been extremely solid at home this season. They’ve won all league games at the Metropolitano except the opener, where they drew against Elche. That’s 8 wins and 1 draw in 9 home league matches. Alavés, on the other hand, struggle badly away from home: in 9 away games, they’ve managed just 1 win, 1 draw, and 7 losses. Atlético’s home dominance combined with Alavés’ poor away form makes this a very favorable matchup for Atlético.

Barcelona have been absolutely demolishing teams this season. They are in amazing form, having won their last 10 matches in all competitions. They currently sit 1st in La Liga with a record of 16 wins, 1 draw, and 2 losses, with all dropped points coming away from home. Real Sociedad are having a disappointing season, sitting 13th, and their recent form reflects that: 1W 2D 2L in their last 5 league games. Their home record is particularly weak, with just 3 wins, 2 draws, and 4 losses, placing them among the poorest home sides in the league this season.

BOLOGNA VS FIORENTINA

Date: 18 JANUARY 2026 at 15:00

BET ON: Both teams to score- Yes

Odd: 1.78



\- Both Bologna and Fiorentina enter this clash with clear attacking intentions but exposed defensive structures that make Both Teams to Score a very logical bet. Bologna’s coach Vincenzo Italiano has repeatedly spoken about his side needing to regain attacking momentum after a difficult run — they’ve shown signs of rediscovering their aggressive pressing and vertical play, but defensive lapses remain a concern, especially with Lucumí still out and rotation needed to manage fitness. Italian commentators note that Bologna’s lines are pushed high and that the team “has been playing with a short attacking blanket”, meaning they can be vulnerable on the break when possession is lost.

\- On the Fiorentina side, Paolo Vanoli has been vocal in Italian media about needing courage and collective effort to change their fortunes, emphasising that his players must be fearless (“bisogna tirar fuori il coltello”) and attacking even under pressure, which suggests a willingness to commit numbers forward rather than sit back. His recent comments also underline a psychological rebuild in the squad — trying to shake off fear and improve in both offensive and defensive phases.

\- Additionally, Vanoli will be suspended and not on the touchline, adding an unusual dynamic that often leads to less rigid in-game defensive organisation from Fiorentina in favour of attacking risk-taking, especially backed by a large contingent of travelling fans eager for goals.

\- Historically this fixture has produced goals (e.g., a memorable 2-2 draw with late Fiorentina equaliser), and with both coaches openly talking about attacking improvements while defensive issues linger, BTTS is strongly supported by tactical intent, motivation and Italian press commentary.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Francisco Comesana 🇦🇷 -2.5 games handicap vs Patrick Kypson 🇺🇸 5 units to win 4.2U @1.83 (Bet365)

Write-up: With the first grand slam of the season upon us I feel like it’s only right that I go back to my roots.

These odds would make sense to me if Kypson had come through qualifying and therefore adapted to the conditions here in Australia. However, he’s a wildcard and has had the same amount as preparation as Comesana (No. 68). The American is a decent challenger player (No. 116) with very little experience on the pro tour. He had a great end to 2025 going 20-3 and winning two titles. These are challenger events though (despite facing up against decent opposition just isn’t the same as ATP events) and were indoors. The courts this year, just like most years, are moderately fast but you can’t really compare indoors with outdoors too much. Kypson has the basics pretty nailed with a solid all around game but just misses that killer shot to bring him to the top 100. On the ATP tour, he played just one match last year losing to Landaluce in Cincinnati. He has played little BO5 action as well so physically I feel like it’ll be tough for him considering that grand slams are a different beast, playing just two and losing comfortably in both in the first round. Even including qualifying his GS record is just 2-6 on hard courts. Patrick is also 1-2 this year, losing to Nava and Mmoh in qualies of 250 events so it’s not like he’s been bringing his good fantastic form into the new year onto a stage that is closer to the pro tour. 

Meanwhile Comesana is a regular on the tour, having played a pretty full ATP schedule barring two challengers so has a clear experience advantage in a sport where it’s so necessary in terms of conditioning and tactically. Similarly to Kypson he prefers playing on clay with a strong baseline game but with a higher ceiling with his better movement, defence and most importantly experience should mean he takes care of business here. He may only be 5”10 but his serve is sneakily quite good (level with Kypson imo) and is generally just more consistent than his opponent of the day. Obviously not a world beater but a player who has room for improvement and a match-up that I would consider to be favourable to him as he loves dragging out rallies and Patrick isn’t a player who will overpower him to force errors, I expect it to be the other way around as the match goes on as the Argentine’s heavy topspin should weigh on the American’s flatter strokes in the long-term as they’re both more neutral players in their gamestyles. This year he’s opened with a loss to young star Shang, followed by a win over Royer (No. 57) and a competitive loss to Shelton (No. 8) so pretty promising for the play in my opinion. Francisco was “only” 7-10 on hard courts on the tour but picked up some decent wins over the likes of Munar, Opelka, Michelsen, Goffin. The big advantage apart from simply being a stronger player though is clearly his exposure to BO5 tennis, having played nine of these matches. On hard courts Comesana is 3-3 picking up big wins over Humbert (No. 17) and Michelsen (No. 28). His three losses were against Fritz (logical), a brutal 5-setter against Altmaier (No. 101) and a really close match against Norrie (No. 35) at the US open last year. 

Even if Kypson starts well I believe that his 
lack of top competition action will cost him especially with Comesana’s ability to make things physical so I strongly trust in him to cover the spread. My prediction is 3-1 to the Argentine. BOL !</td></tr>

__Event:__ NFL: Rams @ Bears 6:30pm EST

__POTD:__ Luther Burden o37.5 receiving yards (-110), 5u to win 4.55u - __MAX BET__

__Write Up:__ The Rams (13-5) &amp; the Bears (12-6) take the field in the final Divisional Round playoff game on Sunday night in what will be an electric frigid environment in the Windy City. Both the Rams and Bears are here due to closing out games with a late touchdown and then hanging on for the win. The Rams beat the Panthers 34-31, after QB Matthew Stafford threw a TD with 38 seconds left. 5 of the last 7 Rams games have been 1 score games. The Bears also had a comeback after trailing 21-3 at the half &amp; 21-6 going into the 4th qtr. Chicago scored 25 in the 4th with Caleb Williams throwing a 25 yd TD with 1:43 left, ending in a 31-27 over Green Bay. Their 18 point comeback is the largest in playoff franchise history. They have 7 wins when trailing with under 2 mins left in the 4th, most in NFL history. They avg a league high 3.46 points per drive in the 4th this season, compared to 1.96 points per drive in the first 3 qtrs (19th). This season, Williams is averaging 7.5 yards per pass (9th) with 11 TD’s &amp; 2 INT’s in the 4th, ranking 8th in the 4th qtr rating (96.2) &amp; 14th in success rate (42.3%). In the first 3 qtrs Williams is 29th in rating (84.8) &amp; 25th in yards per pass (6.7) with 17 TD’s &amp; 7 INT’s. The Bears rank #1 in 4th qtr points (9.6) averaging 17 in their last 3 games (1st), the next highest team in their last 3 is Houston with 12.7. But the Rams also have done well in the 4th in their last 3, ranking 3rd in points (11.7). The Rams are #1 in the NFL in ppg (30.7). The Bears are 9th at 26.2 ppg. Both rank top 3 in plays per game, averaging 64+. This game features 2 of the most explosive teams in the NFL. The Bears (14.4) &amp; Rams (14.0) are 1st &amp; 2nd in plays per game that gain 10+ yards. The Rams are 2nd in plays gaining 20+ yards (4.8), &amp; the Bears are 4th (4.4). The Bears &amp; Rams both have outstanding offenses. Chicago was 6th in EPA/play (0.07), 9th in EPA/pass (0.08), 4th in EPA/rush (0.06), 9th in success rate (45.24%), &amp; 9th in yards/play (5.7). The Rams were 2nd in EPA/play (0.12), 3rd in EPA/pass (0.22), 11th in EPA/rush (-0.01), 1st in success rate (50.46%), &amp; 1st in yards/play (6.2). However their defenses have been much to be desired. Chicago is 30th in DEF success rate (54.3%). They lead the NFL in takeaway rate per drive (17.2%), but they allow 2.69 points per drive (27th). In the Rams last 7 games, they’ve allowed 2.35 points/drive (23rd), a TD on 28% of possessions (25th), &amp; 5.9 yards/play (30th). Before that, they allowed 1.52 points/drive (3rd), a TD on 14.9% of drives (2nd), &amp; 4.8 yards/play (6th). Thru Week 11 the Rams ranked #1 in scoring defense. Since then they’re 27th, allowing 30+ points in 4 of their last 7. The total for this game opened at 50.5. But dropped down to 48.5 due to the weather. The forecast is predicting 18 degree weather &amp; 20 mph winds. But both of these QB’s have actually done well in cold weather. In Stafford&#x27;s 6 career games in freezing conditions he&#x27;s avg 253 yards with 15 TD’s &amp; just 3 INT’s. Last year in playoffs he played in a snowstorm vs an elite Eagles d &amp; threw for 324 yards &amp; 2 TD’s. As for Williams his QBR climbs to 103.7 in temps below 21 degrees. He has played in 3 games since week 15 in cold weather. In Week 15 it was 9 degrees, facing the #1 pass d in the NFL with a -0.088 EPA per drop back allowed, the Browns, who allowed just 165 passing yards per game (1st). He threw for 242 yards, 2 TD’s, avg 14.23 yards per completion, his 2nd most this year &amp; the 2nd most passing yards the Browns allowed. He then went on to throw for 250 yards 2 TD’s in Week 16 &amp; 361 yards 2 TD’s in playoffs vs the Packers in cold games. GB was the 7th best pass d before that game allowing 185 ypg. I’m not concerned about weather, this will be a shootout. 

In his 1st playoff game, Williams threw for 361 yards &amp; 2 TD’s. Williams has thrown multiple TD’s in 6 straight games. Now he gets a Rams d that allows opponents to pass on 59.68% plays, 8th most. Since Dec the Rams have allowed 9.4 yards/target (27th) &amp; 51 open targets (27th) to WR’s. They just gave up 215 yards to McMillan &amp; Coker. Coker is the slot WR. Rams captain Quentin Lake, a hybrid Safety/CB, came back from an elbow injury last game after being out since Week 11. Lake covers the slot, on 92% of snaps. He got TORCHED by Coker. He had 9 rec, 134 yards &amp; a TD with a catch of 52 yards. The Rams d allows the 3rd most targets to the slot. Luther Burden ran 51% of his routes from the slot last week &amp; had 3 rec for 42 yards on 7 targets. He has 3+ rec in 9 straight games. Last week Williams targeted the slot 16 times for 176 yards &amp; 2 TD’s. Burden has been elite this year avg 2.7 yards per route run, 3rd in NFL. He avg 7.1 yards after catch per rec, 3rd. __Burden has 40+ rec yards in 4 of his last 5, avg 6.6 targets with a 29% target rate &amp; a 23% 1st read rate. He’s averaged nearly 60 receiving ypg since Week 10.__ He has a rec of 25+ yards in 4 of his last 5, including a 40 &amp; 35 yard catch. Burden has been even better vs zone specifically. __The Rams run zone 79.8% of their plays, 3rd most. Burden is the Bears zone beater &amp; the #s are insane:__

On 54 routes vs man -&gt; 2.48 yards per route run (15th), 0.22 targets per rote run (46th), total epa 8.71 (85th), Carch rate 75% (10th), 11.32% target share (87th), 9 receptions (69th), 134 receiving yards (61st), 71 Yards After Catch (23rd), 0 TD’s

On 177 routes vs zone -&gt; 2.89 YPRR (4th), 0.27 TPRR (7th), Total EPA 32.14 (45th), 80.43% Catch Rate (7th), 37 receptions (35th), 511 receiving yards (33rd), 252 YAC (15th), 2 TD’s

__His #s vs zone compared to the other Bears WR’s:__

__Burden:__ 37 rec, 511 yards, 80.43% catch rate, 252 yards after catch, 0.26 targets per route run, 2.89 yards per route run - on just 177 routes!

__DJ Moore:__ 35 rec, 487 yards, 58.33% catch rate!!!, 165 yards after catch, 0.15 targets per route run, 1.20 yards per route run - on 407 routes!

Moore &amp; Odunze have catch rates below 59%, OUTSIDE TOP 100 IN NFL. Plus both are injured &amp; wont be at full speed. TE Loveland is the only pass catcher with more targets, but Rams allow 2nd least yards/target to TE’s. 

The entire world will know Luther Burden’s name after Sunday night.

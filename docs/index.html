While he couldnt hit this against South Africa, they are way better than Canada &amp; the Candanian bowlers shouldnt pose a challenge for him.

<tr><td class='post'>**POTD Record:**  111 – 74 - 12

**Previous:**  Man City -1 vs Fulham + Bayern ML vs Leipzig – WINNING!

**New Event:**  Olympic Hockey – Germany vs France + UCL - Benfica vs Real Madrid

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:**  Germany -1.5 + Benfica vs Real Madrid Over 3.5 Cards @ 2.27 (3 units)

Multi sport, crossing boundaries and a plus money 2 leg parlay at that.

**Leg 1:  Winter Olympic Ice Hockey Playoffs – Germany -1.5 Puck line (Includes OT) vs France**

Discussions among Ice Hockey fans abound that Germany has underperformed so far on the ice.  After all they do have an elite top-talent loaded squad with NHL players.  Some speculate that the Germans knew that to qualify in 1^(st) place of their group they had to beat the US team.  Something that was simply not in the cards.  From a strategic viewpoint, saving themselves for these playoffs and later rounds may have been the smart play, assuming this is what they planned.  Germany made it through losing 2 matches but with only a -3 goal differential.

Now the Germans are in the playoffs where they face the worst team from Group A, France.  The French lost all 3 of their opening round games by 8, 4 and 3 goals ending up with a -15 goal differential.  There is no reason the Germans do not pounce on this opportunity and take advantage of a weak disorganized French team that has shown very little promise thus far.  After all these are Germans were talking about.  I’m married to one so I know…no mercy.  Germany should win by more than 1 goal.

**Leg 2:  Champions League – Benfica vs Real Madrid Over 3.5 Total Cards**

If anyone is unaware of what transpired on Jan 26 when these teams met in Lisbon, Portugal in the final match of the group stage, please do yourself a favor and go watch the highlights.  For context alone, Benfica’s coach Mourinho used to be the head coach of Real Madrid many moons ago, and was ousted in 2013 after a poor season.  He savored and relished the recent victory against his former club which suffered humiliation losing to a Benfica that was ill equipped to accomplish such a feat.  At least that is what everyone thought.  Mourinho proved once again he can somehow rearrange the chess pieces to pull off the incredible upset, which he did by winning 4-2 in a most dramatic fashion.  A match that had 38 shots, 18 shots on target, 26 fouls, 8 yellow cards and 2 red cards.  A match that saw the goalkeeper score a last second header to send Benfica into the final spot of the playoffs.  Well enough of that match. (Seriously, watch the highlights)

Less than a month later, fate has chosen these 2 teams to play once again in Lisbon, Portugal, for the knockout stage of the Champions League.  This time Real Madrid should be prepared.  They have the better squad, talent, money, and of course the pressure to win.  However, Real Madrid will also be down 2 starters in Rodrygo and Asencio due to their red cards in the previous match.  They will also be missing Belligham and Militao due to injury.  Also, another loss to Mourinho would almost certainly see some heads roll by management.  There are even rumors going around that Mourinho may return to Real Madrid.

Benfica on the other hand have not much to lose as they were not expected to be in this position in the first place were it not for their miracle performance last month.  But they do have a mastermind in Mourinho and rest assured Benfica will not go down at home in front of their fans with their arms crossed.  I expect fireworks in this match and if last month&#x27;s game was any indication, this one should be testy and could get nasty. 

I don’t think over 3.5 cards is too much to ask here.</td></tr>

The <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> revolves around Galatasaray being a home underdog receiving a struggling Juventus side in arguably the harshest environment not only in the UCL; but in the whole continent. Juve have struggled when playing away from home in both Serie A and UCL, winning only one of their L5 matchups away from Turin. To be fair, the wins versus solid teams while playing away have been nonexistent since probably Bodo in november? The point is I consider Gala offensively skilled and I wouldn&#x27;t even be surprised if they won outright.

Game: Winter Olympics Hockey- Sweden vs Latvia (2 PM CST)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Zemgus Girgensons over 0.5 pts +150 (BetRivers)

Note: Don&#x27;t use DK or FD. Their odds for the Olympics are terrible.

Girgensons has been a pleasant surprise so far. He&#x27;s sitting at 4 points in 3 games, and he has points against USA, Germany, and Denmark (all ranked in top 9 in the world). Girgensons plays on the top line of both EV and PP, and he routinely plays 20+ minutes as a forward, which is usually only reserved for top players.

Sweden&#x27;s defense is beatable, allowing two goals to a weak Italian team and 9 goals overall in the 3 group stage matches. Latvia&#x27;s team total is set at 1.5, and if Latvia scores twice, it&#x27;d be hard to imagine Girgensons not being involved. I&#x27;m willing to roll the dice at +150.</td></tr>

&gt;Sweden remain at the top of the standings as the only unbeaten team. Their opponent on Tuesday is Canada who now sit in fifth place after a close win over Japan. Sweden has been dominant so far and considering Canada&#x27;s struggles, this line feels like a gift. Hasselborg and Knochenhauer have been the best skip and second, respectively, and I can easily see them outplaying Homan and Miskew. Wilkes has also been awful in the lead position for Canada which has certainly not helped their cause. Sweden came into this event with a 9-7 record this season against elite level teams so they are certainly capable of winning this when they are also the hotter team.</td></tr>

Benfica vs Real Madrid, Over 3.5 goals @ 2.52

At 2.52, I really like the value on over 3.5 goals here. Benfica at home don’t change their style, they attack, press high, and create chances in numbers. Against a team like Real Madrid, that usually leads to an open game. Madrid are deadly when there’s space and can easily score two or three themselves. If this turns into a back-and-forth battle, four goals is very live at this price.</td></tr>

The two sides played this exact matchup in November in a game with 5 cards in total. In the French league, Monaco average the highest yellow cards for a team as they get around 2.30 on average. Monaco managed to cover in 5/8 CL games, PSG in 4/8, good referee for this game here as he is averaging just a bit over 4 cards per game this season. Given the fact that Monaco host this important CL playoff game, I&#x27;m expecting to get at least 4 cards again here as they often trouble PSG at home.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Italy vs Switzerland 6:00 am EST (Olympics/Men&#x27;s Hockey)

Under 6.5 goals (+100)

My first <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> to start this 4 win streak for the Olympics was under 6.5 for Canada vs Switzerland and I had 0 upvotes. Well now i&#x27;m going back with Switzerland with the best odds for under between the four matches tomorrow because this one feels again to me like a low scoring game. Yesterday I was looking at this line and it went from +125 to +100. They&#x27;re starting to understand that this isn&#x27;t the group stage anymore. It&#x27;s win or go home so the amount of goals scored doesn&#x27;t matter. Italy got destroyed by Finland because Finland could get that bye spot by scoring a lot of goals and also because Finland had a **full NHL lineup**. They&#x27;re now facing Switzerland who like I said in another <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> have nine NHL players and the rest are Swiss league level. Do I expect Italy to win? Nope. But I expect it to be a closer game than a beatdown. Italy will have the crowd advantage as host and it&#x27;s now do or die. They&#x27;ll give a good effort and Switzerland knows this. The captain for Switzerland said this
&quot;You&#x27;ve got to win that game before you can think about anything else,&quot; Josi said. &quot;And I think you saw Italy, they played great against Sweden, played really good against Slovakia. There were tight games.&quot;

I&#x27;ve watched the Switzerland games and they tend to play to the level of their opponent. They use their 3 NHL defensemen to create rebounds for the forwards to capitalize and that amounts to a lot of shots from the forwards but with only few NHL forwards (5) on their team the shots are usually not that dangerous. It usually works against European players led team but against team with NHL players who can quickly go from defense to offense like team Canada or Czechia it&#x27;s difficult to keep the defensive assignments especially with their Swiss-level players. Well, as we know Italy has the worst roster in these Olympics by far and I think they won&#x27;t be able to generate much offense even if they get some scoring chances. They might get 1-2 goal but I expect the 3 Switzerland&#x27;s NHL defensemen to get the puck out of the net and their goalie to make the saves (Leonardo Genoni is a Swiss goalie legend because he excels in these kind of games).

I take the model between Switzerland vs France, who are slitghtly better than Italy, as one of the scenarios that could happen tomorrow. France had 27 shots but got shutout while the Swiss NHL players made the difference to win the game 4-0. Italy tomorrow should generate something like 20 shots as the host so something similar to France. The second scenario is the game becomes like Italy vs Slovakia and the Italians make it close by ending the game 3-2 (Slovakia had 7 NHL players on the team as a comparison to Switzerland).

Switzerland went under the 6.5 goals line in 2 of their 3 games in these Olympics with the last one almost also going under but didn&#x27;t happen because of a last minute Czechia comeback. Meanwhile Italy only hit it once but the two other games were against Sweden and Finland who like I said had both full NHL lineups and had way more firepower than what Italy will face tomorrow against the Swiss. I just don&#x27;t see this game become a massacre for Switzerland when it&#x27;s now a win or go home situation and every mistake could be costly.

**Write up:** Going to Kembla for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today’s pick</mark> with EASIEST CHOICE. Resumed this prep with a pretty soft 2.5 length win over 1300 meters and steps up to the 1400 <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. After scratching’s we come into barrier 5 and there’s not a single ounce of speed in this race bar us, so we will be finding the front extremely easily. This is one of the main reasons I’m so keen, as we will have complete dominance over the speed of the race, and can make it extremely hard for anything else to make up ground on us.     
      
We sat 2nd last start and ran great closing splits from up on the speed, so I don’t envision the extra 100m being anything besides a positive. We’ve got Jay Ford on top, and he’s fairly good for a country race, so there’s no worries in that department.      
       
In terms of dangers I don’t really see anything that worries me. TSAREVICH was a monster win last start, coming from seemingly 20 lengths behind and monstering them late, however I’ve seen the sectionals and I really think he went right past horses who were paddling, so less impressive than it visually suggested.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** **Cardiff ML** v AFC Wimbledon **+ Lincoln City ML** v Northampton **(5u)**

**Odds:** \+110

**Write Up:** A bit sweaty on the first leg but they come through with two second half goals, Coventry vs Middlesbrough ended 3-1 thanks to a hattrick from Haji Wright. I am updating my net units based on my picks (over 2.5 instead of 1.5) which was +221 instead of the +127 odds posted, the lower gained 5.09 units and the higher line was 8.84 units. Both good cashes for any that tailed, lets get onto todays picks.

Cardiff (1st) are host to Wimbledon (15th), the home team boast an impressive record of 10-1-1 at home this season, unbeaten in 11 league games home and away,  averaging \~2.4 goals at their home ground. In comparison Wimbledon have an away record of 5-3-4 scoring an average of \~1.5 goals per game. Cardiff won the reverse fixture earlier in the year 1-0 and with home advantage, a higher scoring rate and better form I don&#x27;t see Wimbledon being able to keep them from putting a few past them. Keeping it simple with the better team winning at their home ground.

Lincoln (2nd) are unbeaten in 14 league games, owning a home record of 9-2-1. Northampton (17th) are 2-4-6 in away games, although unbeaten in 3 they are fixtures against weaker opponents and the two away games in that ended in draws to Exeter (14th) and Barnsley (16th). Lincoln are in the promotion race which should give them plenty of motivation to perform at home, with Northampton struggling away and struggling to score consistently I see the team with a stronger form, lineup and home advantage taking all 3 points from a poor travelling, bottom-end team.

Short writeup <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, not overthinking it much as the two much stronger teams with good home records should both be looking for 3 points against these matchups.

Appreciate anyone who tailed yesterday, managed to cash all of the lines I had chosen, even whacked them all in a parlay for a nice cash out of +15 units!

Honestly, they really should&#x27;ve scored a couple more, judging by the fact Barca&#x27;s keeper even won man of the match. I&#x27;ll keep riding this wave in the most daring way possible - by going back to the team that had handed me the most Ls to date. Yes, whilst I mostly focused on the &quot;Barca curse&quot;, one team has been consistently killing my picks one after the other, whilst somehow staying relatively under the radar. I&#x27;m talking about Real Madrid. No matter what, whether I backed or faded them, they&#x27;d always find a way to break my heart come the end of the game. But after surviving this Barcelona madness, I think the next logical step is to come for Real Madrid. Character progression and all that.* ***This is it, the final boss battle, if you will. Let&#x27;s get to it!***

**Last Five:** ✅✅❌✅✅

**Event:** Champions League, Benfica v Real Madrid, 3:00 pm EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Benfica +0.5 Asian Handicap, -103, 5 units

**Write Up:** I don&#x27;t think I need to explain myself too much here. Real Madrid just haven&#x27;t impressed me enough to back them in a big Champions League game like this one. The **previous meeting between these two sides saw Benfica beat Madrid** in a spectacular fashion after a stunning headed goal from their goalkeeper (yes, you read that right) helped them beat the Spanish giants 4-2 and secure a spot in the play-offs. Benfica thus proved they can absolutely compete against elite teams, and truthfully, 4-2 might have even flattered the guests a bit.

Real Madrid have since managed to find some consistency, but Benfica certainly have more than enough quality to at least snatch a draw here. Keep in mind, this is the **first leg of a knockout tie, and neither team is going to come out swinging,** especially not Madrid. They&#x27;re going to be more than happy to **settle for a draw** here and hunt for a win at the Bernabeu, depending on how the on-field balance looks. As a reminder, we&#x27;re talking about a team that celebrated a narrow first leg defeat to Manchester City, as they anticipated a comeback at their home ground (which they, in fact made happen).

However, I&#x27;ve not even come to my favorite part about this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, which is the **Real Madrid absences.** In case you forgot, the guests collected two red cards in their last match (ironically, against Benfica), meaning **Raul Asencio and Rodrygo** are out of the picture for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>&#x27;s clash. And if these aren&#x27;t some crucial absences, **Jude Bellingham** is also set to miss the match due to a hamstring injury, while **Eder Militao** still doesn&#x27;t look ready. And for that final blow, **Kylian Mbappe is still recovering** and is possibly not going to feature for the whole 90 minutes. That&#x27;s a crazy amount of key first team players missing, and whilst *Benfica are missing Alexander Bah and Fredrik Aursnes* themselves, they just aren&#x27;t on the same level of importance as the aforementioned players.

Unlike the league phase clash, goals aren&#x27;t going to rain in this one, so Under 2.5 goals is a good angle if you want to boost the odds further (or go more conservatively with a 3.5). This is essentially a Benfica double chance, but once again, the odds are tastier if I head over to the AH section of my book (-103 v -111). Another max unit play here because the confidence is absolutely sky high and I just think these odds are too good in this context. BOL and let&#x27;s enjoy this European classic and maybe a cheeky hattrick from the Benfica keeper ☘️🫡</td></tr>

Big respect to Cilic for holding his own out there at 37 after years of injury problems.

He’s had a pretty good start to the season, losing in R16 of Hong Kong to Borges, R3 of AO to Ruud having beaten Shapovalov in straights and last week lost to Fritz in the semis of Dallas having defeated Tien in round 1. Nakashima started the season on fire by reaching the finals of Brisbane and beating the likes of Davidovich Fokina in straight sets before falling to Medvedev 2-0. He then suffered an upset to VDZ in Melbourne in four tight sets to put a dent into his strong start to 2026 and last week lost to Fritz in R16 of Dallas.

So both players have had decent season openers but it’s the conditions that are going to heavily favour Nakashima in this match. Unlike Dallas which is one of the fastest tournaments, Delray plays fairly slow so Cilic’s big serve becomes less of a weapon. More neutral balls is going to force more errors from Marin who will be forced to attack to try and end points early. This is going to play exactly into Brandon’s gamestyle who has great rally tolerance and depth to keep rhythm going. Considering Nakashima’s strong serve and Cilic’s relatively poor returning I’m not optimistic on the Croatian’s chances at creating many opportunities on return but on the other side if Cilic’s first serve dips even slightly I expect him to get punished by the American’s depth. Nakashima plays very tactical tennis (his play style is stylistically very similar to Djokovic who Marin struggled against greatly) and if he can be on the front foot with a good return and force backhand-cross exchanges this could be a quick win for him. Not only does Nakashima’s patient game match well against Cilic’s error-proness on these courts but there’s also going to be questions of the Croatian’s fitness. At 37 playing 5 matches in 7 days is going to take its toll and I can see this being a UE fest once the match goes on. I would have fairer odds at around 1.50. Cilic did beat Nakashima in November 24’ on the way to winning Hangzhou but the courts there are also amongst the fastest on tour so I’m not worried by it. BOL !</td></tr>

### ⚽ <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Tigre -1.5 Asian Handicap @ 1.72 (-139) - 2 Units

**Kids watch the Champions League, real men watch the Copa Argentina.** 🇦🇷⚽

* **The Hierarchy Gap:** Tigre is currently one of the most aesthetic and well-drilled teams in the Argentine Primera División. Their ball movement and offensive patterns are top-tier. 
* **Top Flight vs. 3rd Division:** They are facing an opponent from the third tier. Even if the underdog is in a &quot;good moment&quot; in their league, the physical intensity, speed of play, and individual quality of a Primera side are usually too much to handle for 90 minutes. Third division in argentina is almost amateur.

We need a 2-goal margin win to clear the -1.5 line.

**Games: Australian A League -  Sydney FC VS Auckland FC - 3:00 am EST**

**---**

**Sydney FC played Auckland away 10 days ago and got 7 corners while losing 1-0, now they get a rematch at home and I expect them to be up for it performance wise.**

Sydney have played 6 home games this season and covered this line in **5/6** with an average of **5.83 corners per game. With the one miss ending on 4 corners.**

Sydney have lost 4 of their last 5 games yet a win will have them second and just above Auckland. I expect heavy field tilt from Sydney while Auckland punch on the counter, Auckland are better defensively but should find themselves having to deal with more dead balls than they&#x27;d like.

**Football | Champions League | 20:45 UTC+3**

**Match:** Galatasaray vs Juventus

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Galatasaray Over 0.5 Goals

**Write Up:** Juventus have played 4 away matches in the Champions League this season, and apart from the 0-0 draw against Monaco, they conceded at least 1 goal in every single one of them. Galatasaray, on the other hand, managed to score at least 1 goal in 3 out of their 4 home games.

Galatasaray usually have big problems on the road in Europe, but at home they’re different. Especially with the crowd behind them pushing them to score and win. The fans will be roaring again tonight, no doubt, and I’m confident they’ll get at least one goal on the board.</td></tr>

Ireland v Zimbabwe 

Zimbabwe win @ 1.66

Starts in about 11 Hours ⏳

Units: 5

https://www.buymeacoffee.com/JaySial

Reasoning:

Zimbabwe beat Australia in their last match. Biggest upset of this World Cup.

High in confidence and to make sure they qualify to next stage Zimbabwe will deliver this win.

They are batting very sensibly. Muzarabani’s bowling and Sikandar Raza’s all round performance can cause problems for Irish team.</td></tr>

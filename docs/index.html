	•	Cowboys -3
	•	Lions Moneyline

Record: 1–0
Units: +3.85

Dallas at -3 continues to offer value by staying below the key number of -3.5 and aligning with clear matchup advantages. The Cowboys benefit from continuity under center, while Washington’s QB situation is compromised — Marcus Mariota and Jayden Daniels are both out, pushing veteran Josh Johnson into the starting role. Johnson has historically struggled to sustain drives and isn’t built for consistent down-to-down execution, weakening Washington’s offensive rhythm and opening the door for Dallas to control pace and cover the number.  ￼

Detroit on the moneyline pairs well by leaning on offensive effectiveness and quarterback stability rather than spread margin. Even with recent dips, Detroit’s offense has been one of the most productive in the league, generating well over 5,000 total yards on the season and scoring near the top tier in points per game, powered by an efficient passing attack and balanced run game.  ￼ With J.J. McCarthy out for Minnesota (following a hand fracture) and backups in at quarterback, Detroit’s more experienced unit — led by Jared Goff — should hold a clear edge in execution and consistency.  ￼

Together, this parlay blends quantitative value (line plus offensive production) with situational factors (injury-induced QB instability), forming a reasoned, upside-oriented two-leg play.</td></tr>

*Write Up:*
 
Seems like the general feeling is that the Thunder will bounce back strongly at home, as they are big favorites to win this rematch. 

In order to make this safer than the current Spurs +9.5 line, we are adding in Castle +15 points. 

In his 8 games back so far from injury (Spurs 7-1 record), he&#x27;s only scored under 17 points once, which was 15 in their loss to the Knicks.

He&#x27;s also only scored over 20 points 3 times in that span, with 2 against the Thunder.

In addition, he&#x27;s averaged 6.4 Free Throw attempts in these 8 games as well.</td></tr>

NFL🏈 . Cowboys at Commanders, 1 pm ET 12/25/25

Record: 8-9
Net Units: -3.97 Units

Explanation: Forget home field advantage. The Cowboys can easily cover -6.5 because Dallas is still one of the too efficient and performance offenses in the league. Washington is expected to start Josh Johnson with Jayden Daniels on IR and Marcus Mariota out, so i expect a lot of miscommunication plays and punts, giving the Dallas defense a lot of help (which they need) . So , I see no reason why cowboys don’t just slowly slip away with this game down the stretch. If not, then you just gotta tip your cap to Washington, they’re all professionals, anyone can beat anybody in the league.</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>**POTD Record:** 5-13-3 *Absolute scenes in the Burkina Faso game! Winless against Equatorial Guinea, 1/13 in AFCON openers, and trailing in the 95th minute in a match where even just a draw would&#x27;ve won us the bet. But of course, the football gods had another idea, letting Burkina Faso score not once, but twice in quick succession to win the game in the process. As I always say though, if I go out, might as well go out in style and oh boy did we lose that bet in an absolutely ridiculous fashion. Can&#x27;t say I saw that coming, one of those fair enough moments for sure. Crazy how the same scenario happened twice in the space of a week to me (El-Gaish were up 1-0 to a team they haven&#x27;t lost to in the last 10 H2H meetups, and proceeded to lose it through goals in the 89th and the 92nd minute). We move though, here&#x27;s hoping Santa listened when I asked for better luck on my picks*

**Last Five:** 🅿️❌❌❌❌

**Event:** Vietnam U19 Championship, Công An Hà Nội U19 v PVF U19, starts in 4 hours 54 minutes

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Công An Hà Nội U19 Win or Draw +115, 1.5 units

**Write Up:** Yesterday&#x27;s madness might&#x27;ve done something, because why am I betting on the Vietnamese youth team championship? Well, because I&#x27;ve found a cheeky value play, that&#x27;s precisely why. From my pov, Công An Hà Nội appears to be a seriously underrated team that&#x27;s just now finding its feet, having won 3 out of the 4 matches at the start of the new season, after a ropey last season that saw them leak goals like no tomorrow. They&#x27;ve now **scored 13** and conceded just 6 goals **in 4 matches** (a **massive improvement** from last season). Their opponents, PVF boast a **similar record,** with a slightly better goal difference, but, inversely, they looked much more convincing last season. This gives them inflated odds for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>&#x27;s match, hence the fade. The Công An Hà Nội U19 squad is known for its **dynamic playing style,** characterized by quick passing, line breakage, tactical awareness, and conditioning, being able to effectively **counter-press** the moment they&#x27;re dispossessed, which is something **their opponents occasionally struggle with.** This commitment to player development has led to the emergence of several talented individuals who have gone on to represent the national team and succeed in professional leagues. I feel like covering both the win and the draw at + odds is a goldmine and one I&#x27;m absolutely willing to explore in <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>&#x27;s dry ahh calendar. The only thing that makes me slightly wary is the H2H (Công An Hà Nội U19 are winless in the last 4 outings), but I&#x27;ve learned my lesson and will stop paying this much attention to old statistical data, and instead focus on the expected value of the play (sweet plus odds for covering two outcomes of two pretty evenly matched teams on paper). After being hit hard in the AFCON madness and since I&#x27;m just slightly less familiar with the intricacies of the Vietnamese footballing pyramid, I&#x27;m going with 1.5 units. Merry Christmas and BOL y&#x27;all, whether you decide to tail or fade I just hope everyone has fun at the end of the day. Going to bed and I just know I&#x27;m waking up to a sweet notif ☘️</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **Anthony Davis over 23.5 Points at $1.86**

To lazy for numbers .

Alright so why are we going with Anthony Davis? The truth is Anthony Davis is being heavily slept on currently he has has had injuries which has prevented him from playing full minutes or trying to understand how the team functions. Truthfully we have seen how this team will and can force swaps and mis matches CONSTANTLY, for example in the Pelicans game the whole game plan was for AD to bully Derrick Queen on every single play. Also Draymon Green is whining that hes sick and tired of having to play Center and that he wants a true center.

Also I like that his minutes are pretty high in his last 5 games now being 36, 35, 34, 37, 33 which is a pretty good indication he will have minutes granted no foul trouble or injuries. As a Laker if not injured he&#x27;s consistently hitting this line if not injured.

I wouldnt take this above this line, anyway if you want to see more of my picks I also post on the NBA daily picks thread as well and currently am 8-0 since starting.</td></tr>

There is risk of a blowout here, but otherwise this feels a little too easy. Harvey has cleared this in 4 of his last 5 and he cleared this in his last game against the Chiefs.

While this game is meaningless for the Chiefs, it is a big deal for Denver and Harvey has been on the field 60% or more of the time in their last 3 games. Outside of week 15, he’s getting almost 3-4 catches a game, which should help him eclipse that number.

Merry Christmas to everyone, wishing a blessed day full of blessings. What better way to celebrate Christmas than to have some NBA action on this special day. Antman immediately stands out to me in this somewhat of a rival matchup and especially on this day. This’ll be his 2nd Christmas Day game in his career scoring 26 in his first one against the Mavs last year and im expecting a motivated Edwards here.

And here’s what Ant said himself: “

_It’s gonna be a night,” Edwards told Shams Charania of ESPN. “I’m gonna have 30 (points), for sure. I might have 40. But it’s gonna be a night.”_

I mean hard not to back Ant with this statement right? 

I’m definitely sold on Ant chucking in this one, with only 20+ FGA, Edwards is over in 10/14 games with five 40-point performances in that span. 

Despite only going over in 2/L5 reg season games against the Nuggets (two hooks on 29), the volume has been top tier having 22+ FGA in all those games.

Backing this Ant narrative play and im hoping he’s efficient, confident he’ll get his shots up just about making them.

Would play this up to 31.5.</td></tr>

It’s not every day you bet on a near double digit underdog to cover the spread, but this line feels disrespectful and not supported by form. The Spurs are at full strength, with Wemby having ramped his minutes up, and have multiple guys playing very well recently (Castle, Vassell, Keldon, Kornet etc.) and I won’t be surprised to see Fox and Wemby go berserk on this nationally broadcast game. The Spurs have literally beaten OKC straight-up twice in the past 11 days, and have won 9 of their last 10 games. OKC are the best team in the league and favorites for the title for a reason, but this line requires nearly everything to go perfectly for OKC and I think this young, energized Spurs team will bring it against OKC. Even if OKC win I think the game stays close.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** **Cowboys -2.5** and **Lions -2.5** **(-139) 5U**

Two games against two eliminated teams starting two terrible back-up quarterbacks.

Leg 1: Tale of two sucky defenses which would have made for a surefire shootout if either Jayden Daniels or Mariota were playing. Instead the commanders, injured beyond the pale, are forced to go with their third string veteran bench warmer QB Josh Johnson who, until last week, threw a sum total of 3 receptions since 2021. When he came in for the injured Mariota against the Eagles, he went 5/9 for 43 yards and an INT earning him a QBR of 5 (no like that’s an actual score a QB can get). It’s the Cowboys, so he may get in a decent drive or two – but given that Dallas is likely to put up 30+ against one of the worst defenses in the league save the Bengals, -2.5 should not be an issue.  

Leg 2: A must win for the Lions after a devasting loss where they had two game-winning TD’s overturned by OPI in the final 20 secs. They are now on the brink of missing the playoffs and need to win out. They come in banged up (Amon St. Brown nursing a knee injury, o-line and secondary bleeding) but still have Goff and Gibbs in an indoor stadium. What seals this game for me is Max Brosmer under center. Brosmer has been awful in the limited action he’s seen – avg 3.3, 5.8, 4.2 yards/attempt in garbage time. The only game he started was against Seattle where he threw 4 interceptions, was sacked 4 times, and earned a pathetic QBR of 5 (no like that’s an actual score a QB can get) on way to a 0-26 blowout loss (first shutout for Seattle since 2010 and first time Vikings failed to score in a game since 2007). So yea, He’s epochally bad. There is simply no way he is keeping up with a Lions team desperate to make the playoffs.

Javonte is averaging 15.9 rushing attempts a game with 76.5 averaging rushing yards, for an average of around 4.8 YPC, with the Commanders defense allowing that exact YPC

Commanders have been awful, one of if not the worst rush defenses as of lately. Np wonder they are ranked 29th. Saquon rushed for 132 last week. Tyrone Tracy Jr for 70 two weeks ago. Aaron Jones for 76, held RJ Harvey to 35 but got destroyed by Achane and Gibbs the weeks prior. In the past 6 weeks, the RB1s average 95.8 rushing yards against the commies.

Cowboys are heavily favored to win this despite being on the road against a divisional opponent and having a bad defense Their line sits at a whopping -8.5, Vegas clearly expects a spanking here. Mariota is out putting in third stringer Josh Johnson who&#x27;s passing line sits at 178.5 despite going against such a mediocre defense.

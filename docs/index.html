He had 28 last time they played.The magic have found their footing offensively as of late with an up paced tempo that complements the heats top 5 pace this season resulting in a lot possessions and a lot of scoring. This would be easy money if not for Powell dealing with an ankle injury if he plays the full game this should be an easy cash.

Game is played in Rams Park. For those that don&#x27;t know, Turkish football is probably the most home ground heavy favorites because of the sheer madness the fan environment is. Add to this, that Samsunspor has never even tied vs Galatasaray when playing in Istanbul. (L3 matches being 3-2, 4-2, 3-1, all in favor of Galatasaray) 

Galatasaray is riding the hot hand at home with only one loss since may. We will be taking the Asian Handicap to protect ourselves in case they only win by one.

**Write up**:  Was tempted to go with Mainz under a new head coach at home, but decided against it. 

My model loves Schalke <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, projecting a 48-51% win probability.

Schalke is flying right now - 1st place and boasting the league&#x27;s best defense (only 8 goals conceded). 

Düsseldorf is the complete opposite: 14th place, the worst home team in the league, and the weakest offense. It’s a nightmare matchup for them. Getting 2.25 on the league leaders against a relegation candidate feels like a gift. My adjusted numbers see an edge here. Backing the best defense against the worst offense at plus money is a no-brainer. Düsseldorf&#x27;s tendency to dominate in possession when playing at home is a perfect match for Schalke&#x27;s style under Miron Muslic. Solid defence and quick counterattacks! 

But, it could easily be a goalless draw, so under 2.5 Goals might also be solid value @ 1.93 odds.

Besiktas is going nicely on both fronts. Coach Alimipijevic, the new head coach of the Serbian national team, is back. They have some really good players on their roster, nice offense, and average 91.4 points in the Eurocup. I like the big win for this one.</td></tr>

**🏀 Jamal Murray o23.5 Points -110** vs the Atlanta Hawks

This line feels disrespectful for two reasons:

1. Murray is coming off a 52 point game vs the Pacers
2. Most of the Nuggets weapons are still injured.

Murray has cashed in L4/5 and though Cam Johnson is back, that hasn&#x27;t diminished his opportunities. He&#x27;s averaging 34-36+ minutes with plenty of usage alongside Jokic.

Hawks are weak against PGs. They rank 27th in Points Allowed to PGs and even CJ McCollum torched them for 46 points (though that was a bizarre game).

Both teams ranked middle of the NBA in pace yet the books still have the over/under very high at 238.5. Expecting scoring and Murray to lead the charge.

Write up: Easy win last time. Expecting another sixes fest here.
Worth noting that the venue i.e Sharjah Stadium is one of the shortest grounds in cricketing venues. The usual pattern in Sharjah pitches is that it&#x27;s batting paradise for the first few matches and then it becomes extremely slow and difficult to bat on later. 

A total of 30+ sixes were hit in the first match held here. Abu Dhabi have Russell, Hales, Narine, Rutherford and others that are known for powerful strokes and can clear ropes. Meanwhile Desert Vipers got Fakhar, Hetmyer and Sam Curran. 

Shorter sides, powerful batsmen and early in the tournament - these factors made me go for total sixes for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>

Last pick: Josh Giddey “U” 21.5 Points (-105)❌
Played: HardRock | Bet: 1U


<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the day</mark> : Pascal Siakam OVER 30.5 points + rebounds (-125)

Reason • 
Siakam has been an absolute wagon for us this season and were going back to him here, let me break this down👇

Siakam has been the clear #1 option for the Pacers this season with a lot of their players being injured he has stepped up big for them, This season Siakam is averaging 31 PR a game on 11.7 rebound chances per game and 18.2 FGA per game, compared to last season where he averaged just 25.9 PR a game on 11.7 rebound chances per game and just 14.7 FGA per game.

Scoring matchup breakdown👇

Siakam gets an amazing matchup versus the Bulls who allow the most PPG to PFs(26.70). Siakam sees a combined 47% of his points from Transition, Free Throws and spot up where the Bulls rank (18th, 20th and 20th), this is gonna be great for Siakam as the Bulls are a bad defense against all of Siakam’s scoring types so I expect him to see high shot volume here.

When playing teams that rank 15th or worse against transition Siakam is over this line in 5/7 games avergaing 33.1 PR per game.

When looking at scoring zones Siakam gets a great matchup as well, Siakam gets a majority 31% of his points from the RA, a zone the Bulls allow the most PPG against, and the Bulls run a small ball lineup with their tallest player being vucevic who is just 6’9, which is gonna lead to Siakam being in the interior a lot which is gonna lead to great rebounding volume.

SIakam also gets a great matchup when looking at shot types, as he gets 46% of his shots from &lt;10 feet where the Bulls allow the most PPG against.

Rebounding matchup

The main reason I am leaning towards PR here is because this is a great matchup for Siakam against the Bulls who have been getting killed on the boards this season allowing the 10th most rebounds per game to PFs(10.23) and the 6th most total rebounds per game.

In Siakam’s last matchup versus the Bulls he recorded 9 rebounds on 14 rebound chances in that game.

When seeing just 12+ rebound chances Siakam is over this line in 9/14 games avergaing 35.8 PR a game.

The Bulls struggle against forward’s/centers who are big and fast.

Recent performances versus the Bulls 👇

Michael Porter Jr. 43 (Line: 32.5)✅
Miles Bridges: 30 (Line: 27.5)✅
Alex Sarr: 27 (Line: 25.5)✅
Kel’el Ware: 34 (Line: 21.4)✅
Lauri Markanen: 54 (Line: 33.5)✅
Evan Mobley: 32 (Line: 29.5)✅
Giannis Antetokounmpo: 56 (Line: 43.5)✅
KAT: 35 (Line: 33.5)✅
Wemby: 50 (Line: 38.5)✅

When seeing matchups like this, versus teams bottom 10 against transition and bottom 10 in rebounds allowed Siakam has cleared this line with ease going over in 5/6 games avergaing 34 PR a game with.

Siakam saw great usage in his last game versus the Bulls going for 24 points on 23 FGA and he saw 9 rebounds on 14 chances in that game.

When seeing just 15+ FGA on 11+ rebound chances Siakam is over this line 9/11 games avergaing 35.5 PR a game.

Siakam’s numbers go up when you look at him when playing just 32 minutes clearing this line in 11/15 games when seeing 32+ minutes averaging 33.5 PR a game, and I expect 35+ minutes here in a game that should be competitive favoring the Bulls by +5 so I’m expecting this to be a close game, as in their last matchup the Pacer’s won by 2 on a Siakam game winner.</td></tr>

LA Lakers @ Boston Celtics | 7:00PM EST / GMT -5 (18.5 hours from time of comment)

**Derrick White OVER 22.5 Points + Assists**

￼Write Up: Derrick White has scored an average of 22.2 PPG over his last 5, and put up his first 30 point game Thursday vs the Wizards. He paired that with 9 assists. He’s averaged 5.4 APG over the last 5 games and is definitely feeling himself right now. 

The Lakers are allowing 32.1 assists to opponents over the past 3 games, *worst* in the NBA over that stretch. They gave up 39 assists yesterday to the Raptors.

It is the second night of a back-to-back for Boston, but yesterday’s game saw the Celtics leading by 30 going into the 4th so White got the 4th quarter off to sit and rest up. I expect him to easily eclipse this mark and am putting 2 units on it!

Last Pick: Detroit Lions -3 (-105) 5 units vs Dallas Cowboys

Last Pick Reflections: Cowboys offense came to play and as expected, one of Lamb or Pickens was going to get neutralized by Campbell. It helped that Lamb went down with an injury, but fluornoy stepped up really well in his absence and nearly took over the game. Why I don&#x27;t trust the Cowboys is because of their defense, and they got absolutely gashed on short throws and Goff had his way even though his final statline doesn&#x27;t indicate how dominant of a performance this was from Detroit. Glad to have gotten the win and keep the streak going!

Event: North Texas vs Tulane NCAAF

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Tulane Moneyline (+115) 5 units

UNT (North Texas) has a VERY explosive offense (points per game (46.8) and yards per game (512)) so I&#x27;m expecting a lot of points here tomorrow. They have a wide arsenal of weapons that makes their pass game look almost effortless at times. Tulane, however, is a proven battle-tested team and while they have not looked as good at UNT down the stretch, I see this as another classic case of overvaluing of a team that seems to be clicking at the right time, but in my perspective of watching UNT play, they feast on bad teams. They trot down the field against bad teams. They make football look easy against bad teams. Where Tulane has the advantage here based on watching their film is a highly-physical defensive line, and if they can generate pressure on Drew Mestemaker and neutralize the likes of Caleb Hawkins and Wyatt Young, then I think Tulane has the potential and talent to win this game. Their main gripe, however, is their inconsistent play so if you want to reduce your unit size, that&#x27;s understandable. If Tulane can capitalize on their opportunities, I expect this to be a grind-out victory for them. This game should have a playoff-like atmosphere and I love backing home CFB teams in this spot. 

Just to reiterate, in conjunction with my model, I use the eye test as well as my gut feeling to play what I believe is the most-valuable <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> on the slate.

-everything is bet to win unit amount-

Write up:

In a game that’s projected to already be tightly contested (2.5 spread) the over makes a ton of sense here! Both teams inside  the top 25 in Kenpom adjusted tempo and love to push the pace! They both average above 37% from downtown which both rank inside the top 60 nationally and on top of that, quinnipac is allowing almost 34% from downtown. Iona has only allowed 16% from downtown but I do believe negative regression will seep in soon. They allow almost 25 attempts from downtown per game good for 255th nationally and their schedule has been against teams who don’t usually shoot well form downtown but that will change here! 

Both teams also rank below 330th nationally in opponent field goals attempted per game! Meaning they allow a shit ton due to their pace 

On top of this iona is 6-2 to the over and quinnipac is 4-3 to the over

The line has moved to 163.5 after opening at 161.5 but I like it still. Over makes sense. Let’s get back on track

Start Time &amp; TV: 8:00pm EST (FOX)

Units: 3.5 Units

Reasoning: To kick off championship weekend well be going with the Boise State Broncos against the UNLV rebels in the Mountain West championship game. Boise State and UNLV have faced off earlier in the year and the Broncos trounced the Rebels 56-31 and the Broncos just could not be stopped on offense in that game. Runningback Dylan Riley had his best game of the year against this Rebels defense, running for over 200 rushing yards and averaging over 13 yards per rush attempt, he looked like former Broncos runningback Ashton Jeanty against this Rebels defense and I think he will have another great game against them in this conference title. The Broncos will also be getting their star quarterback Maddux Madsen back who missed that past few games due to injury and when he faced off against UNLV earlier this year he had an amazing performance throwing for 4 touchdowns and averaging 11 yards per pass attempt. These two teams are very different on the defensive side of the ball, the Broncos have a top 10 pass defense in the nation only allowing 167 passing yards per game while the Rebels are ranked 113th in pass defense allowing just about 250 passing yards per contest. Boise State also has the defensive edge in rushing yards per contest and points allowed per game. Boise State also has home field advantage in this one as the Mountain West title game isnt played on a neutral field so I see that as another huge advantage in this one. I expect Boise State to win by more than field goal again against the Rebels and take the Mountain West title for the second straight year.

Prediction: 34-27 Broncos

Last pick:🏀Indiana -2.5/LSU -1.5💩Indiana has no business being in the top 25 after that performance.

Best of luck to everyone tailing and remember to bet responsibly! Happy championship weekend everyone lets have ourselves a great weekend!!🍀🍀

Write Up:  
 

Iona’s offense finally found rhythm the last couple games better shot selection, guards pushing pace, and they’re actually hitting their open threes instead of just pretending they might. Plus, defensively, they’re way more physical than Quinnipiac is ready for.

And honestly, Iona only needs to win by a couple buckets. With the way they’re attacking the paint and controlling tempo lately, that’s not a big ask. Quinnipiac can hang for stretches, sure, but they don’t have the consistent scoring to punch back for a full 40.</td></tr>

Last Pick: Parks vs Dodin - Dodin Handicap +4 Games @ 1.93 ✅️

It was amazing how Dodin was able to keep this match close, with Parks producing 26 aces. The underdog was still able to hold a decent percentage on both first and second serve and she took this one to 3 sets. Great play here, especially against the number 1 seed in the tournament.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** **Parks vs Korpatsch - Parks ML @ 1.63**

Alycia Parks, currently ranked 71st in the world, is the number 1 seed in this tournament and needs to defend her title points, since she also won in Angers last season. She&#x27;s one of the tallest players on tour, which gives her a big advantage on this surface (Indoor Hard), with the ability to get free points on her first serve much more frequently than most of her opponents. She produced 26 aces in the last round, which might be a good indicator that she can use her best weapon once more to increase her chances of winning the tournament. Her game does have some problems, especially when playing outdoors, as she moves a bit slowly compared to the tour average, and she hits really flat. With this, she ends up making a lot of unforced errors when outdoor conditions nullify her serve power, but the same can&#x27;t be said here in Angers, where she feels much more comfortable.

Korpatsch is a veteran of the circuit now at 30, always seen as an average player with a decent rally tolerance and baseline game, but a weak serve, which has prevented her from standing out from the rest of the WTA tour. Last year, she was defeated specifically by Parks in this tournament in straight sets.

With this, Parks knows that most of her ranking points need to come from Indoor tournaments, and defending this title should be a major priority. With her powerful serve, she should be to simplify each point and win the match. Keep in mind that in order to win this tournament in the previous year, Parks had to defeat Belinda Bencic in the final, the current number 11 in the world.

Good luck!</td></tr>

Net Units: +23.76  

Last Pick Thoughts: When I saw the score was 0-0 at half, I got a little nervous. I find it difficult to bet / predict on both Tottenham and Newcastle games. However, they both can score and that thought pulled through.  

Sport: English Premier League - Chelsea vs. Leeds @ 3:15pm EST  

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Chelsea win + Over 1 goal = +110  

Write Up: I usually like taking the other side when one team (Chelsea) has a much busier and more competitive schedule than the other (Leeds). However, Chelsea seems to be “sharpening their tools,” lately and really finding their confidence and form. It appears to me that Neto and Estevao are really coming into their own in Chelsea uniforms, Enzo is incredible, Palmer is back (apparently). My only hope is that they don’t take their foot off the gas now that they’re against an easier opponent. A draw a man down to Arsenal is a huge result, now they have the opportunity to make a big early step in the title fight. I am concerned about the number of games they’ve played recently and Caicedo being suspended for this game. No team in the prem is a cakewalk (other than Wolves), but Chelsea, for being such a young team, already has quite a bit of experience under their belts competing for the top and they also have little “pressure” from the media to be winning the league, I think that benefits them. Maresca is also a fantastic manager at balancing workload and getting results.

Don’t bet more than you’re willing to lose. 5-1 is a great start, I suspect there will be an averaging out at some point.

<tr><td class='post'>**POTD Record:**  98 – 63 - 10

**Previous:**  Newcastle Draw-no-bet &amp; Manchester City Draw-no-bet – WIN / DRAW

**Recap:**  Crazy nailbiters for a Tuesday.  City was up by 3 in the first half but Fulham fought back and the match ended in a City win 5-4.  Meanwhile Newcastle were up 2-1 until the 95^(th) minute when a bicycle kick goal, nonetheless, got Tottenham the draw.  We were that close.

**New Event:**  Premier League – Arsenal vs Brentford &amp; La Liga Athletic Club vs Real Madrid

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:**  Arsenal vs Brentford Both teams to score NO &amp; Real Madrid Draw no Bet  @ 2.15 (Usual 3 units)

**Leg 1:**  Arsenal ML vs Brentford - Both teams to score NO

Arsenal at home have been quite formidable this year winning 9 out of 10 matches across all competitions, scoring 25 while just conceding 2 at the Emirates Stadium to Man City and Tottenham. 

Meanwhile Brentford have lost 5 of their last 6 away matches conceding 12 goals in the process.

Arsenal’s defensive structure is like a fortress few teams have been able to penetrate.  They have allowed only 7 goals this season across all 13 matches played, by far the stingiest defense in the league.

**Leg 2:**  Athletic Club vs Real Madrid – Draw-no-Bet

This game will mark Real Madrid’s 6^(th) consecutive road game.  They have won 1, drawn 3 and had 1 loss to Liverpool in Champions League.  In the 3 La Liga matches, they were dominant controlling possession, having more shots and shots on target, yet ending in draws. 

Real Madrid have players making their returns including Militao and Rudiger in defense which should allow their midfield to push their lines a bit more forward and help Bellingham, Vinicious and Mbappe to get the job done.

Meanwhile, hosts Athletic Club have a bunch of injuries and this has opened the door for the possibility of potentially starting 18-year old Selton Sanchez.

Given this being the final of 6 road games for Real Madrid, and being 2^(nd) in the table, I expect them to step up the caliber of pressure to get the 3 points they need in their hunt to catch league leaders Barcelona.  If Madrid win they will be just 1 point behind them.

Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> - Pending - Chicago Blackhawks Puck Line +1.5 -108 (1.08u to win 1u) 

Wednesday’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> - Utah Mammoth vs Anaheim Ducks total goals o6.5 -115 (1.15u to win 1u)

The Ducks are one of the highest scoring teams in the NHL so far this season and are going up against an Utah team that is in poor form and haven’t had good performances from their goalies. Vejmelka played poorly against the Sharks on Monday, so you may see their backup Vanecek.

On the other hand, the Ducks are onto their 3rd string goalie Ville Husso (maybe could argue 2nd string) as they’re out Dostal and Mrazek. Husso had a pretty good game on Monday against STL but STL missed a bunch of golden opportunities to score (like wide open nets bad).

Good luck!</td></tr>

Total odds 1.52 (1 Unit)

Write Up : 

* Arsenal is heavy favourite  as the table topper and they are hosting Brentford(12). Arsenal won 9 out of 10 home games and they scored 25 in 13 matches, conceded 7. They averaged almost two goals per game. Brentford scored 21 and conceded 20. They are good at home, weaker at away. But they might create some trouble for the hosts. Over 1.5 is my best option here.

*  Leeds is number 18 at point table hosting Chelsea(3) <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Chelsea is unbeaten in their last 7 games in all competition, has the third best attacking record scoring 24 goals. While Leeds has the second worst attacking record scoring 13 goals. Leeds might create some chances, but I think Chelsea will at least manage to draw.

I always try to be at the safe side. But, in sports betting; anything can happen. 

So, Bet responsibly. Good luck.</td></tr>

Arsenal are currently unbeaten in 17 games, but after being unable to trump a 10-man Chelsea on the weekend a home game against Brentford, when the likes of Odegard, Gyoekres, and Jesus return, is a perfect game to remind the league why they&#x27;re in first.

**Arsenal played Tottenham and a previously unbeaten Bayern in their last 2 home games and smashed this line in both, getting 8 shots on target in both games!**

**Arsenal has covered this line in 3 out of their last 5 games, and I see that trend continuing again tomorrow.**

Last Pick: Atletico at Barcelona o2.5 Goals + BTTS (-150) **Kaching!** 

Recap: Perfect game script for us. Hansi Flick’s trademark offside trap gave Atletico a chance to score the first goal of the game. Then shortly after, the two guys I highlighted in my writeup (Pedri/Raphina) managed to connect and respond. It was cookies from there. Another great read. 

Event: Chelsea at Leeds (EPL) u/3:15pm EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Chelsea to Win (-120)

Read: Chelsea have really been getting themselves together as of late. They are coming off a hard fought draw as they hosted the league leaders Arsenal last time out. In a game including a first half red card which they played through, scored, and salvaged a point. Chelsea have only dropped points in two away games all season. One of which they drew 2-2 with Brentford back in September and then the next prem match that followed they lost 2-1 to Man United with a red card five minutes into the match. (I don&#x27;t see them conceding two goals in this spot) Since then, they have won three away games in a row and have not conceded a single goal in any of them. Their defense has stepped up lately. Caicedo will not be available because of suspension. Cole Palmer is in the mix to play and potentially even start which is very positive.

Leeds have conceded 25 goals and have only scored 13 of their own during this season through thirteen total games. At home they have been noticeably better defensively. Only conceding 7 goals in six games. Compared to conceding 18 goals in seven games away from home. This is my only worry in this game besides the Caicedo absence. Leeds are significantly better at home. They are also due unfortunately. Truth be told though Leeds are 2-1-7 in their last ten matches. They sit 18th in the table fighting to get out of the relegation zone. 

Yes. Leeds have shown signs of life at home but, Chelsea is flying and with their form recently they will not be stopped here. Trust the boys in blue. 

BOL.</td></tr>

Event : Germany DFB Pokal 🇩🇪

Union Berlin vs Bayern Munich

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> : Bayern to Win + Total Over 2.5 Goals @1.64 for 3u

Bayern Munich are first in the Bundesliga with 44 league goals and have won 13 of their last 15 games across all competitions, while they scored in 100 percent of their recent matches with an average of 3.27 goals per game, making over 2.5 extremely likely. Union Berlin did hold Bayern to a 2-2 draw just three weeks ago and have been the only team to take points off Bayern in the Bundesliga, but Bayern have both scored and conceded in their last five consecutive matches, meaning goals are guaranteed in both directions. Bayern lost 3-1 to Arsenal in the Champions League last week but bounced back with a 3-1 win over St. Pauli, proving they respond well to defeats. For Bayern, the pokal match is very important game as they would be aiming to win the whole thing. It&#x27;s no surprise Bayern want to lift the cup since it&#x27;s been lot of years since they last lifted it. Bayern&#x27;s main 11 will play <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> against Union, and therefore Bayern should win this with score line of 2-1, 3-1, or 3-0.

ESBJERG VS COPENHAGEN

Date: 03 DECEMBER 2025 at 18:00

BET ON: Over / Under- Over +2.50

Odd: 1.62

DENMARK CUP

\- Esbjerg enter the cup quarter-final with strong momentum and a highly charged home atmosphere, as more than 13,000 tickets have already been sold — a level of local intensity Danish media highlight as a real factor in pushing the team forward. Their recent 3–1 win and consistent goal-scoring at home suggest an attacking approach from the EfB coaching staff, who know that their best chance lies in using the energy of Blue Water Arena to put pressure on FCK. Copenhagen arrive in a more fragile state, with head coach Jacob Neestrup openly admitting that the team has lacked “power and energy” after several poor away performances, yet he recently chose to highlight the side’s offensive strengths and stated that he wants to build on that rather than tighten defensively. The combination of Esbjerg’s motivation and confidence, FCK’s defensive vulnerability, and a coach who publicly prioritises attacking play despite setbacks creates the conditions for an open match with tempo, space, and chances at both ends — strongly supporting a bet on Over 2.5 goals.</td></tr>

Contrary to what the table shows, Wolves are not that bad, as they&#x27;ve generated great chances in all home games they&#x27;ve played. They have underperformed quite a bit with 7 scored in total, while accumulating almost 12 xG total, but at home they do way better. Nottingham have failed to keep clean sheets in almost all PL games. This season in the PL in 13 games Nottingham have 1 clean sheet vs Liverpool, where clearly Liverpool should have scored. At home this season, Wolves hit a btts in 4/6 PL games, failing to score only on Palace and City, while hitting btts vs some decent teams. They also played 3 EFL Cup games at home where they had a 3-4 loss to Chelsea, 2-0 win vs Everton and a 3-2 win over West Ham.</td></tr>

Last Pick: Sonmez vs Jimenez Kasintseva - Sonmez ML @ 1.57 ✅️

This was a classic WTA style match, with both players breaking each other constantly but Sonmez won the 2nd set tiebreak and carried the momentum to finish off with a win.

**Tennis** | **Challenger Angers (Women)** | **12:30 PM (Eastern Time)**

**Plays will always be shared as 1 unit for fair record purposes**

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** **Monnot vs Sonmez - Sonmez to win 2-0 @ 1.81**

Sonmez had a sweaty battle against Kasintseva, an opponent who was able to keep the match close due to her size advantage on this indoor surface in Angers, by saving 8 break points. This was still a quality win for Sonmez, especially after surviving a second-set tiebreak against a taller opponent. 

This time, things should become a lot easier against Monnot, a player who has never been able to break into the top 400, as she will need to beat Sonmez from the baseline, since she only has 1.64 metres, so she shouldn&#x27;t be able to serve at a high level to avoid rallies against a stronger opponent. 

Sonmez was able to reach a career-high top-70 in October, after some strong performances in Beijing and Ningbo. Most recently, she was able to beat Eva Lys, a top-40 player, on this surface (Indoor Hard).

With this, the skill gap should be huge, and I&#x27;m expecting Sonmez to win in straight sets.</td></tr>

**Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Harry Wilson 1+ SOT (+105) ❌️

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s Event:** English Premier League | Arsenal vs. Brentford (11:30AM PST)

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Thiago 1+ SOT (+100) 1 unit to win 1 unit

**Write Up:** All I can say is wow. What a match that was, we were treated to a real spectacle. Bummer that Wilson didn&#x27;t look to shoot much of the game and his teammates didnt <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> out his runs in the box. 9 goals were scored and our guy wound up with one assist and no shots. We move on, sorry we lost, but thankful for a great game. I&#x27;ve mentioned this before, but my plays are intended to boost the enjoyment of watching some great matches. Giving us something to root for. We won&#x27;t hit them all, but we try to hit as many as possible. 

We stay in London <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> where 1st Place Arsenal hosts 11th place Brentford. These mid-week matches are always tricky, as coaches will want to rotate without losing synergy and giving up points. I think Arsenal will be looking towards the weekend where they play at Villa and try to rotate as much as possible. Brentford on the other hand will want to play spoiler as they are not playing in Europe this season and I expect most of their 1st team. 

I was shocked to see this line at even money and wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this moves quickly. Thiago has had a fantastic start to the season, filling the void for Brentford left by the parting of Mbuemo and Wissa. He&#x27;s got 11 goals and is a striker in form. He&#x27;s averaging over 2 SOTs per match, and has only failed a SOT in 3 matches making him 10/13. 

Arsenal has a great defense, but we also bet against it over the weekend with success. I expect Arsenal to rotate their already injured backline even more here. I love this play because Thiago has hit SOTs against the big teams all season, landing 3 SOTs on Liverpool and 1 on Man City. He&#x27;s also hit 3-2-2 SOTs in his last 3 matches. Arsenal should win this match, but I&#x27;ll gladly take Thiago to get 1 SOT at even money!

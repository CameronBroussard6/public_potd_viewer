Last pick: Real Madrid vs Barcelona (BTTS &amp; Over 2.5 &amp; over 1.5 goals in the 2nd half @ 1.75) ❌️

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>: Crystal Palace vs Brentford &amp; Liverpool vs Aston Villa (Brentford to score 1 goal @ 1.36 &amp; BTTS Liverpool vs Aston Villa @ 1.58 = 2.14) 🍀




Another day, another Moist Conflict! Though loss last time, Mbappé failed the penalty, then the goal offside and the endless chances where both teams could&#x27;ve scored on the second half. 





EPL Combo <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Brentford Over 0.5 + Liverpool vs Aston Villa BTTS

Crystal Palace versus Brentford is a matchup that historically screams goals. Looking at the last six meetings between these sides, all six have seen both teams find the net, with the average fixture producing 1.56 goals from Brentford and 1.33 from Palace. This isn&#x27;t by accident, it&#x27;s the nature of how these two play.

What&#x27;s most compelling about Brentford right now is the quality they&#x27;re bringing to every attack. Over the 2024-25 season, the Bees recorded the highest xG-per-shot in the entire Premier League at 0.15, bettering even champions Liverpool who sat at 0.14. They&#x27;ve been clinical, efficient, and prolific throughout the campaign, averaging 1.28 xG per match while taking a sharp 10.67 shots per game. Igor Thiago, Daamsgard and Kevin Schade have formed a genuinely destructive attacking unit that has blown away most defences they&#x27;ve faced. At Selhurst Park, Brentford are conceding goals at a higher rate away from home at 75 percent compared to Crystal Palace&#x27;s 75 percent at home, creating the ideal environment for a goalfest. I&#x27;m backing Brentford to score at least once, they&#x27;ve been too good to ignore in the final third.

Liverpool versus Aston Villa is where the real story unfolds. Liverpool&#x27;s defensive issues are becoming increasingly difficult to ignore, and Villa possess the attacking prowess to exploit them comprehensively. In their last 10 meetings, both sides have scored in nine of those matches, delivering consistent BTTS outcomes. Looking at the broader picture, Liverpool are conceding at an alarming 63 percent rate this season, while the Reds themselves maintain a 97 percent scoring rate across all competitions. Aston Villa, having won four in a row heading into this fixture, have shown they can trouble elite defences. Liverpool&#x27;s home record against Villa specifically shows BTTS landing in 75 percent of matches, with the Reds scoring in every single game at Anfield in their current data set while Villa managed to put the ball past them in 50 percent of away visits. Both teams averaging 1.8 and 1.4 goals respectively over their recent runs means the 3.5 goal line feels realistic. Liverpool will score because they always do at home, but Villa have the tools and form to breach Liverpool&#x27;s backline and make this interesting. Expect both teams to get on the scoresheet.





Let&#x27;s cash it!

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Premier League / Burnley vs Arsenal / Arsenal ML &amp; U 3.5 game goals at 1.90 odds 2U

Burnley is coming from 2 wins in a row against Wolves and Leeds which were huge for their fight against relegation. Arsenal is a different beast though. They have the best defense in the world and even on games where their opponents park the bus like Burnley will most likely do, their set pieces efficiency comes into effect. I expect a professional 0-2 win for Arsenal.</td></tr>

Event: Snooker International Championship @ 930pm est

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Tom Ford to WIN vs Daniel Wells -178 for 2.7u to win 1.51u on FD

Writeup: Okay so I know first things first, these odds aren’t the best but I truly believe Tom Ford enters the match with a statistical edge in both match-level and frame-level performance. His career match-win rate of ~55.7% and frame-win rate over 53% indicate that he is consistently stronger than a break-even player. Meanwhile, Wells hovers just above 50% for both match and frame wins, suggesting Ford has a higher ceiling in head-to-head play. Adding to that, Ford’s strong performance in opening matches (winning ~61.5% of his first-in-tournament matches) gives him a psychological and practical advantage when starting a fresh event like the International Championship.

Furthermore, Ford’s recent dominance over Wells…including two convincing wins in 2025…suggests he understands how to exploit Wells’s game under pressure. If Ford brings the same tactical discipline and capitalizes on early frames, he’s well-positioned to control the match rhythm and come out on top. 

As always, BOL and stick to the unit system, snooker can be a silly sport but Tom Ford is a solid veteran that I think can pull through in this match. Let’s get back on a little win streak!</td></tr>

🧠 Write Up

When you follow Portuguese football long enough, you notice one thing: “quiet” fixtures rarely stay quiet for long.
Casa Pia and Estrela Amadora are two of those mid-table sides that defend like they want to attack again as soon as possible.

Casa Pia’s last five games tell the story — they’ve allowed 1.0 xG or more in four of them and still created chances of their own even against Braga and Famalicão. They don’t park the bus; they press, they open spaces, and when they fall behind, the game turns chaotic fast.

Estrela are just as wild. They can look compact one week and then explode into a shoot-out the next (see their 2.6 xG home blitz against AVS). They give up big looks on the road — over 2 xG conceded away to Gil Vicente — and they’ll probably try to trade punches again here.

Add both together and you get two teams who live around the 2.5–3.0 expected-goal range most weeks. Neither has the back line to kill tempo, and both have forwards who shoot on sight.

The market still prices this like a slow, low-scoring grind. It isn’t. Anything north of 2.30 for Over 2.5 is real value — and at 2.37, it’s a bet I’m happy to take.

**Summary:** Qarabag&#x27;s opponent missed a penalty first half which was lucky, but other then that we were cruising in this parlay with Hatayspor picking up a red card after 16 minutes. 2-0 &amp; 0-3, GG&#x27;s to everyone tailing!

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** ***Marseille to win(1.70) + Benfica to win(1.42) @ 2.02 -- 3 units***

**Write up:**

Two late games on this Saturday. Let&#x27;s hope it&#x27;s worth the wait.

**Auxerre v Marseille**

**Auxerre is 17th with only 7 points in 9 games**. Their points came from games against mid-table teams or **relegation sides**: **FC Lorient (16th), Toulouse (9th) &amp; Rennes (10th).** I must admit that Auxerre have had a pretty tough schedule so far with fixtures against teams like PSG, Lens, PSG, Nice &amp; Monaco. But they&#x27;ve also lost all of these matches and haven&#x27;t managed to upset against any of these teams. **Marseille is 3rd** in the league and is coming off losses against Lens last weekend &amp; Sporting midweek. Overall they are having a good season and with **Greenwood on top of the league in goal contributions** they are looking as far the better team here and 1.70 is way too high of an odd here in my opinion.

**Vitoria Guimaraes v Benfica**

**Vitoria Guimaraes** is normally sitting in European spots in the Portugese top flight. How different is that this season with **only 11 points after 9 games**. With **3rd-place Benfica visiting** them <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> I think they need to look at next weekend to see if they can get some more points there. Benfica is supplying **topscorer Pavlidis** with enough chances to score **8 so far** in the campaign. With 5 of those being after the last International Break he is looking on fire. Benfica is just the better team here, have the better squad and want to win here to keep up with Sporting and Porto.

**Best of luck if tailing!** 🍀

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: BTTS + Over 2.5 goals @ 1.80 - 3 Units


Previous game this season between the two ended 3-2. Brommapojkarna have hit this line in 18/23 games this season, averaging around 4.2 total goals per match. Vaxjo are a great matchup with 15/23 games for them hitting this line, also averaging a pretty good amount at 3.7 total per game. Both teams are very evenly matched with leaky defence and historically, this matchup has produced plenty goals with their last 4/5 meetings hitting this line.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Bayern Munich ML and O2.5 Goals + Arsenal ML (-119)


Write Up: Bayern Munich is unstoppable right now with 10 straight wins all clearing the o2.5 goal line and sitting top of the bundesliga table facing off against 5th in the table Leverkusen who&#x27;ve had a pretty decent campaign so far however they&#x27;ve lost 7-2 against psg and their defense is atrocious. Bayern will simply be too much for them here. On to the 2nd leg 1st placed Arsenal face bottom of the table Burnley and this is a game where Arsenal simply cannot afford to drop points if they want to stand any chance of winning the league so therefore I expect Arsenal to be motivated enough here to not drop any points and keep their lead at the top of the table.</td></tr>

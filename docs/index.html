**NFL | NE Patriots @ Cin Bengals | 1:00pm EDT**

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:**  Drake Maye o258.5 Passing Yards (-113), 5 units

**Write Up:** My last Three dubs have been NBA, but I really love <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>&#x27;s NFL slate for a lot of picks. Wanted to take the Pats on the spread originally (-7.5 feels criminal), but saw that another capper snagged that already so nice read there. Instead we&#x27;re going with Drake Maye for o258.5 passing yards to keep the streak alive. This is overall a massive mismatch for these two teams. Bengals allow the second most passing yards in the NFL. Daijahn Anthony is out, this team is a mess. I&#x27;m pretty sure we&#x27;ll see MVP contender Maye to go deep to Boutte at least a couple times to get things going early. Only risk here is an absolute blowout where we run the ball to stall later in the game. Maye has covered this line in 4 out of his last 5 games, and 8 out of 11 on the year. This line is right about average. I feel like the books could have inflated it a bit and still had most bets on the over, so I think it&#x27;s really solid +EV. 

Man I really hate betting on the Patriots, but if the books are going to put lines like this out I can&#x27;t turn my head.

**Take Drake Maye o258.5 Passing Yards**

***<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: (NFL) Jahmyr Gibbs over 60 rushing yards + Jalen Hurts over 150 passing yards (-177)*** 

Reasoning: Gibbs is facing the 2nd worst rush defense in the league (NY Giants). Lions are heavily favored (-13.5) which favors less passing attempts and more rushing attempts for the Lions. As for the other leg, Jalen Hurts is facing the worst pass defense in the NFL (Dallas Cowboys). H2H, Hurts has surpassed 150 yards in both games vs the Cowboys since last year. Hurts should see plenty of opportunities as the Eagles are only (-3) favorites. With these favorable props <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, let’s take Gibbs and Hurts for this high probability parlay.

Event: Jets vs Ravens (NFL)

Bet 4U to win 3U

Similar to last play where we find a running back going against a good rush defense but this time the added factor here is that tyrod taylor is going to start for the jets and unlike justin &quot;running back&quot; fields, he actually tries to throw the ball. So expect him to get less rush attempts here

Another thing is that the ravens are heavy favorites for this match-up with the spread being at -14.5 currently which means just more passing for the jets. Also hes under in 6/10 games this year with most of those games being justin fields so just remember that

I have only tryharded nfl capping this season but somehow betting unders just works more often idk why

Loveland is finally growing into a prominent role on the team with 4+ targets  and 3+ catches in five straight weeks.  The Pittsburgh Steelers are a great matchup for tight ends this season and this number feels pretty low for what should be a tight game where Loveland’s pass catching skills are needed.

League: International Rugby

England is flying very high after a big win against New Zealand and has moved some of their regular starters to the bench. Argentina’s explosive, dynamic style is well suited to break England’s rush defense especially when England will be starting a few younger players. England’s back row starters are all phenomenal players, but they’re not their quickest options nor do they cover as much field as say Pollock or Curry (on the bench), so I think Argentina will be able to hang with them to start</td></tr>

### **&quot;<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>&quot;**


**Game:** Indianapolis Colts at Kansas City Chiefs
**Selection:** **Indianapolis Colts +3.5**
**Time:** Sunday, 1:00 PM ET
**Current Odds:** -110


**1. The &quot;Dynasty Tax&quot; vs. The Efficiency Reality**
The betting public continues to price the Kansas City Chiefs like the juggernaut of 2022, ignoring the reality of their 2025 performance. The Chiefs are 5-5—their worst start in a decade—yet they are laying 3.5 points against an 8-2 team. The Super Model flags this as a &quot;Legacy Premium.&quot; You are paying a tax for the name &quot;Mahomes,&quot; even though the metrics show a team in decline.


**2. The Rest Discrepancy**
The Indianapolis Colts are coming off a **Bye Week**. In the modern NFL, the rest advantage late in the season is one of the most predictive variables for covering the spread. Head Coach Shane Steichen has had 14 days to script his opening drives against Steve Spagnuolo’s defense. Conversely, the Chiefs are grinding through a short week of preparation after a physical divisional loss.


**3. The Statistical Mismatch**
* **Colts Offense:** Ranked #1 in the NFL in Total Offense (396.9 yards/game) and #1 in EPA/Play. Jonathan Taylor leads the league in rushing, allowing Indy to control the clock and keep Mahomes on the sideline.
* **Chiefs Defense:** While solid (4th in points allowed), they have not faced an offensive line this dominant since Week 1. The model projects the Colts to win the time-of-possession battle by a 60/40 margin.


**4. The &quot;Hook&quot; Math**
The most critical factor is the number. In NFL betting, the number **3** is king (the most common margin of victory). By getting **+3.5**, we hold a winning ticket if the Chiefs win by a field goal (e.g., 23-20). The model projects this game as a pure coin flip (50/50 outright win probability), which makes catching 3.5 points mathematically superior to any other spread on the board.


**Model Prediction:** **Colts 27, Chiefs 24** (Colts win outright).</td></tr>

**Hawks - Hornets** 🏀 NBA UTC 23:00

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>**: Kon Knueppel 3 Points Over (2.5) @ 1.50



📌 Knueppel currently has the most three-pointers made among all rookies in the NBA (54, ahead of Luka Garza for second). He&#x27;s also 12th overall in the league!

📌 He&#x27;s shooting 42.1% from three in his first 16 games; his last five games have seen him shoot 9.0 three-point attempts/game and make 46.7%. In his most recent game, he scored 26 points on 6-of-9 three-pointers.

📌 Atlanta Hawks 3-P Defense – A Dream Matchup for Knueppel: The Hawks are allowing 37.9% 3-point attempts and 14.1 3-point attempts per game this season → 18th in the league. In their last eight home games, Atlanta opponents have averaged 15.4 three-pointers (40.2%).

📌 Their 3-P defense is particularly poor against wingers (SG/SF): Allowing 41.1% SGs and 39.8% SFs (among the top 5 teams in the league)

▫️ODDS: 1.78

▫️Thoughts: Arsenal has burned me before on this kind of <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> and the new striker gyökeres likely is out as well after an injury in their last champions league game. However Merino plays a rouge sort of football where the guy somehow manages to find goals quite often. Saka, Trossard , and Martinelli have also been playing great this season too. Arsenal has skated by with a few 1-0 wins, but they&#x27;re at home and this is a North London derby match. This win is vital for Arsenal, it would put them 6 points clear of Chelsea and 7 points above Man City. Of course a football team collecting their 3 points is always important, but after a stunning (and disappointing depending if you are an Arsenal fan or not) draw in stoppage time against Sunderland, I feel like the gunners will be even more motivated to retain their lead in the Premier League.

Tenshin Nasukawa vs Takuma Inoue
   
<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Takuma ML   

Write Up: Takuma Inoue may be an big underdog however, he is simply the more experienced boxer going 20-2 in boxing while tenshin’s is 7-0 with 2 KOs. Because Inoue is not a knockout puncher, his clearest and most realistic path to victory is a decision. That aligns perfectly with the stylistic dynamics: Tenshin is difficult to hurt cleanly, but he can be out-boxed round by round by a veteran who sets traps, maintains distance, and forces exchanges on his terms. With the market overvaluing Tenshin’s hype and underestimating Takuma’s experience and ability.  Takuma has fought has the highest level in boxing, holding titles and has more overall championship experience. Takuma is super experienced in going the entire 12 full rounds. Tenshin may be up and coming however his gas tank has not yet been put to the test so hence I say Takuma ML. Alternatively if you would like to get more value from this you can play to Takuma by Decision.

Next bet ⚽️ Bolivia division professional 

Always ready vs bolivar over 3.5 goals @2.30 odds 

Always Ready and Bolivar consistently produce high-scoring matches, especially when they meet in El Alto, where the altitude creates a fast, open style of football. Both sides attack aggressively, press high, and commit numbers forward, which naturally leads to goals and defensive gaps.
Always Ready have been scoring heavily at home all season, and Bolivar are one of the strongest attacking teams in the league. Their head-to-head history is full of 4+ goal matches, and both teams have reliable goal scorers in form. With the pace, altitude advantage, and the way both sides play, this matchup suits an over 3.5 goals outcome and aligns perfectly with a goals-based strategy.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s Event: Buccaneers @ Rams 8:20 P.M EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **Buccaneers ML +275**

Write Up: The Buccaneers have every reason to come out swinging <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, and this matchup against the Rams is lined up perfectly for a statement win. Tampa Bay has dropped two straight, and with the division race tightening, they’re now neck and neck with the Panthers. Carolina has a brutal matchup against the 49ers this week, giving the Bucs a golden opportunity to regain control of the NFC South if they handle business.

The Rams walk into this game with real vulnerabilities. Their defense has been slipping, and they’ve gone back-to-back games without recording a single sack — a major problem against a Bucs offense that can get rolling when Baker Mayfield is kept clean. If Tampa’s O-line gives him time, L.A.’s defense has shown nothing lately that says they can stop it.

Chris Godwin is expected to return, injecting badly needed firepower into a hungry Buccaneers team that is downright starving for a victory.

With the division on the line, a struggling Rams defense, and reinforcements returning, <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> is the moment for Tampa Bay to punch back and get right. With these odds and the promise the Bucs &amp; Mayfield have shown this year I have to back the dogs here in just a absolutely great spot. Give me Tampa.</td></tr>

**Write up:**

**Real Betis v Girona (15.15 GMT)**  
Girona is in the relegation zone this season and are struggling against teams that are worse then Betis.

Betis on the other hand are 5th and looking to continue their good start to the season against Girona here. They&#x27;ve not really picked up a ton of points against teams around their own level or higher, which means that they need to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> up points against teams lower in the league standings. This is a game that they must win and, in front of their own home crowd after an international break, I see them winning this one.

**Aberdeen v Hearts (15.00 GMT)**  
People that have been tailing me know I like the current streak Hearts is on. Against a struggling Aberdeen this season this is a train I&#x27;m hopping aboard on once again. They&#x27;re already on 30 points after 12 matches and are looking to extend their lead.

Besides last week&#x27;s 0-0 draw against 6th place Motherwell, Aberdeen have not managed to gain any points against teams that are higher on the standings as them. And I do not see them starting to do that against a very confident and currently in first place sitting Hearts. Now as long as the Scottish Premiership isn&#x27;t yet divided in their playoff groups, this is a competition where a top-4 team is looking to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> up as many points against the bottom teams as they can before the split happens.

**Best of luck if tailing!** 🍀

Mega is a developing team with no competition ambitions, and still, they can pull out some good games. Since the pressure is off, because of those factors, I chose this hopefully safer combination. Keeping 1.5u.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Leipzig vs Werder Bremen - Over 3.5 Goals**

**Odds: (American: -110) (Decimal: 1.91)**

**Plays are always 1 unit**

Leipzig has been doing some solid work in the Bundesliga, currently in 4th place, tied with Borussia Dortmund and just one point away from Leverkusen at 2nd place. This team is playing its best at home, with 4 wins in 4 home matches. In this condition, the over 3.5 goals line hit in 2 out of their 4 home matches, with this team conceding a goal in this condition 3 out of 4 times. 

Werder Bremen is also in a solid position in the league, and they usually manage to score away from home, even when they lose. This team has scored in 4 out of their 5 away matches, and the over 3.5 goals line has also hit in 4 out of their 5 away matches. 

With this, Bremen knows that they won&#x27;t be able to keep up with Leipzig if they try to play defensively for the entire match, so I&#x27;m expecting them to risk a lot in counterattacks when possible. Leipzig, on the other hand, will always try to put constant pressure on Bremen. Leipzig has their full squad available for this match, so I&#x27;m expecting some goals, which is usually the norm with these teams in the current season.

Good luck!</td></tr>

Scotland vs. Tonga (Tonga +42.5) @1.59

Scotland will win by a big score, but everything has to go perfectly as with every other large handicap. They are not in the right mental state after losses to New Zealand and Argentina, surrendering a 21-point lead in the latter. Furthermore, they are unhappy with their current management, and that presents the possibility that they do not go as strong as they can despite the fact they will still win.
There is not much to say about Tonga other than that they play proudly and will have a right go at it to put at many points on the board as they possibly can.
This <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> is given mostly based on Scotland and their current mental state. The result will be a drubbing, but not by 43 points or more.

The lions are often borderline unstoppable at home. They are coming off a loss against the eagles on the road where they looked terrible. This is the perfect bounce back game where regardless if its dart, winston or wilson i do not expect this to be a competitive game. The lions have too many weapons and the corners of the giants do not match up well and should get torched all game as long as the offensive line holds up. The lions defensive front should have a field day vs the giants o line. I have not even mentioned gibbs and david being the best one tow punch in the entire NFL. Lions will have over 400 total yards. the only way they dont is if the defense and special teams cause turnovers early in drives or score on their own.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Saints ML 

Write Up: 
my original <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> would have been the Steelers Moneyline, but with the uncertainty of Aaron Rodgers starting, I am deciding to go with the New Orleans Saints.

The Saints have been real shaky all year as well as the Atlanta Falcons, but after an impressive one against the Panthers Tyler Shough looks like he is starting to get comfortable in Kellen Moore‘s offense. As well as a lave Camara and Johnson. 

The Falcons have looked like shit in the past couple games, as well as with Kirk cousins being the starter and Drake London injured. I believe the Atlanta Falcons will try to rely on Bijan Robinson to heavily, and the Saints will sniff that out. I also believe that even without Kirk cousins Michael panics didn’t look good in Atlanta before his injury. The only thing that could keep Atlanta in this game is their defense.

While I believe it is a lot, I think the Saints at the Superdome is always a tough team to beat and I think the Saints are showing that they are starting to play well together and are playing a bad team in the Atlanta Falcons who is injured quite a bit.</td></tr>

For <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> I am going with both teams to score in arsenal vs Tottenham. 

In there last 5 matches in Prem league at home arsenal has only conceded 1 goal against city.  

But on the other hand Tottenham has scored in all of there last 5 away matches in Prem league. 

Odds on Tottenham to score are 1.82x . Which means bookies expect a arsenal win to nil.  

But in there last 10 visits to Emirates ( arsenal home ground) in Prem league. Tottenham has scored 9 times.  If you go through there H2H history Tottenham has scored more often away then at home.  

Its Tottenham. They show up when noone expects them and lose when everyone expects them to win.  

At +107 i would take the btts anyday.  

Although i thought about going with just Tottenham to score at 1.84x on the off chance Arsenal fk up like liverpool did yesterday. But i would take the risk.  Its a rivalry from what I heard.  So yellow cards might have been a good bet but prem league is more technical football then physical football. So fouls and tackles are rare that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> that.

To bet 1u and earn a profit of .78

I believe the Eagles is severely underrated at this point because they were having trouble against PLAYOFF teams, but that’s supposed to happen. Just look at Rams v Seahawks, which struggled against each other. 

At every position match-up, the eagles are better or close to equal (QB, WR). 

If the Eagles can stop the top offensive teams, how much more to the Cowboys. Not mentioning, they were against top defensive teams, which is the total opposite of the Cowboys. 

This is a divisional match-up which i trust that the Eagles prepare better than the Cowboys.

The Heat continue to be the fastest paced team in the league. Them alone push the over/under high to 240.5. Expect Maxey and the 76ers to match pace with their quick trigger on 3s.

Maxey continues to lack his usual complements as well without Oubre and Embiid but gifting this assist line at plus money is a must take.

Heat are ranked 25th in allowing assists to PGs. Guards in general do well in assists vs Bulls, Giddey had 9 assists vs them in 31 minutes despite a blowout. 

Maxey has cashed in L2/2 and L2/4 vs Heat. He&#x27;s seeing an average of 13.1 Potential Assists / game.

NFL: Cincinnati Bengals VS. New England Patriots.  

Write Up: Gonna change things up for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> since it’s Monday Night Football. And as per usual, another day, another strange spread. From the few Bengals games I’ve actually watched, they have looked extremely volatile and lost. Joe Flacco has been really inconsistent, as demonstrated by his strong start to the season followed by a decline in quality, highlighted by his glaring performance last week against the Steelers. The only consistently good part about their offence would probably be their receivers, most notably Tee Higgins and Ja’Marr Chase, the latter sitting this game out due to a suspension for an incident with Jalen Ramsey against the Steelers. Now, time to address the elephant in the room, because the offence isn’t the worst part about the Bengals. Their defence is abysmal, ranking first in most defensive yards allowed and touchdowns allowed. And if things couldn’t get any worse, a portion of their defensive line is not playing this match due to injuries, somehow managing to dig a deeper hole for themselves (if it wasn’t deep enough already). On the other hand, the Patriots have been excellent this season, led by MVP candidate QB Drake ‘Drake Maye’ Maye and very solid offensive units like Stefon Diggs, Hunter Henry, and DeMario Douglas. They rank top 10 in both total yards made and passing yards made. Alongside their great offence, their defence has been nothing short of amazing, placing 7th in least amount of yards allowed. Not to mention, They have a perfect record on the road, going 5-0 in all their away games (Dolphins, Bills, Saints, Titans, Bucs). I expect them to exploit both the Bengals’ limited offence and garbage defence. Therefore, I’m taking the Patriots covering the 7 point margin.</td></tr>

Write Up: Seahawks just ran into a very tough division opponent, the LA Rams. This week they face the Tennessee Titans who are one of the worst teams in the league. Seatle has one of the most efficient offenses in the league, especially early in the game.


Seahawks lead the NFL with an average of 8.0/points in the 1Q. Ahead of the Colts (7.0), Rams (6.9), and Lions (6.6). They&#x27;ve averaged 10.3 points in the 1Q in the last 3 games. For the non NFL fans, this means they usually get in two scoring drives in the first quarter.


JSN has hit this line in 7/10 games this season (they&#x27;ve played 10 games). He&#x27;s hit in the last 4/5, with the miss being against the Texans, who are one of, if not the best defense in the NFL. JSN is tied 2nd in the league with most catches in the 1Q with 19 in those 10 games.


Titans do have a poor run defense, but they are middle of the pack against the pass (18/32 teams), so I still suspect the Seahawks to be throwing it early as usual to get the offense going


Partially a degen wager as it&#x27;s limited to the 1st Q, but what are we here for.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Kenneth Walker III + Zach Charbonnet 100+ combined rushing yards (-130) 2U**

NFL (SEA/TEN) 1pm EST

Write-up: Titans give up 109 yds/game on the ground to opposing running backs on 23 avg carries - 7th worst in the league. Seattle is favored by 12 and against weaker teams have gone up big and early on the backs of their stellar defense and JSN. This leads to a lot of rushes that are split between KWIII/Charbonnet. 2 weeks ago against arizona the duo had 14 carries each for a total of 28 carries and 150 yards. against Houston 29/115, TB 19/121, AZ 31/120, Pitts 28/120, etc. Issue is its hard to predict who between them will go off in any given week.

Rather than <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> one, taking the chance of a bad day/minor injury/huge run by other - this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> picks both. We&#x27;re basically asking them to clear 100 yards total against one of the worst run defenses in the league with very favorable game script.

I was debating between this bet and Gibbs/Montgomery combined rush yards against the Giants - which is quite similar in many aspects. decided on this for the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> since odds are much better (Gibbs/Montgomery is -170 for combined 125+ yards) and I think taking Gibbs&#x27; individual props are better in that situation.

so Kenneth Walker III + Zach Charbonnet 100+ combined rushing yards (-130) on DK.  BOL if tailing!</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: Rock ML vs Aspinall 

Sport: Darts, Players Championship Finals

Reasoning: Rock has the stronger long-term numbers (higher 12-month scoring/finishing and the 3–1 head-to-head), and this tournament has only widened that gap with a 98.4 average vs Aspinall’s 95.9 plus better checkout efficiency across their last three matches. He’s shown the higher ceiling and the heavier scoring in this event, so the statistical edge stays with him.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Declan Rice 1+ SOT (+135) ✅️

**Write Up:** Enzo has come through for us twice now, this go around was a bit more sweaty than the 2 minute cash from the last go around, but his late 88&#x27; goal cashes us again to start off the weekend!

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> we head down to London where 1st Place Arsenal host 8th place Tottenham in the North London Derby. These two teams do not like each other to say the least and their stadiums are 25 minutes apart. Arsenal is the heavy favorite here as they play tough at home, but I&#x27;m staying away from ML as my main <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> (as usual). This matchup is always unpredictable and fun to watch, we could see a 4-4 slugfest or a 1-0 defensive battle. 

I have to be honest, I really don&#x27;t like rooting for Arsenal. Most of their players have big egos, flop frequently, and complain with flailing arms when things don&#x27;t go their way (sorry Arsenal fans). But Declan Rice does not fit that mold - as he&#x27;s a great guy on and off the pitch. I like this play because Rice has really been in shooting form recently. He has had 1+ SOT in his last 3 EPL matches and 4 of his last 5. He also found himself in the box a ton for England during the break, with 3 potential SOTs (two called back for borderline offsides). He again fits my mold of hard working midfielders that I love to back. He takes free kicks more often than not (and scores from them!) and has been playing much further forward in the box attacking over the last 5 matches. Keep in mind he does take corners from the left side, so not a lot of corner shot attempts from him. 

I like Rice here to maintain his shooting form and land a shot on target here. BOL if tailing and have a great Sunday!</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Frederikstad O3.5 team corners vs Viking FK 3U @ 1.72 (Bet365)

Write-up: Four losses in a row… that’s the fourth time I’ve gone through this very same patch and it’s never reached five - always leading to a long win streak but it obviously sucks at the moment. Brentford with a disgraceful performance after scoring the opener through Igor’s penalty and were leading the corners 3-1 at that point. After that though they parked the bus. I will never understand why teams do that so early as it almost always leads to them losing their advantage with 60 minutes of pressure piled on. That pressure from Brighton paid off with Minteh especially wreaking havoc, getting an incredible assist for Welbeck before Hinshelwood sealed the deal not long after. The Seagulls had 80% 2H possession at that point (which is insane) and ended on 7 corners to the Bees 4. Igor missed a last minute penalty and Brighton got a very deserved win against a disorganised team.

Going to keep this short and sweet, Viking are neck-and-neck with Bodø/Glimt and a win <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> would take them top with a game remaining. Fredrikstad are a steady sixth, which is where they also finished last year. Viking has averaged 4.6 corners conceded over their last 20 away matches while Fredrikstad has won an average of 5 at home over the same time period. Using all the stats I have and including recent corner form I get an expected 4.9 corners for the home team. That gives me a 71% chance of the play winning. This same fixture produced 7 corners for them last season (and the reverse fixture saw 6 this year). Fredrikstad have covered the line in 15/20 and Viking’s opponents in 13/20 at home. Looking at opponent-specified data shows me 13/16 times the line covered when Viking faced top 10 opposition and 11/15 for their opponents so both are in line with my estimation. BOL !

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s games: Scotland v Tonga + England v Argentina (Rugby)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s picks: Scotland -29.5 + England ML @ -122 (3 Units)

Write up:

First <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> in the thread last time, hopefully this format is correct. I am not sure many people followed it but it was a winner! 

Sticking with the rugby theme for Sunday. 

Scotland playing Tonga at home to finish the internationals. The line is actually set at -38.5 which I think can easily be covered but is also quite high. Therefore I am going for the alternative spread of -29.5

This game should be a walk in the park for Scotland and they will be looking to correct their failure last time out against Argentina where they blew a 21-0 lead. Despite playing a low ranking  opponent they have named a very strong side and can see them easily scoring 50+ points. However, these games can flow weirdly when it is 1-sided, hence me going for the alternate handicap.

Part 2 is England to win ML. Again the spread is tempting at -9.5 but Argentina are a good side and I expect it to be close , even tho it should cover. Probs gonna take a piece of the spread at lower units. 

England have won 10 in a row and are in their best form for years - beating New Zealand last week. They will be looking to round off the perfect autumn series with another win against Argentina. 

Argentina on the other hand showed their frailty going 21-0 down to Scotland last week , and against a stronger more consistent side in England - it is hard to see this not ending with a home win.

I was shocked when I saw the odds for this was -122 hence the 3unit stake. 

(I hope this write up format is ok and happy to take any tips for useful info to include going forward!)

This Lakers team has been a really fun watch all season, led by a combination of Luka, Reaves and Domin-Ayton. Now Lebron is in the mix, and this team looks like an absolute powerhouse on offense and above average on defense. They play the tanking Jazz who are prone to getting blownout, including losing to the Lakers 4 days back by 14 pts. The Jazz can be a fun team with different guys popping off, and Lauri is still quality, but the gulf between these teams is too much. I’d play it to -10.

**Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Jakobi Meyers o7.5 1Q receiving yards ✅️ 

**Game:** NFL **-** Jaguars @ Cardinals, 3pm CDT

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Jacoby Brissett o243.5 passing yards (-127 on FD)

**Rationale:**

Keeping with the theme of targeting the Jaguars terrible pass defense on this one. I wouldn&#x27;t let last week fool you. The Jaguars have been a bottom-5 unit against the pass this season, allowing an average of 237 passing yards per game, 253 per game if you remove last week&#x27;s outlier. They are also going to be without Travon Walker this week, which will *severely* inhibit their ability to get pressure on the QB.

Jacoby Brissett has been **slinging** the ball in his starts this season, averaging 28 completions and 314 passing yards per game. He has thrown for *at least* 258 yards in every start this year, including his monster 452-yard performance last week. The Cardinals running attack has been poor most of this season due to injury, and this plays right into the Jaguars&#x27; top-5 running defense.

The Jags, of course, have also been famous for getting killed by backup QBs over the last few years (Jacoby may not *reallllly* be a backup, but he is technically). Jake Browning and Davis Mills had field days this season, and Brissett is the exact archetype of player that just shreds their pass defense.

I really like this line and expect him to clear it, and it will not surprise me if the line continues to jump up by the time you read this post.</td></tr>

Last Pick: Nico Collins Over 74.5 yards ❌

[Nico write up](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/comments/1p1p0r2/comment/nprkkza/?context=3)

Bad beat for Nico who was on pace in the first half, then gets no action in the second due to a stellar performance from Houston&#x27;s defense stonewalling Allen and the Bills. Nico had 3 catches on 3 targets for 55 yards in the first half, then absolutely no looks in the second. One more catch (for his game average) would have been right at the 74 yard number. I should have known better to make my first <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> on a Thursday night game, but I&#x27;m not gonna let it keep me down.

Event: Patriots @ Bengals 1:00 PM

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: **Hunter Henry over 39.5 yards receiving (-110) (2U)**

Hunter Henry is set to have a decent game because the Bengals are **literally the worst team in the league at defending tight ends**, giving up over 4 catches and almost 60 yards a game to TEs. Their linebackers and safeties keep losing underneath and over the middle, which is exactly where Henry eats. He’s efficient with the targets he does get, so it doesn&#x27;t take much volume for him to put up solid yardage.

(And as a bonus, he’s got a real shot to find the end zone too. He and Diggs basically split red-zone work evenly, and Cincinnati has been getting cooked by tight ends near the goal line all year. They have given up the most TDs to TEs as well. Henry ATTD is also a solid play at +180.)

Arsenal have been in stellar form even with the Sunderland draw. In their last 10 games, they&#x27;ve won 9 and drawn 1. A last-minute goal last gameweek against Sunderland saw them fall short of achieving a perfect 10-game record and they&#x27;ll look to recoup those dropped points against their biggest rivals tomorrow.

After both Liverpool and City lost <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, I don&#x27;t see a way where Arsenal get under 5 shots on target tomorrow, even if they have a slow start, enough players are returning to keep this attacking side rejuvenated.

Write up: I almost took this line last week for my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> vs. the Raiders and it cleared by a mile. I like this line just as much this week at home in this divisional matchup vs. a middle of the pack Eagles pass defense. This season Pickens has cleared this yardage in 8/10 games and has hit this mark in his last 5. 

At this point in the season Pickens has been a major contributor in the passing game and has become the greatest WR2 in the NFL. Pickens averages an impressive 8.3 targets average in games this year and ranks 7th in the league in yards average per catch (15.7).

I believe Pickens will continue to have many opportunities to be involved in this high-powered and well orchestrated offense at home this week. The Cowboys have been very dominant in Jerry&#x27;s world and average 282 yards per game through the air.

Every game moving forward will be a must win for Dallas. I believe they will be putting their best foot forward on offense this week and Pickens will continue his career year success in this high stakes clash.

Write up: 

Eagles:

For two weeks straight, the Eagles have been bombarded with criticism about their offense—questions about stagnation, lack of explosiveness, and whether Jalen Hurts can carry this team down the stretch. But the reality is that before their bye week, this offense was firing on all cylinders. In the two games leading into the break, Philadelphia averaged over 27 points per game, Hurts completed nearly 67% of his passes, and the rushing attack was balanced and efficient with Saquon Barkley pounding out chunk gains behind one of the league’s best offensive lines. The narrative of a “broken offense” simply doesn’t hold up when you look at the numbers in context.

The recent dip in production came against two of the NFL’s most suffocating defenses in brutal weather conditions. Detroit ranks 6th in the league in yards allowed per game, while Green Bay sits right behind them at 7th. Playing outdoors in freezing temperatures against those units is a completely different challenge than what awaits in Dallas. The Cowboys’ defense, despite a spirited showing against the Raiders, ranks near the bottom of the league in both points allowed and yards surrendered. That Raiders game was more about emotion than quality—the Raiders are bottom-tier in nearly every offensive and defensive metric, and Dallas fed off the atmosphere of a desperate opponent.

Now the Cowboys return home on a short week, while the Eagles come in rested, healthier, and motivated to silence the noise. Playing inside the dome at AT&amp;T Stadium eliminates the weather factor and sets up perfectly for Philadelphia’s offense to reassert itself. The Cowboys want this game to turn into a shootout, but that’s not how it will be decided. The Eagles dominate in the trenches, and that gives them multiple outs to win—whether it’s Barkley grinding down the defense, Hurts exploiting mismatches in the passing game, or their own defensive front collapsing Dak Prescott’s pocket. This is the perfect spot for the Eagles to prove the critics wrong and remind everyone why they remain one of the NFC’s most complete teams. Not to mention  the cowboys have given up the 9th highest rate of explosive plays and I wouldn’t be surprised to see saquon break one off to the house tomorrow. 

Northwestern:

At the Greenbrier Tip-Off, both Northwestern and South Carolina are staring down the possibility of leaving 0-2. That desperation raises the stakes, but Northwestern has the clear edge. My power ratings make this game closer to -6.5, while the market sits at -5.5, giving us immediate value, however the pace by both teams might make this a little tighter in the end but I am not worried about northwestern, they will be getting the job done.

The Wildcats’ offense is built around Nick Martinelli, who has emerged as the best player on the floor in this matchup. His efficiency and ability to score at all three levels force defenses to collapse, opening opportunities for Arrinten Page and Jayden Reid. With Page providing a reliable interior presence and Reid distributing while scoring in double figures himself, Northwestern now has three legitimate scoring options. Their shooting splits reflect that balance: the Wildcats are hitting over 46% from the field and nearly 44% from deep, numbers that far outpace South Carolina’s streaky perimeter shooting. Carolina has meechie Johnson and really that’s about it, and they only shoot 45% from the field compared to northwesterns 51%. They simply don’t have as much continuity and fluid options in their offense to match martinelli and co and martinelli will be the best player on the court tomorrow, and he’s coming off a down game with just 8 points in a close loss to a solid Virginia team. 

Rebounding has been Northwestern’s Achilles heel, highlighted by the lopsided 49-23 margin against Virginia. Yet even in that game, they led for stretches and lost by just five despite being +4.5 underdogs. That shows how dangerous their shooting can be when they’re clicking. Against South Carolina, the rebounding battle is far less intimidating. The Gamecocks average around 36 boards per game—similar to Northwestern—and were bullied on the glass by Butler. With Page and Martinelli anchoring the frontcourt, Northwestern actually holds a size advantage here, something they didn’t have against Virginia.
South Carolina’s offense leans heavily on perimeter shooting, but they lack the efficiency and depth Northwestern brings. Combine that with the Wildcats’ superior shooting splits, their trio of scoring threats, and the fact that South Carolina has struggled to impose themselves physically, and the edge is clear. Northwestern has the tools to control this game, and with both teams desperate to avoid 0-2, the Wildcats’ balance and size should carry them to a win.

In summary:

The Eagles face a soft Dallas defense in ideal conditions after weeks of criticism, while Northwestern’s efficient offense and size give them the upper hand against South Carolina. At +110 odds, this is a plus-money play that I think puts us in excellent place to cash. As always, cheers 🍻</td></tr>

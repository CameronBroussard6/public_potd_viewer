**Write up:**  
  
**The <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>:**  
Based on similar games with these odds, this profile usually produces **open matches** rather than one-sided ones. The teams tend to trade goals, with **draws like 1-1 or games finishing 2-1 / 2-2** showing up often. That already points more toward **both teams scoring** than a clean sheet scenario.

From a motive point of view, this is not a “control and shut down” type of game. The structure leans toward **goals over clean sheets**, and the clusters I track show repeated **BTTS outcomes** in this exact range. Even when one side is favored, the other usually finds a way to score.

All my layers line up here — **odds profile, score patterns, and goal motives** — which is why I’m happy to take this as a **BTTS spot** rather than forcing a side or total.

**My Model in general:**  
My model is built around the idea that matches follow **recurring patterns**, not randomness.  
Instead of predicting games in isolation, it groups matches by **odds profiles** and studies what *actually* happens when similar games are played.

By clustering historical matches with the same **home–draw–away odds**, I track how games usually unfold — goals, BTTS, scorelines, and game flow. From there, the model identifies **motives**: situations where teams are more likely to attack, trade goals, or avoid clean sheets.

Every <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> comes from **data-backed profiles, not opinions** — combining odds structure, score patterns, and streak behavior to find spots where the market regularly repeats itself.

Tip off is 6:30 PST. Moving on to another system that has seen success. Jonas has hit this the last 6 games and 8 out of the last 10. I&#x27;m not totally sure why the line has not moved on it. I suspect it is due to his minute being solely dependent on Jokic&#x27;s playing time. I will probably not stray from this system until Aaron Gordon is healthy. 

The Nuggets are -1.5 favorites tonight so it is expected to be a close game. I will wager 2.5 units on the same bet on Thursday should it not hit.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Rayo Vallecano 0.0 Asian Handicap +100, 3 units

**Write Up:** I love a clean +100 (2.00) line and see a lot of value here. Rayo Vallecano aren’t exactly flying but they’re a tricky side to beat, even taking valuable points off the big two - yes, Barcelona and Real Madrid have failed to register a win against them this season, and they troubled Atletico too. They’re especially stubborn at home where they’re extremely hard to beat as they rarely ship goals, and the atmosphere at their ground is absolutely electric and reminds me a lot of the temperamental South American leagues. At the same time, they’re more than capable of scoring goals of their own and completing cheeky comebacks. Betis, on the other hand, have been quite inconsistent and struggle to break down defensively sound teams, like the one they’re facing this evening. Rayo also proved they’re a tough opponent for the Sevillan side, as Betis haven’t beaten them since the early 2024. Pretty confident in this one, but as always, bet responsibly. I do see massive value in this play but odds of +100 essentially imply a coin flip. BOL if you do decide to tail ☘️</td></tr>

Dortmund doing Dortmund things in my last pick, I will learn from that.

According to my model, the alternative consideration <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> would be a double chance on Bournemouth in Manchester. However, Bournemouth seems very dead at the moment. 

I don&#x27;t understand the odds for the Rayo vs Betis matchup. According to the statistics and expected lineups, my model predicts a Real Betis win in over 60% of cases which presents us insane value at these odds. Rayo is the third-worst home team in La Liga. Both teams played away in the Europa and Conference Leagues during the week, so fatigue is not a factor.

I&#x27;m confident in the analysis and am putting my faith in the better team overall. If you&#x27;re taking this game into a parlay, it would be better to go with Betis Double Chance, this hits at over 80% in my model.

Looking at the rosters of both teams, I don&#x27;t see a difference in quality. Even though the Tigers are coming here after a four-hour flight, they will show their quality on the court. Their ability to make the game difficult to win through rebounding and toughness in the paint is what stands out. While Beijing is a team that finds its rhythm more easily at home, when the Tigers&#x27; half-court defense and tempo control work well, games usually stay balanced until the last quarter. +6.5 isn&#x27;t a guarantee of a win for me; it&#x27;s a safety margin that allows them to stay in the game even if they experience ups and downs in the score.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Miami Dolphins +3.5 (-125)

Write Up: Long time readers here trying out making my own selections, hopefully make some people some money here as well!

Most EPA/play and success-rate models price this game closer to PK / +1. Getting +3.5 clears the most important number, and the matchup data supports a tight game. Pittsburgh’s defense is built around pressure, not coverage dominance. With TJ Watt out, their pressure rate drops materially, and pressure rate is far more predictive of defensive EPA than sack totals. Miami’s offense ranks near the top of the league in EPA/play when kept clean, and removing PIT’s primary source of negative plays raises Miami’s expected points per drive. This directly reduces Pittsburgh’s ability to create separation.

Miami holds a clear edge on early downs: top-tier early-down success rate on offense versus a Steelers defense that’s below average at preventing early-down success. Early-down efficiency is one of the strongest predictors of ATS performance for underdogs — it keeps teams out of long 3rd downs, sustains drives, and shortens games. With Achane playing the way he has, I wouldn’t be suprised if he a breaks a big run or 2 as well.

The Dolphins rank among the league’s best in explosive pass rate, while Pittsburgh’s offense sits bottom-tier in explosive plays. Underdogs with an explosive advantage consistently outperform the spread because they can erase deficits quickly, while the favorite lacks fast scoring paths. Pittsburgh’s offense is far more methodical and dependent on long drives.

Dolphins +3.5 (Prediction 20-17 Dolphins Win)

I just believe the pace of play of each team as well as the Dolphins willingness to feed Achane will keep this game close, and while i’m not sure the Dolphins win i believe the game is kept within a field goal either way. I think TJ missing this game will be a bigger loss than realized in the Monday Night Football game.</td></tr>

Ivica Zubac o 17.5 points (-104 on DK); 2 units

  
JJ gets off to a SLOW start, or as Clyde would say, he was lookin lackadaisical out there. Stayed steady though and cashes in the 45th minute, with a bit more sweat than I would have liked. 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>, I am rolling with big Zu to score 18+, who has struggled against the Grizzlies this season so far, scoring only 9 and 10 points in two games.

However, in those two games he was facing off against Zach Edey, who currently has the **best defensive rating** in the NBA at 94.5 (minimum 15 mpg) due to his monstrous paint presence (where Zubac operates exclusively).

Edey will not be playing, and so Memphis will be starting either Aldama or Landale at the center position, neither of whom are especially strong defenders statistically (as neither rank in the top 300 defensively). Both of MEM&#x27;s big men should be outmatched (and certainly outsized) by Zubac, so I expect LAC to try to exploit the mismatch.  

Another potential advantage for us is that, while LAC typically play a very slow pace, MEM should speed things up and ultimately create more possessions for the Clippers. When Morant plays, MEM has a pace ratings of 103.3 (for reference, the 4th fastest team currently has a pace rating of 102.9).  

And as always, this game caught my attention as it is expected to be close, so Zu should get his full minutes and I believe an above-average game offensively due to MEM&#x27;s weakness at the center position, sans Edey.

As a sidenote, I think Zu should do well on rebounds too, but his line of 12.5 was a little too high for my taste.</td></tr>

**Event**: (NFL) Miami Dolphins vs. Pittsburgh Steelers | 8:15pm ET 

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>**: **Devon Achane OVER 17.5 Rush Attempts** | 2u to win 1.96u | -104 on FD

**Reason**: As most NFL fans have noticed, Devon Achane is making his name known as a top RB in the league and over the past couple of weeks he has been dominating. Achane went out with a rib injury last week, but is looking to suit up in Pittsburgh as Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel stated his injury is nothing to worry about. 

One reason I love this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> is because the **temps in Pittsburgh will be frigid (16 degrees around kickoff).** Tua is infamous for playing awful in cold games. Taking a look at the **last 7 games where temps have been 45 degrees or less, the Dolphins are 0-7** and Tua&#x27;s (whose completion percentage in these games has been suboptimal) numbers in those games are not ideal. Should Miami want to get one in the win column for Tua, Achane can save the day. Though this Steelers defense against the pass has not been playing well by any means, I still think Miami will look to try and attack on the ground. **Pittsburgh allows 125.3 rush yards per game,** ranking bottom 10 in run defense.  

**Taking a look at Achane&#x27;s workload the last 6 games - 18, 14, 22, 21, 22, 7(exited early).** Miami is obviously trying to get him involved more - **3 of his 4 games this season with 20+ carries have been in the last 4 games.** I don&#x27;t see a reason for them to change the amount of carries he has been getting.

**He has been playing too good to not give him the ball 20 times a game, especially against a poor Pittsburgh defense in below 20 degree temps.** 

Most of what JoeIngles mentioned in his Achane <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> also applies here. This <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> will just depend more on Miami&#x27;s game plan rather than Achane&#x27;s pure skill.

<tr><td class='post'>NBA <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> 13-9

Last Pick: Jalen Johnson Over 9.5 Boards.

Very lucky that it hit if I&#x27;m being honest, as he got a lot of defensive boards stripped from Barlow and Walker. However the line moved to 10.5 Boards and he ended up with 10 exactly.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Todays Pick</mark>: **James Harden Over 7.5 Assists.** 

TLDR: No Zach Edey, Plus they have had a lot of time to rest, from their 7 straight away games and then 2 home games and then 5 straight on the road AGAIN which is why line feel low imo

I know exactly what you’re thinking *the Clippers?* The same Clippers where Ty Lue has publicly questioned Kawhi Leonard’s availability and Leonard himself has hinted the roster needs more talent. It’s not a stable situation, and recent results back that up.

Over the last five games, Harden has gone **under his assist line in all five**, with **every under coming on the road**. This is one of the oldest teams in the league, and heavy scheduling tends to hurt teams like this more than most. Steve Kerr has made similar comments about Golden State, and the Clippers fall into that same category. Assists only count if teammates hit shots, and fatigue has clearly impacted conversion.

Despite that, Harden’s role hasn’t changed. He’s still **top 8 in potential assists**, averaging roughly **14.1 potential assists per game**, which tells us the opportunities are there — recent unders have been driven more by shot-making variance than a lack of creation.

The home/road split adds important context. **At home**, Harden is a significantly better creator, posting an **AST% of 39.6%**, compared to **32.6% on the road**. The Clippers’ offense is also more efficient with him on the floor at home (**119.1 OFFRTG vs 115.9 on the road**), with a slightly faster pace that increases assist opportunities. While his usage rises on the road, his efficiency and assist conversion drop, reinforcing that Harden is more effective as a playmaker at home.

Memphis presents an interesting matchup. They rank **top 9 in assists allowed to point guards**, meaning they are relatively solid at limiting direct playmaking, but they rank **bottom 3 in points allowed to point guards (around 27th out of 30)**. That suggests they struggle badly containing dribble penetration, often forcing help defense even if initial coverage holds.

That dynamic still suits Harden. He ranks **top 18 in drives per game at 14.3**, and with **Zach Edey out**, Memphis’ interior resistance should be weakened. If Harden’s drive volume increases to **around 20 drives**, using his historical drive creation rate (roughly **10% of drives becoming assists**), that projects to **about 2 assists coming directly off drives**, before accounting for assists generated through <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>-and-roll or secondary actions.

Overall, while recent road unders are a concern, the combination of a **home environment where Harden’s assist rate is meaningfully higher**, increased paint pressure, and a Memphis defense that struggles to contain point-guard scoring keeps Harden’s assist upside firmly in play in this matchup.</td></tr>

**Write Up:** Three wins in a row! Lets start new week with great upcoming game in Premier League! Here is the reasoning for my next <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>.

Manchester United has only lost once in the nine last games that they have played. The loss came against Everton in a super close matchup in which the Red Devils should have won at least one point. At home, ManU has been pretty decent, winning 4/7 matches. However, having watched them play, they did pretty well in all of them and with a bit of luck they could have a win rate of 100% at home.

Bournemouth has won only 2 points in the last six games they played. They had a tough schedule, but it is still a horrible record. Also to add, in away games they have lost three straight matches against Sunderland, Aston Villa, and Manchester City and have allowed 10 goals - that&#x27;s averaging 3.33 per game!

Overall of what I have seen from these two teams this season and the difference in form, I believe that the Red Devils are closer to winning the upcoming Premier League matchup!

**Event**: Spain La Liga: Rayo Vallecano vs Real Betis 12:00pm PST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>**: Real Betis Draw no Bet (-120) 2u

**Write up:**

To start I&#x27;ll explain the reasoning as to why I chose this over double chance or a straight moneyline. I think Real Betis have been a very good team this year and haven&#x27;t been getting props for it. With that being said, Vallecano are an annoying team that just scrape scrape scrape draws at home.

Although they&#x27;re 18th in the league at home, they&#x27;ve only lost 1 game, against Bilbao. They drew with Barcelona and Real Madrid at home, only scoring and conceding 4 goals in 6 games at home this season. This probably shows you why I&#x27;m so weary of betting the straight ML here. I definitely don&#x27;t think Vallecano can win this game, but I do feel like they can scrape a draw somehow. The double chance for Betis is -250 making it pretty bad value, so I like the DnB for the push in case they draw. When talking about overall form, Vallecano are quite bad. They&#x27;re 0-3-2 in their last 5 games, only scoring 1 goal and conceding 6. 

On to Betis, they do have a few vital players out, but as shown in their away game at Zagreb midweek, these losses aren&#x27;t huge for them. Betis are undefeated away this season, also enjoying drawing games. They&#x27;re 2-5-0 away this season in La Liga, and have a goal difference of +3. Betis have been flying recently, getting a great away win 1-3 at Zagreb midweek, and coming off of a nice La Liga form besides the crazy 3-5 loss against Barcelona.

**Long story short**: I think Betis win this game, but given both of these teams love a draw, I want the safety of the DnB.

Write-up: Absolutely wretched form continues with yet another loss. It’s so frustrating because quite literally everything indicates the play will win yet it’s simply not happening (yes I realise that’s what betting is all about). Carvalho didn’t even shoot in an awful showing by Estoril who lost 4-0, meanwhile the left winger had 3 SOT’s. To make matters worse he was hooked off in the 63rd minute to mark his first substitution since August. The fact my plays are purely statistically driven makes it easy for me to keep posting but it sure is infuriating which I really hope to turn around. I’ve turned to the dark side with a parlay, if done right they can be profitable.

Leg 1 - Liam Thompson 1+ tackle vs Sheffield Wednesday (@1.33)

Thompson missed over 2 months of football with a knee injury and has been eased back into the lineup. He is predicted to start (and should be playing most of the match after he managed to play 85” last game). In his short season he’s averaged 1.25 tackles per game, clearing the line in all four games. If we go back to his last 18 Championship matches which is a more accurate representation of what to expect he’s covered the line in 18/18, averaging 1.47 tackles per match and clearing the line in 10/11 away matches. Sheffield United allow 3.4% more tackles than league average and players playing in Thompson’s position have averaged 1.8 tackles per game at the Hillsborough (covering in 9/10).

Leg 2 - Jesus Ramirez 1+ SOT vs Tondela (@1.50)

Ramirez is leading the line for Nacional and has averaged 1.54 shots on target this season, hitting one in 11/13 (85%, failing vs giants Porto and Sporting) and in his last 8 matches. When playing at home, he averages 1.67 and has cleared the line in 5/6 this season. Tondela allow 41% more SOTs (5.9) than league average which is a lot and a huge boost to Jesus’ chances of shooting on target as he is their focal point of attack scoring 7 of their 12 goals and representing 47% of the team’s shots on goal this season. Tondela has conceded 1.29 shots on target to strikers away from home, the line having been covered in 5/7.

Note: on the off-chance that Thompson and Ramirez don’t start, choose a book that voids the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. It could save you a lot of money. BOL !

A lot of posts in here already on Achane. Surprisingly he hasn’t been as involved in the passing game for the last couple of games. I think that turns around tonight. The colder weather makes me think we get more short throws this week for Tua, which is right in Achane’s area of the field. And it seems like he’s guaranteed for a big breakout run. And of course, TJ Watt being out is a big deal for Pittsburgh’s defense. The total is at 42.5 right now, but I could see it being a bit higher than that.

UNIREA SLOBOZIA VS FCSB

Date: 15 DECEMBER 2025 at 19:30

BET ON: Over / Under team corners- FCSB Over +5.50

Odd: 1.83

ROMANIA

\- FCSB look well positioned to cover over 5.5 corners given the tactical and psychological contrast between the two sides. Boosted by an extraordinary Europa League comeback against Feyenoord, Elias Charalambous and Mihai Pintilii are expected to set FCSB up aggressively, pushing their full-backs high and sustaining pressure in the final third to capitalise on their momentum and close the gap to the play-off places. Despite ongoing injury concerns — with Bîrligea, Alibec and Dawa not fully fit and AFCON absences forcing defensive reshuffles — FCSB still rank first in the league for total shots, underlining their volume-based attacking approach that naturally generates corners. Olaru’s return further increases ball circulation and wing dominance, while Unirea Slobozia arrive in a deep crisis, eight straight defeats, a struggling goalkeeper situation with Rusu still injured, and a clear mental block admitted by coach Jean Vlădoiu. Expect the hosts to defend very deep in a low block to stop the bleeding, inviting sustained FCSB pressure, repeated wide deliveries and recycled attacks — a game state that strongly favours FCSB consistently winning corners and clearing the +5.5 line.</td></tr>

Write up: I have finally hit a little cold streak here. Unfortunately, I think Maye would&#x27;ve cashed for us if Henderson didn&#x27;t break those two long runs. Shai two nights ago sat the first 6 minutes of the 4th quarter when he only needed 7 more points for the cash. It&#x27;s a part of the game, key thing here is to stick with the model, and keep going... loses are going to happen, but it&#x27;s the long game that we want! Let&#x27;s get back on track here with our boy Achane.

• ⁠Model has this hitting at a nice 59% on the dot

• ⁠Model likes the under in the game, which shadows the slow pace, rushing heavy offense

• Model shows that Miami may elect to run the ball on some fourth downs instead of kicking FG&#x27;s because of the weather in Pittsburgh which should give Achane a few more opportunities 

Need to see one go through the basket, so let&#x27;s roll Achane. Good luck, and again, tail with some caution, the model has hit a small cold streak - will be diving into the model to tweak some things during the game tomorrow - may be going back to the 2-leg parlays that were money for us and put more of a heavier focus on those moving forward.

It is an early game that starts in some 5 hours, so I have to write it now. I stumbled upon this competition yesterday. I have no idea why they play it now, especially when competitions are still being played in their leagues, thus going for other sports too.

I already played the Philippines against Malaysia in the first round. They won by 25 and barely covered the spread by 1 one point, but they did it. Now Malaysia already played the first round game with Vietnam, they won 89-63.

So Malaysia entered the game with the Philippines with some boosted confidence with this big win behind them, and the Philippines just got to Thailand, still adjusting.

And they won easily by 25. And now they face a team that lost by 26 to the team they have beaten.

I know this is an oversimplification, but sometimes you don&#x27;t need to analyze stuff too hard.

This spread seems to be set too low, I would think twice if it was between 45-50, but this looks really doable. 1.5 units on this one.</td></tr>

Event: Kings @ Stars (NHL) (7pm central)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: SGP Kings +1.5/Under 5.5 goals (+140) (1U)

Write up:

Under 5.5:

The stars are coming off two losses in a row in which they lost 4-0 and 5-2. However 3 of those 9 goals allowed were empty netters. I believe back at home in Dallas the stars will look to get back to their old ways and that requires locking down on defense. However over their last 3 games the stars haven’t crossed the 20 mark on shots on goal. The kings are coming into town riding a two game losing streak themselves allowing 5 total goals over that span. This matchup sets up beautifully for an under. Over their last 10 games, the kings have the 6th worst goals scored per 60 mins at only 1.94 and the stars are a little bit better at 2.34 goals for per 60, however whe we dig deeper the stars have the 3rd worst expected goals for per 60 over this same period. The kings are 1st in the nhl over this last 10 game period allowing just .97 goals for per 60! While the stars are worse but still only allowing 2.2 goals for per 60 over this same period. The expected stats remain the same there as the kings are performing exactly how they should on defense which goes to show this defense is legit! Both teams are bottom 5 in the NHL in shots on goal over their last 10 and both are middle of the pack at 13th and 15th in shots on goal allowed. As far as high danger shots allowed, the kings are on fire allowing just 10 high danger shots on goal over their last 10 while the stars have allowed 21 which is double the kings number but still the 8th best mark in hockey over their last 10 games. (I like to use 10 game span because in long seasons like this it is best to go off how teams are playing at the moment). 


Kings +1.5:

As I mentioned that the stars have averaged 2.34 goals for per 60 which is good for 15th best in the league so just mediocre in their last 10 but are really expected to score the 3rd worst mark in the league. This is due to the fact that the stars haven’t put up a lot of shots on goal recently (worst in the entire league in their last 10 games) and yes they have been shooting well (10th best in the league in shots on goal shooting percentage) this will be SIGNIFICANTLY harder against a kings team with the number 1 save percentage on shots on goal over their last 10 at a staggering 96%! In a game in which I expect to be low scoring already, I think that’s the kings +1.5 bolsters our payout but on top of that I wouldn’t be surprised at all if the kings come out of here with a win. After all these same two teams met on October 23rd in Dallas and the kings won 3-2. And the stars are in a bit more of a slump now than they were then. 

Let’s get back to our winning ways. As always, cheers 🍻</td></tr>

__Event:__ NFL: Dolphins @ Steelers 8:15pm EST

__POTD:__ De’Von Achane o78.5 rushing yards (-110), 4.12u to win 3.75u

__Write Up:__ The (6-7) Miami Dolphins are traveling to Pittsburgh to take on the (7-6) Steelers on Monday Night Football in an AFC matchup. The AFC North leading Steelers started the season off 4-1 and looked like one of the AFC’s top contenders. But then they went on to lose 5 of their next 7 games, with some fans calling for head coach Mike Tomlin’s head. He responded last week with a huge 27-22 road win over the Ravens that gave the Steelers a 1 game lead in their division. Steelers QB Aaron Rodgers threw for a season high 284 yards &amp; a TD, with 5 completions of 25+ yards. __Bad news struck the Steelers this week though as they will be without their star player on defense, 7 time Pro Bowl linebacker T.J. Watt, after he underwent surgery to repair a collapsed lung this week.__ This is a huge game for Pittsburgh, with a win they have a 72% chance to make playoffs, but a loss knocks them down to 54%. They’ll have their hands full with a team that is coming in hot. Miami fell to 2-7 after a 28-6 loss to the Ravens in Week 9, &amp; it looked like not only was their season done, but also their time with head coach Mike McDaniel &amp; QB Tua Turnindaballova. Both were on the hot seat. The Dolphins responded with a stunning 30-13 win over the Super Bowl contending Bills in Week 10. They’re now on a 4 game win streak &amp; have a tiny chance at making playoffs. Miami&#x27;s win streak is the franchise&#x27;s longest since 2022. Their success has came from an elite running back that hasn’t been able to be stopped.

Mike McDaniel found the recipe for success for the Dolphins: De’Von Achane. __The Dolphins are 5-1 this season when De’Von Achane runs for at least 85 yards. They are 1-6 when he rushes for fewer than 85 yards.__ So McDaniel has continued to feed the hell out of him &amp; tge entire offense’s focus has been shifted to the run. This focus on the run was evident in last week’s 34-10 win vs the Jets, where Miami rushed for season highs of 239 yards &amp; 3 TD’s on 41 carries. Look at the differences between their rushing in recent games vs earlier season games.

Weeks 1-9: 21.9 carries per game, 97.2 rushing yards per game, 4.44 yards per carry, 35.6 rush success rate, 4 rushing TD’s, 2-7 record

Weeks 10-14: 34 carries per game, 192.3 rushing yards per game, 5.65 yards per carry, 48.4% run success rate, 7 rushing td’s, 4-0 team record 

__The Dolphins 48.4% rushing success rate over the last 4 games is higher than any team’s season long success rate, run or pass. Dolphins have run for at least 160 each of past 4 games (first time since 1977).__ That success stems from Achane being a cheat code on the field. He is one of the most explosive backs in the league. __Achane has ran for 92+ yards in 4 straight games, including 120+ in three of those. Since Week 9, Achane leads the NFL with 147 scrimmage yards per game. Achane ranks 1st in the league with 5.8 yards per carry &amp; 4.4 yards after contact. With his recent surge, Achane achieved his first 1,000 yard rushing season &amp; has averaged 5.68 yards per carry over his 41 career games. The only player with a higher rushing average through 41 games is Lamar Jackson (5.81, minimum 10 rushes per game). Over his last 4 games he has rushed for 7.2 yards per carry. He has a run of 10 or more yards on 18.1% of his attempts. No back with as many runs as he has a higher rate. Miami has 32 runs of 10 or more yards since Week 8, the most in the league.__ Now he faces a Steelers defense that has had issues with explosive backs lately. Pittsburgh allowed Chase Brown to average 9.8 &amp; 5.5 yards per carry in his 2 games, Kimani Vidal to rush for 95 yards &amp; a TD, James Cook &amp; Ray Davis to combine for 206 rushing yards in Week 13, &amp; Derrick Henry &amp; Keaton Mitchell to combine for 172 yards on Sunday. They have been a run funnel defense doing well vs the pass. __Pittsburgh has not allowed an opposing passer to reach 7.0 yards per pass attempt in a game since Week 8. Which fits the Dolphins run scheme well since Tua has thrown the ball 26 times or less in 6 of his last 7 games. Only 48.7% of Miami&#x27;s yardage over their last 5 games has been via passing, the only team below 50% over that span.__ Also the weather is a huge factor in this one. The Dolphins have historically had trouble playing in the cold &amp; the kickoff temperature on Monday is forecasted to be below 20 degrees Fahrenheit. Dating back to 2016, Miami is 0-13 when the kickoff temperature is below 40 degrees (including postseason). Tua is specifically bad. He is 0-5 in his NFL career when the kickoff temp is below 40 degrees. He has 6 TD passes &amp; 5 INT’s in those games with a passer rating of just 78.8. The Dolphins lost those games by an average of 19.2 points. It also helps that the Steelers have allowed opponents to run 69 plays per game, most in the league. This should provide plenty of opportunities for Achane. In the Week 14 win over the Jets, Achane suffered a rib injury and did not return. Dolphins OC Frank Smith said De&#x27;Von Achane &quot;looked great&quot; in practice &amp; nothing should hold him back this week. Achane was taken off the injury report &amp; was deemed a full go this week. On top of TJ Watt, Steelers could also be without 1st round rookie DT Derrick Harmon who has missed the last 2 games with a knee injury &amp; is questionable for Monday night. Also the Dolphins defense has stepped up lately. Miami has allowed 1.59 points per drive over their past 8 games, 4th in the league. They could keep this one competitive. Regardless of the score, the Dolphins are going to feed Achane as he is their whole offense.

Dolphins record this season when they throw 30+ times, 0-7. Dolphins record this season when they run 30+ times, 6-0. Tua Turnindaballova is bad. Achane is good. TJ Watt is out for the Steelers defense. All signs point to Dolphins feeding Achane.

**Write Up:** Back in the green yesterday with Haaland scoring 2 goals and cashing us in the 89th minute. Bit of a sweat, but the game played out more or less as expected and the big Norwegian came through for us again. Great way to end the weekend! 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> we head north to Manchester as 8th place Man U host 15th place Bournemouth. The middle of the table is jam packed this year, as only 5 points separate these teams. A win for Man U puts them back in the top 5 and a win for Bournemouth puts them up to 11th. Man United have really turned it on over the last few weeks, they&#x27;ve only lost once in their last 9 matches, going 5-3-1 in that stretch. Bournemouth are trending the opposite direction, winless in their last 6 going 0-2-4. I&#x27;m expecting Man United to control possession here, take a lot of shots, and score a lot of goals.

Bruno Fernandes is the captain for Man U, takes their penalties, takes their free kicks, and takes corners from the left side. He&#x27;s their playmaker. He leads the PL in assists this season with 6. He has really turned it on over the last few games, with 5 goals/assists in his last 3 matches and 7 in his last 6. The fact that this is even money with his (and his team&#x27;s) current form seems like a steal to me. 

Bournemouth as I mentioned is in poor form all around, but especially defensively. They have conceded at least 3 goals in each of their last 4 away matches to Sunderland, Villa, City, and Palace. Yes, you read that right. I like Man United to continue that unfortunate trend for Bournemouth here and think Bruno will be in the middle of the action as usual. 

BOL and I hope you all have a great start to the week!</td></tr>

🏒NHl, Senators at Jets, 12/15/25 Mon, 7:30 pm Eastern Time

Explanation: I favor Winnipeg because against the Senators, they have the advantage in the two areas that usually decide one-goal NHL games: 1) goaltending stability and 2) penalty-kill leverage.

Offensively, both teams are averaging 3.06 goals per game, but Ottawa has been weaker defensively (they’ve allowed 102 goals in 31 games, a -7 differential and a team .872 SV%) compared to Winnipeg sitting basically even in goals for/against (95–95) with a better team save profile.   The special-teams gap is where Winnipeg can really separate: Ottawa’s power play is strong (26.3%), but their penalty kill has been a major problem (69.8%), which is the kind of weakness that gets punished against a competent PP like Winnipeg’s (20.9%)—one or two extra conversions can flip a 3–3 type of game into a Jets win. 

In net, if the projected starters are Connor Hellebuyck vs Linus Ullmark, I think Winnipeg has the edge. Hellebuyck’s numbers are much stronger (.916 SV%, 2.41 GAA) than Ullmark’s this season (.877 SV%, 3.05 GAA)—and Winnipeg just got a great boost with Hellebuyck returning and looking sharp in a 5–1 win over Washington on Saturday. Conversely, Ottawa has dropped four of its last five (including a tough late loss to Minnesota), and the Jets’ path is pretty straightforward: play a disciplined game to reduce Ottawa’s PP impact, lean on the better goaltending, and let the Senators’ weak PK give Winnipeg the best chance to grab the “extra” goal that decides it.</td></tr>

EVENT: MAVS-KINGS 5:00 EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Kings +3.5 @ 1.91 (2 UNITS) (WINS 1.82)

REASONING: Been watching the kings play recently and I think this team is very underrated with their potential to make quick runs with how fast they play. Davis is listed as questionable so that should make somewhat of a difference if he doesn’t play. As well as a few others on the Mavs.  Kings squad does have multiple injuries as well however their current squad is adjusted to this and playing great without them. I think Sacramentos pace can take them to the finish line and secure an easy win or cover the spread <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.

Last Pick: Trae Young o8.5 ast vs MIA, Deni Avdija o5.5 ast v LAC, -130 on DK at time of writeup, betting 2.5u ❌

I don&#x27;t even know what to say. Trae had one assist in H1. I was watching the game, he just decided not to be the primary facilitator on offense. He was a hot <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> in this thread, and completely sold. Deni had 9 assists and continues to ball. Let&#x27;s get these last lost days back with an NFL smash spot.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: HOU +8.5 v LAC, Derrick Henry o49.5 ru yd v GB, -152 on DK at time of writeup, 5u MAX BET

Time for the second max bet of my career. If this misses, I&#x27;ll be shocked. Let&#x27;s start with HOU. I would make HOU a favorite in this game if I&#x27;m being honest. I am not a believer in LAC. Everyone knows their offensive line sucks, and their defense is solid. They are 27th in red zone TD rate. They are 4th best in red zone TD rate allowed. They are 17th in EPA per pass, and 17th in EPA per rush. They allow the 6th most sacks. HOU gets the 7th most sacks. Herbert will definitely be dropped multiple times in this game. HOU has by far the best EPA per pass allowed in the league. They are a modest 14th in EPA per rush. LAC will likely rely on their rushing attack to generate offense in this game. When LAC played a similar defense in JAX (4th in EPA per pass allowed, 11th in EPA per rush), they lost 35-6. LAC is not built to have a sustained passing attack, under 210 passing yards for Herbert in 4 of last 5 (clearing against DAL who is ass). I agree with the guy who said Herbert under passing yards. Although LAC might be able to build something on the ground, which can include Herbert scrambling, HOU will absolutely shut down their passing attack and create many sacks. HOU has great form, and although they&#x27;ve allowed 21 and 20 points to LV and ARI, their defense still is top 2 in the league and shows up against big teams. HOU on offense is not the best, 14th in EPA per pass and 30th in EPA per rush. Trent Brown is out which is obviously a big problem, but LAC is missing Denzel Perryman on defense, which is an equally important loss. HOU struggles when opponent gets pressure, but they have put up 20+ points in the past 5 games. HOU has covered +8.5 in every game this year. LAC&#x27;s home field advantage is non existent. HOU clinches playoffs with a win. I&#x27;m tempted to go HOU ML, but to go safe, I&#x27;ll take the alt spread 1.5 points above the key touchdown number (since the math can get a bit funky considering how many FGs HOU kicks, I want to be safe if LAC has 2 TDs that outscore HOU 2 FGs) and trust HOU&#x27;s defense to keep the game within a TD if they lose.

I went back and forth a bit on how to play this BAL/GB game since there&#x27;s a lot of angles I like. I liked an alt total under, I liked BAL +10.5, but ultimately, I think this is the safest play. It&#x27;s no secret that BAL will be a run heavy team in this game. Huntley is the QB. Now, GB does have a solid run defense, 7th in EPA per rush allowed, 9th in rush yards allowed. This is an entirely gamescript <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. Henry scored 2 TDs against NE last week, then they did not give him the ball in the last like 11 min after he scored the 2nd TD. Everyone knows this is an idiotic decision, including BAL coaches. Now, BAL is fighting for their playoff lives. They have to win this game. Derrick Henry is their best player, and they are going to give him the ball. He has 60+ yards in every game since week 5. CHI dropped a modest 108 yards on 22 carries between Swift/Monangai. RJ Harvey had 65 on 16, Swift/Monangai had 120 on 27 in the first meeting, Gibbs had 68 on 20, Jones/Mason had 83 on 17, Tyrone Tracy had 88 on 19, etc. This is a solid GB rush defense, but they haven&#x27;t shown an ability to hold opponent lead backs to under 50. Huntley started week 8, Henry had 71 yards on 21 carries. 9 carries with Lamar, 9 carries with Huntley last week. They&#x27;re probably going to give him the ball 20+ times this game. Their offensive line is healthy. GB will expect run, but their typical defense is not stack the box, they do this at the 8th lowest rate in the league. The game is on the road and the weather is not notable. Henry averages 5 YPC this season. 15 carries at 5 YPC is 75 yards. All we need here is 50. BAL will lean on Derrick Henry in this game, and I see no path to him not achieving at least 50 rushing yards in this game.

**Game:** Houston Texans @ Los Angeles Chargers | Sat 12/27, 4:30 PM EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Houston Texans +1.5** (-110) | 1.5u

The Chargers offensive line is in shambles - Slater and Alt on IR, now Salyer ruled OUT. They&#x27;re starting Bobby Hart at left tackle against the NFL&#x27;s #1 pass rush. Herbert has been sacked 49 times this year and these same Texans picked him off 4 times in last year&#x27;s playoff beatdown (32-12).

Houston&#x27;s defense is elite - #1 in points allowed (16.6 PPG), #1 in yards allowed, and hasn&#x27;t given up 250 passing yards in a single game this season. Getting the hottest team in football (+7 straight wins) with points against a banged-up O-line.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: (NCAAF) North Texas Mean Green -6.5 vs San Diego State Aztecs (-132) (5:45 PM EST)**

Reasoning: New Mexico Bowl. Mean Green are 11-2 on the season. Against the spread they are 10-3 this season. All in which they were the favorites. The Aztecs are without starting QB Jayden Donegal. Bert Emmanuel Jr is making his first start this season for the Aztecs. North Texas average 44.8 points per game, which is best in the nation. They rank 3rd in passing yards per game and 43rd in rushing yards per game. On defense, the Mean Green gives up 24.9 points per game, 70th in the nation. They give up the 9th least passing yards per game and 127th in rushing yards allowed. North Texas will be without their head coach but their team is healthy and offense is elite regardless of who’s coaching. The Aztecs are without their defensive corrdinator and without their starting QB. Line movement is favoring the Mean Green as well. Let’s back the Mean Green to cover here

NBA | Pacers v Heat | 🏀  

Just can’t seem to go on a run 😂 Don’t know how Trae doesn’t get it done in this matchup but that’s how NBA has been for me this season unreal variance. Saw a lot of potentials but just wasn’t it..

Ware has been a beast whenever he’s seen decent minutes prolly one of the few positive things for Heat lately. In his last 5 games he’s recorded 34, 38, 47, 14 &amp; 29 PR, and with 25+ minutes he’s over in 14/17 games this season. 

Pacers being ranked top 10 in both rebounds and points allowed this season (8th most points in the RA) suggests Ware should eat here. We’ve seen centers doing work in this matchup lately 

Garza 19, Queen 27, Raynaud 21 &amp; Embiid 48 PR, Vucevic 24 etc.. 

Ware does all his work in the paint/RA where Pacers have been very soft and he has been a beast on the glass avg 10.9 RPG &amp; 17.4 rebound chances per game.

My bad for the late post, just landed off a flight not long ago. Hoping Ware continues to feast here like he has done with good minutes</td></tr>

**NCAAF - North Texas vs San Diego St**

Drew Mestemaker o280.5 PassY (-110) 1u

(Last play review at end of post)

Hope everyone had a wonderful Christmas, and a relaxing Boxing Day. My family celebrates together on the 26th more so than the 25th, so we took the day off yesterday.

Today is the Drew Mestemaker audition game in the New Mexico Bowl - anyone who has been following North Texas this year, knows that Drew has the arm &amp; the system to sling with the best of them. This is play 2 of 3 of this college football season that really stood out for me when the lines were released, because I expected this to be higher (Believe it or not).

He was expected to be one of the more prominent mid major players to sit during bowl season, but surprised everyone as he committed to the game. With a potential move to a big school on the horizon, <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> serves as a rare post season audition for the 19 year old freshman in a modern NIL era.

This line seems high, but for a guy of Drew’s ability, and a receiving corps that boasts **EIGHT different viable passing options**, this seems like the right fit for a game of this magnitude for both the school &amp; the player, especially if the game stays close.

The *roadblock* comes from the fact that San Diego State DO have a **very strong pass D**, but they also haven’t played a QB or offensive unit with the range and ability of Mestemaker yet this season. Contrarily as well: SD St are **missing their defensive coordinator, and their offensive unit are missing their top 3 players including their QB and WR1**. Staying on the field could be tough for SD St which could fall into our hands even if their defensive ability isn’t impacted.

The last few weeks has been Drew’s blossoming point: he’s **cleared this line in 6/8**, with one of the 2 games coming up short by 4 yards, and the other coming on a season low 18 standard drop backs. This season he’s **averaged 32 pass attempts** a game, &amp; <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> won’t be the day for North Texas to get away from what’s been working for them. It also helps that the total for this game is the highest on the day at 53.5, which shows the books aren’t scared for the top scoring offensive unit in the country to keep it going.

**Last play review:**

NBA - SAS @ OKC, Stephon Castle o23.5 PA (-110) 1u ✅

(Seemed like it was an easy cash, but it did get a little bit sweaty again as the 3rd went on… Castle finished 19 &amp; 7 with some efficiency, but his turnovers and poor passing at times could have cost us. Good for the Spurs though, 3 high leverage wins in a row over OKC anoints them, in my opinion, as title contenders)

*(Note: previously wanted to play Nico Collins 4 rec/50recY (+103) but I misread the line and wanted to thank u/Which_Marzipan_6178 who reached out to me to point out the inaccuracy, I apologize if any of you guys who tried to find the line or played it at a different price than I posted)*

**Odds:** 2.00 | +100 | 2 units to win 2

**Write up**: losing last 2 bets straight is not what i had on my christmas list. To break the L streak, ill go with what i think is the &#x27;safest&#x27; matchup of the night. I have done a writeup on these teams couple days ago. Thye just had different matchups (Chi against OTT and Stars against TOR couple days ago, both bets covered). Nothing reallly has changed for both of these teams. Bedard is still out and hawks are still garbage bad right now. The only guy that can somehow keep the game close is Knight, if he plays like a brick wall. I expect a similar game like hawks did against ottawa. Only this time, otter is projected to start in goal for the stars after a good xmas break. sometimes a matchup is exactly what it looks like on paper and this should be one of those times. stars are a legitimate cup contender playing at home where they are an absolute wagon (12-5-1). They will be more motivated by coming off an overtime loss to wings, and they are facing a blackhawks team that is frankly decimated. without Bedard, chicago isn&#x27;t just bad, they are historically bad offensively, averaging 1.6 goals per game in his absence. Their captain Foligno is out with inj too. They are on a six game losing streak. Dallas has beaten them by multiple goals in four straight meetings at the airlines center. Given that they possess the 2nd pp in the league and are facing a disciplined challenged chicago team, Robertson, Rantanen and the rest of the squad should have a field day. Ive crunched the Corsi numbers and analyzed the xGF splits too:

at 5 on 5, the possession metrics paint a dark picture for the hawks. their Corsi For percentage (CF%) hovers around 47.4%, indicating they are consistently out possessed. More concerning is their Expected Goals (xG) diff. chicago has generated 61.6 xGF while conceding 84.2 xGA at even strength. This -22.6 differential is among the worst in the league. dallas maintains a positive goal differential and possesses the puck management skills to dominate zone time. I expect stars to control the pace and the game by a lot, forcing chicago to defend for extended shifts, which leads to fatigue and, inevitably, defensive breakdowns.

Mikko Rantanen: 51 points in 37 games (1.38 points per game).   

Trend: 9 points in his last 5 games.   

Matchup logic: Rantanen is too big and too skilled for hawks current defensive pairings. He dominates possession along the boards. I expect him to have a multi point night.

Galatasaray - Trabzonspor 🏀 Türkiye Basketbol Süper Ligi UTC: 17.30

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **Trabzonspor** \+6.5 @ 1.80 

**Writeup**: According to the betting companies, Galatasaray is a heavy favorite (1.35), but I think an odds around 1.60-1.65 would be more reasonable. Trabzonspor is not coming here from an ordinary defeat, but from a magnificent victory against the league&#x27;s giant, Fenerbahçe Beko, by scoring 99 points. The chemistry in the team is established, their hands are warm and their offensive rhythm is at the top of the league. Galatasaray, on the other hand, lost against Anadolu Efes in its last match and is experiencing in-game breaks. Both teams are at 7-5 after 12 matches and are very close to each other in the rankings. In these types of matches, the &quot;home team = easy win&quot; scenario is not automatically correct when the line reaches 6-7 points. Trabzonspor&#x27;s offensive engine is Marcquise Reed: he carries the burden of both scoring and directing the game (he has an average of 22.92 points + 5.75 assists). I accept Galatasaray&#x27;s home advantage in this match, but the balance of power of the two teams + Trabzon&#x27;s ability to direct the game through Reed + Galatasaray&#x27;s tendency to give the opponent a 3-point window keeps the possibility of the match remaining in single digits strong. That&#x27;s why Trabzonspor +6.5 is a reasonable value attempt.</td></tr>

BTTS @ 1.82 (1u)

Writeup : Sorry for the delay, I had been on a trip &amp; had missed posting. Just got some time before the match starts.

Catanzaro come into this match as slight favorites and their recent results justify that, as they have won 7/9 last matches. However, defensive consistency has been an issue. They’ve conceded in 9 of their last 11 matches, including 7 of the last 9 at home.

Cesena arrive in strong overall form and are proving very difficult to beat. They’ve lost just 2 of their last 10 matches, and their attacking reliability stands out, scoring in 15 of 17 matches this season, including 7 of 9 away. Defensively, though, they also show clear weaknesses, having conceded in 8 of their last 9 away matches.

Think the BTTS is a decent shout &amp; expect to see goals in both ends.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>TODAY</mark>&#x27;S <mark style='background:#fff59d'>PICK</mark>:** Baskonia -9,5 vs. San Pablo Burgos (ACB)

**ODDS:** 1.74 / -135

# Reasoning:

This <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> is based on structural trends and measurable performance gaps rather than narrative or subjective motivation.

For context, in the ACB the **Copa del Rey** is played by the **top 8 teams after the first 17 games** of the regular season. Baskonia currently sit in that **5th–8th range**, meaning they are in a direct fight to secure a Copa spot. At this stage of the season, games at home against bottom-tier opponents are especially important, because dropping them can immediately push a team out of the top eight.

Looking at league-wide trends, teams ranked between **5th and 8th** playing **at home** against teams ranked **14th or lower** win roughly **76% of the time**, with an **average winning margin of about +11.8 points**. This shows that spreads around double digits in this matchup profile are not inflated by the market, but reflect how these games typically play out over 40 minutes. With the line set at **-9.5**, the spread is actually below the historical average margin for this exact scenario.

Defensively, the gap between these two teams is clear and quantifiable. Baskonia allow approximately **88.9 points per game**, close to league average, while San Pablo Burgos are conceding **96.8 points per game**, the **second-worst defensive mark in the ACB**. That means Burgos are giving up more than **eight points per game above league average**, a deficit that consistently leads to lopsided results when they face teams with above-average offensive talent, particularly away from home.

Depth is another major separator and one that shows up clearly in the numbers. Baskonia regularly use **nine to ten players** for double-digit minutes, with their bench contributing around **32 points per game**. Burgos, by contrast, rely heavily on a **seven-man rotation** and generate only about **21 points per game from their bench**. That’s an **eleven-point gap in second-unit production**, which becomes critical in games where runs and momentum swings are common.

This difference in depth is reflected even more strongly in second-half performance. Burgos away from home are outscored by an average of **4.1 points in the first half**, but that deficit expands to **9.3 points in the second half**. Baskonia, meanwhile, tend to **improve their margin at home by roughly 5.6 points after halftime**. That divergence suggests Burgos struggle to sustain defensive intensity and physical output over 40 minutes, while Baskonia are more likely to create separation as the game progresses.

From a matchup perspective, Baskonia play at a higher offensive tempo at home and are among the better transition-scoring teams in the league. Burgos have had ongoing issues with defensive balance, close-outs, and containing pace once games speed up. When forced to defend multiple possessions in quick succession, their short rotation and poor defensive metrics tend to show up quickly on the scoreboard.

Putting all of this together, the **-9.5 line at 1.74** aligns well with the underlying data. The historical margin for this matchup tier sits close to +12 points, Burgos’ defensive numbers are among the worst in the league, the bench differential alone approaches double digits, and second-half trends consistently favor Baskonia pulling away rather than managing a narrow lead. This isn’t a play built on vague motivation, but on repeatable statistical patterns.

The main risk, as with any spread of this size, is late-game variance or an unusually hot shooting night from Burgos, particularly from three-point range. Outside of that scenario, the statistical profile supports Baskonia winning this game by a comfortable margin more often than not. Let&#x27;s try again, u/alex88-</td></tr>

Last pick: Lauri Markkanen Under 26.5 Points (-120) HR ❌

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the day</mark> : Evan Mobley Under 25.5 PRA (-110 HR)


Reason • 

Mobley just returned on Christmas Day from a left calf strain that was originally 
supposed to sideline him for 2–4 weeks. He returned earlier than expected (dumb move ) and was clearly on a short leash, playing only 25 minutes against the Knicks.
 The Logic: To clear a 26.5 PRA line, Mobley typically needs 32–34 minutes of action. In his return game, he shot an incredibly efficient 75% (6-of-8) and still only finished with 26 PRA (14 Pts, 9 Reb, 3 Ast), barely missing the under even with a perfect shooting night. <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> with a The Houston Rockets have transformed into one of the elite defensive units in the NBA this season. 
Top 3 Defense: Houston currently ranks 3rd in the NBA in Defensive Rating and 3rd in Opponent Points Allowed. They’re also are top-tier at defending the restricted area. Since Mobley scores the vast majority of his points in the paint, he’ll be fighting against Houston’s length and physicality all night. historical &amp; Performance Trends
 Previous Matchup: In their last meeting on November 19, Mobley played 36 minutes (much higher than he will play <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>) and recorded only 24 PRA (18 Pts, 6 Reb, 0 Ast).
 Efficiency Regression: As mentioned, he shot 75% in his last game. It is highly unlikely he maintains that efficiency against a Houston defense that ranks 10th in Opponent FG%, meaning his scoring total is likely to drop even further <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.</td></tr>

Start Time &amp; TV 11:00am &amp; 2:15pm EST (ESPN)

Units: 4 Units

Reasoning: For this Saturday bowl game slate well be going with the Pittsburgh Panthers over the East Carolina Pirates in the Military Bowl and the Army Black Knoghts over the Connecticut Huskies in the Fenway Bowl. I like riding with these two teams as both of their opponents have very notable opt outs and injuries with both East Carolina and Connecticut playing without their starting quarterbacks so I see these two teams struggling mightily without their starting signal callers suiting up for these bowl games. East Carolina will be without their starting runningback, London Montgomery, wide receiver Yannick Smith, tight end Jayvontay Conner, starting left tackle Jimarion McCrimon and most importantly quarterback Katin Housee so with all of these missing pieces on offense I dont see them being able to move the ball on this Pittsburgh defense that is 8th in the nation in rush defense and allowing less than 25 points per game so I see the Panthers running away with this one. Connecticut is also getting killed by opt outs in this one as they will be without starting left tackle Ben Murawski, starting right tackle, Cartsen Casady, starting right guard, Brady Wayburn, starting tight end Juice Vereen, starting cornerback Cam Chadwick, starting linebacker Oumar Diomande, starting defensive lineman Vincent Carroll-Jackson and most importantly quarterback Joe Fagnano. Army on the other hand does not have a single player opting out or in the transfer portal so I see the continuity of this team being a big plus for Army in this one. As we all know Army runs the ball more than anyone in the nation being a service academy that runs the triple option and this Huskies defense is quite terrible against the run ranking 115th in the nation in yards allowed on the ground per game allowing almost 200 rush yards per game so I see the Black Knights gashing the Huskies on the ground in this one. With all of this into consideration I do not a path to where Pittsburgh and Army lose in their bowl games.

**Write up:**

**The <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>:**  
This game lands in a **Balanced Neutral** profile — the type where neither side dominates enough to keep a clean sheet. Carrarese have slight home momentum, but Mantova typically **find ways to score**, even when they don’t control the game.

The data suggests:

* **BTTS hits in 6 of 8** in this odds structure
* **Early goals are frequent** (HT Over 0.5 in 8/8)
* Score patterns sit around **1–1 / 2–1**, ideal for BTTS

Even though total goals are often tight in Serie B, this matchup is wide open enough for both sides to break through. At **1.70**, the price is fair value for a game that projects **chances on both ends** rather than a defensive lock.  
  
**My Model in general:**  
My model is built around the idea that matches follow **recurring patterns**, not randomness.  
Instead of predicting games in isolation, it groups matches by **odds profiles** and studies what *actually* happens when similar games are played.

By clustering historical matches with the same **home–draw–away odds**, I track how games usually unfold — goals, BTTS, scorelines, and game flow. From there, the model identifies **motives**: situations where teams are more likely to attack, trade goals, or avoid clean sheets.

Every <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> comes from **data-backed profiles, not opinions** — combining odds structure, score patterns, and streak behavior to find spots where the market regularly repeats itself.

Previous: Shocking performance from so many of the Hull players.  I really hate when players take it easy and try to play sexy when playing weaker teams, only to get bitten in the ass which is what happened.  McBurnie had some good chances, but I think the guy should retire.  All Hull players looked dead, I feel their minds are already in Dubai.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s Writeup: Alright let&#x27;s head to the Scottish Premiership.  Hearts are top of the table this season and have only lost one game all season to Aberdeen, an outlier in my thoughts.  They have beaten both Rangers and Celtic, both away as well: 1-2 at Celtic and a cleansheet 0-2 at Rangers.   They average about 6.5 shots on target in away matches, and have scored in every match this season bar Aberdeen and Motherwell.  In their last 4 matches they have scored 7 goals so they are not goal shy.  Hibs on the other hand are sitting at 5th and have only won 3 out of their 8 home matches this season.  They can score, but coming up against better opposition they dont fare well.  For this reason I am going with the Hearts DC play.  

I will also go with total under 7.5 cards:  This season Hibs have never had more than 3 cards ever in any of their games.  Their last 8 games they have had 1,3,2,2,1,2,1,1 cards for themselves.  Historically this game usually never sees more than 5 cards except for in May 2023, there were 10 yellows and one red, and 9 in 2022 which also had a red.  Let&#x27;s hope there&#x27;s no reds tomorrow.

12/27/2026 5:00pm PST / NFL / Baltimore Ravens @ Green Bay Packers

Narrative: Ravens in a must win scenario, eliminated from playoff contention with a loss here. The line doesn’t reflect this because Green Bay technically could get home field advantage in the playoffs if they win their next 2 games and a few other outcomes occur. Both teams expected to start their backup QBs, although Raven’s star QB Lamar Jackson is not ruled out just yet. Regardless if Lamar plays, Willis, Packer’s back up did not practice a couple of days ago due to illness and is dealing with a hurt throwing shoulder from an injury last week (Dec 20). Along with that, Josh Jacobs, Packer’s star RB has been playing on an injured knee and was just upgraded to active for tomorrow. With the playoffs just weeks away, surely they won’t give Jacobs a huge work load, thus putting pressure on Willis’ hurt throwing arm to do more work. Ravens probably win out right here, but I’ll take the +3.5 just in case. GG!</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>**: O2.5 Goals + BTTS-YES (+105) 2u ✅

**Write up**:

Finally back to the Premier League with what&#x27;s going to be a very good game. This has hit for Chelsea in 3/5 of their last games and 16/25 matches this season. Given Chelsea aren&#x27;t the greatest at home this season in the Prem (being 4-2-2, 13th in the league) I can see them wanting a statement game against Villa, especially with Palmer being back to action. They average 1.5 goals per match at home, and allow just short of 1. Only finding 1 win in their last 5 league games, they really need to secure some points to keep their top 4 hopes alive. 

Villa on the other hand have been incredible this year. Being 4-2-2 away from home, and averaging 1.5 goals per match away while conceding 1.38. This looks great for the bet we have <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. This line has hit in 6/7 of their last away matches across all comps. Most notable in a 2-3 victory over West Ham in their last away match. 

To be completely honest, the reasoning behind this bet is quite simple: both team will indeed score and one of them is leaving with 3 points. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised with a 2-2 but the quality of these teams just screams 2-1 either way to me. Sad I couldn&#x27;t bet the City -1 because that was going to be my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> but we&#x27;ve been cashing with the Villa bets recently.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: 2 Units Cooper Flagg over 34.5 PRA $1.86** 

I like to do writeups when I place a bet and thought why not share them, so due to that I will most likely not respond.

Cooper Flagg at 34.5 PRA is most likely a pricing error which is true as 365 has him at 36.5 PRA the reasoning is Keegan Murray is out. Keegan Murray is the only player the Kings refuse to trade and is currently the face of the kings franchise and is one of the best wing defenders, Keegan has held Bam to low points, held KD to 8-21 from the field, in other words he is a very capable defender. The problem is he is injured, and Cooper flagg is 6,9 at SF and the kings roster has no one that can defend Washington at PF and Cooper Flagg at SF. Furthermore Kings are ranked 11th in Pace and Dallas is ranked 6th in Pace. The real beauty is the Kings being 27th in defensive rating allowing 119.4 PPG so it seems to me that this will be a fast paced game. Not too concerned for a blow out either as the spread is set at -2.5. Considering that Anthony Davis is out, I&#x27;m assuming Flagg will be more aggressive and have the green light to chuck up a fair few more shots then usual. We also saw how against Golden State when AD was injured he can take advantage of mismatches and make the right play. 

Personally I have put 2 units due to the fact that his line just seems wrong at 34.5 as it should be probably be more around 35-36.5, Additionally I would not take this if not this original line just due to how Cooper is a pretty bad FT shooter on the road currently. Feel free to say why you don&#x27;t like this bet either so I can improve as I go on.</td></tr>

Second-guessed my instincts last time so here&#x27;s my first-though best-thought <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, with the following support.

Murray has been on a heater in his last 10 games, averaging 29.6 ppg, **4.8 3PM and 52.7% 3P%**. He is over this line in 8 of L10, and one of those misses was due to limited minutes in a blowout against the Kings. 

Magic are right in the middle of the league (#16) in terms of 3PM given to opposing point guards, but are worse defensively without Wagner and Suggs, both still injured. And with undersized Wendell Carter guarding Jokic, ORL will be forced to double-team creating more kick-out threes. 

For Denver, With AG, Braun, and now Cam Johnson injured, Murray is taking on more of those shots. 

In their only prior matchup last week with nearly the same active players, Murray went 7/12 from three. I&#x27;m not expecting the same level of shooting here but given Murray&#x27;s confidence, shooting ability, this matchup, and his team&#x27;s need for him to put up points, getting to at least 3 3PM seems pretty reachable.</td></tr>

That’s a HUGE blow. Pitt will be without their “starting” RB due to injuries, that he’s been plagued with all season.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Aston Villa Double Chance vs Chelsea @ 1.99 odds (3u) ✅ 

Write Up:

Honestly, the odds on this game are actually disrespectful to Villa. They are literally on a winning streak the hottest team in the league right now and the bookies are still treating them like underdogs against a Chelsea side that has been super shaky at home. It is the perfect setup because Chelsea loves to push their defense way too high, which is exactly what Villa wants so they can feed Morgan Rogers and Watkins on the counter and just cook them with speed. Betting on the more disciplined team, with the better manager, in better form, getting 1.99 odds for a Double Chance on a team that hasn&#x27;t lost in two months is basically insane value that I can&#x27;t pass up.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Declan Rice 1+ SOT (+125) 1 unit to win 1.25 units

**Write Up:** That one hurt. Three of us here had the same read and, while I think it was a good read, United went full bus park as soon as they scored their first goal. Cunha had one more great chance but scuffed the open shot. Definitely getting cold as these mid season matches are proving to be volatile. 

But we keep trying. Declan Rice, my favorite Arsenal player to back, has all of the traits I look for in backing a player - he runs hard, crashes the box, likes to shoot from range, and chases everything. We&#x27;ve already cashed with Rice back in November at similar odds, and I really like him here again <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Arsenal are big favorites in this match, will have a lot of the ball, and will hopefully take a lot of shots. 

Rice has had 1+ SOT in 7 of his last 9 EPL matches. Interestingly enough the two he missed were both away matches. This line has cleared in 5/5 of his last home EPL matches (7/7 if you include Champion&#x27;s League and cup matches). He has been shooting more frequently lately, averaging over 2 shots per game. While he doesn&#x27;t take a high volume of shots, he has a high percentage of his shots that hit the target. 

I expect Brighton to have a tough time here. They are not a team that parks the bus well and they will feel they need to get some shots in to take something from this game. They will be open to the counter, which is another angle where Rice can hurt them.

* I&#x27;ve been absolutely rolling on darts this year. It feels like favourites get backed so much that the odds are always skewed and betting underdogs has made great money
* Now on to the matchup, in their one head-to-head matchup last year Plaissier actually won 6 sets to 5.
* This tourney, they have averaged almost identical average scores and 180&#x27;s thrown
* The biggest difference for me is Plaisier having about 50% checkout in his 2 matches while Ratajski was at 50% and 37%. If anything, Plaisier has been the better closer and I&#x27;d look at him to win this one

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Todays Pick</mark>**  Emanuel Wilson o30.5 rushing yards (-112 on DK) 1u to win 0.89u

**Writeup:** Love is confirmed out, Josh Jacob&#x27;s has been limited practice all week with some knee and ankle issues. It&#x27;s Emanuel Wilson time. Packers are still in the hunt for that 2nd seed, needing the bears to lose their next two and for Packers to win out. This week shouldn&#x27;t be a struggle assuming that Lamar isn&#x27;t in.

Wilson&#x27;s been crushing it when he needs to, getting 82 yards last week against the bears, and putting up over 100 yards against the Vikings when Jacob&#x27;s was out. His average is just below this line at 29.2 yards but I believe he&#x27;s going to get more carries. Again, Josh Jacob&#x27;s has been playing through injury and was less relied on in the 2nd half versus the bears. Meanwhile, Malik Wilis has been going through some shoulder issues. I&#x27;m sure he wouldn&#x27;t be playing if Clayton Tune wasn&#x27;t the backup, and if Clayton Tune is the one to start, he&#x27;ll be heavily relying on his rbs, ala Jacob&#x27;s n Wilson.

While the line is only sitting at -3.5 for the Packers, it&#x27;s a home game against a mediocre Ravens team with a backup qb. I expect a lot of rushing from both sides with Henry and Wilson being the stars. Can&#x27;t guarantee this game will be pretty both playoffs are on the line for the Ravens and 2nd seed is on the line for the Packers.

Explanation: I think Clemson can beat Penn State tomorrow because Clemson’s defense has been very solid not giving up a crazy amount of points, and they’ve been very good on stopping offenses on third down. Opposing offenses only convert on 3rd down 29% of the time, which is top 10 in all of college.

 Penn State’s defense has been much more vulnerable on 3rd down. They let their opponents convert 42% of the time.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: 🏈 Justin Herbert under 211.5 passing yards (-114). 

Game starts at 4:30pm EST. Bet 2.5u

Writeup: Betting on the first of the Saturday NFL games and taking Herbert under his passing prop. Frankly, I don’t understand this line at all to the point where I feel like Vegas knows something I don’t. Before looking at this line, I thought for sure this would be under 200 yards. In theory, I would put 5u or more on this, but we’ll lay down half of that for this one. Here’s the thought process.

The Chargers are coming into this one winning 4 of their last 5 and 7 of their last 8. They have already clinched a playoff spot and still have something to play for to improve their seeding. However, their one glaring weakness is their offensive line. With multiple starting tackles out due to injury, Justin Herbert is getting pressured at the 3rd highest rate in the league and has and has one of the lowest average times in the pocket before pressure in the league. Because of this, his top receiver has had under 45 yards in 5 straight games. 

Now let’s look at the opponent. The Houston Texans started off 0-3, but are since then 10-2 and are almost guaranteed a playoff spot. Much of their success has been due to their absolute shut-down defense, with their offense finally starting to string games together. Unfortunately for Justin Herbert, the Texans defense get pressures at top 5 rate in the league. 

We have also already seen this matchup in the playoffs last year. Herbert had no time in the pocket, was sacked 4 times, threw 4 interceptions, and lost 32-12. Herbert did get over 211.5 yards in this game, but this was largely due to game script and having 2 deep bombs to a wide receiver. Besides this, Herbert had nothing.

With a low over/under of 39.5 and the Chargers still being slightly favored at home, I expect the Chargers to want to establish their run game against a Texans defense that will make Herbert’s life a living hell. This could get really ugly for Herbert, and I don’t see him getting over 212 passing yards in this one.

Remember to only bet what you can afford to lose, and BOL!</td></tr>

**Event:** AFCON, Benin v Botswana, 7:30 am EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Botswana Win or Draw + Under 3.5 goals +130, 4 units

**Write Up:** While Benin come into this group stage game as the more established side on paper, I think there are very real reasons to believe Botswana can spoil the party and win, **or at least take a point** from <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>&#x27;s matchup. This is the first competitive meeting between the two nations, which immediately removes the usual head-to-head bias that often favors the bigger name. With no historical dominance to lean on, the game becomes far more about current form, match context, and tactical execution, which are all areas where Botswana quietly actually make a strong case.

Botswana’s opening match result might not look encouraging at first glance, but context matters. Against tournament powerhouse Senegal, Botswana were under heavy fire for long periods at a time, yet still showed remarkable defensive resilience and structure. Their goalkeeper, **Goitseone Phoko,** delivered one of the standout individual performances of the tournament so far, notching up an astonishing **14 saves,** the highest tally recorded in a single AFCON match this edition. That performance alone suggests Botswana are capable of frustrating opponents who struggle to convert possession into goals. And here&#x27;s where Benin&#x27;s attacking struggles come into play, really making this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> stand out to me.

Benin head to this fixture with **serious attacking concerns**. They&#x27;ve failed to score in **three consecutive matches** across all competitions and have looked anything but decisive in the final third. Even against weaker opposition, Benin have struggled to create clear scoring opportunities, often relying on hopeful crosses or isolated moments of brilliance rather than continuous structured attacking pressure or counter-pressing. Against a disciplined **Botswana side likely to sit deep and protect the box,** that lack of incision could once again be exposed.

From a tactical standpoint, Botswana are expected to remain compact, prioritize defensive shape, invite pressure, all the while looking to exploit transitions with their quick runners, as well as utilizing set pieces. This feels exactly like the type of game that tends to unsettle Benin, a team struggling with breaking down low blocks. Players such as **Thabang Sesinyi** and **Tumisang Orebonye** offer physicality and directness with their insane running capabilities, giving Botswana an outlet when they regain possession, but they&#x27;re also intelligent at covering the space, ensuring no holes are left between the thirds of the pitch that could be exploited by Benin&#x27;s attack.

Crucially, the **pressure is entirely on Benin**. After a disappointing start to the group, anything less than a win would be viewed as a catastrophic failure, and that expectation can quickly turn into impatience. Botswana, by contrast, have nothing to lose here. Given Benin’s scoring drought, Botswana’s defensive prowess and the psychological dynamics of a must-win AFCON group match, backing **Botswana to win or draw** feels like a well-reasoned value play. In a tournament defined by fine margins, Botswana have more than enough to stay competitive and possibly spring a surprise. Just like yesterday, I&#x27;m also sprinkling an Under 3.5 goals on this play *(feeling a cagey 0-0 or 1-1 draw here)* to make the odds even greater (coincidentally the same as yesterday - surely all the signs are there?). After another lengthy research I feel confident of going in with 4 whole units. BOL and let&#x27;s get a winning streak going ☘️</td></tr>

This is a repeat of the disastrous playoff game that Herbert had last year where he threw 4 INTs. I’m sure that’s on his mind, but he’s going to have to take some risks in this game that matters quite a bit for both teams. There is a huge mismatch here between the Chargers O-Line and the Texans D-Line that’s going to put Herbert in some tough spots.

Starting with Herbert, before his last game against Dallas’s “defense”, he had interceptions in his previous 4 games and he has thrown a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> in 10 out of 15 games this season.

Odds: 1.75 (7/4)

Write-up:
This matchup profiles strongly for Both Teams To Score based on consistent attacking output and defensive concessions from both sides. Chelsea are averaging 2.1 goals for (GF) per game while conceding 1.1 goals against (GA), underlining a side that scores reliably but rarely keeps opponents quiet. Aston Villa show a near-identical profile at 2.0 GF and 1.1 GA, and their recent form run has been driven by attacking efficiency rather than defensive control. From a matchup perspective, both teams generate high-quality chances and are comfortable committing numbers forward, which often leads to open game states. Recent head-to-head meetings support this angle as well, with scorelines such as 2-2, 2-1, and 3-0 frequently seeing both sides find the net. With both teams averaging over a goal conceded per match and possessing the attacking quality to capitalise, BTTS Yes at 1.75 represents strong value relative to the underlying numbers rather than a narrative-based play.</td></tr>

Write Up: Feeling really good on this one, the model has this game ending 82-72 (154). I understand why the books have the line at 165.5 because CSUN plays fast (11th in tempo) and Stanford also plays relatively quick (top 100). The fact is that CSUN is a very bad shooting team, especially from 3 where they rank 271st in 3pt FG%. Stanford should have total control over this game. The fast tempo of this game will be slowed down because Stanford should consistently have a lead around 10 forcing them to slow the game down trying to hold their big lead. So to sum it up, 11th in tempo only matters when the game is close, they cannot shoot well enough to comeback.

**Last Pick:** Coventry win + over 1.5 goals ❌

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Todays Pick</mark>:** Arsenal win + over 1.5 goals @ 1.57 (1 unit)

**Last Pick Reaction:** Swansea came out and made it a difficult game for Coventry as expected. Coventry grabbed their goal just before half-time and from that point on were the only side that looked like winning. They could easily have scored two or three but wasted a few good chances. Still, we move. **FT: Coventry 1-0 Swansea**

**Write Up:** I was tempted to back Man City <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> as they face an inconsistent Nottingham Forest side at the City Ground, but that inconsistency is exactly the problem. Forest can get rolled by Brentford one week and then push the league leaders the next, especially at home. Not worth the risk in my opinion especially because the home forest fans love a big game.

Instead, the focus shifts to the Premier League leaders Arsenal as they host 9th‑placed Brighton at the Emirates. Arsenal are unbeaten at home this season, **scoring 20 and conceding just 3** at their North London fortress. Mental defensive numbers and arguably the best in the world right now — especially with Saliba back in the side.

Offensively, Arsenal are averaging **2.5 goals per game** at home while **conceding only 0.38**. Their only two losses this season came away to Liverpool at Anfield (when they still knew how to play football) and late on against Aston Villa at Villa Park (arguably the best team in the league at the moment). What I&#x27;m getting at is Arsenal look in excellent shape heading into 2026, and they’ll be determined to maintain their narrow lead over Manchester City and Aston Villa going into the new year.

While goals have been a little harder to come by recently, their midweek EFL Cup performance against Crystal Palace was very encouraging—they could easily have scored three or four with better finishing. If they carry that momentum into <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>’s match, they should have no trouble creating chances against an inconsistent Brighton side. With key players like Rice, Saka, and Raya expected to return after being rested midweek, Arsenal should be close to full strength. Martinelli picked up a knock, but Trossard is more than capable of stepping in.

Brighton, meanwhile, sit 9th and have been the definition of average this season. They’re not bad enough to be dragged into a relegation fight, but they’re also nowhere near showing the quality needed to push for Europe. They’re **winless in four**, and a trip to the Emirates is unlikely to change that. Combine Arsenal’s elite defensive record with Brighton’s modest attacking output—**1.13 goals scored and 1.5 conceded per away game**—and it’s hard to see the visitors causing many problems. Raya already has **nine clean sheets** this season, the most in the league, which shows the size of the task Brighton face. **Welbeck may return from injury, but that remains unconfirmed.**

As for the over 1.5 goals, the line has hit in **88% of Arsenal’s home matches** and **88% of Brighton’s games both away and overall**. If Arsenal create chances at anything close to their midweek level, this should be a comfortable win with goals on the board in the 3 or 4-0 range, maybe 3-1 if Brighton feel like having a bit of a go. Arsenal beat Brighton <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> and anything else is a major slip up by the Gunners.

Still getting used to writing these, so feel free to drop any thoughts or suggestions in the comments. Always happy to learn—and best of luck if you decide to tail.

CHELSEA VS ASTON VILLA

Date: 27 DECEMBER 2025 at 18:30

BET ON: Both teams to score- Yes

Odd: 1.64



\- Chelsea vs Aston Villa has the makings of an open, high-quality contest shaped by form, motivation, and structural risk on both sides. Chelsea’s push to stay in the top four has been a recurring theme in Maresca’s recent press conferences, where he has emphasised bravery in possession and quicker vertical play at home, even if that comes at the cost of defensive exposure — something already visible with Colwill and Lavia injured and James regularly stepping out of the double pivot. That aggressive 4-2-3-1 gives Palmer freedom between the lines and has improved their attacking output, but it also leaves space in transition, as seen at Newcastle. Aston Villa arrive with immense confidence and nothing to fear, and Emery has repeatedly stated that he will not abandon his narrow, attacking structure despite conceding chances. Villa have scored multiple goals in every recent match but have also conceded in all of them, a pattern reinforced by Mings’ absence, Martínez’s fitness concerns, and negative underlying xG numbers. With both managers prioritising attacking control over defensive conservatism, elite creators in Palmer and Rogers operating centrally, and key defensive absences limiting in-game containment, the tactical and motivational setup strongly points toward both teams finding the net.</td></tr>

Event: Texans @ Chargers 2:30MST

Write Up: This matchup features a battle between the #1 and #6th ranked scoring defenses in the NFL. As we near the end of the 2025 season, both Houston and LAC have been performing towards the under in their respective seasons. So far the Texans have gone under in 64.3% of their games, and the Chargers 57.1%. With a combined average of 36.7 points per game allowed for the 2025 season, this game has the makings of a low scoring and grind it out affair. 

Houston&#x27;s pass rush is elite, while LAC&#x27;s pass blocking is bottom 5. This matchup alone will provide many problems for the Chargers ability to give Justin Herbert any possibility to take control of the game with his arm. Harbaugh will be forced to approach this game with a ground-and-pound style and attempt to control the tempo with long and methodical drives, something he as a coach excels at with a league leading time of possession per game.

The Chargers and Texans flex very impressive red zone defenses which will hold scoring touchdowns to a high premium. Through their last 3 games the Chargers have held teams to an average of 0.7 touchdowns in the red zone, while the Texans also boast an impressive 1.3 average over their last 3.
 
I predict this game not to be as much of a QB deal between Herbert and Stroud than it is to be a kick-off between Fairbairn and Dicker. I believe the defenses will thrive in being able to keep the opposition out of striking distance and force each team to win the game with their legs.

Write Up:

Changing the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> since someone already had the City handicap in the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> thread.

I’m going with a straight combo: Arsenal and Manchester City both to win. Arsenal are at home against Brighton, and this is the type of game they usually handle well, especially when they’re in a title race and can’t afford to slip. At the Emirates they’re aggressive from the start and usually put teams under pressure early.

City are in full chase mode behind Arsenal and their form speaks for itself. They’re scoring freely, barely conceding, and even with a couple of absences they still have more than enough quality to beat Forest.

Nothing fancy here. Two top teams, both highly motivated, both expected to do their job. The price comes out nicely at +116, which feels fair for the spot.

International Hockey U20 - World Junior Championship



Last Pick | USA -5.5 (LOSS)



<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Czechia vs. Denmark | Czechia -4.5 (-130)



Time: 8:30pm EST



USA is in the middle of their game, but I wanted to get this play in before any of the lines change. We’re moving to the biggest mismatch in pool play. Denmark is downright terrible. They just got thoroughly outplayed by a Finland team that historically doesn’t score much, got outshot by 20 and pretty clearly took their foot off the gas through the game. Denmarks first 3 games since they got to Minnesota have now seen them lose 6-1, 13-2 and 6-2. Every few years there’s a team that makes it into the top division and gets completely demolished game in and game out. Like last year with Kazakhstan and a few years ago with Austria, Denmark will need an absolute miracle to stay with the top dogs.



The Czechs on the other hand have brought what could possibly be their best team since they won back to back championships in the early 2000s. They&#x27;ve been a force in this tournament the last few years, they’re deep everywhere and play an up tempo style that focuses on play driving, rush attempts and puck possession. The complete opposite of a Finland team that still managed to put up 6. Just last year we got to see the Czechs put this on display when they played a horrific Kazakhstan team and beat them 14-2. The worst teams in the tournament usually try and limit the damage in these games, they know they have no shot at winning, they’re fine dropping into a trap and getting outshot by 30 as long as they don’t lose by 10. The biggest flaw to this strategy with a team like Denmark is they don’t have a goalie to help make those crucial saves. Expect a gigantic mismatch between two teams trending in different directions tomorrow, the Czechs never miss on an opportunity to pump a teams eyes shut.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:**  
Manchester City −1 Asian Handicap (AH) | Suggested stake: 1 unit | Odds: −110 (DraftKings)

**Write Up:**  
Manchester City enter this match in **excellent attacking form**, having scored **26 goals in their last 10 matches** (2.6 per game), with **7 of those wins featuring 3+ goals**. Against strong opponents such as Liverpool, Newcastle, and Everton, City averaged **2.4 goals per game**, demonstrating their ability to score consistently even against tough defenses. In the **last 5 head-to-head encounters vs Nottingham Forest**, City won **3 matches by 2+ goals**, drew 1, and lost 1, averaging **66% possession and 14 shots per match**, showcasing their dominance. The potential return of **Rodri** provides additional midfield stability, improving ball control and defensive coverage, which will help City dictate the tempo and create high-quality scoring opportunities.

Nottingham Forest, by contrast, has scored only **12 goals in their last 10 matches** (1.2 per game) and conceded multiple goals against strong teams, highlighting defensive vulnerabilities. The absence of **key players such as Ola Aina, Chris Wood, Ibrahim Sangaré, Willy Boly, Ryan Yates, and Dan Ndoye** significantly weakens both their defensive structure and attacking threat, reducing their chances of competing effectively against City’s potent attack. Forest’s inconsistent scoring and multiple defensive lapses increase the likelihood that City can cover the **−1 Asian Handicap**.

Based on recent form, head-to-head history, and current team news, Manchester City has a **60–65% probability to cover −1 AH**, with a \~20–25% chance of a push (1-goal win). Considering these factors, the **−1 AH line offers clear value**, making this a medium-risk, medium-reward <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. For added confidence, combining this with an **over 2.5 goals market** could also be considered, given City’s attacking trends and Forest’s defensive weaknesses.

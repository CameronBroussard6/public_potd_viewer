<tr><td class='post'>**POTD Record:** 11 - 3

**Last POTD:** Villanova -4.5 L

**Event:** NCAAB // Clemson @ Wake Forest 7:00 pm EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Clemson -2.5

**Odds // Units:** DraftKings (-137) 3.9u

**Write-up:** There’s nothing sexy about this Clemson basketball team — except for the fact that it wins. They had a loss to Virginia Tech, which was their only sleepy performance of the season, and obviously, it&#x27;s tough to go win against Duke at Cameron Indoor. So I&#x27;m not overreacting. This is a rock-solid team at the top of the ACC. First off, I’m expecting maximum focus and attention to detail coming off back-to-back losses. I like how they competed vs. Duke — the Devils are just extremely good. Clemson&#x27;s defense travels very well, as we saw. Their offense, on the other hand...they fell flat, but Duke is top 3 in the country in defense.

Based on Brownell’s record (28-5 in the last two seasons of ACC play), they&#x27;re used to taking care of business in spots like this. They have one of the strongest road records this season, SU (6-3) and ATS (7-1, 5-1 as favorites). Inside conference play, Clemson stands 8-4-1 ATS, which ranks 2nd. ATS, Wake stands 1-2 as a home underdog, and 4-7-1 ATS in conference play.

* Clemson ranks 80th in offensive efficiency vs Wake&#x27;s 103rd.
* Clemson ranks 87th in eFG% vs Wake&#x27;s 125th.
* Clemson&#x27;s rebounding ranks 148th vs Wake&#x27;s 269th.
* Clemson ranks 21st in defensive efficiency vs Wake&#x27;s 177th
* Clemson ranks 8th in opponent ppg vs Wake&#x27;s 233rd
* Clemson plays slow (325th), Wake plays fast (74th)

Clemson’s bread and butter is defense and a slow-paced game. Expect them to continue slowing the game down and playing deep into shot clocks. If they can force Wake into deep possessions and bad shots, we are gold. With Wake&#x27;s soft frontcourt, its only chance to win in this one is forcing a bunch of turnovers and shooting a very high clip from deep. Clemson has a solid offense, very balanced, with every guy able to score. I&#x27;m expecting some quality shots from everyone tonight versus this soft defense. Clemson&#x27;s late-game execution has led them to consistently close out tight games when it comes to that. It makes sense to lay the points with the more balanced and disciplined team with the stronger identity to secure the road win and cover here. GL

<tr><td class='post'>**Record:** 3-1 **(+ 1.979 units)**

**Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Girona - Barcelona FIRST\_HALF OVER 1.25 goals - **LOSS**  
Good read but unlucky. Total xG in the first half was &gt; 3.0 as per the Fotmob and Flashscore stats.  4 big chances missed. Penalty missed. If you play this first half 100 times, you get 0 goals in \~4-5 games. Forget and move on.

**Event**: Olympiacos - Bayer Leverkusen (Champions League) @ 21:00 CEST

**Stake:              2.979 units**   (my profit so far + 1 unit)

**Analysis:**

**This market is TOTAL shots of a player towards the goal. It does NOT have to be on target. Grimaldo just needs to shoot 2 times.**

Free money basically, this line makes no sense.  Grimaldo&#x27;s average is \~2 shots per game. Leverkusen is an attacking team and Grimaldo has a free reign on the left side of the pitch to do what he wants. He takes free kicks, sometimes penalties, he shoots from outside the box, inside the box, from anywhere.

**I base my conviction not only on the stats:**

* **Bet365 odds are 1.3 (American: -333)  for Grimaldo to have at least 2 shots.**

So I&#x27;ll go hard here with 2.979 units stake and attack this edge, let&#x27;s go.

\----------

EDIT Additional remark:

* This exact matchup (Olympiakos - Leverkusen) was played in January 2026 couple of weeks ago in the Champions league (group phase) and Grimaldo shot 4 times.
   * Leverkusen had good attacking stats in general, more shots, more xG but could not score.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Milan vs Como, both teams to score 1.86 odds (1.1 U)

Como is one of the most attacking teams in the league, while Milan is one of the most defensively solid teams. However, I don’t expect Milan’s defence to be able to handle Como’s attack. I expect the game to be similar to their last meeting, which ended 1–3 for the Rossoneri — a match that had 25 shots and was high-paced and end to end</td></tr>

Tennis | ATP Doha | 10:30 AM EST (estimated)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Jakub Mensik vs Zhizhen Zhang | **Zhang +3.5 games at -120 (FD). 1 unit.**

Write-up: I originally posted this more than 8 hours ago, but it wasn&#x27;t visible due to a single word in the write-up. Reposting now for transparency, but there&#x27;s still some time to tail if you&#x27;d like.

Paul 2-0 closed at around -150, but he ended up playing pretty badly after the first set. 

Jakub Mensik comes into this match in questionable form, having dropped a set to Jan Choinski in his first match back from an abdominal injury that forced him to pull out from a fourth-round match against Novak Djokovic at the Australian Open. Even if it weren&#x27;t for the injury, Mensik has yet to display consistency in his results on any surface, and Zhizhen Zhang is a dangerous floater in this draw. Zhang has a career-high rank of No. 31 in the world, and while he missed out on most of 2025 due to injury, he seems to be finding his form again. Last week at the Brisbane Challenger, Zhang won the title without dropping a set, defeating a couple decent players in Sakamoto and Bolt. In his first match here, he faced just one break point in a 6-4, 6-4 win over a tough qualifier in Carballes Baena. Zhang&#x27;s serve has always been one of the strongest elements in his game, and he backs it up with a heavy forehand that works well on mid-slow hard courts like these in Doha. Combine that with Mensik&#x27;s relatively serve-dominant game, and I expect to see some close sets here. Of course, you always have to be careful about backing a player who made a final in the last week, but I think those extra matches were just what the doctor ordered for a player like Zhang. I think he&#x27;ll be happy to get into forehand exchanges with Mensik given Jakub&#x27;s inconsistency off that wing, and while he&#x27;ll be at a big disadvantage on the backhand wing, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s enough for Mensik to dominate here.

**Event:** Premier League, Wolverhampton Wanderers v Arsenal, 3:00 pm EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Wolverhampton +1.5 Asian Handicap, +100, 1 unit

**Write Up:** Wolves have proven **they can keep games tight** if needed and the earlier meeting of the two sides showed just that. **Arsenal needed the help of not one, but two own goals, to scrape a narrow 2-1 victory in the 94th minute.** The H2H game before this one had ended 1-1. **Away from home,** I expect the game to be even tougher for them and I just can’t see them dispatching Wolves with the way these two teams have been playing as of late. **Gyokeres, Saka and Co. just haven’t clicked** and I don’t expect this will change <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Atletico Madrid ML @ 1,98

**WriteUp:** Risky game to bet on because it can go either way. I expect many goals this game. However Atletico seems to just forfeit LaLiga matches completely. They spanked Betis 5-0 and Barcelona 4-0 in Copa. Rested their players vs Betis 2nd game and the Rayo game. Brugge is in great form and they beat Marseille 3-0 in the last CL game. I think the cup experience of Simeone and the Atletico players will matter more in this tie and they will get a win here. The odds are just way too good to pass up, but tail at your own risk.</td></tr>

India might get a few sixes but Netherlands won&#x27;t get too many. If Netherlands bats first this will certainly hit. Even if India bats first they should get a decent amount but no where close to 18.

**The most recent match at this ground was 4 days ago between New Zealand and South Africa. Two very strong batting teams and there were 15 total sixes that game.**

India may me better than both NZ and SA but Netherlands are no where near on the level of the other teams i mentioned.

The historical data coupled with the match up (great team vs tier 2 national team) should make this sweat free.</td></tr>

Event: Indonesia IBL: Borneo - Dewa United, 13:30h

This was almost equal yesterday, Borneo was a slight favorite, and then the odds plummeted, now 1.25 - 3.7 for a win of each team.

I also find this to be closer than the current odds show, and in Indonesia, if it is close, it is usually also with under for points.

The stats don&#x27;t support this at all. The last 7 H2H games of these 2 went over, and heavily over. Dewa has only 2/5 with under in the last 5, Borneo 3/5, but the logic is that these 2 combined are bound to play an under game, why, because it is going to be a close game. Hopefully without OT.</td></tr>

Match: Qarabag v Newcastle &amp; Wolves v Arsenal

Time: 18:45 &amp; 21:00 CET

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Newcastle ML + Arsenal ML (1.77)

Reasoning: 

Newcastle travel to Qarabag for the first leg of this tie and these two teams are currently in different levels. Yes Qarabag has had some good displays at home this UCL season but I would say that was mostly because their opponents underestimated them. I do not see Newcastle doing the same here. Newcastle has a very solid defense that rarely gets caught up in counters which is where Qarabag shines. They have showed up against weaker opposition in this years UCL and got the most out of their match. I see them wanting to close this tie from the first leg and so they can try to rest a couple of key players on the second. 

Arsenal is coming out of a draw against Brentford in the league and they simply cannot drop points here <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Not only because City is 4 points behind but because they are playing the worst team in the league. Not to mention they play Tottenham in the weekend so a victory here is a must. They have the quality to dismantle Wolves, without a doubt and I think they will do that. A loss/draw here might put their all season into shambles and I don’t see that happening.

**Write Up:** Not a lot to say here tbh. Italy&#x27;s men have been fairly consistent throughout the winter olympics and the only real competition for podium placements are Sweden and France. As for women&#x27;s biathlon, France will most likely win and the remaining two medals should go to Sweden or Norway. Worst case, should Italy or Germany perform way better than their current form suggests, it&#x27;s essentially a H2H between Sweden and Norway where Sweden is definitely the strongest of the two.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Winner: Inter Milan, 1.80, 1 unit


Write up: Typical early knock-out stage match. Inter has significantly greater quality than their opponent and is a significantly bigger favorite in this match-up. 
Although Bodo/Glimt had several good results against top teams this season in the UCL, they made through the eyes of a needle, claiming 6 of the total 9 points in the last two games. 
They are not constant in their playing form and they are unexperienced in this phase because they are qualifying for the first time in the UCL knock out stage.
Inter Milan are in a great form since the start of the season with a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> in this moment winning 8 times in the last 9 games.  They are one of the most experienced roster in the UCL at this moment, because of reaching the final 2 times in the last 3 seasons with almost the same squad.
They are not under big pressure in the Serie A because they are leading the table with 8 points ahead of AC Milan and they have pretty much easy schedule in the Serie A, so they can easly focus on the Champions League fixtures against the Norwegian runner-up.</td></tr>

**Units (to win):** 4.6u to win 4u

**Reasoning:** My largest unit sizing for a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> ever, and for good reason. First, apologies to others who may not have this line available, I could only find it at Betano (around -180 other bookies). McDavid walks into the quarterfinals having scored 3 points in each round robin game. Coach Jon Cooper has been experimenting with his lines in practice, and it will be interesting to see if he maintains the Mc-Mac-Mack line or bump Wilson back onto Mcdavid&#x27;s wing. Regardless, the top guns will all be present on the team Canada power play, attacking against Czechia&#x27;s measly 57% PK on the tourney. The Czech&#x27;s are playing their second game in a row after edging out the Danes to qualify, a game they were expected to win comfortably but ended up needing to play their big guns heavy minutes. This Canadian lineup is an all time great lineup that should have no difficulties in winning by 3+ goals tomorrow. Other team Canada plays such as spreads or goalscorers are solid proxies to my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>, but getting this value compared to other bookies was a smash on McJesus.

Lehkonen is T-most points on the Finnish team. He&#x27;s not on the top line, but he skates on the 2nd in both PP and EV. And with this being the KO stage, he should get a small boost in ice time with shortened lines. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to see his ice time over 17 minutes.

Switzerland only has 3 NHL defensemen on their roster. Roman Josi is good defensively, but Moser and Siegenthaler&#x27;s xGA/60&#x27;s are below average. Switzerland&#x27;s best defensive forward Kevin Fiala is out after suffering a season-ending injury against Canada.</td></tr>

**CET 21:00 Football Premier League**

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>: Wolverhampton vs **Arsenal -2,5 handicap** at **3,3** odds

Explanation: We got Arsenal who has entered their &quot;golden era&quot;. This is basically Arsenal in their best years and we might not be able to witness it for a very long time again. They are the favourites for pretty much everything at the moment this year. Arteta has gotten the time and resources to build up this team and its paying off its dividends now.

I suspect that Arteta took of the pedal after that 4-0 score in the first half in their last game, which was against Wigan. They will look fresh to face Wolverhampton here and I honestly expect a thrashing. I do however approach this game with cautioun by &quot;only going&quot; -2,5 handicap. My expectations are 1-6, 0-6 or even 0-7. But I do want to cover other scores, such as 0-4 and 1-4 for example. There is always a game somewhere where we see a huge thrashing in the Premier League, and I think it&#x27;s this game. Too much difference in quality is the reason. Even the bench of Arsenal players would start over the Wolverhampton players. That&#x27;s the gap which we have at the moment. Wolverhampton must be preparing for the Championship (division 2 level) as their season is already over. They have been playing like a Championship level team this season and they might even struggle there. Another factor that plays here is the fact that Wolves will try to play their game and get severely punished by Arsenal over and over again.

On the side note: My tactics won’t change by lowering the odds to less than 2. The goal is to find high odds to play here, such as the range of 2,2 to 3,3. I’m trying to keep track of the results in all of the top leagues. We will **always aim for** **long term** gains here and make sure to manage your bankroll. I will try to post another <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> in the coming days. Good luck everyone.

**Write Up:** Strange one yesterday as Dembele gets subbed off 20 minutes into the first half. Most books should have voided it, if you used 365 with sub on play on it cashed. I&#x27;m calling it a push, because my book voided, but very happy some of you cashed as well!

Champion&#x27;s League playoffs continue as Newcastle head to Azerbaijan to take on Qarabag. Newcastle are the only EPL side to not qualify directly into the final 16 and this should be a major mismatch in talent. Qarabag statistically were tied for the 2nd worst defense in the first 8 games of the UCL and just barely made it into the playoffs. Newcastle finished in 12th place, a few spots outside of the qualifying places. 

Newcastle have scored 3 goals or more in 3 of their UCL matches, and those were against the worst defensive teams in their schedule. They tend to take advantage of bad defenses and in this stage the more goals the better, so I do not see them letting up on the gas after a goal or two. Love the value here, BOL!</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** **Elliot Slessor +2.5** v Zhao Xintong **+ AC Milan or Draw** v Como **(4u)** 

**Odds:** **+144**

**Write Up:** Smooth sailing on that lay, Cardiff finished 3-1 and Lincoln saw it out 4-0. Appreciate everyone who tails - its good to finally get the wins into the double digits. Have a wonderful day folks, onto the writeup.

Firstly we go to the Players Championship 2026 for Snooker. Slessor and Xintong faced off once prior in the 2025 World Championship qualifiers and it finished 8-10 in favour of Zhao, both hitting 600 shots! In terms of form they both are coming into this in relatively good form in their last 10 their records are as follows: Zhao with a 8-2 record and Elliott with a 7-3 record. Xintong recently won the World Grand Prix, currently ranked number 7 my bet is that as Slessor (22nd) is also in decent form, and going off their latest matchup we know they both have the quality it takes. A +2.5 handicap is supported by 6/10 last of Xintong&#x27;s matchups either being losses or within this handicap itself. For Slessor he has 5 wins in his last 6, the loss coming by a deciding set - his confidence is high and with his record his last 10 games have either been wins or within a +2.5 handicap. His recent fixtures include wins against Mark Selby (6th), Wu Yize (12th) and a loss within the handicap to Wu Y., amongst his recent record it shows that he is capable of beating those higher ranked and if he is losing he is keeping it close. +2.5 handicap is my bet here.

AC Milan sit 2nd in the league and Como sit 7th. Since 2025, Milan have won the last 3, all scoring over 2.5 goals. In Como&#x27;s 11 away games they have a record of 5-3-3, unbeaten in the last 3 in the league although they were at Pisa (19th), Lecce (17th) and Lazio (9th). Before these two away games were games at Roma 1-0 (4th) and Inter 4-0 (1st), both defeats to similar strength teams to AC Milan. As for AC they boast a home record of 7-3-1, unbeaten in their last 10 in the league. For the reverse fixture at Como, Milan came away with the 3 points finishing 3-1 on 15th Jan. AC with the home advantage should claim a draw or take away a win here, it should be a tough game either way but I am backing AC win or draw.

Write Up: Sweatier <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> here, this game has a lot more on the line then when Canada and the Czechs last met. Last time they met McDavid recorded 3 points and Canada beat the Czechs 5-0 including a goal in the first period. That was also Canada’s first game of the tournament. Before the team were completely comfortable with each other. McDavid has scored 3 points in multiple games now so I think it should be no problem for him to get 2 this game. Celebrini has also been hot and is on a line with McDavid so look for some goals and assists from the Hockey god.

**Previous:**  Olympic Hockey - Germany -1.5 vs France + Champions League - Benfica vs Real Madrid Over 3.5 Cards – WINNING!

**Recap:**  Well, the Germans did what organized German teams do, perform when necessary.  It was over after the first period ended 3-0.  Meanwhile Benfica and Real Madrid did not disappoint.  What a game!  All kinds of drama, cards, even 2 coaches got red cards.  But when you say drama and Real Madrid in the same sentence, it can only mean one thing, Vinny Jr was involved.  Amazing goal which was unfortunately followed by a racist insult to Vinny which stopped the game.  Regardless, we won.

**New Event:**  UCL – Qarabag vs Newcastle + Brugge vs Atletico Madrid

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:**  Qarabag +2.0 Asian &amp; Brugge vs Atletico Madrid BTTS @ 2.26 (3 units)

**Leg 1:  Qarabag +2.0 Goals vs Newcastle**

Qarabag have shown some grit in this Champions League campaign.  If anyone saw <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>’s Benfica match, it is not easy to play in Lisbon.  Yet Qarabag beat Benfica 3-2 in the first match of the UCL competition.  At home Qarabag has been quite formidable as well, scoring in each of their 4 matches winning 2, drawing 1 and losing 1 and no less to some big names.  They beat Copenhagen and Frankfurt by 2-0 and 3-2 respectively, tied Chelsea 2-2 and lost to Ajax 4-2.  In fact, Qarabag has not lost at home by more than 2 goals across all competitions since 2018 when they lost 6-1 to Sporting CP in a Europa League match. 

Meanwhile Newcastle are coming into this match with quite a few injuries.  Bruno Guimaraes, Joelinton, Tino Livramento, Fabian Schar and Emil Krafth will be out, while Sven Botman, Lewis Miley, and Yoane Wissa will be evaluated.  Worth mentioning is that Newcastle have conceded in 3 of 4 away UCL matches this campaign as well. 

Yes, Newcastle is a better overall squad, but travel to Baku, Azerbaijan is not easy and Qarabag is not about to rollover either.  Should Qarabag lose by 2 goals it’s a push.

**Leg 2:  Brugge vs Atletico Madrid – Both Teams to Score**

This seems like a battle of imperfections.  The last time Brugge failed to score at home was in a 3-0 loss to Arsenal back in October.  Since then they have played 6 home games where they scored 16 goals while giving up 9.  Brugge has shown good form in recent matches but have been leaking 1.5 goals per home match.

On the other side, Atletico Madrid may be the most imperfect of the two sides.  Their last 4 games were as follows:

\-          Feb 5 - Win 5-0 @ Real Betis

\-          Feb 8 – Lose 1-0 vs Real Betis

\-          Feb 12 – Win 4-0 vs Barcelona

\-          Feb 15 – Lose 3-0 @ Rayo Vallecano

If this is not imperfect, I’m not sure what is.  These guys are all over the map but there are plenty of goals to go around.  Also AM always seem to bounce back after a defeat.  The last time they were shutout in back to back games was in Feb of 2024.</td></tr>

Arsenal W vs Leuven W, Over 4.5 goals @ 2.26

At 2.26, I really like the value on over 4.5 goals here. Arsenal w at home don’t change their style, they attack, press high, and create chances in numbers. Against a team like arsenal w that usually leads to an open game. Arsenal w are deadly when there’s space and can easily score two or three themselves. If this turns into a back-and-forth battle, four goals is very live at this price.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Terence Atmane 🇫🇷 vs Flavio Cobolli 🇮🇹 U2.5 sets 5 units to win 3.3U @1.66 (Bet365)

This is going to seem like a really strange play to go for so let me explain. Atmane in my opinion is the streakiest player on tour as his all-out-attack style is obviously inconsistent as hell but when it’s firing he can literally be unplayable. We have only really see him play like this once at the top level when he reached the Cincinnatti masters semis from qualifying and has unsurprisingly been playing fairly poorly since. He picked up just his second win in 11 matches against Kypson in round 1. On the other hand Cobolli, similar to last year, is having a disastrous start to the season. In 2025 it was a 1-8 start and 2026 is looking no better having been battered in his three matches so far against players outside the top 100. Not ideal for a player who’s 20th in the world.

Cobolli doesn’t like to be rushed (hence why he struggles on the fast courts that he’s been playing on this year) whilst Atmane’s massive swinging is error prone. With the courts being slower, I expect Cobolli to be the small favourite but I feel this match is going to depend on the first set dynamic. If Terence comes out firing in S1 I don’t see Flavio, being completely out of form and confidence, putting up too much of a fight to claw his way back into the game especially if the Frenchman is untouchable on serve. On the other hand, Atmane has a tendency to fully lose his ways when things aren’t going his way and then it gets ugly as the match progresses, hitting error after error similar to a Paire would do (semi-tanking). He only really gives his best when he’s winning and the only reason he stuck around against Tiafoe and Kypson is because he won the first set. Both players see very little long matches because of these profiles, Cobolli has seen U2.5 sets in 12/13 matches (8/8 losing S1) and Atmane in 13 of his last 17 matches (cleared in 9/12 losing S1, exceptions Sinner and Fritz since he typically loves a big game and Vukic in front of his home crowd in Paris) since their match in Cincy. That match did quite literally go the distance but the conditions were different and both players were in quite different form so I strongly doubt that happens again. Flavio hasn’t won a set when losing S1  I would have fairer odds closer to 1.5. BOL !</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Jannik Sinner total games u12.5 vs Alexei Popyrin (-200 odds via DK) 1U

Event: ATP Doha Second Round 10:30 A.M. CST

Same bet as last round here. Sinner came out and looked dominant in his R1 match against Machac. Conditions seem to suit him and mentally he looks right back to normal after the AO. He just recently crushed Popyrin at the US Open last year in straight sets and I expect nothing different. Coming into this tournament Popyrin was on a 10 match losing streak and got a cupcake R1 match against a Challenger level player. Don’t expect him to hang with Jannik from the baseline, meaning he would need a top tier serving display to make this one close.

I mainly bet on football (EPL and CL) and League of Legends

**Record:** 0-0

**Sport:** Football | England Premier League

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Arsenal -1.5 Asian Handicap @ 1.85 @ 2U**

**Reasoning:** Arsenal are in a tight title race and can’t afford to drop points in games like this. Even away from home, they control matches through possession, structure, and consistent chance creation. When they face mid-table sides, the quality gap usually shows over 90 minutes.

Wolves tend to struggle against elite opposition, often conceding territory and relying on limited attacking moments. In addition to that, Arsenal is the best defense in EPL

Game: Counterstrike 2 (CS2) | Tournament: PGL Cluj Napoca 2026 | Time: 8:00 AM EST.

**Projected Veto:**

* PARIVISION ban Nuke, FUT ban Inferno
* PARIVISION <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> Dust 2 (Or Anubis), **FUT <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> Mirage**

**Mirage Stats:**

* PARIVISION are 58% winrate on 12 maps of Mirage in the L3 months, their Mirage is the tale of two tournaments however since adding Zweih. The first tournament they added Zweih, they went 4-0 on Mirage, they beat Spirit, Falcons, Aurora and FURIA all without giving up double digits
* This tournament has been a disaster for PARIVISION on Mirage, they have played the map 3 times and are 0-3 on the map so far this tournament losing each of the last 3 days in one sided fashion. They lost to G2 13-8, FaZe 13-2 and FURIA 13-8, while none of these teams are &quot;bad&quot; at Mirage, none of them are top teams/stand outs on the map in my opinion either. They have lost 69% of rounds in the last 3 days on Mirage and yet to win a pistol round on Mirage for the entire tournament, with low 30% winrate on both CT and T side
* FUT are 86% winrate on 22 maps of Mirage in the L3 months, they are 7-1 in the last month overall. They are just coming off an insane 13 winstreak on this map, they lost to MOUZ <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> but I think their is a lot they can take from that series to help them here, I think FUT will look back at that game and feel like they beat themselves more then that MOUZ heavily outplayed them.
* As said FUT were on a 13 map winstreak on Mirage before <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, they have beaten multiple teams this tournament already on Mirage including Astralis, FURIA, Aurora, they also beat G2 and Astralis earlier in the month, these are two of the teams that PARIVISION have gotten destroyed by the last two days
* Think the main two things lacking against MOUZ after they got their 7-2 lead was they got very sloppy/off script on T side, and got antsy on CT side and were trying to make too many plays and get too much info. These are things PARIVISION are great at punishing with Jame&#x27;s system, so this gives FUT strong footage to review and use. On top of this, PARIVISION were the last game of the day and FUT knew that if PARI lost they would face them tomorrow, so they were watching <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> map 3 when FURIA and PARIVISION faced on Mirage and watched them get picked apart.</td></tr>

**---**

We have **1st in the prem vs 20th** <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> and despite recent form were gonna back the leaders to extend their lead. Arsenal are the only prem team playing midweek this week which after dropping points against Brentford would mean they have a quick opportunity to respond. Arsenal are coming into this after a 4-0 attacking display against Wigan and will look to carry that performance on with key players like Saka and Saliba returning from injury. I expect a similar performance to their away game against Leeds.

\---

Wolves are coming off facing 10 shots on target against 17th placed Nottm Forest who literally sacked their manager after the game… I expect home ground to give wolves a boost but this Arsenal side will look to be as clinical as can be and look for an early lead, force wolves to press up, and kill it off with a second. Also Arsenal set peices against relegation teams is just too good.

Brugge must get something at home if they are to advance, Brugge got 4+ corners in 11/12 games in the league at home, the one miss they had a red card, in the CL they covered in 4/6 home games (incl. Qualifiers) failing vs Barca and Arsenal. Atletico have given up 4+ in 7/12 away league games, and 3/4 away CL games. As for the 7.5 line, it&#x27;s a low line that both sides cover almost always. Atletico also seem to be focusing on Copa del Rey, which doesn&#x27;t mean that they won&#x27;t try to win here but they&#x27;ve been underperforming in other competitions including CL.</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>Last 5 <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> : ✅️✅️✅️✅️✅️

**Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>**: Switzerland vs Italy under 6.5 goals (+100) (Went exactly like expected, Switzerland put up a lot of shots but their firepower is not the same as Sweden or Finland to blowout the Italians!)

**POTD Record**: 28-21

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Finland vs Switzerland 12:10 pm EST (Olympics/Men&#x27;s Hockey)

Finland Puck line -1.5 (+125)

Still perfect in these Olympics! These odds seems pretty high for a Finland win by 2. Like I said in the previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>, Finland has a **full NHL line-up** while Switzerland only have 9 NHL players and the rest of the team plays in the Swiss league. Combine this with the fact that Switzerland played <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> while the Finland coaching team was watching them and finding ways to exploit their weaknesses it feels like an obvious win for Finland tomorrow. 

Swiss goalie Leonardo Genoni will be in net for sure and he&#x27;s 38 years old. I know he didn&#x27;t stop too many shots <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> vs Italy but tomorrow vs Finland it will be way different. There&#x27;s a big difference between an NHL shot and an Italian player shot and I don&#x27;t think the old goalie playing both back-to-back games will be ready to stop this Finland offense that destroyed Italy 11-0 and Sweden 4-1. Meanwhile Finland will have Juuse Saros in net, a proven number #1 goalie in the NHL that has played better and better each game and now hasn&#x27;t allowed a goal in the last 95 minutes he was on the ice.

For me it goes down to 2 scenarios that could happen. First one is Finland destroys a less skilled team that played the day before and just can&#x27;t keep up with them. Second one is Switzerland keeps it close but Finland the much better team and greater NHL experience manages to take the lead and then Switzerland pulls out their goalie and Finland ends it in an empty net. I just don&#x27;t see Switzerland taking the lead tomorrow in any way except maybe in the first period when it&#x27;s 0-0. Finland is on a 2 win streak where they dominated their opponents so they come with full confidence which will be important in a win or go home situation. They also have big expectations in Finland with the country winning the gold in 2022&#x27;s Olympics so a quarterfinals loss would be nothing but a big dissapointment for them. (I know it&#x27;s not the same roster from 2022 but still this roster is definitely confident enough that they can aim for a medal)

BOL!

**Write Up:** Arsenal are playing away against Wolves, who are bottom of the league. On the road to the title, the chances of them dropping points in a match like this are very slim, and honestly, I don’t think this game needs a ton of stats or deep analysis.

I’ll just say this: In the 23 matches between the two teams, Arsenal have scored at least 2 goals in 17 of them (73.91%).</td></tr>

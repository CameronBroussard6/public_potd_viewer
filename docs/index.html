He also ranks 31st this season in XP conversion rate at only a 91.7% which means even if the raiders somehow get 3 tds then still a chance he misses one of them.

Raiders have such below average offense which should match well against the below average defense of dallas but dallas did make some moves this offseason to try and fix that but nonetheless I am super confident the raiders get 2 tds at most and lose by a shit ton.

Event: Cowboys @ Raiders 6:15MST

Write up: Short and sweet here. Everyone knows at this point how horrible the Dallas defense has been throughout the course of this season. Tyler Lockett instantly came over to the Raiders last week and became Geno Smith&#x27;s favorite target against the stingy Denver defense and put up 5 catches for 44 yards on a windy day. I see him easily matching those numbers against the 31st ranked defense on yards allowed to wide receivers in a climate controlled Raiders stadium. Although Lockett isn&#x27;t the same player he used to be on the Seahawks, him and Geno have developed a good connection over the years and he will continue to use him as a strong safety net on this otherwise struggling Las Vegas offensive unit.

### Why the Las Vegas Raiders Will Cover +3.5 Against the Dallas Cowboys


The Monday Night Football matchup on November 17, 2025, pits the Dallas Cowboys (3-5-1) against the Las Vegas Raiders (2-7) at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas. The Cowboys enter as 3.5-point favorites, with a moneyline around -188 to -195 implying about a 65-66% implied probability of a Dallas win, while the Raiders sit at +148 to +157. The total is set at 50 points in some lines, though others hover around 38.5, suggesting expectations of a moderate-scoring affair.


 While the Cowboys have the edge on paper with a slightly better record and recent additions like DT Quinnen Williams and LB Logan Wilson via trades, this game screams value on the Raiders to cover the +3.5 spread. Covering means the Raiders either win outright or lose by three points or fewer, and several key variables—stats, travel fatigue, injuries, social sentiment, pre-game buzz, and home advantage—tilt the scales in their favor for a close, gritty contest. Using the prediction model outlined earlier (a logistic regression-style score incorporating these factors), the Raiders emerge with a strong chance to keep it within the number. Let&#x27;s break it down.


#### Team Overviews and Recent Form
The Cowboys, coming off a bye week, have shown flashes of competence but remain inconsistent. Their 3-5-1 record reflects defensive vulnerabilities, ranking near the bottom in points allowed per game, even after bolstering the unit at the trade deadline.


 Offensively, they&#x27;ve relied on a passing attack led by their quarterback, but road struggles have plagued them, with a win percentage differential that doesn&#x27;t dominate lesser teams. The Raiders, at 2-7, are in rebuild mode after selling assets like WR Jakobi Meyers, but they&#x27;ve shown home resilience, particularly in defensive stands. Their Pythagorean win expectation (based on points scored/allowed) suggests they&#x27;ve been unlucky in close games, and historical upsets like the infamous &quot;Heidi Game&quot; on this date in 1968 add a narrative layer of Raiders magic in high-stakes spots.


 Recent form favors a tight matchup: Experts predict scores like 21-20 for the Raiders, emphasizing a one-possession game.
The model&#x27;s strength differential (win pct home - away, scaled by 10) gives the Cowboys a slight edge at -1.67, but that&#x27;s easily offset by other factors.


#### Travel Time and Fatigue
Travel is a massive underrated edge here. The Cowboys are flying from Dallas to Las Vegas—approximately 1,200 miles, a 3-hour flight with a 2-hour time zone.


 This isn&#x27;t just logistics; studies show cross-time-zone travel impacts performance, especially for east-to-west trips where body clocks lag, leading to fatigue in primetime games. The Raiders, playing at home, avoid this penalty entirely. In the model, this adds a +1.5 point boost to the Raiders&#x27; score for the away team&#x27;s disadvantage, as teams traveling over 1,000 miles often underperform spreads by 1-2 points. Combined with Dallas coming off a bye (which can sometimes lead to rust rather than rest), this sets up a sluggish start for the Cowboys, allowing the Raiders to hang around or even lead early.


#### Injuries: Cowboys Hit Harder
Injuries are a game-changer, and the Cowboys are far more banged up. Dallas has 10 players on the injury report, including key pieces like DT Solomon Thomas (out), OT Ajani Cornelius (knee, questionable), DE Dante Fowler (shoulder), and S Malik Hooker (toe).


 Linebacker DeMarvion Overshown is back, but the depth issues in the trenches could expose them to the Raiders&#x27; rookie RB Ashton Jeanty, who&#x27;s poised for a breakout. The Raiders, by contrast, have only six on the report, with mostly minor concerns like QB Aidan O&#x27;Connell (wrist, out—but they&#x27;ve adjusted) and others like G Dylan Parham.


 This injury differential adds +1 to the Raiders&#x27; model score, as Dallas&#x27; defensive front—already a weak point—faces more question marks, potentially allowing Vegas to control the clock and keep the score close.


#### Social Media Sentiment and Pre-Game Buzz
Social media from X (formerly Twitter) shows a mix but leans toward Raiders value as underdogs. Posts highlight historical drama like the Heidi Game and hype for Vegas home energy, with fans noting &quot;upset potential&quot; and &quot;Raiders grind out a defensive battle.&quot;


 A massive $155k bet on Polymarket faded the Cowboys, betting on Raiders to cover at 51% odds, signaling sharp money on the home dog.


 Interviews and coaching comments amplify this: Raiders HC Pete Carroll (noted in previews) emphasized &quot;home energy&quot; and Jeanty&#x27;s potential in pre-game pressers, while Cowboys talk focuses on integrating new players post-bye.This sentiment scores +0.5 in the model, reflecting positive buzz for a Raiders upset or cover.


#### Weather and Other Variables
Weather is a non-issue in the domed Allegiant Stadium—neutral score (0). Home advantage, however, is huge: Defaults to +2 in the model, as Vegas crowds can energize underdogs. Add in the Raiders&#x27; defensive scheme matching up well against Dallas&#x27; &quot;stoppable force&quot; offense, and you&#x27;ve got layers for a backdoor cover. Trends show favorites are 5-0 SU in recent Cowboys-Raiders series at Vegas, but ATS is 3-1-1, hinting at close covers for the home team.


#### Model Prediction and Math Breakdown
Plugging it all in: Strength diff = -1.67 (Cowboys edge); Home adv = +2; Travel = +1.5 (Cowboys penalty); Injuries = +1; Sentiment/Interviews = +0.5; Weather = 0. Total score for Raiders (home win/cover proxy) = 3.33. Probability of covering +3.5 (adjusted from home win prob) = 1 / (1 + exp(-3.33)) ≈ 96.5%. Math step-by-step: exp(-3.33) ≈ 0.036; 1 + 0.036 = 1.036; 1 / 1.036 ≈ 0.965. This high prob reflects the cumulative edges tipping toward a Raiders cover, even if Dallas wins narrowly (e.g., 24-23).


In summary, the Raiders cover +3.5 because their home setup neutralizes Dallas&#x27; advantages, amplified by travel woes, injuries, and underrated buzz. This isn&#x27;t a Raiders blowout—it&#x27;s a classic underdog spot where they lose by a field goal or less, or pull the upset. Bet responsibly, but the value&#x27;s here.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Raptors ML + Pistons ML

Bet 3 units to win 1.59

Why: The Raptors are just the more reliable team right now. They’re playing well, winning consistently, and they’ve handled Charlotte plenty of times, especially at home. Charlotte keeps having stretches where they look decent, but they can’t hold it together for a full game, and that usually catches up to them. As for Detroit, they’re on a legit hot streak while Indiana is basically running on whoever is available that night. The Pacers just don’t have the bodies to keep up, and it shows in how often they fall apart early. Detroit has been taking care of business against teams in that kind of shape, so it’s hard to see that changing here.</td></tr>

**Northern Ireland - Luxembourg**  
Both teams are OUT, that is the only risk factor here. I still see Northern Ireland winning this as they have enough quality and want to end this international period with a win I reckon.  
Northern Ireland managed to put up a good fight against Slovakia earlier this week until they conceded in the 91st minute. They also managed to put up a good fight against Germany previously.  
Luxembourg have 0 points.  
Luxembourg have only scored once in this entire stage and conceded 12 goals so far.  
The previous match between these two ended in 1-3 to Northern Ireland.

At the same time, small wins by 4 against Cluj and Krka, and the latest against Studentski Centar. These close wins, combined with some good games from FMP and an OT loss from Partizan, are the reason for this acceptable spread value.

Edgecombe has not been able to replicate his start-of-season production. but he&#x27;s been getting plenty of attempts, averaging 12+ in last 5.

76ers will lack scoring options entering this game, with Embiid and Oubre both out. PG3 may be back but he&#x27;ll be on a minutes restriction.

Expect lots of minutes and opportunities for Edgecombe.

Clippers are coming off a tough B2B loss, any lack of energy will be exploited by the athletic Edgecombe. Expecting a regain to form or at least enough to cover this lowered line.

* Both teams are very low tier two/boarderline tier three teams, HAVU have shown a little bit more to me albeit not very much either way. They have two wins against ARCRED, an upset win against ECSTATIC and have taken some maps off some other solid tier two teams
* HyperSpirit have been getting destroyed by pretty much everybody. They are 1-11 in their last 12 matches, with a total map record of 5-23. They are 2-10 in their opponents map picks in this time as well and have just been looking very bad relative to tier two competition.

**Projected Veto:**

* HyperSpirit <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> Dust 2, HAVU <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> Nuke (Overpass possible)

**Nuke Stats:**

* HAVU are 58% winrate on 12 maps of Nuke in the L3 months, they have lost 3 straight Nuke maps but before that were on an incredibly solid winstreak with dominant wins beating GenOne 13-5, 9BOOMPRO 13-3, BASEMENT BOYS 13-10, and ECSTATIC 13-9. 2/3 of their recent losses were 25-23 and 13-11 as close as they could be while facing better competition.
* HyperSpirit are 40% winrate on 5 maps of Nuke in the L3 months, they do not like this map and have banned it previously before. They have some major concerns on this map mainly being their CT side winrate is currently 33.3% while Nuke is extremely CT sided. Most times a team lose Nuke when they <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> it is because they have a slow start on offense, it is quite hard to see HAVU having a slow start when Hyper have a 33% winrate on defense.

A couple weeks ago I had Maxey as my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> for 4+ three pointers and no doubt we cashed on that. This time around we run him back for a well rounded stat line and here’s why. 

This season Maxey is averaging 44.8PRA (5.3 above this line) In his last 10 games he’s went over 39.5 PRA 8/10 times for a very nice 80% hit rate. 

Embiid will be out which will make Maxey primary scorer and playmaker. Paul George might make his debut however his distribution is considered moderate with limited mins so I’m not concerned with his involvement. Line should shift a bit in our favor if he is ruled out.

Clippers rank 27th in the league in pts allowed so their defense is pretty soft so far this season and Kawhi is still out for them. They’re also on a b2b while 76ers have fresh legs with 3 days of rest. 

There’s a slight concern of a 76ers blowout here which could limit Maxey’s playtime in the 4th Q however even when the team is comfortably ahead Maxey often continues to contribute offensively, hitting or exceeding the line due to his role as primary scorer and playmaker with Embiid’s absence. 

Maxey’s form has been elite hard to imagine he slows down here.

For this game on MNF, I’d be wary of taking the cowboys or the over, I think how this game goes will surprise a lot of people. 

One thing that I think will happen regardless though, is that Jeanty will tear up the cowboys defence. You could also take over rush/rec yds and I like that almost as much. Best of luck to us.</td></tr>

Tripple double for Hart who absolutely feasted on every department, finished with 10 assists and 16 potentials. Would love to run it back against the Heat again but id rather stay away from the bump.

Mobley has taken on a bigger facilitating role in the absence of Garland and has handled it superbly. Without Garland he’s over in 7/L10 games avg 4.3 assists per game &amp; 10 potentials per game and has had 3+ assists in all 10 of those games.

That includes a game against the Bucks earlier this season where he had 6 assists on 12 potentials.

Bucks allow 8th most assists to PF’s this season and has struggled defensively this season, with a high total of 237 I like Mobley to continue his great impact as the secondary ball handler for the Cavs, especially benefits in the non Mitchell minutes.</td></tr>

Last Pick: Manchester City vs Real Madrid ~ Both teams to take 1+ corners in each half (-175) ❌ (04/17/2024)


Fixture: Croatia vs Montenegro (World Cup Qualifiers) 11:45am PST Time 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Will A Goal Be Scored In Both Halves? Yes. (-160) 

Reasoning: 

Croatia has scored a total of 23 goals in its last 7 World Cup Qualifiers. 

5 of Croatia last 7 World Cup Qualifiers have resulted in Croatia scoring in both halves. 

Additionally, I can see  Montenegro giving its all in offensive positions to stay alive in having a chance of qualifying. This will push for both teams to score due to Montenegro pushing higher up the field, in which Croatia can capitalize on with counter attacks and players being out of positions.

Out of 7 games in which Montenegro have faced, 5 games have resulted goals being scored in both halves. 

Montenegros last match up against Croatia on September 8th 2025, resulted in a 0-4 loss. Additionally in this match., both halves included a goal.

PS. If you want to get better odds with some risk involved, you can aim for Croatia to score in both halves. (+110)

Sport: Tennis Tournament: WTA 125k Colina, Chile Time: 5:00 PM EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Oleksandra Oliynykova 2:0 -165 (tipping at this market avg number but b365 is still handing -137((hammer))

Analysis: Oleksandra is having her best year on clay in 2025 so far with 51 wins [30 itf] and just 15 losses. Shes been one of the hottest girls on the South American circuit this last month too racking up 9 wins (coming off her second title of the year 8 days ago) and only two losses. One versus Julie Grabher which was razor close down to the wire. Then she layed an absolute egg against Jasmin Ortenzi (😂) as a -500 favourite. As for her wins through this campaign I’m impressed with: Udvardy, Riera, Sierra (#1 seed &amp; hometown favourite((SPANKED her))), and sherif (great gritty win coming back from a set down to beat a really establish clay courter in Sherif). Oleksandra has been loving the altitude and we’re gonna continue to back her in this absolute mismatch tomorrow against Elizabeth Mandlik. 

Mandlik on the other hand isn’t having a bad year at any means sitting at 18 wins and 10 losses to the surface currently. *Here’s the problem*, all 28 of those matches (*except 4*) were played on the ITF circuit; a significantly lower level of competition in comparison to the challenger circuit Oleksandra has been dominating. She also lost every time she played a step up in comp: Branstine in Vero Beach, Carle in Bellinzona(elevation) and Friedsam @ Troisdorf(elevation). Get this, her last clay match where she lost to Friedsam was *FIVE* months ago! Shes been grinding little bush league hard court ITF circuits and farming prize money while Oleksandra has been developing herself into a top 100 clay courter who’s (just about) ready for clay WTA 250’s and 500’s while Mandlik is just using her ranking for protected appearance fee is. Even if she’s *serious* about this odd clay entry here, she’s going to be rusty and Oleksandra will absolutely show levels in this spot. Don’t overthink this one, ride the hot hand and see why they NVS🌟

**Todays Event**: 🏈 NFL Monday Night Football Cowboys @ Raiders 7:15 PM CST🏈

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Todays pick</mark>**: Both teams to make a 33 yard or longer field goal (-125 on DK) 1u to win 0.8u

**Writeup:** Dallas heads over to Vegas tonight to face the raiders. Raiders look to get out of their slump while the Cowboys fight to not get embarrassed by another mid team. Cowboys are projected to win with their spread of -3.5, and the line is at a total at 49.5 points, telling us this game could be closer and have plenty of field goal attempts

Lets look at some kicker stats. Daniel Carlson Averages 38 yards for his field goal attempts this season, with his longest averaging 31 yards per game. With 15 attempted this season and 12 made, he sits at an average of 1.3 made per game with 1.7 attempted, a solid 80% percentage. Carlson&#x27;s longest on the season is at 54 yards in week 2 against the chargers.

Brandon Aubrey Average 40 yards/fg made and averaging 41 per longest field goal in a game.. He has attempted 18 and made 17 of those at a 94.4% rate. He averages 1.9 made per game and 2 attempted per game.  Aubreys longest fg was 64 yards, also in week 2 against the giants.

Raiders have a pretty terrible and ugly offense this year, ranking 27th in total offense. However, the cowboys even this out with some equally horrible defense, being ranked 31st. On the flip side, Raiders hold the 15th best defense while the cowboys have the 4th best offense. I can see the Raiders getting into field goal range and not trusting Geno to get it done, and the Cowboys taking some easy points in field goals to start up their early lead.

Event: Cowboys @ Raiders (7:15pm central)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Cowboys -3 (-130) (1U)

-everything is bet to win unit amount-

Write up: 

You can call this whatever you want, you can call this bad handicapping, bad judgement, but I’ll tell you what. There’s something amazing about the human spirit when it has something to play and fight for, you see these things all the time, the miracle “33” point comeback with all the flukes pointing towards Demaryius Thomas being with the team when they honored him that specific game, the interception we saw <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> from Nashon wright who had a beautiful interception for the bears right before halftime then got on one knee and broke down in tears honoring his late coach John Beam who was tragically shot last Friday. You see these things a lot and the cowboys have stated that they’re going to honor Marshawn Kneeland with their pads and how they play. The word “relentless” is being described in the locker room. 

The cowboys clear and away have the upper edge in this game offensively…

* Points Per Drive: Dallas 2.41 (rank 4th) vs Las Vegas 1.27 (rank 31st)
* Yards Per Play: Dallas 5.8 vs Las Vegas 4.2
* Success Rate: Dallas 47.2% vs Las Vegas 39.1%
* Drive Success Rate: Dallas 42.1% vs Las Vegas 28.3%
* Explosive Play Rate: Dallas 11.2% vs Las Vegas 7.8%
* Three-and-Out Rate: Dallas 18.7% vs Las Vegas 28.4%

The Cowboys’ superior third-down conversion rate (41.3% vs 32.7%) and red-zone touchdown percentage (64.2% vs 48.1%) compound this edge. The Cowboys’ offensive efficiency advantage is legitimate and measurable. Their 29.2 points per game ranks 4th league-wide, fueled by Dak Prescott’s 69.3% completion rate and 257.8 passing yards per contest.

But yes, ah, the defense is so tragically poor, having allowed 30.8 points per game. But with the addition of Quinnen Williams parlayed with the following stats and the extra motivation I really do believe these boys will be able to get to geno and mitigate some of the explosiveness from Ashton jeanty

 The Cowboys lead the NFL with a 30.7% pressure rate this season. Geno Smith, meanwhile, has been pressured heavily — he’s taken 18 sacks for 141 yards lost and owns a 77.6 passer rating under pressure, with 7 TDs vs 10 INTs. That’s a clear weakness you can exploit if you’re betting against him. If you watch this guy he is very indecisive and hold onto the ball way longer than he should!

Game logs show multiple outings where pressure wrecked him:
* vs Broncos: 6 sacks, 1 INT
* vs Colts: 4 sacks, 2 INT
* vs Chargers: 3 INTs, 3 sacks







He’s prone to mistakes when the pocket collapses, and Dallas’ top-ranked pressure rate is exactly the type of matchup that exposes him. 



This raiders defense is also not world beaters by any means. Ranking below average in many statistics across the board. I do believe the star power in Dallas is still very relevant, dak has never lost 3 games in a row. And if you know anything about cowboys fans is that they are everywhere and love to travel, these fans will be flocking to Vegas to cheer them on and just experience the atmosphere out there. I expect these boys to have a large backing from their fans. Both teams have losing records but I do believe the cowboys have more to play for and I do believe they get the job done. Been a great weekend! As always, cheers🍻</td></tr>

NCAAB // Florida A&amp;M Rattlers @ Georgia Bulldogs

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Georgia -36.5 (-110) 1u**

We are going out to Athens, Georgia where the Bulldogs have a tune up game against truly one of the worst teams in the country. FAMU is one of the worst teams in one of the worst conferences in the sport and the line reflects that.

This is a very big line, no getting around that, but I think it&#x27;s one FAMU is going to struggle staying within. They are 0-3 so far with an average margin of defeat of 31 points all by teams worse than Georgia. Meanwhile Georgia is off to a great start on the year sitting at 4-0 and scoring at will against every team they&#x27;ve faced so far. In their 3 tune up games so far, they&#x27;ve won by an average margin of 50 points!!!

So, we have a team that has been blowing out tune up opponents against a team that&#x27;s been getting blown out by everyone they&#x27;ve played. I think those trends continue tonight and we see something along the lines of 100-55.

Georgia: #34 in KenPom

Writeup: For Monday Night Football, we have the Vegas Raiders hosting the Dallas Cowboys. Both of these teams have weak defenses and explosive offenses, and we will use that to our advantage here. This one is pretty simple.

This season, running back Ashton Jeanty has been averaging 19 touches per game. Running backs that have seen 15 touches or more against the Cowboys defense are averaging 130 scrimmage yards this season. Since week 4, nearly every lead running back opposing the Cowboys has gone for over 100 scrimmage yards or just short of it - Josh Jacobs went for 157, Breece Hall went for 155, Rico Dowdle went for 239, J.K. Dobbins went for 121, and Emari Demercado (4th string RB) went for 78. The Raiders by far had their best offensive game 2 weeks ago and nearly beat the Broncos last week, who have a top 3 defense in the league. Now facing this incredibly soft Dallas defense, I expect Jeanty to be a focal point of the Raiders attack and reach 85 or more total yards in this one.

GERMANY VS SLOVAKIA

Date: 17 NOVEMBER 2025 at 20:45

BET ON: Over / Under Corners- Over +8.50

Odd: 1.66



\- Germany and Slovakia enter this match with enormous stakes, and both teams’ tactical profiles point naturally toward a high corner count. Germany, despite sitting top of the group, must avoid defeat to secure automatic qualification, and their injury issues — missing key figures like ter Stegen, Rüdiger, Musiala, and Havertz — weaken central stability and often force Nagelsmann’s side to build wider and rely on lane overloads, increasing wing actions and resulting corners. The expected returns of Kimmich and Schlotterbeck further encourage a more proactive, front-foot approach. Slovakia, meanwhile, needs a win to top the group, pushing them into a more aggressive setup with Strelec leading the line and wide players such as Hancko and Ďuriš expected to attack relentlessly. With both teams motivated, playing offensively, and using the flanks as their primary constructive zones — combined with Germany’s defensive absences creating more broken plays — the match projects sustained pressure at both ends and a strong profile for over 8.5 corners.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Hernan Casanova vs Alex Hernández | **Casanova ML at -138 (DK). 1 unit.**

Write-up: Chan closed at -130, and played a solid match to win in straight sets. He ended up beating Charles Broom in the semifinals as well before Daniil Glinka finally ended his run in the final. 

For <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today’s pick</mark>, I’m going with Hernan Casanova to beat Alex Hernandez (could be listed as Juan Alejandro Hernandez Serrano on some books) in Guayaquil. Casanova is a veteran clay-courter who has quietly been playing some solid tennis recently, including a title at an M15 in Santiago, and has received short prices (+200 or so) against high-CH/low-ATP guys like Burruchaga and Heide as a result. He makes his fourth appearance here in Guayaquil, having played here in 2020, 2021, and 2022. 

Meanwhile, Hernández, who had bounced between SA clay and European hard courts this fall, is in okay form, but it’s not like the market has been valuing him the same as Casanova. In early October, he was priced as a massive underdog (+400) against Barrios Vera, who I don’t believe is significantly better than Burruchaga or Heide, and ended up winning just three games. More recently, he was priced as a bigger underdog than he is here against Schiessl and Gima, neither of whom are quite at Casanova’s level in my opinion. Alex actually tends to play his best tennis on hard courts, where he is best known for a crazy comeback against Taro Daniel as a wildcard in Los Cabos. 

Of course I have to mention the head-to-head, as Hernandez did score a straight-sets win over Casanova in Santa Cruz in June. However, Casanova closed at nearly -500 in that match, and I simply don’t believe that he should be available at such a good price this time around. The logic here is similar to my recent Buse <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, where I was able to successfully fade a negative H2H. 

Both of these guys will be grinding from the baseline, but I expect Casanova’s topspin and clay court skills to eventually wear down Hernandez in hot, muggy conditions. I actually thought about making this a 2-unit play, but the main reason I didn’t is that it’s just hard to get recent footage or advanced stats on guys who mostly play ITFs. Regardless, I would take this to around -150, and it’s already trending in that direction on some books.

With Meyers gone, Tre Tucker finally gets a real shot. He basically steps in as the Raiders WR1 now with more targets, more responsibility, and a legit chance to break out. Meyers was soaking up a lot of targets, so with him gone, those targets should naturally slide toward Tucker.


He’s not just a straight-line deep guy either. Tucker’s pretty versatile as he can return kicks, line up all over the formation, and fits into a bunch of different offensive packages. The speed and agility are obvious, but he’s also shown he can fight through contact and make some tough catches when he needs to.


And for context, he’s averaging around 5.1 targets per game this season, so there’s already a solid baseline for his involvement. With this new role, that number could easily bump up.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> : Germany to Win + Total Under 4.5 Goals @1.65 for 3u

Germany have won 4 straight matches since their opening loss to Slovakia and just beat Luxembourg 2-0, and they are playing at home in Leipzig where they have won 5 consecutive World Cup qualifiers and only lost 1 of their last 34 home qualifiers, which shows how dominant they are. Germany&#x27;s attacking players are in good form especially Nick Woltemade, and the team has only conceded 3 goals in 5 qualifiers, making their defense one of the best in the competition. Slovakia did beat Germany 2-0 in September which gives them belief, but they are terrible away from home having lost 5 of their last 6 away matches and failed to score in 3 of their last 5 away games, so they will struggle to create chances at the Redbull Arena. Both teams are strong defensively, so low-scoring matches are expected, and the last 9 consecutive Slovakia matches had under 3.5 total goals, meaning the under 4.5 requirement is very likely to be met.

If any of you have followed my picks in the soccer thread, you know how much I like the Lanky German - Nick Woltemade. He&#x27;s a 6&#x27;6&quot; tall old school striker&#x27;s striker who can do it all. He works hard, chases everything, and can score with his head or his feet. He has cemented himself as the top choice for Germany up front and is coming into this match hot, scoring in each of his last two games for Germany and coming off a 2 goal game at Luxembourg on Friday. I also think our lanky German will take charge of penalty duties, given his current form and that their captain Kimmich is still questionable to play with injury. 

2nd place Slovakia will want to spoil Germany&#x27;s fun here, as they handed Germany their only group stage loss in Slovakia back in September. However, this is a different team on the road, with a 1-0-5 record in away matches over the last year. With their only win and clean sheet being against Luxembourg.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **NC State -11.5** (-120 FanDuel)

NC State is having a good start to the Will Wade era. They’ve won and covered the spread by a comfortable margin in their first 3 games - winning by 48, 24, and 46. They haven’t scored less than 94pts yet. 

State is currently ranked #1 offense in the country at a crazy 1.4pts per possession.

Per Bart Torvik, with preseason bias removed, NC State is the 21st team in the country, while VCU is at 101.

Their opponent VCU isn’t looking the best to start the season. They scored only 78pts against 296 ranked Saint Peter’s.

Will Wade and NC State brought in some dawgs from the portal also. 

Notable starters for NCSU that were added in the portal: 
-Darrion Williams, who was the #1 player in the portal according to multiple medias. 
-Tre Holloman, started at MSU last season and was a key player. 
-Van Lubin who started at C for UNC and had a great second half of the season.
-Copeland who was a top player on viral McNeese team last season where Wade coached prior. 

Counting on NC State’s high powered offense, the motivation of their first relevant home game of the season, and Will Wade to cover this line.

There&#x27;s not a whole lot to say here... The Netherlands should be the dominant team and do all of the attacking at home. There&#x27;s a tiny tiny (and I mean TINY) chance Poland can jump Netherlands here. 

The Netherlands will dominate possession and look to attack frequently in this game... With that in mind, I see them dominating in the corner game. 

On top of that, the Netherlands were pretty shit in their game away to Poland a few days ago, so I expect them not to muck about too much here. 

The Netherlands have a fair few out for this window, and Kluivert has gone back early - but it shouldn&#x27;t matter considering the depth in the squad compared to a side like Lithuania.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> 1 - Northern Ireland to win. NI come into this one off the back of a last minute defeat to Slovakia. However, as mentioned previously - they are a different side at home! Prior to defeat in their last home game against Germany, Northern Ireland hadn’t lost at home for 8 games and rarely concede. Couple that with the fact that the guests have only won 1 of their last 17 games and sit bottom of the group with a record of 0-0-5 having only scored 1 goal in those 5 games. Football is a funny game , but all of the facts point towards and Irish victory in Belfast.


<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> 2 - Germany to win. The Germans come into this one level on points with their guests knowing that a win will see them top the group. Germany haven’t been in vintage form recently and did lose in the reverse fixture in Slovakia. However, at home in a must win game - there are few countries in world football who prove time and time again they get the job done. Can see this being scrappy but again a 2-0 / 2–1 home win seems the likely outcome.

As always nothing is guaranteed in sport but the facts and history point towards this being  routine win… whether that is true or not only time will tell.

It assigns ELO ratings to players and projects a win chance based on the combined ELO ratings of the players on each team. TeamReddit is projecting a 62% win chance here which creates value here on the ML.</td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s play: Tommy Castellanos over 235.5 passing yards vs NC State.

The NCSU passing defense is ranked dead last in the country, surrendering 299 yards per game through the air. Castellanos has topped this number in  7/10 games this season. The only opponents that NCSU has held under the number are Virginia Tech and Campbell, not exactly explosive offenses. Feels like a pretty good spot in a high scoring game.  </td></tr>

Event: NBA Pacers VS Cavs 
 
Writeup: Pretty similar to yesterday. I&#x27;m going with Pacers to keep it very close. With a big potential to actually pull off the upset. vegas says 13% chance for pacers to win, I believe it&#x27;s only that low because of their rough start. They also should have increased their winning chance since 2 players are off injuries.  Looks like their chemistry without  Tyrese is improving significantly. People are forgetting they have a winning spirit in them after making it to game 7 of the finals months ago. And I think they&#x27;ll be very, very hungry to prove their season isn&#x27;t going to continue in its current direction with this game, so I&#x27;m sprinkling a little on the moneyline as well.</td></tr>

Tromsø vs Rosenborg – Over 2.5 Goals

Odds 1.80 

League: Norwegian Eliteserien

My play of the day is Over 2.5 Goals in Tromsø vs Rosenborg in the Norwegian Eliteserien, kicking off late Saturday night/early Sunday morning Australian time. These two sides have one of the strongest goal-scoring trends you’ll find, with 9 of their last 10 meetings going over 2.5. Tromsø at home always push the tempo, and Rosenborg away from home consistently create and concede chances. Rosenborg’s away matches average well over 3 goals, which is exactly what you want for this type of bet. The league itself is fast, open, and high-scoring, making overs naturally more likely. Both teams need to attack based on their table positions, so neither side will sit back or play safe. Statistical models have this game projected at around 2.8–3.0 total goals, which matches the market perfectly. Every major prediction site leans toward goals, with Over 2.5 as the top recommended play. When history, data, team styles, and betting markets all point one way, it’s usually the right side to be on. That’s why Over 2.5 in this matchup is my most confident bet in the next 24 hours.</td></tr>

Larne face Glenavon in a matchup that often produces goals, with both teams playing open, attacking football. Larne usually dominate at home and create plenty of chances, while Glenavon usually concede a lot of goals, especially against stronger sides. Their counter-attacking approach also increases the game’s tempo. With both teams likely to contribute, the Over 3 Goals Asian Handicap looks reasonable.</td></tr>

Leicester Tigers vs. Northampton Saints (Leicester Tigers +6.5) @1.56

It has been a while. I&#x27;ve realized that I can still give picks even if I myself am not betting. I will be giving bets even if I am not currently betting now.

Leicester Tigers have won each of their last eight home fixtures dating back to last season and have won four of their last five games in all competitions.

Northampton Saints were on a five match winning streak until their last fixture when they surrendered a 26-point lead. They have lost five of their last six away fixtures to Leicester Tigers, including the last three.

For some reason, the odds are in favour of Northampton Saints. Leicester Tigers are logical favourites for this game, and the +6.5 handicap is merely a safety measure to ensure there is no sweat.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** North Melbourne Women -29.5 @ 1.88 (2u)

**Last Pick:** Anaheim Ducks 3-Way ML @ 2.10 ✅

Ducks started off strong, up 2-0 in the first 6 minutes and held the lead up until halfway through the last period to make things a bit stressful but were good enough to get a winner late with a few minutes to play.

**Write Up:**  
Going to the AFLW here and taking North Melbourne to cover. They’ve been the standout team all season - elite midfield control, clean ball movement, and a defence that barely gives opponents anything. They’re winning stoppages comfortably most weeks and turning that into quick, efficient scoring chains, which is exactly what you want when laying a big line. Not to mention they are on a 25 game winning streak (absolutely ridiculous) and their closest win this season was by 29 points. 

Melbourne are solid, but they’ve struggled to slow down high-pressure teams, and North’s system is about as disciplined and suffocating as it gets in the AFLW. They rarely allow easy transition, and once they get rolling, they can pile on scores in bunches.

With North’s consistency, midfield dominance, and the way they’ve been putting weaker sides away early, this feels like a spot where they can control the game from the start and stretch the margin past 30 with a grand final spot on the line for them to go back to back.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s match: Partizan vs Fenerbahce &amp; Valencia vs Crvena Zvezda (Euroleague Basketball)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Fenerbahce +6.5 &amp; Crvena Zvezda +9.5 (both odds together 2.21)

Units: 4

Write up: Made quite a long pause and saw that 2 matches are now allowed, so i am very happy with the 2 i&#x27;ve chosen.

Im going to start with Zvezda, since the arrival of coach Sasa Obradovic, Zvezda have made quite a good streak of results, and are currently second and with a win <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> can keep up with Hapoel for the first place.

Now, they are quite battered with injuries, with the tally for the previous game being 8 injured players, but even with that they have played very defensive, good basketball. If the information from the media is correct, Nwora and Moneke are going to play in Valencia, with a chance of Graham playing aswell. Combine that with Jared Butler, Semi Oyeleje, Kalinic... Zvezda have enough players to play this through. Worrying data is that most games that Zvezda won, or played at all in the euroleague this season is at home, so we will see what a trip to Spain will turn out to be. BUT i am still fairly confident, because i think this game will be VERY close, and i dont feel that Zvezda will allow alot of points in, and that their defense will be top notch.

Now to Partizan, i&#x27;ve burned myself when playing them to win and to lose, time and time again they continously block me, but hopefully this will be my day ;\]. They are playing Fenerbahce at home, and Partizan is having a ton of problems. They are currently 17th on the table with losses against last placed ASVEL, blowouts from Paris &amp; Olympiacos, losing against Barcelona 78-76 in a close battle, and ALMOST dropping a 20 point lead in the 4th quarter to Monaco, winning 78-76. They are currently in a very bad place, and i feel that <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> they will continue their losing streak, they have problems in the dressing room, players are showing a lack of effort in defence and in attack, playing nonchalantly and not giving it their all. Still, they are playing at home and it&#x27;s never a good idea to write off Partizan, thats why i gave Fenerbahce a good 6.5 lead.

BOL to everyone!

Basketball | NBA | 9:00 PM Eastern

Boxing | 9:00 PM Eastern

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Francisco Veron ML and Golden State Warriors +2.5

Bet 2 units to win 1.12

Why: Veron has been a lot more steady. He’s coming off a solid win, he’s been facing better opponents, and he’s fighting at home. Villa hits hard, but he’s been really inconsistent lately, and it’s tough to trust someone who’s still trying to bounce back from a couple rough losses. Over 10 rounds, the guy who keeps his shape and sticks to a plan usually comes out on top, and that’s Veron.

Golden State +2.5 - Portland’s beat up, they’ve been playing pretty poorly, and going on the road with that many injuries usually goes badly. Golden State hasn’t been amazing, but they’re rested and at home, and they’re not likely to drop another one to the same team after getting blown out last time. Both picks are basically leaning toward the more reliable sides in each matchup. 

best of luck if tailing.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Tommy Castellanos (FSU) Over 235.5 Passing Yards (-114)
Sport/Event: CFB – Florida State @ NC State
Time: Friday 11/21, 8:00 PM ET 
Stake: 2u

Write-up: I’m starting off with a QB prop. Castellanos has quietly been slinging it. He’s cleared this number in 6 of his last 7 and is sitting in the mid-240s passing on average over that stretch, so 235.5 already feels a bit short. Now he gets about as friendly a matchup as you can ask for: NC State’s secondary is banged up and has been getting cooked for ~300 passing yards a game, including 340+ in four straight. Both teams are 5–5 and fighting for bowl eligibility, so I don’t expect FSU to come in with a conservative game plan. They’re going to let their best playmaker attack the weakest unit on the field. Obviously there’s some risk of a blowout leading to a run-heavy 2H or FSU’s usual road weirdness, but if this stays even reasonably competitive, Castellanos should have enough volume to push into the 240–260 range more often than not. I’ve got 2u on O235.5 for my first <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>.</td></tr>

**Mersin Bld - Karşıyaka** 🏀 Türkiye Basketball League UTC 16:00

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>**: Karşıyaka TT Under (79.5) @ 1.60

Karşıyaka is a club with a long history (two-time league champions but facing a major crisis in 2025). With only one win in eight weeks, they are in the relegation zone. On November 15th, they lost 69-80 at home to Manisa. They suffered six consecutive losses, and on November 9th, they parted ways with head coach Faruk Beşok. Following the 80-69 loss to Manisa Basket over the weekend, it was reported that Chiozza threw the towel at Vice President Denis Köse, who reacted to him from the stands, and Köse threw it back. This incident led to Chiozza&#x27;s departure from the team. Samet Geyik (appendicitis surgery) and Egemen Güven (severe flu) will not be able to play this match. Young players from the youth academy (like Yalın Yıldız) have been brought in.

Mersin, on the other hand, is maintaining and strengthening its squad for the new season: Justin Cobbs has signed a contract extension, Hakan Sayılı (former Karşıyaka player), Ben Bentil (forward from ASVEL), Kuzey Signings like Livaneli have been made. They recently lost to Unicaja Malaga in the BCL (Basketball Champions League), but they&#x27;re playing resiliently at home in the league.

With Samet Geyik and Egemen Güven out, Karşıyaka&#x27;s paint toughness, rebounding/second-chance numbers, and low-post threats are significantly weakened. With Chiozza&#x27;s departure, the ball-handling burden falls to a tight guard rotation, slowing down set tempo and limiting offense on mediocre shooting days. Mersin&#x27;s big men (Bentil and Olaseni) have a physical advantage in protecting the basket and rebounding; they could force Karşıyaka to resort to more crosses and three-point attempts. Karşıyaka&#x27;s missing players and the team&#x27;s unrest will likely be reflected in their scoring.

**🏀 Coby White o4.5 Assists -102** vs the Miami Heat

The over/under of this game is set at 249.5... Wild. Miami ranks first in the NBA in Pace, Bulls rank third.

Heat are awful in the paint. They&#x27;re ranked 22nd worst in Opponent FG% in the Restricted Area, where Giddey and Vucevic can score off passes from White. Bam being back may change things but he&#x27;ll likely be on a minutes restriction. Heat ranked 26th in allowing assists to PG.

White has gotten 7 and 8 assists in his first two games back. With this game looking to score high, Heat&#x27;s weakness in the paint, and White&#x27;s success so far, I&#x27;m hitting this line.

Time: 7:00 AM EST.

**Writeup:**

* Fire Flux and Leo are very evenly matched on paper and both have strong map pools and solid rosters making this an exciting match. Fire Flux are currently slated to get side choice so they should be picking 2nd in this match against Leo 
* Fire Flux have been on quite a hot streak with their new roster and honestly I am quite suprised they are underdogs in this match. They were on an 8 match winstreak where they went 16-1 in maps, then dropped two straight to CPH Wolves/BoomBoomPRO, since that they have won 4 of their last 5 and have looked solid overall
* Leo has a good map pool and solid roster and have been playing together for a while now, they have been inconsistent as a team but are in quite good form as well coming into this game winning 6 of their last 8 maps, they also don&#x27;t blow anyone away with a star player but have a really strong roster with no super weak link and have solid fire power across the full team

**Veto:**

* Veto is not a guarantee and will be a bit tricky, both teams have been perma banning Nuke, but Fire Flux have 0 officials on it while Leo have some, imo Fire Flux will be the ones to ban Nuke here. As for Leo&#x27;s ban they have a few options imo, they have banned Inferno a lot in the past and has seemingly been  a map Fire Flux has been increasingly strong/confident on but is their least played map. Fire Flux are also very strong on Dust 2/Mirage which are Leo&#x27;s worst two maps winrate wise. 
* Leo ban Inferno/Mirage, Fire Flux ban Nuke
* Leo <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> Train, FireFlux <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> Dust 2/Mirage

**Dust 2 Stats:**

* Fire Flux are 63% winrate on 19 maps of Dust 2 in the L3 months

**Event:** NBA: Houston - Denver, 03:30

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Alperen Sengun to score 22 or more, 1.76, 1.5u

Following list of reasons:

- Sengun has a big motivation against Jokic, maybe to show he grew out of the baby Jokic nickname. Maybe he wants to have a better h2h. Maybe he just gets inspired. He showed this with the Turkey team on Eurobasket, where he scored 28 in a 95-90 decisive group stage game. That pushed Serbia to Finland, the game they later on lost.
Maybe he really does think Jokic is the best player in the world, and he wants to show he can beat him and outplay him. Why not. A legitimate motivation there.

- In the last seasons 3 games they played, he didn&#x27;t have the chance to show his progress really, first 2 games Jokic didn&#x27;t play, in the third one in April, he only scored 14 in some 20-25 minutes, terrible performance from Houston there, they were down 31 in the first 3 quarters. Jokic also didn&#x27;t push it, 18 7 7, a minimum effort.
- I have Gordon as questionable for the game. This benefits his chances here greatly, but even if Gordon can play, it stays more than solid.
- It seems that Jokic doesn&#x27;t really care for this non-existent rivalship or the one to be. He would probably swap his 0 points for a win immediately. 
- Finally, in his last 3 games, Sengun had 28, 30, 25, showing a great form.

1.5u <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> - extra confidence, and I played an alt, point less than the standard limit, 22.5, which should also be fine.</td></tr>

Event: South Carolina vs Butler (NCAAB) (1pm central) 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Butler -1.5 (-110) (1U)

-everything is bet to win unit amount-

Write up: 

When you break this matchup down, Butler simply profiles as the more polished team heading into this neutral-site tournament. Through four games, the Bulldogs are averaging 95.8 points per game on 49% shooting from the field and an elite 40.2% from three. Every team that South Carolina has faced so far besides NC A&amp;T who is 280th in the nation in 3 point percentage is below rank 300 and below 30% from three. Southern miss even took these cocks to overtime! Compare that to South Carolina, who despite their 4-0 start, are hitting just 39% from the field and 33% from deep. That gap in perimeter efficiency is massive: Butler is knocking down over 10 threes per game, while the Gamecocks are closer to 6–7 per game, meaning the Bulldogs can stretch defenses and create separation quickly. Butler also dominates the glass, pulling down 46 rebounds per game with a +15 margin, showing they’re not just a finesse team but one that controls possessions.

Tempo is another key differentiator. Butler plays at the 70th-ranked adjusted tempo, reflecting Thad Matta’s fast-paced style that emphasizes quick possessions and high shot volume. They average 65 field goal attempts per game, compared to South Carolina’s 60 attempts, and they convert those looks at far superior splits. South Carolina, meanwhile, ranks 270th in adjusted tempo, preferring slower, grind-it-out possessions. That’s a dangerous mismatch against Butler’s pace and shooting, especially on a neutral floor where early-season chemistry matters.
Continuity matters in November tournaments, and Butler has it. Matta’s squad features returning contributors like leading guard Finley Bizjack, who have stepped seamlessly into bigger roles, and a slew of talented transfers in Michael Ajayi off a solid year at Gonzaga who is averaging a double double and Jalen Jackson (senior) who was a 20ppg player on a competitive IPFW team for two years while South Carolina is still piecing together rotations with transfers like Meechie Johnson, who has bounced between Ohio State and Columbia multiple times. That lack of stability shows in the Gamecocks’ reliance on depth—ten players averaging double-digit minutes—but depth doesn’t equal cohesion. Butler’s core has been built within the program, and their offensive chemistry is evident in their 21 assists per game compared to South Carolina’s 13.8.
South Carolina’s bench explosion against Radford (50 points) looks impressive on paper, but Butler is a different animal. The Bulldogs’ defense is holding opponents to 43% shooting and just 28% from three, meaning those secondary scorers won’t find the same rhythm. Meanwhile, Butler’s offensive leaders are efficient: Bizjack is shooting 47.8% from three, Jamie Kaiser Jr. is at 42.1%, and Jalen Jackson adds another 40% from deep. South Carolina’s top scorer, Meechie Johnson, is hitting only 39% from the field, and while his 40% from three is respectable, he doesn’t have the supporting cast of consistent shooters to match Butler’s arsenal.

The one weakness for Butler has been turnovers—15 per game—but this is mitigated by South Carolina’s inability to force them. The Gamecocks rank 324th nationally in steals and average just 11 turnovers themselves, meaning Butler’s Achilles heel is unlikely to be exploited here. In fact, Butler’s pace and shot volume should magnify their efficiency advantage, while South Carolina’s slower style leaves them vulnerable to runs.

Finally, Butler has already proven they can compete against continuity and talent, going on the road and losing by just two to an SMU team loaded with returning pieces. That performance showed Butler’s guards can handle pressure and execute in tough environments. On a neutral court, with their superior shooting, rebounding margin, faster tempo, and more cohesive backcourt, Butler’s continuity at the pg position should shine.

Bottom line: Butler’s shooting edge, rebounding margin, and program continuity make them the right side. South Carolina’s depth is smoke and mirrors against elite competition, and their slower tempo won’t hold up against Butler’s pace. My power ratings make this closer to -4, so laying -1.5 is tremendous value. Butler is the play. I would bet this right now! As every bet I submit the lines change shortly after. Nebraska was -6.5 when I bet it last night and closed at -8.5 this morning, and still won by double digits like I said! Let’s get a win with butler and take this momentum into another successful football weekend! As always, cheers 🍻

Update: line has already moved to 2.5… not too worried there but definitely get in there before anything more</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: __Davion Mitchell O6.5 AST @1.86 1U (Bet365)__

NBA | Bulls vs Heat | 🏀  

Suggs gets it done with 5 minutes left in the first half what a beast, we move 6-1 run.

NBA Cup games is back and this just stands out immediately, we get a high total of 247.5 in this one and it’s for the right reasons. Heat is ranked #1 in pace this season whilst Bulls are ranked 4th, expect a high speed high scoring game here which is golden for assist props. Cup game should mean starters playing more minutes with every point mattering, lost minutes last game due to foul trouble but should be in store for 30+ minutes here at least.

With 29+ minutes Davion is over in 7/10 games this season avg 8 assists per game &amp; 13.6 potentials per game. Over in 3/3 H2H against the Bulls with those same filters Avg 8.3 assists per game.

Davion is leading the Heat team in passes made per game, assists per game and potential assists per game, so expect Davion to keep facilitating and run the offense in what should be a great game.</td></tr>

Raptors are coming in hot after taking down the Sixers yesterday, and this is a great spot for them. The Wizards might be down two bigs — Sarr is questionable and Bagley is basically doubtful. If both sit, they’re stuck rolling with Vukcevic, and yeah… he’s fine offensively but he’s not stopping anybody on defense.


With Washington’s frontcourt that thin, Toronto should eat inside , easy paint touches, putbacks, second-chance points, all of that. And the Wizards’ defense is already a mess: they turn it over a ton, don’t rebound well, and get cooked in transition.


Put it all together and it’s a perfect setup for Toronto to pull away and cover big. This matchup really favors the Raptors. Expecting Blowout here .

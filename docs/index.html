**Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Bukayo Saka 2+ SOT (+110) ❌️

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s Event:** English Premier League | Crystal Palace vs Man City (6:00 AM PST)

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Haaland ATGS and 2+ SOT (+110) 1.0 unit to win 1.1 units

**Write Up:** Fairly unlucky match for us as Arsenal simply fell flat. Lots of forced passes over the top and wildly off target shots, rather than smooth buildup play. Saka got the whole match as expected and created both Arsenal goals, but it wasn&#x27;t enough. We move on. 

We revisit our Wednesday <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> as Man City visit Crystal Palace. I&#x27;m a firm believer in if it ain&#x27;t broke, dont fix it. We&#x27;re getting this play again at plus money and the odds are too good to skip. Haaland has had a monster start to the season, netting
15 goals in 15 EPL matches. He has come back to life after a minor downturn (by his standards), netting in 2 of his last 3 in all comps. He also scored and had 2 + SOTs in this fixture in each of the last 3 seasons. 

Palace have had a great start to the season as well and currently sit in 5th. They have allowed the 2nd fewest goals in the EPL this season, just 12 in 15 matches. We&#x27;ve got a case of the unstoppable force meets the immovable object, as City are the league top scorers with 35 goals. We&#x27;re getting the odds we are here because of Palace&#x27;s defensive record, but I just dont see them keeping Haaland out. 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> we right the ship and start the next winning streak, BOL!</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>**Record**: 3-1 (+3.65u)

**Last picks**: Borussia Monchengladbach ML (+100) vs. Wolfsburg 3u ❎

Really unlucky outcome <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. As someone who&#x27;s watched both of these play at least 3 times this season, this was by far the best I&#x27;ve seen Wolfsburg play and by far the worst I&#x27;ve seen Gladbach play. With that being said to all the nice people on this sub I do apologize for the loss here. At the end of the day we&#x27;re gambling, not generating free money. Not gonna trip over 1 loss. Anyways, to the important stuff...

**Event**: English Premier League: Crystal Palace vs. Manchester City 6:00am PST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>**: Manchester City ML (-118) 2u

**Write up:**

Manchester City started off the season pretty rocky but have finally found their form as of late. Coming off a massive 1-2 win over Real Madrid and a nice 3-0 against Sunderland on the weekend, City have been rolling recently. After the result of the Arsenal game <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, City and Pep know that tomorrow is a must win game if they want to raise the trophy this year. City haven&#x27;t been great away from home in the Prem this season, being 3-1-3. With that being said, 2 of the losses came against Villa and Newcastle who are third and fifth in home games this season respectively. City are 4-0-1 in their last 5 premier league games with a goal difference of +7. Palace have given City a lot of trouble the past few years but as someone who&#x27;s watched all of those games, it was ALWAYS because of Eze. 

Palace have been deceivingly good this season, sitting 5th place as of now. With that being said, their only real competition so far this season was Aston Villa (before they got good again). Palace sit 15th in the table at home this season, with a home record of just 2-4-1 and a goal difference of +2. Palace are also missing quite a few key players (Muñoz being the most prominent) and I see Haaland absolutely thrashing that back line without him. Palace have only beat Brentford and Liverpool at home, two pretty poor teams this year. 

Assuming City start the same lineup they&#x27;ve gone with the last 2 games, their attacking threat will be too much for a Palace backline missing one of their best players. Assuming Haaland, Doku, Cherki, and Foden all start, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they score 3 or 4 against this Palace team. In their last 5 games away at Crystal Palace, City are 2-2-1. Again, this Palace team is very very different without Eze and I don&#x27;t see them performing the same way they have in the past. 

BOL!</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>💎<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Buffalo Bills Moneyline
Odds: -118 on FanDuel
Wager: 2.5 Units

Record: 4-3
Net Units: -.17

🏈 NFL, Bills at Patriots, 12/14/25 Sun, 1 pm Eastern Time

Explanation: The Bills can beat the Patriots tomorrow because Buffalo’s offense has been consistently more explosive and efficient than New England’s, and that matters a lot in a game where the market expects scoring. Buffalo is averaging 28.9 points per game (5th in the NFL), while New England is scoring 27.0 points per game.

More importantly though is that Buffalo is one of the league’s best in efficiency (about +0.13 EPA/play) , and with Josh Allen producing 3,083 yards, 22 TD, and a strong completion rate, plus James Cook over 1,300 rushing yards, that can be a problem for the Patriots. 

Buffalo’s offense has been strong against more “normal” competition, and the Patriots have had a soft schedule, so don’t let the 11-2 record fool you. They’re a good team, but don’t let it fool you.</td></tr>

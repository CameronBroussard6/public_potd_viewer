<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Iona -2.5 @1.8 1u to win 0.8u

Write Up:  
 

Iona’s offense finally found rhythm the last couple games better shot selection, guards pushing pace, and they’re actually hitting their open threes instead of just pretending they might. Plus, defensively, they’re way more physical than Quinnipiac is ready for.

And honestly, Iona only needs to win by a couple buckets. With the way they’re attacking the paint and controlling tempo lately, that’s not a big ask. Quinnipiac can hang for stretches, sure, but they don’t have the consistent scoring to punch back for a full 40.</td></tr>

**Net Units: 0.5 units up**

**ROI: 16.67%**

Last Pick: Parks vs Dodin - Dodin Handicap +4 Games @ 1.93 ✅️

It was amazing how Dodin was able to keep this match close, with Parks producing 26 aces. The underdog was still able to hold a decent percentage on both first and second serve and she took this one to 3 sets. Great play here, especially against the number 1 seed in the tournament.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** **Parks vs Korpatsch - Parks ML @ 1.63**

Alycia Parks, currently ranked 71st in the world, is the number 1 seed in this tournament and needs to defend her title points, since she also won in Angers last season. She&#x27;s one of the tallest players on tour, which gives her a big advantage on this surface (Indoor Hard), with the ability to get free points on her first serve much more frequently than most of her opponents. She produced 26 aces in the last round, which might be a good indicator that she can use her best weapon once more to increase her chances of winning the tournament. Her game does have some problems, especially when playing outdoors, as she moves a bit slowly compared to the tour average, and she hits really flat. With this, she ends up making a lot of unforced errors when outdoor conditions nullify her serve power, but the same can&#x27;t be said here in Angers, where she feels much more comfortable.

Korpatsch is a veteran of the circuit now at 30, always seen as an average player with a decent rally tolerance and baseline game, but a weak serve, which has prevented her from standing out from the rest of the WTA tour. Last year, she was defeated specifically by Parks in this tournament in straight sets.

With this, Parks knows that most of her ranking points need to come from Indoor tournaments, and defending this title should be a major priority. With her powerful serve, she should be to simplify each point and win the match. Keep in mind that in order to win this tournament in the previous year, Parks had to defeat Belinda Bencic in the final, the current number 11 in the world.

Good luck!</td></tr>

The two sides already met in October in a game with 15 total corners. In home games this season, Bala Town average 4.40 for, close to 9 total, going over in 7/10 games. In away games, Haverfordwest average 5 for and a 11 total, covering this line in 8/9 games, which makes them arguably the best away matchup for corners in the league. </td></tr>

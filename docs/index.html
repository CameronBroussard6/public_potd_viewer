Man U will be playing against a Burnley squad at the bottom of the table. This will be the first game after they let their coach was let go and they will have former player Darren Fletcher managing the team. I expect a bump in the team’s performance with after letting go of their manager.

In other good news, it’s likely that both Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount return in this game. Even with restricted minutes, these are big additions that should help Manchester United.

Burnley has given up 39 goals in 20 games and has a 3-3-14 record this year and haven’t won a game since Oct 26

Napoli are in amazing form covering the goal line in their last 4 games in a row, at home this season Napoli covered this in 5/7 games, getting a great matchup vs Verona who allow a lot - most recently they suffered a 0-3 defeat to Torino, 0-3 to Milan and 1-2 to Genoa. This season, they&#x27;ve allowed 2+ in 5/9 away games, not allowing vs the weak teams pretty much. Verona average 11 shots away, Napoli allow 11 on average at home, Verona covered in 8/9 away league games this shot line, Napoli allowed in 6/7 home league games. Verona most likely gonna trail <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, so they should be attacking quite a bit.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s Event:** English Premier League (Soccer) | Fulham vs Chelsea (11:30 AM PST)

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Enzo Fernandez 1+ SOT (+110) 1 unit to win 1.1 units

**Write Up:** It&#x27;s not often we get +240 straight picks to cash within 10 minutes of a footy match. But Neco came through for us and had a fantastic game. Nothing more needs saying, it feels great when a good read works out as expected! 

Guys I know I play Enzo a lot but listen, he&#x27;s at plus money again and I can&#x27;t help myself. We&#x27;ve cashed him 5 times now and I&#x27;m going to keep riding it. After the thrilling ending and cash a few days ago, we&#x27;re backing Enzo again. For all the same reasons and a few more. 

The 2nd half under their new interim coach last week was night and day to the first. The tactic changed and Enzo was back to his box crashing self. I expect Chelsea to start the game this way against Fulham, as they&#x27;re not a team you park the bus against. The second reason is that their new manager, Liam Rosenior, will be in the stands watching. The players will want to impress their new coach, so I see Chelsea coming out strong. 

**Please wait for lineups if your book does not void for players who don&#x27;t start.** I warn this a lot, and while I fully expect Enzo to start, we&#x27;ve been burned by stranger coaching subs. These guys are playing a game every 3 days, and so eventually coaches will rotate players. With FA Cup over the weekend and a likely break for many starters, I expect Chelsea to go all out to win this one.

Inter u19 vs Sampdoria u19, over 2.5 goals + Inter u19 or draw, @ 1.82

Inter U19 vs Sampdoria U19 looks ideal for over 2.5 goals. Inter’s youth side plays aggressive, high-tempo football and creates plenty of chances, especially at home. Sampdoria U19 may struggle defensively but usually contributes going forward, leaving space at the back. Youth matches are often open and unpredictable, and with both teams preferring attack over control, goals should come early and continue throughout the game. It seems that over 3.5 goals is not available for this match so i just added inter or draw. </td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Maria Sakkari 🇬🇷 O2.5 double faults vs Coco Gauff 🇺🇸 3 units to win 2.2U @1.73 (FanDuel)

Write-up: Turns out it was St. Nicolas that swung by on Christmas eve. I said that I was slightly worried about Liaoning’s form heading into this one and they ended up losing 25-12, 25-19, 25-12 to miss by 6 points. Regardless I still find the line was way too low so I can’t beat myself up for it and it did in fact end up moving to 126.5.

You know what my New Year’s resolution is? To go 365-0 on this thread. Well actually 358-0 because I’ve been testing my models. <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> is day one of that. To recap the year it was alright with some ups (getting 10 wins in a row) and downs (towards the end was abysmal, sorry tailers). I do want to highlight I did win a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> that u/sigmabale tailed on 12/17/25 which is by far my biggest achievement in life. Really stop-start recently, the trends analyses weren’t working unfortunately. Variance? Maybe, but I’ll be focusing on my double faults plays now that the tennis season is back that brought me so much success + maybe the occasional prop I like. Tried something new in the off-season and it didn’t pay off, so be it that’s what betting is all about.

I missed the thread being posted (sorry) but there’s about 2 hours to tail this so I’ll make it very quick. Sakkari has averaged a 5.3% double fault rate over the past year on hard courts. Using both players’ serving/returning stats + ELO differences I get an estimated 3.9 double faults for Maria across 21 games, anchoring it to the market line. That gives this play an estimated 72% chance of winning. She’s covered the line in 6/8 HC matches against the American though I will say that she didn’t DF the last time both played which I’m not worried about considering she’d committed 6 the week before that against Gauff last year. I actually think it’ll be a longer match than that which is good for the play because the Greek has looked very good in her opening two United Cup matches over strong opposition whilst Gauff was terrible against JBM.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:**

**Tennis - ATP Brisbane - Lehecka ML** \[2U to win 1.4u (-143)\]

Time: 11:10PM EST

Reasoning: Lehecka just beat Machac showing he&#x27;s in decent form at least. He hits with a lot of power and was improving his game a lot towards the end of last season. I think he&#x27;s undervalued here against Korda who&#x27;s prone to choking, and think his game doesn&#x27;t up well against Lehecka&#x27;s hard hitting. Korda beat Vacherot 2-0 but I think Vacherot is very overvalued due to his miracle masters win last season so the odds are overvaluing Korda&#x27;s win. 



Lehecka also leads the H2H 2-0.</td></tr>

**Event:** Spanish Super Cup, FC Barcelona v Athletic Bilbao, 2:00 pm EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Athletic Bilbao +1.0 Asian Handicap +105, 3 units

**Write Up:** Yes, I am once again fading Barcelona, but I truly believe <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> is going to be the day they slip up. Their high line has been getting away with too much, but in a match of this caliber, everything is going to look different and Athletic Bilbao aren&#x27;t letting their mistakes go unpunished. Hear me out.

Barcelona’s current *eight game winning streak and domestic superiority* sure sound impressive, but most of those victories have been **anything but smooth sailing.** Even in their latest game (against Espanyol) they were under heavy fire for the majority of the match and only a generational performance by Joan Garcia saved them from a potential embarrassment. We&#x27;ve seen this time and time again, and I just don&#x27;t think Barcelona can survive playing like this for much longer. On the other side we have Athletic, on a very mixed run of form, but a team that is **more than solid in cup competitions.** They have **more Copa del Rey titles than Real Madrid,** for example, and have **won the Super Cup three times,** with the most recent win coming in 2021 (against Barca as well), but they&#x27;ve also reached the final the following year. In fact, they&#x27;ve **beaten Barcelona 3 times in the last 8** matches, suggesting that making life harder for the Catalan giant isn&#x27;t a one-off occurence and that the play absolutely holds value at these scrumptious odds of +105.

Athletic Bilbao are set up for a season of mediocrity, being somewhat disappointing in LaLiga and the Copa del Rey *(getting a narrow win against Ourense)* so far, as well as having an abysmal time in the Champions League, and that&#x27;s why they&#x27;re going to put **all their focus towards this competition** as it&#x27;s realistically the only way they could collect some silverware come the end of the season.

I also like the fact **Raphinha seemed completely ineffective** in the most recent game, showing that he hasn&#x27;t quite shaken off his knock, while **Rashford seems to be on a crazy downtrend,** looking more and more of a ghost with each passing game *(bro thinks he&#x27;s secured that contract).* **Yamal is also operating at about 80%,** trying to adapt to a new playing style. Meanwhile, in the midfield, **Frenkie de Jong often fails to control the game&#x27;s tempo,** needlessly holding on to the ball and always making the most uncreative decision. **Pedri is also questionable because of the recent injury** (and ONLY because of that, as he&#x27;s otherwise absolutely brilliant; without a doubt one of the best midfielders in the world). I don&#x27;t think their **defence** needs much of an introduction, they&#x27;re **all shakey** and only have Joan Garcia to thank for keeping the scorelines respectable. The team as a whole **keeps relying on Lewandowski&#x27;s magic** off the bench, as well as **random moments of brilliance** from Yamal, Ferran Torres, Fermin and Olmo, but that&#x27;s just not going to reliably happen. Joan was extra hyped up to deliver a cracking performance against Espanyol as that was his former club that now hates him for switching to their rivals, I can&#x27;t see him have a performance at the same level again.

Overall, everything is setting itself up nicely for a game, which Athletic Bilbao can definitely get something out of. They&#x27;re a solid team that can always cause troubles to even the most elite clubs, as they&#x27;re **hard to break down** and have the amazingly talented **Nico Williams** always ready to blow past the opposing defenders. *They do have a few absences of their own, but I don&#x27;t think they matter as much in the grand scheme of things.*

Bear in mind, this is a knockout where tactics tend to be more cautious and even **small mistakes are punished,** that&#x27;s why I can absolutely see Athletic Bilbao nab a cheeky win *(feeling a 2-1 here honestly)* or a draw *(which still wouldn&#x27;t be disastrous all things considered).* I love the look of this matchup, been excited for it since the start of the year, so I&#x27;m going in with 3 whole units. If Flick fields Ferran in the starting XI, I&#x27;m loving these odds even more. I also like the BTTS Yes and the Under 3.5 goals angle, if you want to take those instead. Either way, BOL y&#x27;all and let&#x27;s enjoy some Spanish Super Cup madness, the Espanyol match certainly did not disappoint and this one has all the signs of a classic ☘️🫡</td></tr>

Last Pick: Jan-Lennard Struff to win 2-0 vs Botic van de Zandschulp (+175, 1 unit): Loss

Tennis | Canberra Challenger | 12:30 AM EST (estimated)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Rafael Jódar vs Jaime Faria | **Jódar -3.5 games at -138 (BET365). 1 unit.**

Write-up: Tough loss. Struff wasn&#x27;t able to get the break back in the first set from 15-40, and ended up losing the match in three sets. While that <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> wasn&#x27;t the best, I&#x27;m still happy with my overall form (17-3 L20), and am looking forward to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>&#x27;s play. 

Rafa Jodar has seen an incredible rise over the past few years, to the point where he has now viewed as the top young prospect in a highly talented Spanish crop. He recently chose to forgo his remaining three years of college tennis eligibility, which wasn&#x27;t a huge surprise after he earned a spot in Australian Open qualifying and defeated ATP #26 Learner Tien at the Next Gen Finals in Jeddah. This should allow him to focus his energy on breaking onto the main tour in 2026, and this isn&#x27;t the first time a player has used the Canberra Challenger as a starting point. Last year, we saw Brazilian sensation Joao Fonseca capture the title; the year before, Jakub Mensik made a run to the final to start an excellent 2024 campaign. Jodar has already won two qualifying matches (including one on center court, where he&#x27;ll be playing <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>), and one main draw match (defeated big server Nicolas Jarry 3 &amp; 4). Last year, Jodar played primarily on hard courts, which allowed him to develop an aggressive game that perfectly suits the surface.

There&#x27;s no doubt that Jaime Faria is a nice talent in his own right. Faria rose to prominence at last year&#x27;s Australian Open, where he took a set off Djokovic, but injuries ended up significantly disrupting his 2025 campaign. He was able to defeat Elmer Moller easily in the first round, but Moller is pretty much a clay specialist right now, and Faria was only priced at even money. This should be a much bigger test of whether he&#x27;s back to his old form, and I don&#x27;t see him on the same level as Jodar regardless. Faria does have a big serve and forehand, but Jodar isn&#x27;t a serve-dominant player, and I don&#x27;t expect this to turn into a servebotting fest. These are some really nice odds for this play, but I would take this up to around -150.</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>Manchester United @ 1.73 (Unibet) - €300.00

Last 5 &gt; WLWWW // Profit: €2,179.00

United have just fired their main coach, which in my books was an awful decision, since Amorim was really rebuilding United. Anyway, the new manager bounce effect is real even with the current one just being an interim.

This could also not have been against a better suiting side since Burnley are currently on the worst run in the prem with an 11 game winless streak which they have drawn just 2 of. In my books United have improved A LOT and Amorim fixed a lot of things like the xG and discipline of the squad, they have been way more cohesive since his appointment. The interim manager who is the manager of United U18s have managed that youth team to a 2nd place this season, let’s see if he can carry his tactics to the men’s team.

On the H2H side United are 7-2-1 in their last 10 recent meetings with Burnley and when playing at Burnley they are an overall 6-2-1 against them where they are on a streak of 8 games unbeaten at Burnley. Of course lots of things have changed and this United squad is very different, but it is still worth mentioning.</td></tr>

Stake: 2.5 units

Write Up:

Coming off a winning <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, so sticking with what’s working.

I’m backing Aston Villa away at Crystal Palace. Villa are absolutely flying right now with 12 wins in their last 13 games. Confidence is sky high and they look comfortable controlling games regardless of venue.

Crystal Palace are going the opposite direction. They’re on a seven-game winless streak and have lost four of their last five league matches. Performances look flat and momentum is clearly missing.

There’s also a lot of uncertainty around Palace at the moment. Their coach is being linked with the Manchester United job after Amorim was sacked this week, and situations like that rarely help a struggling squad. It’s a big contrast to this Villa side that looks settled, confident, and fully focused.

At +125, I’m happy to side with the team in form against one that’s struggling.

[*https://ibb.co/TqLs3ymz*](https://ibb.co/TqLs3ymz)





Odds opened at evens for Iatcenko and are going up. The reason I guess is her left quadriceps/thigh was heavily taped in yesterday match against Aiava. She asked for a MTO at 6-7 2-1 for leg problems, but it didn&#x27;t seem to bother her too much later as she went on to turn the match around and win 6-7 6-3 6-3. It was her R1 match after two impressive wins in Q against Wei and Shibahara. She is a young Russian with a complete game who had a breakthrough 2025. and will try to establish herself on Tour in 2026. I really like her in a matchup against Garland who is one of my favorite fades in WTA. Classic brainless ballbasher who reaches highest highs and lowest lows in same match. Iatcenko has a pretty consistent gamestyle, placing heavy balls deep into court, moving opponents and will make Garland hit on the run. It&#x27;s a gamble since Iatcenko condition is not fully known, but given I consider her a favorite here I just can&#x27;t miss her at these odds. H2H is 1-0 for Garland, 6-2 6-1 in 2024., but a lot changed since.

**Game: Man City VS Brighton - 2:30 PM EST**

City are going to look to try and shut this game down as early as they can after back-to-back dropped points in a title race, they need to find a way to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> up the pace. They conceded a last-minute equalizer on the weekend and have now lost 2 of their starting CBs which mean the best way they&#x27;re going to keep the ball out of the net is by keeping it in Brighton&#x27;s half.

&gt; **Write Up:** This <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> is from my soccer model that I&#x27;ve been using for the past two years. It assigns ELO ratings to players and projects a win chance based on the combined ELO ratings of the players on each team. TeamReddit is projecting a 62% win chance here which creates value here on the ML.</td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>

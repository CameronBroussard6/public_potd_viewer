In Burnley last 10 Premier League games, their opponents have had over 2.5 corners in the first half in 8/10 of those matches with the only misses coming against a struggling Wolverhampton side and Sunderland. 



Chelsea are going to look to put pressure on the rest of the league with an early win tomorrow.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Iowa -16.5 -115 5u to win 4.5u

Iowa Hawkeyes vs Michigan State Spartans, Kinnick Stadium, Iowa City, IA 3:30pm


Every Iowa <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> I’ve posted thus far has cashed. This is a great spot for the Hawkeyes playing their final home game of the season at Kinnick in what will turn into a night game on senior night. 

Iowa is 8-1 this season ATTS against Division 1 opponents. They keep games extremely tight against top level competition, and blow the doors off of lesser opponents. This is the first time all season that they’ve been favored by double digits against a P4 opponent, and with an average win margin of 28 against non ranked opponents, this game will follow the same story against Michigan State.

Iowa has finally unlocked a bit of a passing game from Mark Gronowski, and their OC Tim Lester does an extremely good job horizontally attacking the field. This team has gotten better and better in every facet week by week. 

The only way to beat Iowa is to be truly elite. USC has Lemon and Lane, and were just chucking up 50/50 balls to them, in which they went 8/10. Both receivers are likely to be first round picks in this years NFL draft, and they used them to barely squeak out a win against Iowa. Oregon used their #1 nationally rushing offense and elite heisman caliber QB to squeak out of Iowa City with a win. Indiana used their Heisman front runner QB to barely squeak out of Iowa City with a win. Iowa State threw the ball to their 6’8 tight ends and got a few really good bounces to win in a rivalry game.

Rutgers lost by 10 points to Iowa but was able to keep the game competitive by throwing to their elite WR’s who will be 1st or 2nd round draft picks.

In games where teams don’t truly have a nationally elite threat, Iowa steps on their neck like they did against Minnesota, winning 41-3, against Wisconsin winning 37-0. 

Michigan State’s offense ranks 65th in the country per PFF, and their defense ranks 115th in the country. Michigan State is They’re banged up at the QB position, potentially having to turn to their third string freshman QB if Chiles or Milijovic aren’t ready to go. The last place I want to be when making my first collegiate start is Iowa City in November against a Phil Parker defense. Michigan State is 0-7 in conference play, having gotten spanked by every team in the Big 10 by a minimum of 10 points, with the exception being Minnesota, where they only lost by 3.

Michigan State has one of the most abysmal O-lines in the country, ranking 121st at pass blocking. Iowa has one of the best pass rushes in the country, ranking 9th. If Iowa can get them behind the sticks with a sack, there’s very little chance of Michigan State getting anything going to advance the drive.

Iowa has gone through a gauntlet of top ranked opponents in the past 3 weeks, and will look to enforce their will against a dog shit Michigan State team on senior night. This is one of the only times I’ve felt Iowa will come into a game explicitly looking to run up the score and excite the fans. Good luck!</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>**POTD Record:** 5-3

**Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** John McGinn 1+ SOT (+110) ❌️

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s Event:** English Premier League | Burnley vs Chelsea (4:30 AM PST)

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Enzo Fernandez 1+ SOT (+100) 1 unit to win 1 unit

**Write Up:** Wellp you cant win them all. McGinn had two great chances, one shot bent literally inches over and outside the post and the 2nd was a rocket into the crowd that took an unlucky block by a defender. At least it was a super fun game to watch as expected. We move on. 

Premier League is back after the international break, and we&#x27;ve got a great slate this weekend! <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> we&#x27;re naturally back in England as 17th place Burnley hosts 3rd place Chelsea in the early early window. And we are running back our very first <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> and backing Enzo Fernandez for 1+ shot on target. Chelsea will want and expect a decisive win here to collect all 3 points and continue their promising start to the season, whereas Burnley are fighting to stay above the relegation zone. 

I was honestly shocked to see this line so high. Enzo has hit at least one SOT in his last 5/5 EPL matches and now 7 of 8 in all comps since Palmer has been out. Palmer is training again, but still out for this match per coach. Enzo did <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> up an injury before the international break, but is fully recovered and available according to coach Maresca. There is a non-zero chance he does not start, but I still like thisnif he comes on as a sub. **You may want to wait for lineups an hour before gametime if you are worried about this.** I&#x27;ll be asleep until kickoff, so I&#x27;m taking it now. 

The same data still applies from my last post - Enzo is the team captain, the likely penalty taker, and loves to shoot (free kicks, outside the box, headers in the box, etc). Burnley hold more possession than you&#x27;d expect a bottom 5 team to, but they also give up a lot of shots - 15 (7 SOT) to Wolves, 12 (8) to Arsenal, and 15 (6) to West Ham over their last 3. 

We cashed this at -110 a few weeks ago, hoping we can run it back for even money. BOL and have a great weekend!</td></tr>

What a performance for the Texans defense after halftime. They completely shut down the Bills offense and allowed only 3 points in the second half. This one came down to the wire and I loved watching this game!

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> 11/22/25: Total match points U42.5 (-105 Bet365)

Event: Missouri @ Oklahoma 10:00MST

Write up: This week Missouri will be visiting Oklahoma in what I predict to be a close and low scoring affair between a lackluster Sooners offense and a run first Tiger&#x27;s team. Missouri has been living and dying on the run this year and ranks top 15 in every major rushing category this season. However, they will be going up against a very tough and stingy Oklahoma rush defense. The Sooners defense has allowed only 82 yards per game and a very strict 2.5 yards per carry this season and I believe they will prove to be a very difficult obstacle for Missouri&#x27;s fairly one dimensional offensive attack. Although Missouri has done very well vs. the under, out of their two away games this year, they both have hit the under. There&#x27;s not much to be said about the Sooners on the other side of the ball. The offense has been a very lackluster part of the team and Mateer hasn&#x27;t been playing well since his injuring his hand against Auburn earlier this season. Not to mention, Missouri&#x27;s defense hasn&#x27;t been great by any stretch of the word but they have been very competent against the run and pass and they tackle incredibly well with a 90% tackle success rate that&#x27;s good enough to be ranked 4th in the nation. I don&#x27;t trust Oklahoma to be able to keep the scoring consistent as they have hit the under in 4 of their last 5 games and I don&#x27;t forsee much of a turn around moving into this game.

Tail or fade BOL to everyone and cheers! 🍻</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>TODAY</mark>’S FIXTURE: Wales v New Zealand (Rugby) 15:10uk / 10:10EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>PICK</mark>: New Zealand -28.5 @ 2.0 (3U)

WRITE UP:
Back in business with another big day of rugby internationals. All bet worthy but <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> of the bunch is New Zealand -28.5 v Wales.

Now worth noting New Zealand have rotated after defeat to England last week but their side still possesses quality wales can only dream of. That added to the fact wales have lost 2/3 of their best players , it isn’t looking good.

This line is fairly aggressive but it could get silly in Cardiff. Wales did scrape past Japan last week by 2 points , but that ended a 10 match home defeat record and was only their 2nd win in 20 games - the other of which also coming vs Japan.

New Zealand will want to round of their tour of the northern hemisphere in the only way they know how and that is in style. 

I won’t be suprised to see them put 50+ points on the board and crushing this developing Welsh side.

Let’s hope I’m right as 3 units.

**Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:**Parlay@2.99 (Coolbet) | **Stake: 2u LOSS**

1. Celtic vs Utrecht (1st Half: Celtic To Win)@1.75
2. Midtjylland vs Dinamo Zagreb (Over 2.5 Goals)@1.71

**Recap:** Celtic easily wins ther first half, but it ends with two goals in Denmark

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s Event:** Bundesliga  | Cologne vs Wolfsburg | 20:30 GMT +2

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Cologne -1.5 Corners@1.95 (Coolbet) | **Stake: 3.5u**

**Write Up:** 

* Wolfsburg corners against away: 15, 6, 6, 14, 13, 11, 10, 9 | WTF!

And it goes without saying that they have lost the corner battle in each of these games by two or more. The guests have also lost the 1st half by two or more corners in 7 of their last 8 on the road. Cologne aren&#x27;t the biggest corner takers in the league, but they average 4.90 from their last eight home games vs Wolfsburg’s 2.70 on the road. Since they got back up into the Bundesliga, Cologne has hosted Wolfsburg three times and won the corner battle: 6-1, 10-1 and 9-2.

So no long write up <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> and kinda of a boring very stats based bet, BOL 🍀</td></tr>

Event: Soccer/Football, [Peru Liga 1] Sport Huancayo vs Alianza Lima


<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: BTTS @ 1.80


Sport Huancayo were the best btts hitting side in the league split that ended most recently - managing a btts hit in 8/8 home games. Alianza Lima hit in 5/8 away games. The same meeting ended 2-1 last season. Both sides have undergone manager changes, however they still look good for a btts here. Alianza Lima also played a couple of games already in January, hitting a btts in 3/4 games.</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>Nurnberg @ 1.93 - €300.00 // Bundesliga 2

Last 5 &gt; WLWWW // Profit: €3,808.04

9^(th) placed Nurnberg vs 15^(th) placed Munster. At home Nurnberg are a good team ranking 6^(th) with a 5-3-2 record and a 14:12 goal diff. We are going to have the 6^(th) team at home against the last team on the road <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, with Munster being 2-0-7 and having a negative goal diff of 9:17.

What makes this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> even more interesting is that Munster have lost 2 key players for this match, due to a red card. Not to mention that Nurnberg are also 4-1-0 in their last 5 home games. H2H in advantage of Nurnberg, being 2-0-1.</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>**Record:** 43-21-1 (+23.37u)

**Last:** (CBB) Illinois -12.5 (1.5u) - Pending

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** (CBB) No. 7 Michigan State ML vs No. 3 Michigan

**Start Time:** 8:00 PM ET (FOX)

**Odds:** \+104 (FanDuel)

**Units:** 1.5U

**Reasoning:** While there’s no love lost between Michigan and Michigan State, both schools can agree on one sentiment: defense is the name of the game.

For the Spartans (19-2), they enter among the nation’s elite defensively, ranking 5th in scoring defense (63.5 PPGA), 5th in opponent field-goal percentage (38.9%), 9th in defensive efficiency (0.919) and 31st in opponent three-point shooting (30.1%). The Wolverines (19-1) counter with a defensive unit that might be even better, 42nd in opponent three-point percentage (30.4%) and 48th in scoring defense (68.8 PPGA). So while defense may win championships, it might also go a long way in settling one of college basketball’s most heated rivalries on Friday night.

Surprisingly, it’s been a rivalry that’s been awfully one-sided as of late.

Michigan State has won four straight and five of the last six contests against its in-state rival dating back to 2023. In fact, not only has the team won 11 of the last 15 overall meetings against Michigan, it also holds an impressive 19-3 mark at home. That includes seven consecutive victories at the Breslin Center, with all but two coming by 12+ points. You’d have to go back 2,938 days and two Wolverines head coaches ago to find the last time the Spartans dropped one at East Lansing (Jan. 13, 2018).

It certainly doesn’t help Michigan that its level of play has been heading in the wrong direction.

After two close calls against Wake Forest and TCU within their opening three games of the season, the Wolverines responded by winning each of their next 10 contests by 15 or more points, including all but two by 28+. Another deep run in March appeared all but assured with the team even being listed as high as +450 to cut down the nets.

However, things have taken a turn for the worse over the last seven games.

**MICHIGAN UNTIL JAN. 2 / SINCE JAN. 3**

* **Record (ATS):** 13-0 (9-4) / 6-1 (0-7) 
* **Barthag:** 1st (.9909)/ 13th (.9436) 
* **Adjusted Offensive Efficiency:** 2nd (129.3) / 33rd (122.0)  
* **Adjusted Defensive Efficiency:** 1st (86.0) / 15th (95.5)  
* **Effective FG%:** 1st (61.8%) / 71st (54.5%)  
* **Efective FGD%:** 1st (40.7%) 92nd (49.2%)  
* **Turnover%:** 136th (16.7%) / 283rd (18.2%) 
* **2PT%:** 1st (65.1%) / 4th (62.2%)  
* **2PTD%:** 1st (38.2%) / 103rd (49.1%)  
* **3PT%:** 27th (38.3%) / 348th (28.2%)  
* **3PTD%:** 36th (29.5%) / 140th (32.9%)

Not only has Michigan failed to cover its each of the seven contests, but the team suffered its first loss of the season in rather embarrassing fashion—a 91-88 loss to Wisconsin at home as 19.5-point favorites. The statistical fall-off across the board defensively would be concerning on its own, but its especially worrisome against a Michigan State offense that enters averaging 82.3 points on 55.6% shooting (39.3% from beyond the arc) over its last three games. Look for Big Ten POTY candidate Jeremy Fears Jr. to continue his torrid run—20.4 points and 9.2 assists on 56.4% shooting over his last five outings—to lead the charge in taking advantage of these weak points.

Rebounding will play a pivotal role on Friday night.

Both of these teams have made a living dominating opponents on the glass this season, as the Wolverines rank 6th in total rebounding (42.0 per game) while the Spartans rank 12th in the category (41.4). However, what could break the stalemate is offensive rebounding, where Michigan State ranks 22nd with 11.5 offensive rebounds per game and 1st in limiting such opportunities for opponents (6.2) while Michigan ranks just 107th in offensive rebounding (9.9) and a troubling 209th in opponent offensive rebounding (9.3). This is where the Spartans can truly do some damage, as the team ranks 23rd in second-chance points (14.4 PPG; 94th percentile) and 1st in opponent second-chance points (6.4 PPG; 100th percentile). That’s concerning news for the Wolverines who find themselves among the worst in the country in the category, ranking 304th in opponent second-chance points (12.6; 17th percentile).

Not surprisingly, turnovers will be the X factor in this one.

Neither of these teams have been the model of clean handling of the basketball thus far. Through 20 games, Michigan ranks 161st in opponent steals (6.6), 172nd in turnovers per possession (16.5%) and 267th in turnovers (12.7) while Michigan State enters ranked 216th in turnovers (12.2), 243rd in turnovers per possession (17.6%) and 254th in opponent steals (7.2). However, things have been especially alarming for the Wolverines as of late, as the team has seen its averages balloon to 8.1 opponent steals and 15.3 turnovers over its last four contests while registering a 21.7% mark in turnovers per possession. It will be imperative for a Spartans team that doesn’t force too many turnovers—225th in turnovers forced per possession (15.9%), 245th in turnovers forced (11.0) and 288th in steals (5.6)—to find a way to change that.

Finally, on a lighter note, Friday also marks the birthday of Michigan State head coach Tom Izzo.

If you love trends, consider this: The Spartans are 7-1 when playing on Izzo’s birthday, including 3-0 against Michigan. That includes an 81-62 throttling of the Wolverines back in 2024.

In what should be an early-candidate for Game of the Year, trust Sparty to emerge victorious.

Last POTD: [Wisconsin -3.5 + Houston ML](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/s/vxZwcsBDjy) ✅

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: NCAAMB: Michigan State +1.5 vs Michigan -108 (0.50U TO WIN 0.42U)** 

Write up: 0.50U on this one because this will be a nail bitter - On another note, I cannot believe Wisconsin shot that bad in the 1H and still found a way to cover the -3.5 for us - Model has this as the highest confident Edge % and EV % for the day. Will add some personal information in this write-up as well.

• ⁠Model has Michigan State ML at 52% 

• Model has Michigan State +1.5 at 53% 

• EV better betting 100$ = 7-9$ for this play

• Michigan State opens up as underdog, at home, vs a Michigan team who has continued to show us that they deserve to be a top 3 team in the country - You guys know me, the first thing I’m going to say here is that this is a rivalry game, and the team that is at home, is an underdog, and I’m taking the bait, once again - Home court advantage is a real thing, and will always play a factor one way or another - Michigan leads in most metrics but man MSU has been rolling, they have been battled tested, and are on a 7 game win streak - They should come out flying high after their awesome comeback victory over Rutgers on the road earlier this week - Michigan State is 11-1 at home this year, with the lone loss being Duke and the Boozier brothers - I took Nebraska +11.5 earlier this week against Michigan and a big reason for that bet was due to the fact that, although Michigan has been rolling this season, they are 0-7 L7 ATS - On the flip side, and a big reason why I am only laying 0.50U on this one, because Michigan has that offensive threat that will score 90+ points, any day of the week - that is the risk we run betting against Michigan - Michigan has fallen off a bit in scoring in conference play, and when teams can stop them from going on their shooting hot streak, which they have been, the chance of winning and more of a chance of covering - I think the over under should be set at around 160.5, given these offenses, the line should be higher than 145.5 - this line tells me that defense will play a big factor, and also tells me that Vegas may not predict many big Michigan runs, which favors the Spartans - Both teams have a top 5 defense in the country, Michigan State has a small rebounding edge, Michigan plays at a high pace, but Michigan defense tends to control the pace of play more at home, than on the road - Tom Izzo will have a game-plan in this one, and if the players can execute, I believe they will pull this one out towards the end - Taking Michigan State +1.5 here due to them being at home, Michigan’s ATS record, Michigan State’s defensive edge at home,  and Tom Izzo

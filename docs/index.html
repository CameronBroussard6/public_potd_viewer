Football | Champions League | Club Brugge vs Arsenal | in \~18hrs

Arsenal -1 Handicap @ 1.6 (1u)

Write Up: While i stayed away from the CL yesterday, since i couldnt trust the Chelsea &amp; Liverpool games (for good reason too), Im going to place a bet on Arsenal, who have possibly been one of the best teams in Europe vs one of the whipping boys in Champions league. Should expect them to win quite comfortably. But, due to key player injuries, I&#x27;m not sure if they can keep a clean sheet &amp; may concede a goal or 2. So, I&#x27;m avoiding the clean sheet stats &amp; going with Arsenal -1 Handicap

Note : My bet means that, if Arsenal win by 1, we get refund. If they win by 2 or more, we get the winnings

Hope we rebound from the loss &amp; BoL</td></tr>

Event: NBA |  Spurs @ Lakers | 8.15PM EST


<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Lakers -5.5 @2.00 2u to win 2u


Write Up:  




The matchup tilts heavily toward the Lakers due to both injury context and current form. San Antonio enters this game without Victor Wembanyama, their anchor on both ends of the floor. In the games he has missed, the Spurs defensive efficiency drops significantly, especially around the rim where Wembanyama usually erases mistakes and deters drives. With Luke Kornet still questionable and Jordan McLaughlin out, San Antonio lacks both size and rotational stability, forcing them to rely on smaller lineups that have struggled defensively.


The Lakers, meanwhile, have been trending upward. Even with Marcus Smart out, their core rotation remains intact and has produced more consistent two-way basketball over the last stretch of games. Los Angeles has tightened its half-court execution, improved ball movement, and reduced defensive lapses  all areas where San Antonio continues to struggle, especially on the road.


Without Wembanyama, the Spurs often fail to generate enough stops to stay within striking distance against disciplined offenses. The Lakers ability to pressure the paint, control the glass, and dictate pace becomes a decisive advantage here. This sets up a scenario where LA can build and maintain separation throughout the game.</td></tr>

__Event:__ NBA: Suns @ Thunder 7:30pm EST

__POTD:__ Collin Gillespie o2.5 3PM (-125), 3.75u to win 3u

__Write Up:__ I find it crazy NBA Hall of Famer Joe Ingles hasn’t had a single NBA <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> in 90 write-up’s. That changes <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. The Oklahoma City Thunder (23-1) are heavily favored (by -15.5 points) to continue an 11 game home winning streak when they host the Phoenix Suns (14-10) on Wednesday night, in an elimination game in the Quarterfinals of the NBA Cup. Oklahoma City is coming off a 30 point win over the Utah Jazz this past Sunday. With the win, the Thunder tied their franchise record with 15 consecutive wins. They became the THIRD team in NBA history to start a season 23‑1 or better, along with the 1970 Knicks (23-1) &amp; 2016 Warriors (24-0). What’s even scarier is that their starting five has played zero minutes together so far this season (SGA, Dort, JDub, Chet, I-Hart). To make it to the Semi’s of the NBA Cup they’ll be up against a Suns team that played them close just a little over a week ago on Black Friday with a final score of Suns 119 to Thunder 123. The Suns have played well this year, currently 7th in the Western Conference standings, despite dealing with injuries all year long with Guard Jalen Green having missed 22 games, DBook missing some games, Grayson Allen, as well as others. This has resulted in Collin Gillespie stepping up &amp; instantly becoming one of the Suns most feared weapons.

The Suns are coming off a huge win at Minnesota on Monday night, without star Devin Booker. He’s been out for more than a week with a right groin strain, but Phoenix head coach Jordan Ott said that he could play on Wednesday. Booker has taken complete control of the Suns since they traded away Kevin Durant in the offseason. Booker is averaging 25 points, 6.7 assists, &amp; 4.3 rebounds per game. What has this cause opposing defenses to do? Double team the hell out of him. __Besides Giannis who is a freak, Devin Booker is getting double teamed at the highest rate in the league, on 21.15% of his touches. Among the Top 10 most double teamed players, he is shooting the least amount when doubled, just 19.12% of the time. He is passing on 60.5% of his touches when doubled, highest rate in the NBA.__ He is getting majority of the attention of opposing defenses &amp; is finding his open teammates. Collin Gillespie has benefited from this more than anyone as he is one of the best catch &amp; shooters in the league. Gillespie, 2018 NCAA Champion at Villanova &amp; 2023 NBA Champion with the Nuggets, went undrafted in the 2022 NBA draft. In his first season in the league with Denver he played just 9 minutes per game averaging 3.6 points. Phoenix signed him last year &amp; his minutes increased to 14 per game &amp; he averaged 5.9 points. Now this year, in his 3rd season, his career has taken off. __Over his last 10 games Gillespie is averaging 18.7 points per game, 4.5 assists per game, 4.2 rebounds per game, &amp; has a 65.5% True Shooting percentage.__ Gillespie is now one of the front runners for the NBA’s Most Improved Player Award, as well as in contention for 6th Man of the Year. But he is likely playing his way out of the 6MOY because he has earned a spot in the starting lineup with his stellar play. Where he has excelled has been behind the 3 point line. Gillespie has become one of the best shooters in the league lately. Just last week he had a Career High 28 points vs the a Lakers, knocking down 8 three pointers. Just 2 games before vs OKC he had 24 points, with 6 three’s made. __Gillespie has made 3+ three pointers now in 9 of his last 10 games, hitting 4+ in 6 of them.__ Where he has been the most efficient has been hitting 3’s at the top of the key. __Gillespie ranks 4th in the NBA amongst Guards over the last 10 games in Three Pointers Made at the top of the key, averaging 3.5 per game (shooting 46.1%). He gets a juice matchup vs the Thunder who are allowing the 3rd most 3PM to Guards at the top of the key over their last 10 games, allowing 6.8 per game. This was evident less than 2 weeks ago vs OKC when he knocked down 6 threes on them. OKC has allowed the 7th most threes in total this season (14.4 per game), while allowing 15.3 in last 3 games.__ Devin Booker’s status is up in the air, but I love this prop either way. If Booker plays, I mentioned earlier he gets doubled a ton &amp; passes to his teammates at the highest rate in the league. __This is great for Gillespie who ranked 1st in the NBA in catch and shoot 3P% (min. 60 attempts), knocking down 51.8%. His 77.6% Effective Field Goal % on catch &amp; shoot shots ranks in the 97th percentile, with his 7 catch &amp; shoot 3’s attempted per game ranking in the 93rd percentile.__ If Booker is out this game, Gillespie will still hit them. He averages 5 Three Pointers Made on 11 Three’s Attempted per 36 minutes without Booker on the floor this season. Regardless he should play at least 26+ minutes. __When Gillespie has played 26+ minutes this season he has had 3+ threes in 13 of 15 games.__ He has proven himself valuable on the court &amp; the statistics prove it. __Collin Gillespie currently ranks 25th in the NBA in Value Over Replacement. To put it in perspective Steph Curry ranks 24th, Jalen Brunson ranks 26th.__

Another huge factor in this game is this is an elimination game for the NBA Cup. Every game teams advance each individual player makes more money, with the opportunity to make $530k if they win the Cup. Gillespie only made $500k in each of his last 2 seasons before this year. This is a big game for him &amp; I fully expect him to eat their butt.

CET 21:00 Football Champions League

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>: Villareal vs Copenhagen to win at 8,5 odds

Reason: Something is not right here. Villreal is heavily underperforming in the Champions League and overperforming in La Liga. My guess is they might lose this one on purpose or go with a weaker squad even, since there is no hope of advancing to top 24. La Liga is their top priority here. They might pull a win vs Ajax in the round after, though. Copenhagen on the other hand is doing decent given the squad and their level of play. They are also capable of winning against top teams from time to time. The odds are wrong according to me and should be alot closer. Let&#x27;s say around 2x for Villareal, draw around 3x and Copenhagen around 4,1-4,5x. This game is closer than it gives the sense of, but the bookies might know something which I don&#x27;t! This was written on my phone. Good luck everyone.

Must win game for Villarreal who have looked really good at home - in all competitions, they scored at least 2 goals at home in 8/9 games. They now face Copenhagen who are not in great form, especially in away games, they&#x27;ve allowed 2+ goals in their latest 6/7 games in all competitions, in CL they lost 0-2 vs Qarabag and 0-4 vs Tottenham in away games. if Copenhagen want any chances of advancing they probably would like their chances in this game considering their final two games are vs Napoli and Barcelona so that should allow for Villarreal goals. The card line has hit for both sides in 5/5 games and the referee is good for cards as well with him reffing 4 games this season in the CL, giving out 7, 4, 5, 2. Villarreal are also one of the best card generating sides in LA LIGA.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Team Liquid -1.5 Maps Handicap vs Nemesis | Team Spirit -1.5 Maps Handicap vs 1WIN Team @ 2.32 odds (1.5u)

Write Up:

Okay, so this parlay is just backing two top tier teams to sweep their opponent. For the Liquid leg, I&#x27;m fading Nemesis because they are currently struggling and just went through a roster change, so their team chemistry is likely not 100% yet. Liquid should be able to capitalize on that instability. For Team Spirit, the data is just too strong to ignore they have beaten 1WIN in 5 of their last 6 matchups, and notably, 4 of those wins were 2-0 sweeps. The stats show Spirit handles this matchup well, so I&#x27;m banking on them to cover the handicap again.

BOL!</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Erling Haaland ATGS and 2+ SOT (+122) 1.0 unit to win 1.22 units

**Write Up:** Hi friends. Back after a week off. We went on a 2 game losing streak, with some major bad luck that Thiago did not start in one of the most baffling lineup decisions of the season. This is always the risk in player props for soccer. **So please always feel free to wait for lineups to be released before making your final decision to tail or fade**. Anyways, we move on. 

Huge matchup <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> as spanish side Real Madrid host EPL Man City in what is likely the match of the week, clash of the titans, insert other hype terms here. Seriously should be a great match. Real Madrid is one of the few non-EPL teams that I follow closely. And they play a very fast game. They shoot a ton, and in turn give up a lot of chances in the form of SOTs and goals. Mbappe is questionable for the match, and if he doesn&#x27;t play I think they&#x27;ll be even more aggressive than usual. 

Haaland has been on a bit of a downtick, only scoring one goal in his last 5 matches. But, as I&#x27;ve said before, big players show up for big games. For the 5 UCL matches this season so far, Haaland is averaging 1 goal per game, 4 shots per game, and 2.2 SOTs per game. He has also scored in every UCL game he&#x27;s started (4/4), but did not score in his last match where he only played the last 25 minutes (he still took 4 shots though!). I really like Haaland here in this fast paced match under the lights in Madrid. 

To be clear, this play is Haaland to Score a goal AND also have 2+ SOTs. Feel free to leave off the 2+ SOTs for less risk if you prefer, I just like the value better. 

BOL everyone and have a great Wednesday!</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** **Kartal vs Kalinina - Under 19.5 Games @ 1.85**

Kartal is here after beating a really weak opponent in the first round by 6-1/6-0, where her level of play was quite high, which might be a sign that she&#x27;s taking this tournament quite seriously, in order to try to climb some ranking spots before the start of the new season. 

Kalinina did not play for 6 months before coming into this tournament and beating Deichmann in straight sets in the previous round, which was an expected win. By missing most of the 2025 season, she&#x27;s now out of the top 150. 

When it comes to playstyles both players like to be aggressive and dictate the pace of each point, with Kartal being superior when it comes to pace absorption and point construction. Kalinina is considerably taller than Kartal but I don&#x27;t consider the Ukrainian a better server. In my opinion, Kartal serves much more efficiently, with a disguised toss and decent accuracy. 

With this, I&#x27;m expecting a one-sided match, especially because Kalinina hasn&#x27;t gained much playing rhythm and is yet to face a player with Kartal&#x27;s quality since her return. The under can work both ways but in summary, this play is focused on Kartal&#x27;s quality.

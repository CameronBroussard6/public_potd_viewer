If you want some added juice, I think Sinner U 21.5 at -230 makes it a +130 play ( Play the parlay at your own risk but this is what I went with)

Took the first loss and it felt bad!! Sorry about it, as I first said I started doing this to keep myself disciplined and accountable for my betting actions. Best way to get back on track is to bet on 2 guys who will always show up. 

If I help you win, do think about giving 1% of your profit on the bet or buy me a coffee :)

We hit another winner with Rosario Central! Now we are heading to the AFC Champions League where the gap between these two teams is massive.

* **World-Class Dominance:** Al Hilal is currently on an incredible 34-match unbeaten streak. They are the most powerful team in asia.
* **Squad Depth:** The difference in quality across the pitch is night and day. Al Hilal has top-tier talent in every position, while Al Wehda arrives in poor form, failing to win any of their last 3 matches.
* **Tactical Mismatch:** While Al Wehda has a decent attacking line that could pose a threat, their defense is their Achilles&#x27; heel. They struggle significantly against high-pressing teams with elite finishing.

The **-1 Asian Handicap** gives us a great safety net: If Al Hilal wins by exactly 1 goal, the bet is a **VOID (Refund)**. If they win by 2 or more, we cash the full ticket.

Sports: Cricket

Yesterday was easy, but <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> is a different story. UAE is unpredictable as you never know which team will show up. We just need them not to throw their wickets away to Rashid. He’s past his peak, and in the last match it was more about NZ batters gifting wickets than him earning them.

UAE will likely play him more cautiously, especially with the Kotla pitch being a batting-friendly surface. Still, keep your stakes strictly to 1u as you never know what’s coming next.

&gt;The playoff picture is beginning to form as round robin play continues and Great Britain and Denmark play early Monday on the women&#x27;s side. Great Britain has a clear positional advantage in a couple spots in this matchup. Dodds has been great and should easily outshoot Halse and Jackson is coming off a 99% game and has been significantly better than Denise. Holtermann is also the worst second at this event. All this to say that Madeleine has been holding this Danish team together and the metrics would suggest that they have not been nearly as good as their record so far. Great Britain has also won the last two matches that these teams have played. The wrong team is favoured here.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Athletic Club vs Elche **BTTS - Yes +** Coventry vs Middlesbrough **Over 1.5 Goals (5u)**

**Odds:** **+138** (+236 for Over 2.5)

**Write Up:** Just can&#x27;t write it, Leipzig fall short despite dominating first half and owning Wolfsburg in most stats (4x the expected goals, 3x shots on target etc.) - simply one of those games that seems to go wrong. Lyon clear the second leg easily 2-0. I will say with most of my lays I rarely ever go 0-2 so I usually put each leg on for a single too, just for damage control. Onto the next!

First up we go to the Spanish top flight, where Athletic sit 9th and Elche in 16th. Important stats you should know this fixture has seen LESS than 2.5 goals 6/8 meetings - HOWEVER here&#x27;s why I am backing BTTS: it historically has a 3/6 hit rate at Athletic. The reverse fixture at the start of the season ended 0-0 at Elche, but current forms are my motivator for this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. Foremost the current records are that BTTS hitting 9/10 for Athletic and 7/8 for Elche. At home Athletic have seen BTTS in 4/8, but noticeably their last 3 (since December 22nd) they have seen this clear against weaker opponents in Levante (19th) and similar quality in Real Sociedad (8th). Elche&#x27;s away record is woeful at 0-4-7, however that has not been for a lack of trying, they have seen goals both ends in 9/11 of their away games. Over 2.5 goals has been seen in 8/10 last Athletic games and 5/6 Elche games. Averages for each team are as follows: Athletic goals for 27(1.13 per game) and goals against 34(1.42 per game) - Elche goals for 31(1.29 per game) and goals against 35(1.46 per game). 

Secondly we go to the English second league where Middlesbrough(1st) travel to Coventry city(2nd). The reverse fixture for this finished 4-2 Coventry at Middlesbrough. I would like to preface this writeup as I am taking the line at over 2.5 goals BUT the odds for that plus the previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> would put us past the +200 as per the rules at +236, tail that line if you will but 1.5 is the safer line. Firstly this matchup has seen over 2.5 goals in 4/5 games. Coventry at home have seen this line clear 7/13, Middlesbrough away have seen it clear 8/15. While these don&#x27;t look particularly enticing lets look at current form. Coventry have won 4 in the last 13, with 5 losses - with injuries (noticably their striker Brandon Thomas-Asante and starting goalkeeper Oliver Dovin) and a short squad Lampard&#x27;s team are seemingly slowing down after a flying start to their campaign. Middlesbrough are on the opposite of the spectrum on a 6 game win streak, scoring 16 and conceding 4. Current form shows over 2.5 goals for Coventry in 4/5 and Middlesbrough 6/7. In a race for the title I expect a high tempo game with plenty of chances both ends just like the reverse fixture, especially if a team concedes then the game should open up. Over 1.5 goals is the safe <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> but personally for the value I am going over 2.5 goals. In total Coventry have 32 goals for and 11 against at home, with 2 out of the last 3 seeing them concede and finish 2-1 against weaker teams than Middlesbrough and Middlesbrough away seeing 3 out of the last 3 away games over 2.5 and BTTS. Simply put current streaks and form show that both teams should find the net and all it will take is either the reliable home team to get two or the on-fire away team to secure 2 like they have in 5/6 with 3 of these seeing them score over 2.5 themselves.

Apologies about the two loses back-to-back, sometimes that happens and such is the nature of the game. Back to winning ways.

BOL and always bet what you can afford to lose!</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: NCAAM: Iowa State ML -130 vs Houston (1U TO WIN 0.70U)**

Write up: A Monday SHOWDOWN - Model has this as the highest confident percentages and hit rate for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Will add some personal information in this write-up as well.

• ⁠Model has Iowa State ML at 58%

• Going against Houston in this showdown - both of Houston&#x27;s loses come on the road this year, at Texas Tech and a neutral site vs Tennessee - One thing that stands out to me in this is that Iowa State is shooting almost 40% from three at home in the Big 12 while Houston is only around 32% - As always, it is Houston&#x27;s defense that typically wins them games, and while they force a lot of turnovers, Iowa State actually takes pretty good care of the ball at home recently - When looking into the data on Iowa State, they are a top 5 team in the country in terms of 3 point %, and top 35 in the country in 2 point % - that being said, on the flip side, Houston is right around the national average when it comes to 3 point shooting - If Iowa State can handle the disruption that Houston likes to cause on D, they have a very, very good chance of winning this game - Both teams have dominant scorers, both teams have good defenses, and this game will come down to the wire - I would like to mention something about home court advantage too, but the way that college basketball has been lately, home court just seems to not matter as much as maybe always thought it did - I really think if Iowa State cannot turn the ball over much, they got this game - they have the defense to stop Houston, and they have the offense to score the ball on a defense like Houston - Between Momcilovic, Jefferson, and Lipsey, I think they have enough firepower to walk away with the W in this one - A small note that I saw online, that I did not think much of was how good Momcilovic is at the FT line - in a close game, down to the wire, I like my chances with him at the FT line - Houston is reliant on their deep ball shot and a lot of mid-range shots - it takes one bad shooting night for them to not be the Houston team all of us have seen this year. Let&#x27;s go Cyclones.

Under 6.5 goals (-125)

Two teams that don&#x27;t allow a lot of goals since the beginning of the tournament. USA only allowed **1 goal** in their 5 games they played while Sweden only allowed 2. Sweden wasn&#x27;t supposed to be here and got a big upset against medal-favorite Czechia by playing a very good defensive game and their young sensation goalie playing once again another solid game. Sweden knows that they don&#x27;t have much chance vs team USA(+2000 to win) so they&#x27;ll definitely go with the same game plan that they did vs Czechia. Keep the score low and play defensively well enough to try to go for a 3-2 or 2-1 upset. With the majority of the crowd there being on their side I expect a solid effort from Sweden.

I know team USA is another beast but they never went the over 6.5 goals line in any of their games these Olympics while Sweden only went over the 6.5 goals once. Every quarterfinals game went under 6.5 also. Overall, I don&#x27;t expect this game to be a high scoring game especially since it&#x27;s the semi-finals and every goal will be important.

Writeup - Going with a Netherlands 2nd division parlay, so staking half a unit.

Leg 1 - Cambuur is 2nd in the league and playing against the bottom side.  Ajax Reserves were beaten 4-0 in their last game, while they lost the reverse fixture 4-1 at Cambuur. The visitors have scored three goals in three of five visits to bottom-half teams, and they can impress once again. Ideally, would go for o2.5 goals Cambuur, but going conservative, hoping for 2 from the visiting side.

Leg 2 - This event has been hit in all of Jong Utrecht&#x27;s last five games and four of Willem II&#x27;s last five matches. Three of the last four head-to-head meetings have also seen over 2.5 goals scored.

*Write-Up* :

This sets up as a serve-dominant opener. Humbert holds in the mid-80% range indoors and Marozsan sits around 80%+, so early breaks should be limited. Both rely heavily on first-serve efficiency and tend to settle in on serve before return games open up.

With two strong indoor hold profiles, first sets between players like this usually stretch into the 10–12 game range. A single break likely isn’t enough to keep this under, and anything on serve through 5-5 clears comfortably.</td></tr>

\-Will have ML picks posted in the esports channel for those interested/can&#x27;t bet player props  
\-**Aurora map 1 ML is a strong replacement imo if you can&#x27;t take player props**

**Initial Player Stats:**

* XANTARES is averaging a .75 KPR L3 months for Aurora, and a .77 KPR in the last month he is still their best player imo, currently in better form with Anubis back in map pool.
* iM is averaging a .72 KPR L3 months for NAVI, with a .68 KPR in the last month. He is the second best player for NAVI in the L3 months and in the last month he has dropped to third behind w0nderful/b1t

**Projected Veto:**

* Aurora ban Ancient, NAVI ban Overpass
* **Aurora <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> Anubis,** NAVI <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> Mirage

**Team Anubis Stats:**

* Aurora are 100% winrate on 4 maps of Anubis in the L3 months, they are the best Anubis team in the world, have been basically since the map was released, they were 22-6 on Anubis when it was in the map pool in early 2025 before being removed. In 2026 so far beaten some very strong Anubis teams (paiN/PARI as well as beating FUT/Falcons)
* NAVI are 0% winrate on 1 map of Anubis in the L3 months, they have always been staying away from this map even when it was in the pool and have struggled on it. They lost to PARIVISION 19-16 in their only map . Despite NAVI having a very strong 2024 on Anubis, they really fell off in 2025 with a 1-5 overall record and avoiding the map at all costs

**Player Anubis Stats:**

* iM averaged a .57 KPR on Anubis in his only map in 2026, a .58 KPR in 2025, and a .67 KPR on the map in 2024. In this 3 year period total, he averaged a .64 KPR on Anubis, a -.06 KPR from his regular average making it one of his worst maps statistically
* XANTARES has averaged a 1.07 KPR on Anubis in 4 maps played so far in 2026, a .79 KPR in 2025 on the map overall, and a .78 KPR in 2024. Overall he has averaged a .80 KPR in the three year period on Anubis, up +.05 KPR from his average making it one of his best maps. Most impressively is how big of a sample of games he has, it is much easier to see big jumps in KPR when sample is small-medium, but for a map he has played nearly 100 times, these are incredibly consistent and strong numbers
* Lots of reasons why its such a good map but one of the big ones is with Wicadia as A anchor, a lot of his kill threat on CT Side goes down, XANTARES has been their big output on CT Side, even historically when the map was much more T sided/favored overall.</td></tr>

Macclesfield vs Brentford, Over 3.5 goals @ 2.01

This matchup has strong potential for goals, especially with Brentford’s attacking quality against lower-league opposition. Brentford typically play with intensity and fluid movement in the final third, which can create multiple scoring chances. Macclesfield may struggle defensively but could contribute on the counter or from set pieces. If the tempo starts fast, this game can open up quickly and push past the four-goal mark.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Juncheng Shang 🇨🇳 to win a set vs Daniil Medvedev 🇷🇺 5 units to win 5U @2.00 (Bet365)

It ain’t 2021 anymore, Medvedev shouldn’t be this much of a favourite these days. I would have fairer odds closer to 1.7. After a really solid start to the season where Meddy won Brisbane, only dropping a single set, he has slightly slipped back into madness. He reached the fourth round in Melbourne beating De Jong 3-0, Halys 3-1, recovered from 2-0 down to Marozsan to seal a victory before being blown off the court by Tien 3-0. Last week, he played in Rotterdam where he lost 2-1 to Humbert and spent the entire match complaining about the balls (seriously a HOF crashout). Shang is entering the tournament with protected ranking as his body is made of glass but his level is very high whenever he plays. He started his 2026 with easy wins over Comesana and Sonego before falling to a red-hot Bublik in straights though had set point in the second. In Australia he took out RBA in four and lost to VDZ in straights but he was clearly unfit so I won’t read too much into it. 

So we have a Medvedev that hasn’t been winning easy recently against a big hitting prospect on a pretty fast court. I wouldn’t be surprised if Jerry was an outright winner in this match-up. Shang is also lefty and Medvedev has really been struggling against them as of late. Both matches he lost this year were against lefties and has lost a set in 12 straight matches against them on hard courts, being 4-8 in that time span. Whilst Daniil is genuinely one of the best counterpunchers we’ve seen and thrives on absorbing power to grind out rallies, his deep positioning is a detriment against lefties as he gets pushed so far off the court by the slider that a player like Shang can just attack down the line after a  backhand cross. Shang’s explosive game fits this pattern perfectly and can also hang in the longer rallies as his defensive skills are also very strong, though Medvedev will obviously have the upper hand in those scenarios more often than not. Meddy’s second serve has also completely deteriorated over time (+ groundstroke pop has slightly reduced) and I expect Shang to punish it. Whilst the Russian is still an elite returner, Jerry’s serving abilities helped by the conditions should limit break opportunities and I feel like this is a pretty favourable match-up for him so I do think he at least grabs a set. BOL !</td></tr>

• Match: Tundra Esports vs. MOUZ


• <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Tundra Esports ML (To Win 2-0) vs MOUZ


• Odds: 2.38


• Unit Stake: 3 Units


Recap:
Liquid won as expected, and FUT took Mirage against Furia to keep the cash flow easy and sweat-free. We had great success at BLAST VI, and now we’re looking to carry that momentum into the opening day of DreamLeague Season 28.


Write up:
In DreamLeague, Group Stage 1 uses a Best-of-2 (BO2) format, which means the draw (1-1) is always a lurking threat. However, when the statistical gap is this wide, the &quot;Draw&quot; often becomes a value trap set by bookies. We are backing Tundra Esports to continue their total psychological and tactical dominance over MOUZ.

While Tundra had a slightly &quot;shaky&quot; 7th-place finish at BLAST Slam VI, losing their streak to HEROIC, they remain a tier above MOUZ in every measurable metric. The head-to-head record is as one-sided as it gets: Tundra has won all 7 of their previous encounters. More importantly, in their last three meetings (Dec 2025 – Feb 2026), Tundra hasn&#x27;t dropped a single map to this roster. On top of that Mouz has been horrific and ended their run at Blast slam by losing to a tier 3 Indonesian stack and bottomed the group stage.

At 2.38 odds, the bookmakers are giving us a &quot;Day 1 Discount,&quot; implying only a 42% chance for a sweep and favoring a draw. They are banking on Tundra being &quot;sleepy&quot; or experimental in the opening match or just because they lost against Heroic in Blast Slam VI. I’ll take that risk any day of the week—Tundra’s discipline in the laning phase (averaging a 76% win rate there) usually snuffs out MOUZ before they can even find their footing.

Final Play: Tundra 2-0. Stick to the unit sizing—don’t go over 3 units!

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: Houston vs Iowa State/ Iowa State ML (-130) 3u

Write up: Love the Cyclones here. To begin, playing on the road in the Big 12 is hard for anyone, I don’t care if you’re Houston. But Iowa State just pummeled Kansas and they get to carry that momentum 2 days later on their own court. Iowa State is 15th in the nation in points allowed (given the difficulty of their schedule that’s insane). They’re 12 in the country in Field Goal percentage, and 13th in the nation in assists. What does this tell us? They’re a very efficient offense that isn’t reliant on making difficult shots. They hound you on defense and work the ball around until they get THEIR shot. Their pace isn’t dictated by the other team. I say this because the Houston Cougars are a very smart and difficult team to play against, but Iowa State has proved this year they can show up against ANYONE. They have the home floor and it’s coming off a huge win against the Jayhawks. That place will be bumping and it will be ready to cash all of our slips. Why Iowa State will win, 1. Two-sided dominance 2. They can beat you a number of ways 3. Depth 4. Home court. Let me know if you’re tailing! Let’s do this.

<tr><td class='post'>**POTD Record:** 16-41-5 *Atletico brought the goods for the second time in a row, this time by getting absolutely steamrolled by the tricky Rayo side. I think it’s just a matter of time I go on a really hot run and <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>’s match is just perfect for that*

**Last Five:** ❌✅✅❌✅

**Event:** LaLiga, Girona v FC Barcelona, 3:00 pm EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Girona +1.5 Asian Handicap, -108, 5 units

**Write Up:** We’re going right back and hitting Barca while they’re down. The recent **dismantling at the hands of Atleti** *(who then went on to lose 3-0 yesterday lol)* has definitely left its mark, and I think the **injury-riddled Barcelona team** is going to struggle out there again <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Their next opponents are Girona, who managed to steady the ship after a terrible start to the league campaign. After a solid run of results, they now sit in midtable. The clashes with their fellow Catalan outfit are always hard fought and Barcelona really struggled the last time these two teams met in the league. Quick refresher, Barcelona needed a last second Araujo goal to secure a narrow 2-1 win, and these teams head into <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>’s match in a completely different context. **Girona have made huge strides** since then, while **Barcelona have clearly regressed** and it seems that their **defensive vulnerabilities** of their ridiculously high line are finally coming back to bite them. If they already struggled so much then, I can’t imagine how tough of a game Girona is going to throw at them <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Another thing to consider is that **this game will be held at Girona’s ground,** which only levels the playing field even more.

*To clarify, I still think Barcelona are the favorites to win it,* but I can’t see them winning comprehensively. And honestly, as long as Girona cover the spread, I really can’t complain. I’m so happy this game is on a Monday, because what’s a better way to start the week with than watching Barca get grilled? Feeling very confident, so another max unit play it is. Under 2.5 goals is also an option, as well as Axel Witsel to have a shot on target (he scored an absolute worldie in their last H2H), but I prefer taking money lines and spreads, so here we are. BOL and let&#x27;s enjoy this spicy Catalan derby ☘️🫡</td></tr>

Last pick:  Napoli vs Roma Over 1.5 goals ✅

Last 5: ✅✅🅿️✅✅

Event: Cagliari vs Lecce

Time: 2:45 Pm EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Cagliari ML @2.30

Cagliari has been on a very good recent form, lost against Roma last Monday but won the previous 3 games including Verona and Fiorentina who are directly involved in relegation with Lecce, although Lecce is very good defending (31 goals conceded, less than 8th place Bologna) they have the worst attack in the league, only 15 goals scored in 24 games currently seating in the 18th place, Cagliari has a much more quality squad, goals are not guaranteed here but the ML is worth the odds.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Olympic Hockey: Canada (W) v Switzerland (W), Fillier Anytime Goal Scorer (2u to win 1.73u)

Write Up: We’re going to go back with women’s hockey for this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. Sarah Fillier has gotten 6 points in her 5 games played at the olympics. Last time we picked her to score she won us some money. She has 3 goals in her 5 games and in my opinion is the best player on the roaster. Last time Canada played Switzerland they won 4-0 and Sarah scored in that game. Here’s to her doing the same in this one!

Modus super series (darts)

Justin Smith Over 0.5 180s vs Graham Hall -140
@ 5:30 AM EST

Reason:

Smith is a regular at the live lounge and I&#x27;ve watched him play for years with his performance getting better and better each time he shows up. In his last appearance back in November, he made it to the finals of his week, losing in the semis to Charlie Manby. In his last 11 recorded matches, he poured in 13 180s and hit at least one in 8/11 matches. It&#x27;s always tricky in these short best of 7 formats but I feel the odds here are way too good to pass up on. I believe he should be in the -170 - -220 range for this prop and I wouldn&#x27;t be shocked to see an adjustment in the later days of the week.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Barcelona Over 5.5 Corners @ 1.64**

**Confidence: 88%**

**Games: Girona Vs Barcelona - 3:00 PM EST**

**Barcelona have covered this line for 8 games straight in LaLiga. Last time they faced Girona they were awarded 11 corners. They average 7.1 corners per game in LaLiga.**

Real Madrid&#x27;s emphatic win against Sociedad puts Barca now in second 2 points behind, a win and they sit first again and they&#x27;ll push for just that. Girona will not necessarily low block but will attempt to mimic Atletico Madrid&#x27;s performance against them and unsettle the structure while punching in behind. Should be the perfect scenario for our corners involving a tempo battle that should play near the byline.

Football | Serie A | 19:45 (GMT)

Game: Cagliari vs Lecce

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Over 0 Goals for Cagliari + Over 1 Corner for Cagliari in the 2nd Half - 1.83 (Bet365)

*Recap: Can&#x27;t believe this is the same Atletico team that spanked Barca. Oof!*

Write Up:

Supporting the home team to get one in <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Against Lecce, I see Cagliari getting at least one goal in and dominating a huge chunk of both halves. There should easily be 2 corners for Cagliari in the 2nd half. Also, Cagliari at home have only been goalless in games vs much stronger teams like Inter, AC Milan and Bologna. Lecce shouldn&#x27;t prove difficult, all things remaining equal.

Good luck if you tail! 🍀</td></tr>

Last pick : Rayo Vallecano vs **Atletico Madrid -1,5 handicap** at **3,4** odds ❌

**CET 21:00 Football Championship**

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>: Coventry vs Middlesbrough **over 4,5 goals** at **5,5** odds

Explanation: Really bad <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> yesterday, but that’s bound to happen as well. We move on to the next one. We have a final here between two of the best teams. They have been the best for the most part this season. And the expectation is lots of goals. The reason is simple, they have a lot of action in their games. Coventry has 98 goals scored + conceded together. The most so far and Middlesbrough are ranked 1 on the table at the moment. Talk about a heated game with lots at stake. The trigger that we need is an early goal and all hell will break loose. I definitely don’t expect these teams to lay back and play defensive. My expectations are 3-2, 3-3, 2-3 or anything higher here. This might be the last time I’m attempting **over/under** bet, if it fails. I need a sign that I’m decent at this, even if I won’t attempt it often. 

On the side note: My tactics won’t change by lowering the odds. The goal is to find high odds to play here. I’m trying to keep track of the results in all of the top leagues. We will **always aim for** **long term** gains here and make sure to manage your bankroll. I changed my mind in the end about lowering the units. The approach will rather be to **quit over/under**, if it goes horrible. I will try to post another <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> in the coming days. Good luck everyone.

Bookie: **Leovegas** and a **5** unit bet. Gamble **responsibly**!

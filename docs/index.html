**Event:** English Championship (Soccer) - Coventry vs Swansea (15:00 GMT) / (2 hours from posting)

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Coventry win + over 1.5 goals @ 1.75 (1 unit)

**Write Up:** Hey all, and happy Boxing Day. Hope everyone had a great Christmas yesterday. This is my first time posting, although I’ve been lurking here for a while, so let’s see how it goes. Quick note before we start: every <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> I post will be for 1 unit, with the occasional 2‑unit play only when I’m extremely confident. Personally, I don’t see the value in going higher if your unit sizing is right, but of course that’s up to you.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s match takes us to the CBS Arena, where league leaders Coventry host 19th‑placed Swansea City. Coventry have been outstanding this season under Frank Lampard, already **scoring 53 goals** — and it’s only Christmas. For context, the next closest side is **3rd‑placed Ipswich with 38.**

Coventry have hit a slight dip recently, collecting just **5 points from their last four league matches**. Even so, they’ve **only lost once in that stretch**, bringing their total to just **two defeats in 22 games**. That loss came away to 3rd‑placed Ipswich, hardly a disastrous result. Their three draws were against **Bristol City (9th), Preston (5th), and Southampton (11th)** — the latter played mostly with 10 men after a red card.

The biggest factor behind <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today’s pick</mark>, though, is Coventry’s home form. They’re unbeaten at the CBS Arena this season, turning it into a complete fortress. They’ve **won 8 and drawn 2 at home, scoring 26 and conceding only 7.** They’re also the league’s best away side, but if we’re nitpicking, their 3-0 loss to Ipswich last month did come on the road.

Statistically, Coventry average **2.41 goals per game this season, rising to 2.6 at home**. Defensively, they’re the second‑best unit in the league, **conceding 1.05 per game overall and just 0.70 at home.** They’ll be without Jay DaSilva after his red card, but three first‑team players return after missing the Southampton match through illness.

Now to Swansea. After finishing 11th last season, they find themselves down in 19th — not quite in the relegation scrap, but far from the playoff picture. Since appointing Vítor Matos at the end of November, they’ve improved noticeably, **winning 3 of their last 4 after losing the previous 5**. However, their away form remains a major concern. Their only defeat under Matos came away at Stoke (8th), and overall this season they’ve played **10 away matches, losing 6, winning 2, and drawing 2**, with a goal difference of **9 scored and 14 conceded.**

Swansea score an average of **1.09 goals per game** this season, dropping to **0.90 away from home**. Defensively, they concede **1.36 per match overall**, rising slightly to **1.40 on the road**.

All things considered, Swansea do look improved under Matos, and this won’t be the walkover it might have been a month ago but Coventry’s dominant home form combined with Swansea’s struggles away should give the league leaders the edge on Boxing Day. As for the over 1.5 goals, the numbers speak for themselves backed further by the fact that **82% of Coventry’s matches** and **73% of Swansea’s** have gone over that line, and that trend hasn’t changed under the new manager.

I expect Swansea to make this competitive, but Coventry’s attacking quality should still see them through with something like a 2-1 or 3-1 win at the CBS Arena to extend their lead at the top of the table to 9 points.

Feel free to drop any thoughts or suggestions — like I said, first time doing this. Enjoy the rest of your Boxing Day, and best of luck if you’re tailing.</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>Hi y&#x27;all. Let&#x27;s give this a go.

First <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>

18:00 CET, basketball, Partizan-Maccabi Tel-Aviv

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: 4/5 units

KK Partizan is in all sorts of turmoil; coach left, fans are booing their own players when they score. Defense is shite and so is the atmosphere in the team. Whether or not the new coach can solidify the team, I think after 3 days of signing that it&#x27;ll not be on time. Maccabi is quite alright on offense.

Maccabi over 84,5+ (I got 1.84 odds)</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>TODAY</mark>&#x27;S <mark style='background:#fff59d'>PICK</mark>:** AS Monaco vs. Real Madrid **UNDER 174.5** (EuroLeague)

**ODDS:** 1.86 / -116

https://preview.redd.it/60q5xjf19j9g1.png?width=930&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fdbef41e0a2ad972cc3340363e039607d4713dfb



# Reasoning:

This matchup profiles much more like a tactical, half-court game than a high-scoring one, especially given the current rotations on both sides.

Monaco, even at home, are not a fast-paced team by default. With **Cory Joseph out**, their guard rotation becomes shorter and more ball-dominant through **Mike James and Okobo**, which usually slows the game down and leads to longer possessions rather than early offense.

Real Madrid, on the other hand, are a team that clearly reduce tempo on the road. They prioritize defensive balance, limit transition opportunities and are comfortable playing through structured half-court sets. Against Monaco’s physical perimeter defense and switching schemes, easy points should be limited.

From a matchup standpoint, there is a lot of defensive versatility on the floor: Diallo, Blossomgame and Theis for Monaco, and strong positional defenders on Madrid’s side. This usually translates into contested shots, fewer fast breaks and a game decided more by execution than rhythm.

The total at **174.5** feels a bit inflated for a game where both teams are likely to control pace, especially in the second half. Barring an unusually hot shooting night from both sides, this sets up well for an **under**.</td></tr>

I like all 3 favorites in ABA <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, and I played all 3. I chose this one as the obvious one, first team on the table against the last one, Krka 2-8 score, Dubai 9-0.

Although I like it more when I play Dubai as guests since it makes no difference to them and the handicap is more generous, this should also be covered.

They played their last game on the 23rd, also at home, so they should be rested.

I like to look for some extra reasons, and maybe the fact that a good number of Krka players had Christmas yesterday and had to travel to Dubai is not going to sit well with them. On the other hand, a good number of Dubai players didn&#x27;t even have Christmas yesterday, I counted 8 of them.

Will this matter? I have no idea, but I like it.</td></tr>

Football | EFL Championship | Birmingham vs Derby| in \~3hrs

BTTS @ 1.99

Writeup : Birmingham have been outstanding at home this season and are extremely difficult to beat. They’ve lost just once at home, scored in all 10 home matches, and have hit 2+ goals in 6 of their last 7 there. Defensively, they’re not perfect though — they’ve conceded in their last 3, which has opened the door for BTTS outcomes.  
Overall, Birmingham’s recent matches have been very goal-friendly, with BTTS landing in 7 of their last 8.  
Derby County arrive in excellent scoring form, having scored in 12 straight matches, showing remarkable attacking consistency, and their games have followed the same pattern — BTTS has landed in 9 of their last 10. Derby rarely fail to contribute to the scoreboard, even away from home.

Cunha has recorded 2, 3, and 3 shots on target in his last three games, and with Amad, Bruno, and Mbuemo missing, he will likely be United’s main attacking outlet. Because of that, it’s reasonable to expect him to be the primary shooter, and I even see some value in backing him for 2 shots on target.
Woltemade, after the disastrous own goal against Sunderland, responded with a brace against Chelsea, and I can see him continuing that form. United are still missing De Ligt and Maguire, and with Yoro struggling for form and Heaven lacking consistency, I expect the German to be heavily involved in the attack.

**Write up:**

**The <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>:**  
This is a **Balanced Neutral** profile — exactly the kind of setup where **both teams usually get on the board** rather than one controlling the match.

Birmingham have a slight edge, but Derby have enough attacking threat in this profile to respond. The sample we have shows **100% BTTS and 100% Over 1.5** support in similar odds ranges, with typical scorelines like **2–1**. That’s a strong indicator of a **competitive game with goals on both sides**.

The tempo shouldn’t be slow either — the model flags **early goal likelihood**, which helps open things up before the match turns cagey.

At **2.00**, the pricing gives us **full value** for a game that doesn’t project clean sheets.

**My Model in general:**  
My model is built around the idea that matches follow **recurring patterns**, not randomness.  
Instead of predicting games in isolation, it groups matches by **odds profiles** and studies what *actually* happens when similar games are played.

By clustering historical matches with the same **home–draw–away odds**, I track how games usually unfold — goals, BTTS, scorelines, and game flow. From there, the model identifies **motives**: situations where teams are more likely to attack, trade goals, or avoid clean sheets.

Every <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> comes from **data-backed profiles, not opinions** — combining odds structure, score patterns, and streak behavior to find spots where the market regularly repeats itself.

Todays <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: **Sheffield Wed v Hull City: Hull City ML @1.90**

Sheffield Wednesday are in serious trouble at both ends of the pitch. They’re scoring just 0.8 goals per game with an xG of 0.81, while conceding 2.2 goals per game and allowing 2.35 xGA; all well below league standards. They sit 24th, have 0 wins in their last 5, and haven’t kept a single clean sheet.

Hull City, on the other hand, are flying. They’re 4th in the table, scoring 1.8 goals per game, generating 1.67 xG, and taking 11 shots per match. Defensively they’re solid too, conceding only 1.2 goals per game with a strong 1.02 xGA and a 40% clean-sheet rate.

Our model gives Hull a 51% chance to win, compared to just 25% for Sheffield Wednesday. Bookmakers price Hull at 1.91 (52% implied), which is close to fair but still playable given the massive gap in form, quality, and momentum.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Connah&#x27;s Quay ML = 1.61u @ -161

Write Up: <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> I found a line I thought was much undervalued in the Wales Premier League. A tale of two seasons between the teams, with Connah&#x27;s Quay up in 2nd place and Flint Town United down around 10th (3rd to bottom of the table). The last two games between the sides has also resulted in wins for Connah&#x27;s Quay, one with a dominating 4-0 victory, and the other a closely contested 3-2 win for Connah&#x27;s Quay (Quay outplayed Flint Town by more than the score showed). I think this line should be closer to -200, and as I have been writing this, the line has already moved closer to that.

Overall: As always my plays will be to win 1u. For all those tailing, I suggest you always divide net units by the avg unit bet, which will give you an accurate representation of who is making what.

Though tempted to fade the Hawks again, the prior loss has soured me on point spreads for now. So I will move to a hopefully more reliable player prop with a short/simple explanation.

Trae may be a defensive liability, but he is an excellent passer/playmaker and thrives in fast-paced games.

He is over this line in 5 of L5, which includes the 3 games since returning from injury and the 2 games prior to the injury (I am not including the game in which he got injured as he only played 7 minutes). Overall for the season, he is over in 6 of 8 total games played.

The Heat have the highest pace rating in the league this year meaning lots of possessions and high-scoring game, and they are tied for 4th in most assists given up to opposing point guards. They haven&#x27;t faced off this season yet, but against a similarly fast-paced team, Chicago, Trae was over in 3/3 this season.

Marmoush was by far the best player on the pitch that day and I see that run of form continuing for the Egyptian. Not many stats to back this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> given there has only been 1 game in the tournament but looking at last game in addition to Omar&#x27;s motives I can see this play does very well, and won&#x27;t be surprised if he wins player of the tournament if Egypt go far.

**Event:** AFCON, Angola v Zimbabwe, 7:30 am EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Zimbabwe Win or Draw + Under 3.5 goals +130, 4 units

**Write Up:** Despite both Angola and Zimbabwe losing their opening AFCON group stage fixtures - Angola narrowly went down 2-1 to South Africa while Zimbabwe were dramatically beaten 2-1 by paper favorites Egypt - there are solid enough reasons to back **Zimbabwe to avoid defeat <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>**. Angola’s AFCON history shows they’ve **only won one of their 10 opening games** at the tournament and have often dropped points in their second fixture after an initial loss, with draws in 1996 and 2006 following opening defeats. Meanwhile, **Zimbabwe have historically absolutely held their own against Angola**, and the overall **H2H is well balanced,** with both teams winning **eight times apiece and registering three draws** across their numerous encounters.

Zimbabwe’s squad is certainly not noticeably weaker than that of Angola, and it carries momentum from the recent goalscoring form, including **Prince Dube**, who scored a silky goal against Egypt, and they’ve shown they can score in successive matches. Angola are missing striker **Zini** through injury, which could blunt their attack and give Zimbabwe a tactical edge. Add to that Angola’s inconsistent form and Zimbabwe’s resilience in tight games, and a **Zimbabwe win or draw** looks like a sensible, value-backed prediction for this crucial AFCON group game. There&#x27;s also the possibility of neither team wanting to risk it ahead of the important Egypt - South Africa clash, thus making the draw even more likely (works for us). I&#x27;m certainly loving this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> and **pairing it with an Under 3.5 match goals** leg (I&#x27;m very positive this will be a **low scoring affair,** *personally feeling a 1-1 or a 2-1 Zimbabwe masterclass).* They&#x27;ve **nearly stunned Egypt,** so why can&#x27;t they take it a step further? Exactly, there&#x27;s no reason they can&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve spent hours researching the underlying data behind this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, so I&#x27;m feeling very confident that it&#x27;s gonna hit and finally release me out of the shackles of the horror run that I&#x27;m having atm - staking 4 units on this. Covering two outcomes and sprinkling an Under feels like great value for these odds, and the more I look at it, the better I feel about this. I don&#x27;t mind the BTTS Yes <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> either, but I&#x27;ve gone with the outlined <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> in the end.

Writeup: <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s picks are built from my ai model on the reccomendstion of Ipswich to win paired with a conservative goals angle, based on their stronger attacking metrics and ability to control matches against similar opposition. The data shows Ipswich creating higher-quality chances while the game profile still supports goals without needing a high-scoring shootout. This combination targets value while keeping risk controlled, rather than forcing aggressive lines.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Mattheus Cunha 2+ SOT (+180) 1 unit to win 1.8 units

**Write Up:** Happy Boxing Day! Oddly enough there&#x27;s only one match <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, but it&#x27;s bound to be an entertaining one as 7th place Man United hosting 11th place Newcastle. This is an important match as both teams are vying for spots in European football next season. 

Manchester United has been a mixed bag this year. They score a lot of goals and concede a lot of goals, in fact they have the highest # of total goals per match in the EPL. They are currently missing a ton of players, including their leading Goalscorer and leader of assist with Mbuemo,  Bruno Fernandes, and Amad all out due to AFCON/injury. They&#x27;re going to be looking for creativity and Cunha looks tocbe the guy to try to fill those shoes. 

Cunha has been on a year lately, after some injuryy struggles early in the season. In his last 3 games, he has really turned it on. In these last 3 matches, he has averaged 7.3 shots/game, 2.7 SOTs per game, and scored 2 goals. With Bruno now out, I see him getting even more of the ball and taking more shots. The books currently have his as Man U&#x27;s most probable Goalscorer, most probable shot taker, but behind Sesko and Zirkee in probable SOTs. I think this line is mispriced based on these trends, but we will certainly take it. 

Newcastle is a decent team defensively, but play much better at home than on the road. They have not had a lot of tough road tests this season, but notably they conceded 7 SOTs on 15 shots away at Brentford, 9 SOTs on 15 shots away at West Ham (who only had 38% possession). Predicting a lot of shots and goals here - love this line in this spot. 

BOL and hope you all had a great Christmas!</td></tr>

Match : Angola Vs Zimbabwe


<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Angola ML + Under 3.5 Goals @2.26 Odds ( 1xBet ) 2unit to win 2.52u


Write Up: 


I’m confident on Angola win + under 3.5 goals. Angola are clearly the better side and should control this game from start to finish. They’re more organized, better in midfield, and don’t need chaos to win.


Zimbabwe will sit back and defend deep, but they don’t have enough quality going forward to really threaten for 90 minutes. Angola aren’t a high-tempo, high-scoring team anyway they’re happy to score, manage the game, and close it out.</td></tr>

CFB🏈 New Mexico vs Minnesota gophers, 4:30 pm ET 12/26/25

Record: 9-10
Net Units: -3.96 Units

Explanation: I think New Mexico can beat Minnesota tomorrow because New Mexico should be able to control most of  the game. They run a balanced offense and their run defense is much improved over the season, only allowing 113.4 rushing yards per game, and that’s good in this matchup since Minnesota’s run game is struggling barely topping 100 rushing yards per game. 

New Mexico is hot on 6 game winning streak and set a school record of 484.5 total yards per game. I foresee and conclude too many things that can go right for New Mexico , and too many things that can go wrong for Minnesota.</td></tr>

International Hockey U20 - World Junior Championship

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: USA vs. Germany | USA -5.5 (-110)

Time: 6:00pm EST

What’s going on everyone, I&#x27;m back again for my favorite week and a half of the year. If anybody&#x27;s been around, we’ve been on a roll the past few years and looking to continue with more of the same. It’s a pretty even split this year as far as the playing field goes. A clear top 5, a Slovakia team that can be a little scrappy and the last 4 fighting to stay out of relegation.

With that being said, we’re going to start the slate off with the US covering against the Germans. The Americans have the Germans number in this tournament, routinely dominating them year in and year out. The US didn’t bring a gold favorite to the tournament like last year, but they should still comfortably fight for a medal. The Germans on the other hand will be fighting to stay in the top division for another year.

We only have a few pretournament games to go off of for both teams, but luckily for us they already played eachother 4 days ago, with the Americans winning by 8. Germany did start their backup in this game, but it wouldn&#x27;t have mattered much. USA also sat a few of their returnees to get some looks at depth players before the final round of cuts. Expect a pretty big mismatch between a gold medal hopeful and a team trying to just stay afloat to start us off</td></tr>

MIDDLESBROUGH VS BLACKBURN

Date: 26 DECEMBER 2025 at 16:00

BET ON: Match odds- MIDDLESBROUGH

Odd: 1.79



\- Despite their slip-up at Bristol City, Middlesbrough remain the form side and a strong bet to win at Riverside. Under Kim Hellberg, Boro have climbed to second in the Championship thanks to consistent performances and an aggressive, possession-oriented tactical setup that sees them dominate games and control midfield play — a philosophy Hellberg has publicly praised for its intensity and control in recent press comments after big wins like the 4-1 rout of Hull. At home they are particularly dangerous, with seven wins in ten league matches this season and a habit of starting games strongly, making them favorites in front of their supporters. Injuries to Lenihan and Fry are a concern, but Boro’s defensive reinforcements and creative balance — including form attackers Strelec and Conway — mean they have more depth than struggling Blackburn. Conversely, Blackburn’s squad is stretched with key absences including potential issue with Gudjohnsen and other regulars, and coach Valérien Ismaël has recently admitted attitude issues in training, undermining consistency and preparation. With Boro’s clear motivation to consolidate an automatic promotion spot and Blackburn still fighting just to climb away from the bottom, the hosts have both the tactical edge and psychological incentive to take all three points.</td></tr>

Last pick:

Brighton Vs Sunderland 

Brighton win and under 4.5 goals (1.90) ✖️

A game which never looked like producing too many goals, Brighton did finish the game very strong and had Sunderland hanging on but couldn&#x27;t find a way to break them down as time ran out. Ending 0-0.

Premier League 

Manchester United Vs Newcastle 

Matheus Chuna 2 or more shots on target.

(2.10) 2.5 units 

Both teams come into this game with a good portion of missing players, United missing some key attackers, Newcastle missing a lot of key players in defense.

With so many players on international duty or out with injuries, Chuna should get the full 90 minutes here to find these shots on target. He&#x27;s been in good form as of late coming back from an injury, 2 goals and an assist in his last 3 games.

Shot wise his breakdown is as followed for the past few games.

Aston villa away: **6 shots 3 on target**

Bournemouth at home: **8 shots 3 on target**

Wolves away **8 shots 2 on target**

Newcastle are also a team that really struggles to perform well away from home , they average about 7 shots on target conceded away from home if you take out the derby game against Sunderland last away game, which was a hard watch, constant fouls as it was a fierce rivalry match,  which meant there was very few chances for either side.

Chuna is a very direct player, great at picking up the ball from deep and going on a run and getting shots away, he should again get plenty of shooting opportunities to cover this line again like he has been for the past few weeks and for the price were getting it&#x27;s too good for me to pass up a bet on this.

Last Pick: Korpatsch vs Rakhimova - Rakhimova ML @ 1.71 ✅

Decent final with a good level by both players especially in the 2nd set but Rakhimova dominated most of the backhand trades and won the title in straight sets.

**Tennis** | **WTA 125 Limoges** | **5:30 AM (Eastern Time)**

Plays will always be shared as 1 unit for fair record purposes

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** **Kartal vs Pieri - Kartal Handicap -6.5 Games @ 1.71**

We head into another week of Indoor tournaments, with some talented WTA players entering the draw, such as Kartal and Krejcikova, with this 125 tournament being quite stacked, which should certainly create one-sided matchups, and one of them is this one.

Kartal had a decent season, with superb performances in her last tournament in Beijing, where she dominated strong players such as Kasatkina, Maya Joint and Mirra Andreeva. She&#x27;s quite short, but her court speed and agility are fantastic. Not only that, but she also serves at a high percentage for someone with her height and has a powerful backhand. Currently ranked 69th, she certainly can be at least a top 30 player.

Pieri was never able to get out of the top 200, and fast surfaces were never her speciality. If we look at her current season, she played 52 matches on clay and only 13 matches on hard courts. When it comes to recent form, she isn&#x27;t performing particularly well, having lost 5 out of her last 6 matches in straight sets (all on clay). The Italian player is only 1.60m and should struggle to close service games against a player of Kartal&#x27;s quality from the baseline.

These types of handicaps can certainly be dangerous when the underdog has the possibility of doing a phenomenal game, but I&#x27;m quite certain that this will be a walk in the park for Kartal. Expect her to dominate Pieri on an indoor hard court.

Good luck!</td></tr>

__Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:__ [✅ Chris Rodriguez o41.5 rushing yards (-115), 3.5u](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/s/v30qKRN7sL)

__Event:__ NFL: Eagles @ Chargers 8:15pm EST

__POTD:__ AJ Brown o60.5 receiving yards (-110), 3.3u to win 3u

__Write Up:__ The 8-4 Philadelphia Eagles are traveling to LA to take on the 8-4 Chargers on Monday Night Football. Just 2 games ago the Chargers were blown out 6-35 by the Jags, then luckily had a bye week the following week. They used the rest &amp; put a beat down on the (2-10) Raiders 31-14. They are currently 2 games back behind the Broncos in the AFC West &amp; are looking to gain stay in contention for the top spot of the Division. The Eagles suffered their 2nd straight loss last week to the Bears on Black Friday in their last game 24-15, but they still are on top of the NFC East. The Eagles led the entire game as they were up 7-0 after the 1st quarter, 10-3 at the half, &amp; 10-9 after the 3rd quarter. But then they gave up 2 TD’s in the 4th &amp; couldn’t come back. Starting OL Lane Johnson was injured with a foot injury &amp; has this has significantly affected the Eagles run game, leading to more passing.

No team in the NFL has won more games than the defending Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles (47-16), since the start of the 2022 season. The Eagles offense has been stagnant lately, but they have played some good competition. Whereas the Chargers have had a weak schedule. The Chargers have done really well at shutting down the pass. LA ranks 7th in the NFL in EPA/Dropback allowed. Phili hasn’t been great through the air lately, but they are still above average passing, ranking 13th in the NFL in EPA/Dropback. QB Jalen Hurts has been slinging deep this season. __Hurts is 2nd in the league in rate of throws 20+ yards downfield (15.2%). He ranks 4th in the NFL in completions of 40+ yards with 8. Hurts has a 118.6 passer rating on those deep throws, the fourth highest in the NFL. Spreading the field has also helped Hurts, who has a league leading 113.3 passer rating in sets with four or five wide receivers.__ Who has Hurts primary downfield target been lately? Star WR AJ Brown. The Eagles may have had a rough game vs the Bears last week, but Brown had a huge game, catching 10 balls for 132 yards &amp; 2 TD’s. Brown has become the focal point of this Eagles offense the past few weeks. __AJ Brown has double digit targets in 3 straight games. Brown leads the NFL in designed/first read targets over the last 3 weeks with 32.__ Over that same time period, other Eagles star WR DeVonta Smith has only 23 designed/first read targets. The pecking order has been reestablished in Philadelphia &amp; AJ Brown is the clear WR1. Brown has been the best receiver in football since then. __In his last 2 games he ranks #1 in Receiving Yards (242), #1 in Receptions (18), &amp; #2 in Targets (22). He has 47% of the Eagles receiving yards in those games.__ He has been the guy the guy all season that they get the ball to when they need to move the ball. __Brown has the 3rd most receiving yards amongst WR’s in the 4th quarter with 268. He has had 50% of the red zone targets over the last 5 weeks.__ The Chargers have great stats this season at shutting down opposing WR’s, but most of the WR’s they’ve played this season have to wear helmets off of the field as well. __All of the pass catchers they’ve played this year that don’t have the tism’ all hit this number this season- Bowers: 4/63, Jakobi Meyers: 5/64, Jettas: 7/74, Alec Pierce: 5/98, Waddle: 6/95, Deebo: 8/96, &amp; Sutton: 6/118.__ Not only is this a good play due to AJ Brown’s recent success, but also due to the Chargers defensive scheme. __The Chargers run Zone coverage at the highest rate in the league, as they only run man on 14.1% of their snaps, the league’s lowest rate.__ Brown has been a monster vs zone defense lately, &amp; Hurts has been targeting him way more than other star Eagles WR Devonta Smith. Here are the 2 WR’s stats vs Zone coverage over the last 3 games:

Brown: 1st Read: 48.8%, Yards/Route: 3.59, Targets/Route: 0.37, Air Yard Share: 44.3%, 1st Down/Route: 0.18, ASS: 0.106 (Average Separation Score)

Smith: 1st Read: 24.4%, Yards/Route: 1.54, Targets/Route: 0.20, Air Yard Share: 36.4%, 1st Down/Route: 0.06, ASS: 0.05

Smith also has been playing in the slot in a majority of his snaps this season. __Devonta has ran 59% of his routes from the slot. Whereas AJ has ran 89% of his routes out wide.__ That’s not good news for Smith as he’ll be lined up against Chargers star defensive back Derwin James Jr. The Chargers have been using safety Derwin James Jr. as their primary slot coverage player. __Among qualified cornerbacks &amp; safeties, James allows the lowest yards per slot coverage snap (0.28), ahead of notable safeties like Kyle Hamilton (0.42) &amp; Minkah Fitzpatrick (0.49).__ Smith is going to struggle this Monday night opening up even more opportunities for AJ. Brown is also much bigger than the Chargers DB’s &amp; I think Hurts continues to target him all game, especially with the run game situation. 

Eagles RB Saquon Barkley has been a shell of what he was last year. Barkley had 14 games with 100+ rushing yards last season. This season he has just 1 game with 100+. He has only rushed for more than 60 yards twice in his last 10 games, getting held to less than 50 yards in half of those. This week he’ll be behind an offensive line that will be without star LT Lane Johnson. Barkley is not the same back with Johnson off the field as he is with him on. __On 124 rushes with Johnson on the field, Barkley has ran for 4.2 yards per carry with a run of 10 + yards on 11.3% of his carries. With Johnson off the field, Barkley has ran 74 times for 218 yards (2.9 YPC) &amp; a run of 10+ yards on just 4.1% of his carries (38th in the NFL).__ The Eagles are going to have trouble getting things going on the ground &amp; will have to turn to Brown through the air.

In a defensive game where points are going to be hard to come by, AJ Brown is going to get fed as the most efficient weapon on the field.

__AJ Brown o60.5 receiving yards__

Last Pick: [Mikal Bridges Over 3.5 Reb (-120 on Bet 365) Bet 3.5u to Win 2.92u](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/s/lypgMWZWr6)✅

Mitchell Robinson back in the starting 5 caught me off guard limiting Bridges rebounding opportunities however he did enough in the 3rd Q to grab his share for us to cash a well needed win. 

NBA | SAC Kings @ MIL Bucks | 5PM EST

Next <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **Domantas Sabonis Over 13.5 Reb** (+108 on Fanduel) Bet 2u to Win 2.16u

Sabonis is leading the league in rebs this season so far, with an average of about 13.8 rebs thru 4 games played. Last season he also lead the league with an average of 13.9RPG as he has been dominant on the boards consistently, ranking first for two consecutive seasons.

Giannis is questionable with his left knee so if he is out this correlates for more opportunities for Sabonis to grab. Even if he does play I expect some limitations on Giannis rebounding efforts with his knee soreness. 

Sabonis has beating Miles Turner h2h on the glass he’s averaging just 6.8RPG. In games Giannis is out dating back to last season Turner has averaged just 7RPG while playing with the Pacers, not an elite rebounder with Giannis absence. Even last game Bucks starting PG Rollins scrapped out more than double the amount of rebs than Turner.

With Sabonis elite rebounding consistency, Turner’s weakness on the glass, and the potential Giannis absence creating a vacuum on the boards, this is a great opportunity to expect to hit the over.

⚽ My football predictions for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> with analysis!

•Atlas FC - Deportivo Toluca: 1x (Double chance)
•Analysis: Expecting an explosive Atlas game at home, looking to secure points.
•Odds: +125

(Additional information)
The situation is critical, but mathematically there is still a light at the end of the tunnel:
• Remaining games: Atlas only has two games left to play (including <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>&#x27;s game against Toluca and Matchday 17).
• Maximum score: The maximum number of points that the Rojinegros can aspire to is 22 units (winning both games).
• <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s game is the KEY:
• The match against Toluca (sub-leader) is a true &quot;final&quot; for their aspirations.
• If they lose <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, their elimination from the Play-In will be almost a fact due to the point difference and the very small margin they would have left.

•Liverpool - Aston Villa: Yes (Both teams will score🚀)
•Statistics: 74% probability in favor of both scoring. Furthermore, Liverpool have conceded goals in their last 10 games and Villa have scored in their last 9. There are goals!🥅
•Odds: -175
Let&#x27;s see if there&#x27;s any luck!🤞

Last bet: Lakers ML vs Kings @ +125 💥 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s pick</mark>: Blue Jays ML vs Dodgers @ +130

Reason: Jays have the hotter bats in this series and even though it’s tied they’ve looked like the better team. Playing at home in game 7 of the world series, I love the jays to get it done. They’ve been one of the best team in the clutch this year, and win in late innings. They just produce hits that add up. Jays are the hungrier team and I think they take care of business in the biggest game of their life.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Alexander Bublik ML (-114) — 3.42u to win 3u

Mr Tio Sharp with another one:  
This should be an excellent, high-quality match. Some might call it a coin flip — and I wouldn’t argue with that. Both players have had great seasons, with multiple titles, and both are hungry to make a deep run here to strengthen their cases for the ATP Finals in Turin.

Felix has been strong on hard courts this year, much better than Bublik’s, and that’s exactly what makes this line so intriguing.

I’m taking Bublik ML because he’s finally playing with the intention and confidence everyone’s been waiting to see. At 28, he may be hitting his peak — and this is a real shot at his first-ever Masters 1000 final.

Bublik’s current level should expose the inconsistencies in Felix’s game that have lingered since his breakout year. Add in the spark from his heated match with Moutet and the energy from the French crowd, and I think Bublik rides that momentum <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.

Event: Bundesliga ⚽️

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Bayer Leverkusen +4 corner handicap vs Bayern Munich 5U @ 2.05 (Bet365)

Write-up: Very uneventful match with just 2 shots on target all match (and no shots until around the 30th minute). Guirassy scored a nice goal in the 37th but honestly both teams looked really flat which turned the match into a borefest. Anyways Dortmund ended on just 3 corners.

Following an insane 23/24 season where Leverkusen won the league undefeated 17 points clear and one loss in all competitions, their purple patch has dried up. It’s not really a surprise with all the departures and that level being unsustainable in the long-run but they still finished a respectable second last year. This year they find themselves in 5th spot 3 points from second but following Ten Hag’s dismal stint things are slightly looking up with Hjulmand at the wheel and just 1 loss in ten (against PSG).  Meanwhile Bayern have won all 14 of their games with Kompany’s style finally starting to click, being rewarded with a contract extension. Despite this domination, Die Roten doesn’t actually average that many corners with 5.3 won at home over their last 10 and 4.3 conceded. Leverkusen on the other hand have won 4.6 and conceded 4.5 on average away from home. Even by adjusting for more pressure on Bayer 04 (since they are the worse team) I get a mean of 5.1 corners for Bayern and 4.3 for Leverkusen.

That gives this play an 81% win probability. Opponents (including way inferior opposition) have covered this line in 9/10 matches at the Allianz and Leverkusen in 7/10 on the road. The one factor that does play against the play is that this fixture last year saw 6 Bayern corners to Leverkusen’s 1 but nevertheless I still really like the value and the line does surprise me. BOL !

Write up:

With a 4^(th) place in the league after 10 matches and bad performances in the Champions League, Ajax is having a really bad season so far. They are very inconsistent and are unable to control matches like they used to. This results in open matches and plenty of chances for opponents to score. Their shaky form also gives teams the feeling that a result is possible against Ajax, even on their home turf in the Amsterdam Arena. The pressure is mounting for trainer **Johnny Heitinga**, who must know that every match can be his last match. He recently changed goalkeepers in order to solidify his defence, but I think **Remko Pasveer** is getting too old to perform well at this level. He does however know how to coach the defenders and improve the defensive line in that way. **Wout Weghorst** and **Oskar Gloukh** are the top scorers for the team, so I expect at least one of them will score <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. They normally perform well against Heerenveen (9 wins / 1 loss in the last 10 matches), but for me the ML is a bit too risky <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.

After a disappointing start of the season, SC Heerenveen has been playing very well recently. I find this unsurprising, as I believe they have a very decent team with good players. They weren’t outplayed in the beginning of the season, but mostly lost point due to unlucky moments. The most dangerous player at this moment in my opinion is **Jacob Trenskow**; he creates lots of chances and also scored 5 goals himself. Their main striker, **Dylan Vente**, is the top scorer of the team with 6 goals, so I wouldn’t be surprised if he manages to get one in <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Their defensive line hasn’t been great so far this season and they haven’t had a single clean sheet so far. I also don’t expect them to get their first clean sheet of the season <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> playing against Ajax.

All in all two teams with good attacking skills and shaky defences will face each other <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, so I expect an open match with goals from both sides.

Frankfurt is just the straight up better team in this match up and they must collect important point in their race for the Champions League qualification. Heidenheim is the worst team in the league.

**Write Up:** Back to football in Belgium. Club Brugge takes on Dender at home after an easy win in the cup (6-1). They used their second team to let some key players rest. Club Brugge won their last games, but only with 0-1 or 1-0. So we need more goals this game, but I am confident we will get it. Dender is in last place, with only 5 goals in 12 matches. They have big issues in front. The defence is more solid, with 19 goals against in 12 matches.

Dender also played in the cup and won their first game of the season. But they had to use their first team (no rest for key players) and it went to overtime against the last placed team in the second division..

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: NBA Minnesota Timberwolves v Charlotte Hornets 

1U Jaden McDaniels O4.5 1Q points @ $1.90, B365 

Write-Up: Averaging 10.2 minutes in 1st quarters (10 v Pacers, 12 v Nuggets, 8.5 v Lakers) &amp; 37 minutes per game since Edwards got injured so I feel comfortable saying 8.5 minutes is his likely minimum, more likely to get 9. He has had 5 FG attempts in 1st quarters in the last 3 games, with at least 1 being a 3 pt attempt and making 1. Even with Edwards he is 3/5 on this line for the season, and has made a 3 pointer in 4/5 1st quarters, averaging 1.4 attempts. So we only need him to make 1 3 pointer and then go 1-4 on the rest of his shots (if he again takes 5 field goal attempts). 

Charlotte are averaging 34.6 points conceded in 1st quarters (2nd in the NBA) and Wolves are averaging 33 points scored in 1st quarters (5th in league). So only looking at getting 5/33 points or so. 

As with the last 2 days, 1st quarter bets can be streaky so they aren’t a hammer/smash line, spend all your units etc. If you’re thinking about tailing, tail with appropriate risk/units knowing that if he doesn’t hit it, I’m likely to go again on the next Wolves game.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Devon Dampier Over 1.5 Passing Touchdowns (-110 FanDuel) 3 units

Write Up: Dampier enters the matchup averaging 1.9 passing touchdowns per game in 2025, with 13 passing TDs across seven starts. He’s thrown for multiple touchdowns in five of those games, including matchups against UCF, Arizona State, and Oklahoma State. Dampier’s completion rate sits at 69%(nice), showing consistent efficiency and red zone execution. Utah is scoring 38.9 points per game, the offense has leaned on Dampier’s arm to finish drives, especially in competitive games.

Cincinnati’s defense has allowed 227.5 passing yards per game, ranking 77th nationally. They have also given up multiple passing touchdowns in three of their last five games. The Bearcats struggle to contain dual-threat quarterbacks, and Dampier’s mobility adds pressure to their secondary. With the game being played at Rice-Eccles Stadium and Utah favored by over a touchdown, the Utes are expected to generate scoring chances. Given Dampier’s track record this season and Cincinnati’s defensive trends, the over on 1.5 passing touchdowns is well within reach.

Prediction: Dampier Passing Touchdowns in the 1st &amp; 3rd quarter</td></tr>

**Leg 1**:  Belgium Ligue 1 – Club Brugge -1 vs Dender

Once again this is a match of two teams heading in opposite directions.  Club Brugge sit in 2^(nd) place in the Belgian league with a +8 goal differential while Dender are at the bottom of the table in last place with a -14 goal differential.  Club Brugge are at home and are by far the stronger side in every aspect of the game.   They are within a win (3points) of league leader USG and should be able to comfortably win this match by at least one goal, in which case it’s a “push” for us.

**Leg 2**:  NCAAF – South Carolina at Ole Miss -6 (alt Spread)

Ole Miss is coming off a triumphant win at ranked Oklahoma to improve to 4-1 in SEC play and is still within striking distance of the conference title race, even with that loss to Georgia a few weeks ago.  They are currently averaging 37 points per game and 9 yards per pass against a weaker South Carolina team that averages only 3 yards per rush.

South Carolina is sitting at 1-5 in SEC competition and among the worst-performing offenses in the conference.  They are just not there offensively this season, ranking last in the SEC with 20.38 points per game and will have trouble containing a Rebel attack that is top 20 nationally in scoring and top-ten in throwing the football.

Ole Miss is favored by 12.5 but we will take the safer route once again teasing down a touchdown and a hook down to 6.

Write up: In what possibly could be the most fun game of the college football slate tomorrow, I’m taking the points with the dogs. Mississippi state has been knocking on the door of a win in the sec all fucking year (yes I know Arkansas has too). But this miss state team has now been winless in the sec dating back to the 2023 season. This team is angry and their coach said “We&#x27;ve got a pissed off football team,” Mississippi State coach Jeff Lebby, who is still looking for his first conference win at any level of football as a head coach, said on Monday. “(This team) isn&#x27;t hanging their head and is not feeling sorry for themselves. This is a football team that is ready to go prove that we&#x27;re a good football team.” Miss state can actually sling it and I’m gonna tell u what, I don’t care if Arkansas can score (they can) they cannot stop ANYBODY. 103rd in passing yards allowed per game and 128th in rushing yards per game. This is gonna be a fun one, I’m not overthinking this, I’m taking the points with a team that arguably is better and on top of that shouldn’t be getting anything over 3 in this game. I’m sorry for the loss in the capitals, but respectfully fuck it, cause we’re gonna be 5-1 after this and we’re goin fucking streaking again</td></tr>

Start Time &amp; TV: 7:30pm EST (CBS)

Units: 2.75 Units

Reasoning: Heading to Reser Stadium in Corvallis, Oregon for this PAC-12 matchup (R.I.P. the pac 12) between the Oregon State Beavers (1-7) and the Washington State Cougars (4-4). Now it may sound weird to hear that a team impressed me in two games they lost this year but this Cougars team stood out out to me in their losses against #7 ranked Ole Miss and #15 ranked Virginia. In both road games across the country for the Cougars they lost these two games by a combined 5 points and they had amazing defensive performances in both games. The Cougars held the Ole Miss Rebels high powered offense to a season low of 24 points and they ran the ball well on the Rebels as running back Kirby Vorhees averaged 8.8 yards per carry and a touchdown against Ole Miss. The Cougars have wins against Idaho, San Diego State, Colorado State and Toledo while the Beavers of Oregon State only has one win against a FCS Lafayette squad in a game where they were losing at halftime in. This Oregon State defense is one of the worst in division one FBS as they rank 121st in passing yards allowed per game, 83rd in rushing yards allowed per game and 119th in points allowed per game so I think this Cougars offense will find success moving the ball against this Oregon State defense.

Prediction: 27-21 Cougars

As I noted in the write-up — there’d be a good chance we’d see a more decisive win than in their prior matchup this time based on the break disparity and conversion efficiency stats from that match. Cirstea once again had 5 break opportunities, but only converted 1 of them this time instead of all 5, and it was a straightforward (6-4), (6-4) affair.

Markkanen has the Suns number for scoring this year, with 33 points midway through the 4th last I checked . He put up 51 points last game in a OT win vs them. They’re going to lose this time around, but he still showed up to make this a very sweat-free win for us.

——————————————————

**Hong Kong WTA 3:30AM EST** starts in approximately 3 hours

——————————————————

I’m going back to Hong Kong and sticking with Leylah again. I linked the write up to my previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> above, if you want to read my analysis prognosticating her match vs Cirstea. 

In this one, we have a clash of countrywomen, with Canada’s rising phenom Victoria Mboko facing Canadian #1 Leylah Fernandez. This is their first meeting, so there’s no data on that front, but there’s plenty else to analyze and try to infer upon.

So far in Hong Kong, Fernandez has annihilated every opponent, winning all three matches in clean straight sets.

She plays very well historically in this tournament, winning it in 2023 and reaching the semifinals last year.

I watched Leylah’s match against Cirstea, and it’s clear that she’s in excellent form. Her return was excellent and she used it to absolutely punish Cirstea’s second serve — winning 71% of those points.

Comparing this match to their last match in Osaka this month, something that stands out is that Fernandez won 74.4% of her first serve points this time versus only 57.9% in Osaka. 

She’s been incredibly consistent in that area, winning 75.9% vs her first round opponent Wang and 77.4% vs Lys in the 2nd round. 

Her serve is dialed in right now and I don’t see that changing against Mboko.

Mboko has been good too, but hasn’t had as clean of a run to the semifinals, needing 3 sets to beat World #134 Gibson and #51 Eala along the way. She had a nice win against #35 Kalinskaya, last round, although she retired in the second set.

Eala is a lefty like Fernandez and similar in some regards, albeit an inferior player, and gave Mboko some trouble.

Mboko has a good serve, particularly her first serve, putting up good 1st in and similar 1st win percentages to Leylah. 

Her second serve can be susceptible, as evidenced by her recent match against Rybakina in which she only won 18% of her second serves.

A similar story to what happened to Cirstea against Fernandez.

Leylah has significantly more consistent 2nd serve win percentages over the season, and I think that it’s plausible that might separate them and decide the match. 

Both players will want to win this match and prove themselves the best Canadian. I expect this to be tightly contested, but Leylah’s brilliant form and her experience edge over the young Mboko will carry her to victory in 3 sets. 

The over 21.5 games also covers a close two set win: (7-6, 6-4/3) and (7-5, 6-4). 

Don’t bet more than you can afford, and keep in mind that it is a long odds <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, keeping with my strategy. Not every <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> will hit, and I only need 45-50% to make solid profit in the long run.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Vanderbilt ML +105 (1 unit)

Write up: This ranked SEC showdown features two teams that have been on fraud watch this season. In one corner we have Vanderbilt, led by senior Diego Pavia. The Commodores are ranked inside the top ten for the first time since the 1940s with him under center, and their lone loss on the season was against Bama. Vandy has been taking care of business in conference play so far this season, and they’re coming off of a close win against a ranked Missouri squad.

In the other corner we have Texas. Led by future commercial actor Arch Manning, the longhorns strike me as the ultimate paper tiger. Sure they dominated rival Oklahoma, but that performance was preceded by an ugly loss to Florida and followed up with 2 narrow wins against SEC bottom dwellers Kentucky and Mississippi State. To make matters worse, Arch Manning is dealing with a concussion he suffered last week and yet he has been cleared to play.

This is a must win for both teams and the pressure will be palpable. I think this will ultimately come down to which QB executes better, and my money isn’t on Arch. Between the injury troubles and high expectations at home, I’m picking the Commodores to continue their last hurrah season with Pavia by getting a win in Austin. BOL to those who tail.

**Last Pick:** **Sam Houston @ Louisiana Tech | College Football | Totals Over 45.5 (-150)**

**Write Up:** Secured another win before heading into the 4th quarter. Always feels good to win early.

Alright, to the next one. Rutgers heads to Champaign, and while the number looks tempting for an over, the math — and the vibes — say otherwise.

Let’s start with the Scarlet Knights. On the road this year, Rutgers have only hit the over once in three tries — and that was the emotional game for Athan Kaliakmanis’s first trip back to his old stadium against his old team. Outside of that anomaly? The Rutgers stay pretty tamed on the road. They’re averaging just 25 points on the road while giving up 31.

Flip it to Illinois: They have hit the over just once in their four home games. They’re averaging 35 points at home while holding opponents to a tidy 17 on average. That defense has taken some serious hits and has given up an average of 39.5 points per game over the last 6 weeks. And yes, I agree, it looks bad. However, I expect some serious adjustments — and a bit of pride — to kick in for Saturday&#x27;s matchup.

Illinois is also staring down back-to-back losses for the first time this season. They haven’t dropped three straight since 2022, so you know they’re coming in focused. I don’t see them turning this into a track meet — more like a grind-it-out, Big Ten-style “get-right” game. Expect clock control, methodical drives, and a few stalled red-zone trips.

Could it get high scoring? Sure. But a shootout? Nah. Not with these trends, not with this motivation.

I’m buying up a few points and hammering Under 65.5. BOL if you decide to tail!

__Event:__ NCAAF: Vanderbilt @ Texas 12pm EST

__POTD:__ Vanderbilt +3 (-110), 3.3u to win 3u

__Write Up:__ This is a big one as we could hit 50 wins &amp; 69%. My wife has been looking forward to the 69% I’ve planned a present. Vanderbilt is one of the most surprising teams in the NCAA as they come in at 7-1 on the season, including 3-1 in the SEC. The Texas Longhorns come in off a 45-38 OT win on the road against Mississippi State to move to 6-2 on the year, including 3-1 within the SEC. Vandy has been the talk of the town &amp; all eyes will be on them this weekend. It’s an elimination game as the loser will most likely be eliminated from the playoffs.


Heisman hopeful Vandy QB Diego Pavia may be the star of the show, but Vandy’s offense is built around its run game. Vandy’s strategy, especially vs teams that are good, is to run the ball &amp; control the clock. __This has resulted in Vandy ranking 133rd in pace of play, allowing them to wear down opposing defenses.__ The strategy works because Vandy’s OLine is elite, one of the best run blocking units in the nation. Vandy has strong side &amp; quick side OL. This scheme puts players in a better position to highlight their strengths, the quick guard will be in a position to be the pulling guard more frequently. It took a little bit for Vandy to get the scheme working. But in the 2nd year of the offense, it’s running well &amp; it gives them a huge edge in the run game in this matchup. __Vandy’s OL leads the NCAA in opponent adjusted yards before contact. A huge turnaround for an OL that ranked 130th by the same metric last year.__ As for the run game matchup Vandy is clearly superior. Since Vandy leans on heavier formations that stack the box, defenses don’t respect Pavia’s arm, &amp; Vandy sees stacked boxes at a high rate. __Vandy RB’s have ran into a stacked box (7+ defenders) 77% of the time, 3rd highest rate in NCAA. When running into a stacked box, Vandy RB’s are averaging an absurd 7.3 yards per rush, most the nation. To provide some context, Ashton Jeanty averaged 6.2 yards per attempt into a stacked box.__ Pavia is a critical part of the Vandy offense due to his legs, he’s averaging 64.3 ypg on the ground, excluding sacks. __A QB always willing to chase big plays, Pavia generates an EPA of 1.0 or higher on 24% of his dropbacks vs pressure, ranked 15th. They also excel in 3rd &amp; long avoidance rate, ranking 5th at 15%.__ Their defense has been on point as well which will be huge vs a big Texas offense.

Texas has leaned on a slightly pass heavy offense this year under Manning QB Arch Manning. __Texas has thrown the ball at a rate 3.5% above expected based on situational data.__ But Manning’s availability is up in the air after a concussion vs Mississsippi St last week. If Manning can’t suit up, his backup, Matthew Caldwell, would likely take over. 
Caldwell is a redshirt-senior in his 1st year with Texas, having previously played at Jacksonville State, Gardner Webb, &amp; Troy. 
It’s hard to imagine Steve Sarkisian trusting Caldwell, who began the 2024 season as the backup at Troy, to execute Texas’s typical game plan. __Unfortunately Texas doesn’t have much of a rushing attack &amp; will be at a disadvantage on the ground based on these opponent-adjusted numbers:__

Texas: ranks 89th in yards after contact

Vandy: ranks 20th in yards after contact allowed

Vandy should have an edge vs a Steve Sarkisian spread offense, which typically creates light boxes. __Here are the stats vs small boxes with 6 or less defenders in the box, which accounts for 59% of Texas’ handoffs:__

Texas: 4.4 yards per attempt, ranked 104th

Vanderbilt: 5.4 yards per attempt allowed, ranked 67th

If Texas has to throw the ball with Caldwell, they will need a conservative attack due to his issues as a downfield passer. __Last year at Troy, Caldwell’s 49% on target rate on throws of 10 or more yards downfield ranked 130th. 
Even if Manning starts he has 51% on target rate which doesn’t inspire confidence either.__ Surprisingly, Texas has been an aggressive downfield passing team. __Outside the red zone, 30% of Texas’ pass attempts have been 15+ yards downfield, the 8th highest rate in the NCAA.__ One of the reasons Texas’ commitment to the downfield attack has been so confusing is their struggling OL. __Here is how the Texas has done this year:__

__Texas: ranked 113th in pressure rate allowed__
__Vandy: ranks 70th in pressure rate generated__

Although neither line is very strong, Vandy will likely mess them up. __Manning has taken a traditional dropback 63% of his passes, l 20th highest rate in the NCAA, which invites more pressure.__ Vandy’s pressure rate on traditional dropbacks vs quick dropbacks (zero/one step dropbacks &amp; RPOs) is a big difference:

Traditional dropbacks: 46%, ranks 35th

Quick dropbacks: 21%, ranked 73rd

Vandy has a disruptive DLine that can affect Texas’s style of play. If Caldwell starts, there’s a chance Texas could focus on quick dropbacks, he took a quick dropback 44% of the time last year at Troy, but it would be a significant change in Sark’s approach. __Texas’s 19.9% quick dropback rate ranks 123rd in the NCAA, &amp; on those plays, they are only gaining 6.0 yards per attempt, ranked 91st.__

__Vanderbilt +3__

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Thiago Agustin Tirante vs Henry Bernet | **Bernet ML at +172 (FD). 1 unit.**

Write-up: Hijikata closed at around -238, so I continued my streak of getting decent CLV. However, I don&#x27;t necessarily think it was the best play, because Rosenkranz was definitely the better player, and I feel that I should have known that he would succeed in that matchup. 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>, I&#x27;m going with Henry Bernet to beat Thiago Agustin Tirante in the first round of Athens qualifying. This is the first year that this event is being hosted in Greece (moved from Belgrade, Serbia after last year), so it&#x27;s hard to know exactly how the conditions will play. However, it can be expected that they will be reasonably fast, as with most indoor events around this time of year (with the notable exception of Paris. 18-year-old Henry Bernet is one of the top Swiss prospects right now, having won the Australian Open Juniors at the beginning of the year and drawn comparisons to Roger Federer with his one-handed backhand. Injuries have significantly affected his schedule this year, meaning he hasn&#x27;t made a ton of noise on the pro tour yet, but that doesn&#x27;t matter too much to me after the match he played against Jakub Mensik in Basel. Bernet&#x27;s serve and forehand were firing in that match (8 and 7.8 shot quality ratings), and he was able to pull off some really nice shots with the backhand as well, even if it remains inconsistent. I understand why Tirante is favored as the much more proven and well-rounded player, but two big things would concern me about backing the Argentinian here. First, he&#x27;s never really been an indoor player, even if his fast-court game might be slightly underrated. Second, he&#x27;s had a pretty packed schedule recently, switching from clay to indoor hard last week and coming here with just a day of rest after losing to Lajal in Bratislava. The odds movement on this play has been a bit weird, as Bernet moved down to 2.24 from an opening price of 2.48 before swinging all the way back to this price. However, my prediction is that this is the highest you&#x27;ll see him, and these odds present 1 unit of value to me.

Burnley vs Arsenal

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> : Burnley Under 0.5 Goals @1.66 for 4u

Arsenal have been perfect defensively in October with six straight wins and zero goals let in across all their matches, showing how solid their defense is. William Saliba and Gabriel are one of the best defensive partnerships in the Premier League, and David Raya in goal has been making excellent saves, meaning Arsenal almost never concede goals at home or away. Burnley are sitting 16th in the league with only 10 points from 9 games and have struggled badly to score, especially when playing against big teams like Arsenal. Scott Parker&#x27;s team is very defensive and they have missing several key attacking players who are injured for a long time. Arsenal are the league leaders and are hungry to keep winning, so they will control the game completely and not let Burnley have any chances to score. With Arsenal in their best defensive form of the season and Burnley struggling to score against anyone, this is one of the safe picks for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.

What an ugly performance. What should have been a score fest ended 1-0. 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Tennessee v Oklahoma over 55.5 points. +100

Units 2.63 to win 2.63 

Tennessee is a unit on offense this year. 

They’re ranked 3rd in offense yards per game
They’re ranked 2nd inoffense points per game 

Oklahoma on defense is a unit 
They’re ranked 6th in points allowed and yards allowed. 

Tennessee is going to get their points. That’s what they do. They have scored at least 30 points in every SEC game they’ve played this year except Alabama at Alabama. 

What else Tennessee does is play terrible defense. They’ve allowed every SEC team they’ve played to score 30 points including Mississippi State, Kentucky and Arkansas, which is the bottom of the SEC barrel this year. Literally bottom 3 teams in the rankings. 

Mateer has not been playing his best football and Neyland isn’t the easiest place to go play but the Swiss cheese defense Tennessee plays will allow him to let it rip. I think Tennessee wins a shootout and that’s what this will be. 

Tennessee 41-38</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Auckland FC to Win** v Adelaide United **@ $1.75**  
  
Had to go back a ways to find my last pick and it wasn&#x27;t good! New season of the ALM is here and unpredictable as ever, but I think this is good value for Auckland against Adelaide. Auckland are built around a stingy defence and measured attack, so might only be a low scoring affair, although the corresponding matches were 2-2 &amp; 4-4 last year. While most of my optimism is based around my requirements for a fantasy football win, i still think they get it done. Bonus dabble on Francis DeVries anytime assist @ $5.50.</td></tr>

Yesterday&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:  Coventry to win at Wrexham. 4u @ $1.86 ❌

Yikes, what a disaster. 

Coventry had a 1-0 lead at halftime but Wrexham looked great in the second half, and deserved their win. 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:  Arsenal to win at Burnley and u3.5 total goals. 4u @ $1.95

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Arsenal are traveling to Burnley as the league leaders. 

There&#x27;s been a lot made of Arsenal set pieces etc. But realistically, they face a lot of low blocks and there&#x27;s only a few ways you can break that down. 

Set pieces are a great way to do that. Also being afraid to cop a corner or foul someone changes the way you defend too. 

Burnley probably look like the most likely club to go down at the moment, but they have been a lot better at home and have only conceded two goals in four home games. 

In fact their 4 home games have only had a total of 8 goals.

Granted, Burnley have played the other two promoted teams at home, but they&#x27;ve also had Liverpool and Forest. And while those sides aren&#x27;t as good as they were last season, they&#x27;d still expect to beat Burnley.

In Arsenal&#x27;s four away games they&#x27;re 3-0-1, with that loss being the crazy Liverpool free kick.

Arsenal 4 away games have only had a total of 6 goals so far. 

I think Burnley are going to sit deep, keep things very tight but it won&#x27;t be enough. 

I like the u3.5 goals instead of the 2.5 for a few reasons... But at these odds I like having an extra goal up my sleeve. 

Also, Gabriel is $3.60 to have a shot on target which I think is great value as he&#x27;s a beast at corners.</td></tr>

Another day, another Moist Conflict! Though loss last time, Mbappé failed the penalty, then the goal offside and the endless chances where both teams could&#x27;ve scored on the second half. 





EPL Combo <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Brentford Over 0.5 + Liverpool vs Aston Villa BTTS

Crystal Palace versus Brentford is a matchup that historically screams goals. Looking at the last six meetings between these sides, all six have seen both teams find the net, with the average fixture producing 1.56 goals from Brentford and 1.33 from Palace. This isn&#x27;t by accident, it&#x27;s the nature of how these two play.

What&#x27;s most compelling about Brentford right now is the quality they&#x27;re bringing to every attack. Over the 2024-25 season, the Bees recorded the highest xG-per-shot in the entire Premier League at 0.15, bettering even champions Liverpool who sat at 0.14. They&#x27;ve been clinical, efficient, and prolific throughout the campaign, averaging 1.28 xG per match while taking a sharp 10.67 shots per game. Igor Thiago, Daamsgard and Kevin Schade have formed a genuinely destructive attacking unit that has blown away most defences they&#x27;ve faced. At Selhurst Park, Brentford are conceding goals at a higher rate away from home at 75 percent compared to Crystal Palace&#x27;s 75 percent at home, creating the ideal environment for a goalfest. I&#x27;m backing Brentford to score at least once, they&#x27;ve been too good to ignore in the final third.

Liverpool versus Aston Villa is where the real story unfolds. Liverpool&#x27;s defensive issues are becoming increasingly difficult to ignore, and Villa possess the attacking prowess to exploit them comprehensively. In their last 10 meetings, both sides have scored in nine of those matches, delivering consistent BTTS outcomes. Looking at the broader picture, Liverpool are conceding at an alarming 63 percent rate this season, while the Reds themselves maintain a 97 percent scoring rate across all competitions. Aston Villa, having won four in a row heading into this fixture, have shown they can trouble elite defences. Liverpool&#x27;s home record against Villa specifically shows BTTS landing in 75 percent of matches, with the Reds scoring in every single game at Anfield in their current data set while Villa managed to put the ball past them in 50 percent of away visits. Both teams averaging 1.8 and 1.4 goals respectively over their recent runs means the 3.5 goal line feels realistic. Liverpool will score because they always do at home, but Villa have the tools and form to breach Liverpool&#x27;s backline and make this interesting. Expect both teams to get on the scoresheet.





Let&#x27;s cash it!

Burnley is coming from 2 wins in a row against Wolves and Leeds which were huge for their fight against relegation. Arsenal is a different beast though. They have the best defense in the world and even on games where their opponents park the bus like Burnley will most likely do, their set pieces efficiency comes into effect. I expect a professional 0-2 win for Arsenal.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Tom Ford to WIN vs Daniel Wells -178 for 2.7u to win 1.51u on FD

Writeup: Okay so I know first things first, these odds aren’t the best but I truly believe Tom Ford enters the match with a statistical edge in both match-level and frame-level performance. His career match-win rate of ~55.7% and frame-win rate over 53% indicate that he is consistently stronger than a break-even player. Meanwhile, Wells hovers just above 50% for both match and frame wins, suggesting Ford has a higher ceiling in head-to-head play. Adding to that, Ford’s strong performance in opening matches (winning ~61.5% of his first-in-tournament matches) gives him a psychological and practical advantage when starting a fresh event like the International Championship.

Furthermore, Ford’s recent dominance over Wells…including two convincing wins in 2025…suggests he understands how to exploit Wells’s game under pressure. If Ford brings the same tactical discipline and capitalizes on early frames, he’s well-positioned to control the match rhythm and come out on top. 

As always, BOL and stick to the unit system, snooker can be a silly sport but Tom Ford is a solid veteran that I think can pull through in this match. Let’s get back on a little win streak!</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Casa Pia - Estrela Amadora Over 2.5 Goals @ 2.37 (1 Unit)
Book: Betano

⸻

🧠 Write Up

When you follow Portuguese football long enough, you notice one thing: “quiet” fixtures rarely stay quiet for long.
Casa Pia and Estrela Amadora are two of those mid-table sides that defend like they want to attack again as soon as possible.

Casa Pia’s last five games tell the story — they’ve allowed 1.0 xG or more in four of them and still created chances of their own even against Braga and Famalicão. They don’t park the bus; they press, they open spaces, and when they fall behind, the game turns chaotic fast.

Estrela are just as wild. They can look compact one week and then explode into a shoot-out the next (see their 2.6 xG home blitz against AVS). They give up big looks on the road — over 2 xG conceded away to Gil Vicente — and they’ll probably try to trade punches again here.

Add both together and you get two teams who live around the 2.5–3.0 expected-goal range most weeks. Neither has the back line to kill tempo, and both have forwards who shoot on sight.

The market still prices this like a slow, low-scoring grind. It isn’t. Anything north of 2.30 for Over 2.5 is real value — and at 2.37, it’s a bet I’m happy to take.

BOL!</td></tr>

**Write up:**

Two late games on this Saturday. Let&#x27;s hope it&#x27;s worth the wait.

**Auxerre v Marseille**

**Auxerre is 17th with only 7 points in 9 games**. Their points came from games against mid-table teams or **relegation sides**: **FC Lorient (16th), Toulouse (9th) &amp; Rennes (10th).** I must admit that Auxerre have had a pretty tough schedule so far with fixtures against teams like PSG, Lens, PSG, Nice &amp; Monaco. But they&#x27;ve also lost all of these matches and haven&#x27;t managed to upset against any of these teams. **Marseille is 3rd** in the league and is coming off losses against Lens last weekend &amp; Sporting midweek. Overall they are having a good season and with **Greenwood on top of the league in goal contributions** they are looking as far the better team here and 1.70 is way too high of an odd here in my opinion.

**Vitoria Guimaraes v Benfica**

**Vitoria Guimaraes** is normally sitting in European spots in the Portugese top flight. How different is that this season with **only 11 points after 9 games**. With **3rd-place Benfica visiting** them <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> I think they need to look at next weekend to see if they can get some more points there. Benfica is supplying **topscorer Pavlidis** with enough chances to score **8 so far** in the campaign. With 5 of those being after the last International Break he is looking on fire. Benfica is just the better team here, have the better squad and want to win here to keep up with Sporting and Porto.

**Best of luck if tailing!** 🍀

Previous game this season between the two ended 3-2. Brommapojkarna have hit this line in 18/23 games this season, averaging around 4.2 total goals per match. Vaxjo are a great matchup with 15/23 games for them hitting this line, also averaging a pretty good amount at 3.7 total per game. Both teams are very evenly matched with leaky defence and historically, this matchup has produced plenty goals with their last 4/5 meetings hitting this line.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Bayern Munich ML and O2.5 Goals + Arsenal ML (-119)


Write Up: Bayern Munich is unstoppable right now with 10 straight wins all clearing the o2.5 goal line and sitting top of the bundesliga table facing off against 5th in the table Leverkusen who&#x27;ve had a pretty decent campaign so far however they&#x27;ve lost 7-2 against psg and their defense is atrocious. Bayern will simply be too much for them here. On to the 2nd leg 1st placed Arsenal face bottom of the table Burnley and this is a game where Arsenal simply cannot afford to drop points if they want to stand any chance of winning the league so therefore I expect Arsenal to be motivated enough here to not drop any points and keep their lead at the top of the table.</td></tr>

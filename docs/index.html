**Last 5:** ✅️⬆️❌️⬆️✅️

**Sport:** Football

**Last Pick:** Mallorca vs Sevilla – BTTS – 3U

**Upcoming match:** Lyon vs Laval (20:30 CET)  

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Lyon -2 AH

**Unit stake:** 3U

**Odds:** 2.35

**To win:** 4.05U

**Recap + overview(?):**

Took the day off yesterday (mostly). Busy life and I do want to keep posting only thought out picks in <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>.

Last pick was a very solid win. Mallorca Sevilla both scored in the first half. Sweat free, just like I like them.

Let&#x27;s keep riding the momentum.

**Write Up:**

A sweat-free bet. Let’s follow that with another one. I’ve had success in the Coupe de France before, the aim is to keep that going. And this match is perfect for it.

Lyon are the in-form team right now. The last time that they’ve not won is on December 7th. 10 straight wins in the league, the cup and in Europe.

In the meanwhile, Laval lost all league games since their last win on the 25th of November

They did win 3 cup games vs Saint-Pauloise(6th tier), Guingamp (League 2, won 1-0 in the 94th minute with their only shot on target but Guingamp were dominating) and Istres (4th tier).

Laval had a relatively easy (and lucky) road to get to the round of 16 but that ends <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.

Their away record is 3-4-4 in the league. Winning against the #14, #15 and #16 home teams in the league. Losing to the #2, #5, #11 and #12.

You can probably see where this is going.

Lyon are 8-0-2 at home in 1 division higher than Laval are playing in. Losing only to PSG (#1 away) and Toulouse (#5 away).

Lyon are bound to dominate here. With PSG out of the competition and managing top 8 in Europe for an easier schedule they will want to get a relatively easy victory.

I expect them to win at least by 2 goals and am hoping for 3+. The -2 AH line is perfect for this spot and the odds are immense for what I am expecting.

Fade or tail, BOL!</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>Record 1-0 (+1U)

Last pick: Denver +3.5 v Detroit ✅✅✅

Bet: 1U

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Spurs ML

Write-up: First of all, the OKC are 1-3 against the Spurs. 

Additional data also provides that the OKC are the 3rd ranked in Net Adjusted Efficiency on road games and the Spurs are also ranked 3rd in the same category but on home games. Hence, they offset one another. 

However, on the last 5 games, the Spurs are ranked 5th against OKC’s 10th position in Net Adjusted Efficiency. To add, the Spurs are more consistent compared to OKC in trying to sustain this data. 

Lastly, the Spurs lost on the ROAD to OKC the last time they met, which will be an added fuel for them to get their lick back. I also expect the fans to jam-pack this game, which will only further help us. 

Let’s get this bag!!!</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: ZKK Partizan -3.5, 2.0, 1.5u

Both teams are heavily home-oriented, 5-0 for both, Montana slightly better in away games, but lost the last 2. The real comparison here is the games both teams played recently against Buducnost, the top team in the league.

Montana lost in the middle of January, 80-58. Partizan won at home 67-59, which was a big upset.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** **(Tennis) Ugo Humbert ML vs Adrian Mannarino + Tomas Machac ML vs Arthur Gea @ 1.61 (2 units to win 1.22 units) - 12:30 PM + 1:40 PM EST (Timings may be delayed)**

**Write Up:** Ugo Humbert plays Mannarino who had a resurgence near the end of the 2025 season and was playing at top form however recently he has playing terrible, he has not even won a game in 2026! Even losing to World #254 in Bertola... WHO? Regardless Humbert is in indoor freak, a career 58 – 32 record he is gonna destroy Mannarino. 

On the other hand we have Machac who plays Gea who had a solid run in the Australian Open beating Lehečka and going to 5 with Wawrinka. Machac however has beaten far more impressive opponents in the same tourney, beating Dimitrov, Tsisipas, and taking Musetti to 5 who was about to beat Djokovic before he retired. While Gea&#x27;s serve is really strong Machac is a good baseline returner and over the course of the match he will break Gea and will steamroll through.

Jake Walman over 1.5 shots (-160)

3 wins in a row!

Ever since Jake Walman came back from the Christmas break, he decided that his New Year&#x27;s resolution was to shoot at least 2 shots on goal every game. Well he&#x27;s doing just that and he&#x27;s now on a **11 game streak** with 2 shots! His last 3 games he even got 4, 3 and 4 shots! I know the Oilers played yesterday but in his last back-to-back game, Walman got 3 shots. Combine this with the Flames being top 10 in the league this season for shots allowed and this looks like a great game for Walman to go for a 12th game in a row with 2 shots! Oilers in their last 10 games vs the Flames also have on average 32 shots so I expect plenty of opportunities for him to shoot!

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Stuttgart ML @ 1.58

Write Up: Going with something less juicy here.

Holstein, 11th place in the 2. Bundesliga, takes on Stuttgart, 4th place in the main Big Boy bundesliga. Even though Stuttgart are away and might possibly rotate (not sure if they do), this should still be a Stuttgart win. 

Sometimes you just take lower odds for something that should not be too stressful. If you absolutely refuse you take odds like this, you can add Inter ML for a total of 2.1 odds - but I’m staying with Stuttgart ML.

BOL! I’m hoping for that 2:1 ratio - hopefully I’m not jinxing. 🙏</td></tr>

Last pick: Josh Hart (NYK) Over 8.5 Rebounds (L)❌

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>:Alperen Şengün (HOU) Over 10.5 Rebounds

Even coyote couldn&#x27;t account for a &quot;Wawa car tag&quot; level of bad luck! But Coyote doesn&#x27;t stay down. We pivot to the two most dominant &quot;future&quot; stars on the board.

Reasoning: We are looking for the &quot;Inevitable&quot; scenario. Boston is playing their second game of a back-to-back, and tired legs usually result in short jumpers. Houston is the #1 offensive rebounding team in the NBA, and Şengün is the anchor. Even with Kevin Durant (ankle) and Fred VanVleet (ACL) out, Şengün’s usage is at an all-time high. He just grabbed 16 boards last game; the momentum is essentially a freight train.

Scenario A (The Ideal): Boston settles for perimeter shots due to fatigue. Şengün cleans up the glass on the defensive end and feasts on second-chance opportunities against a Boston frontcourt that lacks a traditional 7-foot bruiser with Jayson Tatum out. He hits 11 rebounds by the end of the 3rd quarter.

Scenario B (The Grind): The refs (like Scott Foster or Tony Brothers) call a tight game, slowing the pace to a crawl. Houston runs every play through Şengün in the post. The missed free throws and slow-developing plays keep him parked in the paint, allowing him to grab &quot;easy&quot; boards off the rim.

Scenario C (The Trade Deadline Chaos): With trade rumors swirling (Harden, Giannis, etc.), the energy on the court is erratic. Rotations tighten. Şengün, being the franchise cornerstone, stays on the floor for 35+ minutes regardless of the score, simply out-working the bench players.

Scenario D (The White Flag 🏳️): Boston blows Houston out early. However, unlike Josh Hart (who gets pulled for rest), Şengün often stays in during blowouts to anchor the young lineup. He stat-pads 3-4 &quot;garbage time&quot; rebounds against Boston’s deep bench to clear the 10.5 line.

Scenario E (Cold Night): Both teams shoot under 40% from the field. This creates an &quot;infinite&quot; supply of rebounds. Even if Şengün struggles to score, the sheer volume of misses makes 11 rebounds statistically inevitable.

Scenario Proof: Şengün has averaged 11.4 rebounds over his last 5 games. Historically, he has a massive ceiling against Boston (once putting up 12 boards against them). With Boston&#x27;s interior defense weakened by the schedule and Houston’s #1 ranking in O-REB, he doesn&#x27;t need to &quot;play well&quot; to hit this; he just needs to stand near the basket.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: Under 6.5 Goals (-122) 2.44u To Profit 2u  

Write-Up: Got scary at the end of that Ducks vs Kraken game but it cashed regardless! Onto the next one we have the Chicago Blackhawks coming to Columbus to play the Blue Jackets. In net for the Blue Jackets is Jet Greaves who has been doing great this season. Jet Greaves has a save percentage of .908 and a 2.67 goals against average. On the other side, Spencer Knight is in net for the Blackhawks and he has been good every year but this year has been especially good. This season, Spencer Knight has a .909 save percentage and a 2.61 goals against average. The Blue Jackets are a pretty unimpressive team on offense, they rank 17th in goals while being 4th in shots. They don’t really have any guys who have a great shot to score goals at a high percentage of their shots. On the flip side, the Blackhawks are one of the worst offensively this season, ranking 26th in goals and dead last in shots on goal at 32nd. With the Blackhawks being one of the worst offensive teams and facing a breakout year in Jet Greaves, and then the Blue Jackets who can’t capitalize on their shots on goal, facing a great goalie in Spencer Knight, this will be a matchup with great goalies not having threatening shots on them. They will both be able to save the weak shot attempts and have a low scoring affair.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: (NHL) St. Louis Blues at Dallas Stars 8:30pm: Pavel Buchnevich o1.5 SOG (Caesers)

Odds: -137

Units: 2U

Reasoning: Originally when the odds were announced I had Kyrou at o2.5 SOG, however since the props were placed it went from +104 to -120, with that so has my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> to Buchnevich o1.5 SOG. They are linemates so the reasoning is very simple. The line of Buch, Neighbors, and Kyrou has been really impressive and a recent development. Robert Thomas got hurt and the blues were lacking centers and so they put Buchnevich at center and he has been vocal, active and driving the team forward. Neighbors got moved to Buch’s wing spot and provides strength and grit that the line needed so that when they do a dump and chase, they can actually gain and retain possession, while also having enough skill for the line to make the line productive. His has hit this line last 5/7. BOL and tail responsibly

**Last Pick: ✅** William Nylander 3+ Shots on Goal

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Mitchell Marner 3+ Shots on Goal for 2u

**Odds:** \+145

**Game:** NHL | Vancouver Canucks at Las Vegas Golden Knights | 10:00pm EST

**Reasoning:** Golden Knights are facing the worst team in the League at Home. They&#x27;ve been averaging around 28.5 SOGs per game and are going up against the worst defense in the league. Marner has had a high shot volume over the past 5 games easily surpassing 3 SOGs.

Now he is known as a playmaker passer, but that was back on the Leafs. On his current line-up he is the best talent on the ice for making a shot when they are out. Marner is on a 3 goal streak and the other primary shooter Dorofeyev has only 2 SOGs in the last 3 games. Bruce Cassidy needs a freaking win here, I think Cassidy will tell Marner to not pass but rather get that puck in the net, clearly he has the ability in the last week.

Marner will get about 20 minutes on the ice, and will be involved in both the PP &amp; PK units. which the Canucks averaging about 3.7 penalties a game. We can expect some SOGs from both sides of that equation.

Additionally, Marner is sitting at 797 career points, the boy wants 4 more points. I&#x27;m sure his team will be supporting this push and perhaps his last 5 games having higher than average SOGs support this thesis.

Tomorrow will be the 2nd to last game before the Olympic break, on a 5 game losing streak against the worst team in the league. Expect an aggressive game, high event game.

Let&#x27;s go Mitchell Marner 3+ SOGs!

\--------------------------------------------

Big win from William Nylander who secured 3 SOGs within the first 30 minutes of play! Throwing it all on Marner tomorrow for a 3-peat of SOG picks!</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: **UNC Asheville-USC Upstate O140.5 (-115 FanDuel) 1U**

Event: CBB | USC Upstate @ UNC Asheville (6:30 p.m. EST) | 🏀

*Recap: Have yourself a game, Mr. Collier. The Utah Jazz made a trade early in the day and used seven players against Indiana. So how does Isaiah Collier respond? He set a Jazz single-game assists record for a player not named John Stockton (22) and added 17 points (and just two turnovers!) in 48 minutes. FWIW his previous career high was 37 minutes. He did exactly what I thought he would. He missed all three of his 3-point attempts but got to the free-throw line a team-high eight times. His shooting from the stripe (and floor) was pretty bad, but no matter. When you&#x27;ve only got seven guys, you&#x27;re gonna chuck the rock. Oh, and Utah won 131-122. Onward.*

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s reasoning:** When UNC Asheville and USC Upstate get together, defense often goes missing for long stretches of time. These teams just combined for 152 points on Jan. 21. What&#x27;s changed in 13 days? OK, sure... USC Upstate scored 65 points in back-to-back games, which is admittedly 10 points lower than their season average. UNC Asheville scored 69 points against a Gardner-Webb team that turns every game ugly and 71 points at perennial nemesis Winthrop. The 70 point average since Jan. 21 is four points lower than *their* season average. But there are no injuries that I am aware of. So why <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> this pairing of 10-13 teams to rekindle their offenses <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>?

Because they&#x27;ve cleared 140.5 in five straight head-to-head matchups, and 7 of the last 10 meetings. Better yet, they&#x27;ve cleared 140.5 in 7 of the last 9 games played in Asheville. Against all competition, UNCA has combined to clear 140.5 in 7 of 12 home games this season. In conference play, the Bulldogs are 6-3 to the over. Against USC Upstate specifically, UNCA has averaged 79.6 points over the last 10 meetings and has cleared 80 as a team in four of the last five (83, 92, 93, 95).

Meanwhile, USC Upstate is averaging 75.4 points over its last five games against UNCA, including 85- and 92-point outings last season, when UNCA had a much better team. Both KenPom and BartTorvik are projecting totals just over 140.5, so buyer better beware. But I like this matchup as an offensive get-right game for both sides. UNCA averages 2.3 more points per game at home, which is to be expected. If the Bulldogs hit their usual 75 in front of a friendly Kimmel Arena crowd, all USC Upstate needs is 66 points. That&#x27;s actually two points less than what UNCA usually allows at home. But the Spartans have gone for at least 64 in four of their last five games in Asheville. And get this, USC Upstate is averaging 11 more points on the road against conference opponents than at home (74.3 vs. 63.3). What an incredible split. In their last five road games overall, they&#x27;ve notched 65, 69, 86 (OT), 77, and 65 - 72.4 average.

USC Upstate likes to push the pace, and they&#x27;ve been more efficient with it on the road for whatever reason. KenPom puts their adjusted tempo at 155. On the road, as an underdog, I wanna see them gunning. Both teams&#x27; defensive ratings are in the 210s. UNCA has the second-best 3-point field goal percentage in the Big South Conference (36.1). Both sides are middle of the pack for guarding the deep ball. That tells me that we could see some offensive spurts thanks to outside shooting. In Jan. 21 game, they combined for 36 takes from range, and both made right at their season average.

My thesis: I look to UNCA to flirt with dropping another 80 on USC Upstate. I also look for the Spartans to push the ball and play to their conference road game average (74) and/or L5 average against UNCA (75). That totals 154/155, easily more than the line for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, and a basket better than they played on Jan. 21 - which did not feature any outlier offensive shooting performance. Even if UNCA scores just a typical 75 at home, all we need is 66 from USC Upstate. The current spread is 6.5. That implies that USC Upstate will get 68, 69. This might be tight, but I like my chances with two teams looking for offensive answers on their buildup to a one-bid conference tournament.

Good luck and Godspeed!

Writeup: Awesome 2nd half by Xavier, unfortunately the 1st half was a total blowout.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: 🏀 Duquesne +13.5 alt spread + San Francisco -2.5 alt spread (-127).

Game 1 starts at 7pm EST. Bet 2.5u

Writeup: Let’s start with Duquesne. They go up against a 20-2 George Mason team with a top 30 quality of record and are ranked top 75 in the league. Beyond this, I don’t see why Duquesne shouldn’t have a chance to get an upset victory. Their offense vs the GM defense is about as even as they come, and while I would give an advantage to the GM offense, I like Duquesne to rebound effectively and create some turnovers as well. Additionally, Duquesne should have an offensive advantage with shot around the rim, and GM likes to prevent the 3 ball and is a bit softer down low. This is another game where we back the underdog with a polar opposite play style to the favorite. GM’s pace of play is 335th, whereas Duquesne’s is 63rd. Add on top of this that GM has been very inconsistent, plays some of their worst ball at home, and have not had a convincing win in a month, I think Duquesne has a shot to win on the road. We’ll take them to cover by +13.5.

Next is San Francisco vs Loyola Marymount. The big driving factors for me here are defense, momentum, and 3-point shooting, with a few smaller factors on top. San Fran has a defense efficiency just outside the top 100, whereas LMU has an offense efficiency almost in the 300s. San Fran also has a momentum ranking just outside the top 100. Not that impressive, but when you compare it to LMU’s ranking of 365th…oh look that’s dead last in the league. We just took Santa Clara to beat them on Saturday, and Santa Clara won by over 30. LMU has lost 6 straight and I have no reason to trust them. I feel good about this one, so give me San Fran to cover a -2.5 spread at a solid price.

### ⚽ <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Racing Club Reserve ML @ 1.62 (-161) - 2 Units

**The Analysis:**
We are officially in the green! After a rocky 0-2 start, we’ve hit **three wins in a row** and the momentum is real. <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> we’re looking at the Argentine Reserve League, a market where the gap between the &quot;Big 5&quot; and the rest is often massive.

Racing Club (Home): They have one of the most prestigious academies in Argentina. At home, they are incredibly disciplined, physical, and technical. They usually suffocate teams that don&#x27;t have the same level of tactical training.
     
Barracas Central (Away): To put it bluntly, their youth setup is one of the weakest in the division. They simply don&#x27;t have the infrastructure to compete with a giant like Racing. Their recent form is abysmal: **only 1 win in their last 10 matches.**
* **The Play:** While Reserve games can sometimes be low-scoring or tricky, the quality difference here is too large to ignore. Racing should dominate possession and eventually find the breakthrough.

**Write Up:** Brutal red card 29 minutes in for Hearts sealed the fate really, poor showing from Hearts conceding late anyway when down to 10 men. It is what it is, you can&#x27;t predict players being sent off really. Apologies for that.

Si Jiahui has won all 3 of their head-to-head matchups, latest being around a month ago. He is good at getting decent scores with accurate play - I do think he starts better and can continue good form and carry on a lead to secure the win. Jiahui comes into this with 3/2 (W/L) in their last 5 games, with Wilson going 2/3, you may suggest that they have similar records however Wilson with the worse form in combination to the poor H2H record points to Jiahui winning. 

Ronnie and Josh O&#x27;Connors last matchup came in the Saudi Arabia Masters - with O&#x27;Sullivan going 5-0. Both players are not in the greatest of form but I do think Ronnie is the better player here. I see him potentially dropping a frame or two but I do think he sees this one out.

It’s debut campaign saw it run really well in all 3 starts, culminating in a 2nd placing in the Reginald Allen to the eventual Carbine Club winner (big 3yo races).

The break in between preps has seemed to do wonders for this horse, as she’s looked to come back impressively based on the two trials this time in. We draw barrier 5 and get the best jockey in the world on top, so I’m fairly confident we’ll end up with a grouse spot in running, probably the 1-1.

We have a dominant ratings profile over the rest of the field, however I am cautious that the rating came in our grand final as opposed to first up, but with the expected improvement I can forecast a similar number here.

As I go down the list of opposition, I can <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> many holes in them. SIGNOR TORTONI, our main market rival, has trialled the house down either side of its first up run, but that run was absolutely awful, finishing dead last. I can’t possibly trust that horse currently. CLEAR PROOF and KILBRANNAN are going well but they’re definitely not up to the class of our horse. That leaves SNITZEL DANCER, who hasn’t done much at the trials but showed its class last prep, however we comfortably had its measure when we matched up.

We’re going with Tundra ML.

If you saw my last post, you know Yandex absolutely killed our parlay last time. They looked disjointed and totally lost on the map. I’m not trusting them with my money again until they get on the same page.

On the other side, Tundra has historically owned this matchup. They have an 8-4 record against Yandex all-time, and they usually dismantle teams that play loose. Getting Tundra at 1.8 odds is honestly a steal they are just the more disciplined team atm. Yandex might have Watson and Saksa, but they aren&#x27;t playing like a unit rn.

PSV face Heerenveen in the KNVB Beker with both sides aiming to reach the next round. Cup matches are often cautious early, with more risks taken after halftime.

**Event:** EFL Cup, Manchester City v Newcastle United, 3:00 pm EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Newcastle Win or Draw, +105, 1 unit

**Write Up:** Manchester City gave us a nice win in our most recent fade and I&#x27;m repeating the process here. They once again looked dreadful in that second half against Tottenham, showing they really do **struggle to beat their bogey teams** and that they far too often **take their foot off the gas** after going up.

Newcastle are not only a bit of a **bogey team** for Man City, but also **take this cup more seriously** after not really being in contention on the other fronts. They&#x27;re trailing on aggregate, so I&#x27;m expecting them to come in **all guns blazing** to try and cut the deficit, and I can see them nabbing a draw or a narrow win, *which ultimately isn&#x27;t going to be enough to see them through,* but should be enough to secure another win on the board. They&#x27;re a physically **strong, well organized** side that can cause a lot of damage to **City&#x27;s lacklustre backline** even on their good day, let alone in the form they&#x27;re in at the minute. Because of that, I logically also like the look of the BTTS Yes if you want to sprinkle something extra on this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>.

That was our 8th win playing Enzo for the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>, every one of those was plus money other than one.

Enzo came through for us again in less sweaty fashion as he lands an SOT before halftime. Gotta love it!

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> we&#x27;ve got the last semi final for the EFL Cup as Man City host Newcastle. City is already up 2-0 on aggregate here. This should be an even more open game as Newcastle need to score at least 2 goals. We have cashed Semenyo a few times in the soccer thread over the last few weeks and I like him here again <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. His goal over the weekend was on a counter attack and I expect that to be City&#x27;s main threat <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. 

Semenyo has been on a tear since joining City, scoring a goal in 4 out of 5 games played. He has scored in two straight EPL games and also scored in this reverse fixture a few weeks back at Newcastle. I&#x27;m buying down the risk a bit here as ATGS is +190, since City have been moving towards a two pronged attack with Haaland and Semenyo up front. The two have had great link up play the last few games, so I love that we are still in plus odds and adding the option of an assist to cash.

**Explanation:**

I see good value Maestrelli in this match. He had a solid run in Australia, qualifying for AO and won his first match against Erhard, who has been playing well recently. He is currently number 117 in the world and meeting number 306 in the world. 

Shelbayh made a good progression the last year but has not really shown a good form recently. Besides his match yesterday, he has not won a match since October last year and I believe this match is going to be a too big a mouthfull against a Maestrelli who has won 5 out of his 7 matches this year and played all matches on hard court (and one of the matches he lost was to Djokovic, which almost shouldn&#x27;t count as a lost match in this statistic).

I see a good value in this bet and good luck!

**Last:** (CBB) Indiana ML (1.5u) - L

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** (CBB) No. 10 Michigan State (-6.5) at Minnesota

**Start Time:** 7:00 PM ET (BTN)

**Odds:** \-112 (DraftKings)

**Units (to win):** 1.5U

**Reasoning:** Death. Taxes. Another Sparty donation?

There hasn’t been a lot of coin respecting going on when it comes to Michigan State as of late. That’s largely in part to some slow starts, as the team stumbled out of the gate in each of its two games last week against Rutgers and Michigan, trailing at the half by nine and 16 points respectively. But while a second-half surge helped the Spartans (19-3) outlast the Scarlet Knights in overtime, it was a case of too little, too late against the Wolverines. The loss snapped a seven-game win streak and dropped the team to 4th in the Big Ten standings.

But if there’s one thing head coach Tom Izzo knows how to do, it’s to bounce back: Michigan State is 31-13-2 ATS following a loss over the last five years.

However, don’t expect Minnesota to make it easy. Despite a 3-8 mark in conference play—and having lost each of its last seven games—the Gophers (10-12) have been a tough out in the opening half of games. In fact, the team has either led or been tied at the half in four of its last six contests. That includes being knotted up at 34 against then-No. 13 Illinois and leading 36-30 against then-No. 7 Nebraska. Elite defense has been the name of the game, as Minnesota ranks 10th in first half scoring defense (29.7 PPGA).

Unfortunately, that’s about the only positive the team can hang its hat on.

After a 10-5 start to the season, it’s been all downhill for the Gophers. Through 22 games, the team ranks 125th in field-goal percentage (45.5%), 163rd in offensive efficiency (1.064), 242nd in three-point shooting (32.7%) and 245th in scoring (71.8 PPG). Not the kind of numbers you want to bring into a matchup with a Spartans defense that enters ranked 8th in opponent field-goal percentage (39.1%), 9th in scoring defense (64.4 PPGA), 11th in defensive efficiency (0.928) and 40th in opponent three-point shooting (30.4%). The last time the team came off a loss, the unit limited USC to just 17 first-half points and 51 for the game on just 33% shooting (18% from beyond the arc).

Things don’t get any more promising on the defensive end.

On the year, the Minnesota defense can be described average at best, ranking 48th in scoring defense (68.8 PPGA), 97th in opponent field-goal percentage (42.9%), 102nd in defensive efficiency (1.020) and 195th in opponent three-point shooting (34.2%). However, over the last six games, the unit has been leaking water, conceding an average of 76.2 points on 46.2% shooting from the field (40.7% from long range). For a Michigan State offense that ranks 53rd in offensive efficiency, Wednesday night’s matchup could be like stealing candy from a baby. Especially with point guard Jeremy Fears Jr. (14.9 PPG, 8.8 APG) playing the way he has as of late.

Trust Sparty to bounce back convincingly.

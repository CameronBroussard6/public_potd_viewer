*Last 5:* ❌✅✅✅❌

**CFP - Indiana vs Oregon, 7:30 EST, ESPN**

***Indiana -2.5 (-151) 1.5u***

The second of 5 straight football plays takes us to the other half of the college football playoff, as undefeated Indiana takes on Oregon in the Peach Bowl.

Watching this line all week, seeing it drop from -165 to -150ish kinda scares me a bit, but it also gives me more value for a spread I was going to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> anyways. Word to Joe &amp; Soggy, and much of the nation, *Indiana is the team everyone is leaning on*, but I can’t find myself to stray from the public - I’m just a bit of a pussy, and I’ll pay for the insurance.

There’s of course metrics and data and information we can dive into - but honestly, the simple and plain fact of the matter is **Indiana has already beaten Oregon this year, and made them look basic in the process**.

You can stop reading here if you want - unless you believe the old adage in college football that *”it’s difficult to beat a team twice”*

For me, when the stage is this big, I have to lean on what makes the most sense to lean on: similar to my thinking in the first college football playoff game (kinda didn’t work, disclaimer), **I think the more balanced team, with the stronger defensive unit, will win**.

**Indiana are undefeated**, they’ve only **allowed more than 2 scores in 1 of their last 7 games**, they are the **number 2 overall defensive unit** in the country: they **rank in the top 3 in the country in yards against, rush yards against, scoring D &amp; 3rd down D**.

I shall not disregard the fact *Oregon have an elite level defensive unit themselves*, but Indiana have the offensive unit to match in spades: **7th in total offense, 3rd in scoring, the number 1 3rd down offense** - a lot of elite level ingredients to concoct successful playoff football.

Add to the fact that this feels like the Fernando Mendoza party - we are all just invited. The kid is a stud, and seems un-phased by the limelight. 

Give me Indiana by a FG minimum.

Last play review:

***CFP - Miami +7.5/Total u56.5 (-119) 1.5u*** ❌

(Boy oh fucking boy, if that isn’t the definition of a turn, I don’t know what is - this seemed cruised for a W before 4 lead changes in the 4th quarter made it a god damn tightrope - all the what ifs to reflect over this one: Miami had 3 INTs ripe to grab, a compete and utter lack of big play containment, and the touchdown on Miami’s final drive of regulation to kill us - this one is a heartbreaker)

Rose and Vinyl face off in the 2nd game of the season after seeing each other in the 2025 championship (Rose 62-54). Rose also won 2 out of 3 matchups in the 2025 season but there have been roster changes on both sides.

Rose retained 4 of their 6 with most notably Chelsea Gray returning. Rose didn&#x27;t miss a beat in their first game winning 80-62 against a shorthanded (and maybe league worst) Lunars Owls. Gray had a 35 point game and fowards Azurá Stevens and Shakira Austin (new addition) stepped up enough with Reese leaving the team. Kahleah Copper was ruled out but believe she&#x27;s expected to make her debut on Friday. 

Vinyl continue to be led by Rhyne Howard and Dearica Hamby but struggled in the first game losing 58-42 against a solid veteran Laces team. Vinyl&#x27;s explosive offense fueled their 2025 playoff run but they are still figuring it out. Losing 3 players (Ogunbowale, Boston, Canada) plus returning player Rae Burrell being out clearly impacted their opening performance. 

I think Rose continue off their momentum and win against Vinyl. Could keep an eye on injury updates for Copper or Burrell, but I think the Rose can keep their edge over Vinyl either way. BOL</td></tr>

Mirra Andreeva is still trying to bounce back from a disappointing end to last season, and so far she&#x27;s doing well.  <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> she faces Marta Kostyuk who is on an impressive 4-match win streak on hard courts, coming off of a surprising upset of #3 Anisimova and determined to get back into the top 10.  Andreeva is favored, but with Kostyuk being in impressive form and having high confidence after her defeat of Anisimova, I see the *possibility* of an upset, so I&#x27;m taking a different angle here.  Andreeva lately has had a tendency to get a very slow start, indicated by the fact that her last 5 matches have all gone 3 sets.  I anticipate this will be an intense, highly contested match.  Kostyuk will likely steal a set here, but since there isn&#x27;t much value in her set spread, I&#x27;m instead betting over 21.5 games.  Expect a winner to be decided only after 2 or 3 long, competitive sets.</td></tr>

Stake: 2 units to win 4 units

Write Up:

Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> didn’t hit, so we reset and move on. Going with a player prop here.

I’m backing Julian Brandt to get at least one shot on target. In his last four competitive games he’s averaging 2 shots per match, and he’s been consistently getting one on target. On top of that, he’s in great form lately, scoring 4 goals in his last 3 games, including two against Bodø/Glimt in the Champions League.

He’s also done damage against Frankfurt before, scoring against them in their last meeting in the DFB Pokal. Even though he’s listed as a midfielder, Brandt loves getting into scoring positions, arriving late in the box, and his involvement has clearly gone up recently.

What I also like here is the matchup. In their last game, Frankfurt conceded a goal and allowed 3 shots on target from opposing midfielders, which lines up well with Brandt’s role and positioning.

We only need one on target, and at plus money this feels like a solid bounce-back spot with the stats backing it up.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Brisbane Roar Vs Auckland FC - **Auckland FC Win or Draw (Double Chance)+Over 1.5 Total Goals @ 1.72 (Melbet)**

**Write Up:** Brisbane Roar host Auckland FC in a match that looks more likely to produce goals than control. Both teams tend to play open football, and recent games suggest defensive discipline often takes a back seat once the match opens up.

Brisbane Roar’s recent form highlights ongoing defensive problems. They have lost three of their last five league matches, conceding eight goals in those defeats. That run includes a heavy 3–0 home loss to Wellington Phoenix, who were down to 10 men, and a 2–1 defeat away at Macarthur. Even in tighter games, such as the 1–0 loss to Melbourne City, Brisbane struggled to apply sustained pressure once they went behind.

At home, Brisbane Roar’s issues have been even clearer. In two of their last three home games, they conceded three goals and failed to score in both losses. While their away win against Central Coast Mariners showed they can be dangerous on the counter, that style hasn’t translated well at home, where they’re expected to control the game instead. Over the season as a whole, Brisbane Roar have scored just 11 goals in 12 matches. Even though they’ve conceded a similar number, their lack of attacking balance often leaves them chasing games rather than dictating the tempo.

Auckland FC come into this match with a stronger overall profile. They have won six of their 11 league games and scored 16 goals, showing they are more effective going forward. Recent away wins against Western Sydney Wanderers and Central Coast Mariners highlight their ability to handle pressure while still attacking with intent. Defensively, Auckland FC are not without their weaknesses. They conceded three goals at home to Newcastle Jets, and their 1–1 draw at Macarthur showed they can be exposed when teams attack them directly. Still, once games open up, Auckland often respond well and usually create enough chances to regain control.

Brisbane Roar come into this match after another away defeat in the A-League, making it back-to-back league losses. Looking at their recent form, the over 1.5 goals line has landed in three of their last five matches, though that drops to two out of five at home. Despite this, Brisbane’s recent performances haven’t been very convincing, and it feels like Auckland FC could take advantage of that. Auckland, on the other hand, have seen over 1.5 goals in four of their last five games and have either won or drawn in four of those matches. They are also unbeaten in their last five away games, with the same over 1.5 goals trend continuing on the road.

Overall, Auckland appear to be in much better shape in terms of form and momentum and could prove too strong for Brisbane. Their solid away form and sharper attacking play give them an edge against a Brisbane side that has struggled to assert itself at home. If Auckland take the lead, the match setup suits them, as they have the ability to stay on the front foot rather than sit back and defend.

Not much to add to what already has been written on this matchup.  Both teams have top ranked offenses and defenses, but Indiana has just been a bit more impressive overall.  Statistically, Indiana ranks better in most categories as well.  They have been the best squad all year and I expect them to move on to the final.  So the moneyline part is not in question, it is about the points total.

I’m expecting points from these two teams which has been the norm throughout the season.  The O/U is currently at 48.5, but we can tease it down by 10 points to get us to 38.5 and a -110 scenario when combined with the ML.</td></tr>

However, Gokulam is pretty decent in defense, so going conservative &amp; taking a 2 goal asian line for EB to score.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Taiwo Awoniyi ATGS (+195) 1 unit to win 1.95 units

**Write Up:** That one hurt guys. 5 shots for Szoboszlai, including 2 free kicks, and he airmailed all of them. He had a great game too all around, and looked the most promising for Liverpool to score. I&#x27;m bordering fade territory with a couple unfortunate losses, might be best to limit your units or stay away for a few games. These plays are fun for me to back and gives me something to root for during the game, so we keep charging along. 

EPL goes on a bit of a break as the FA Cup comes to life this weekend. For those unfamiliar, the FA cup is a cup between pretty much ALL English professional teams, starting with over 700 teams. We are currently in the 3rd round with 64 teams, which is the first round that EPL and Championship teams join the matches. The FA cup is typically more prestigious than the EFL Cup, and the winning team earns an automatic berth in the Europa League next season. In these early rounds, you tend to see Premier League sides play a B team and lower division sides throw their all at the game to try and advance. 

For this match Wrexham, aka Hollywood FC, (9th in 2nd tier) host Nottingham Forest (17th) place in the EPL. Forest are in a proper relegation battle this season, so coach Dyche is going to have to preserve his top players and hope that mostly subs can grab the win here. Worst case he will throw on the bigger names after halftime if it looks grim. Wrexham have played 4 matches since Christmas, but also have a week off after this match so I expect mostly their first team. 

Taiwo Awoniyi (Big T) is an easy player to root for. He is a big and powerful center forward who a high motor, great attitude, and works super hard. He has had a really tough go of it over the last year, facing a really serious head injury at the end of last season when he collided with a goalpost. He&#x27;s had a slew of other injuries this year, but he&#x27;s finally fit again. This game is a prime game for him to show what he can do and finally get a chance. 

There is really no great data here to back up this play, because the sample size is so small. He scored a goal last season in the FA cup 4th round, but has otherwise struggled to find playing time. But with Wood out, and Kali out on loan, Big T will get his chance here as the team&#x27;s 2nd striker (Igor Jesus needs a rest). I&#x27;m backing that a premier league striker can find the back of the net against a 2nd division back line. 

No doubt this is a risky play, while I feel strongly that Big T will start, **lineups are always a risk in these cup games.** I personally am playing this now, as I expect the odds will go down once he is confirmed starting and lineups are out. But they&#x27;ll still be plus money, so please do your own research and consider the risk. 

BOL and happy Friday!</td></tr>

**Write Up:** Senegal are unbeaten against Mali historically and haven&#x27;t conceded more than 1 goal in any AFCON game so far. Senegal are a very organized, very sturdy team that plays as a unit, is top 10 in the world (in my opinion, FIFA ranks them #19) right now, doesn&#x27;t concede many chances, and most importantly is consistent. Mali on the other hand keep games very quiet, they&#x27;re okay-ish defensively, but are a team that&#x27;s relatively inexperienced and capitulates at most challenges.

**Event:** Scottish Championship, Ross County v Partick Thistle, 2:45 pm EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Ross County 0.0 Asian Handicap +135, 1 unit

**Write Up:** From the AFCON and the Spanish Super Cup in Saudi Arabia, the journey takes us to the good old second tier of Scottish football, where I&#x27;ve come across this very interesting matchup. We have the second placed Partick Thistle *(I could swear this team was called Patrick, immersion has just been broken)* travelling to Ross County&#x27;s ground. Ross County currently sit dead last on measly 13 points, in comparison to Partick&#x27;s impressive 40.

*The form, as well as H2H also favor the guests,* as Ross County are winless in over 5 league games and they&#x27;ve lost the last three H2H encounters, conceding 7 and scoring just 2 in the process. The home team boasts a terrible goal difference of -18, having scored at a rate of less than a goal per game (18 in 19), while conceding almost twice per game (36 in 19). On the other end, Partick aren&#x27;t showing many cracks in their game, maintaining a positive goal difference with 33 goals scored and 23 conceded.

So, why on earth am I then backing Ross County if all the signs point to a Partick Thistle masterclass? Firstly, the **line just seems like a trap,** as at the time of writing, Partick&#x27;s ML is sitting at +105 odds. Secondly, Ross County are **playing at home,** and I&#x27;ve observed that especially the UK teams tend to get a big morale boost on their own ground. I have already backed the team that was supposed to be the paper favorite in a similar kind of matchup before, **and they&#x27;ve almost always dropped points.** So, I&#x27;m not making the same mistake. Taking the Ross County 0.0 Asian Handicap at the beautiful +135 odds because I truly believe in a sneaky Ross County win, while a draw isn&#x27;t disastrous. This is essentially a DNB <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, but for whatever reason, my book offers slightly higher odds on the 0.0 Asian Handicap. Make sure to check if that&#x27;s the case in your book too. Going with just the one standard unit because, knowing my luck recently, Ross County are getting hammered 3-0 with all the goals coming after the 80th minute. BOL and let&#x27;s enjoy another mad clash together ☘️🫡

Last Pick: Johannus Monday -2.5 games vs Tom Gentzsch (-138, 1 unit) ✅

Tennis | ATP Hong Kong | 7:10 AM EST (estimated)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Alexander Bublik vs Juncheng Shang | **Bublik ML at -163 (BET365). 1 unit.**

Write-up: Easy win for Monday, as he seemed to be a level above Gentzsch in that one. That brings me to 4-1, +2.54 units in 2026, and I&#x27;m looking to continue my strong form with this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>!

Alexander Bublik comes in to Hong Kong ready to make an impact after an up-and-down 2025 that saw him capture four ATP titles but also win three games in a BO5 match (to be fair, it was against Jannik Sinner). He already got off to a good start against Botic, winning in just under an hour with an 8.36 performance rating, while Shang took down Sonego (7.57) and Comesaña (7.37). The market has been trending towards Shang, as Bublik opened at -200 before dropping to this price, and I completely understand why. Shang is a talented but injury-prone lefty who finally seems to be healthy again, has the crowd behind him, and has a 2-1 H2H advantage in this matchup. However, there&#x27;s also a pretty simple case for Bublik: he&#x27;s the better overall player, and his serve does so much damage on these courts. Shang is certainly a crafty player who demands patience in rallies, but Bublik has started to show a willingness to not bail out early with a drop-shot or slap forehand. The two matches where Shang beat Bublik came in late 2024, a low point in Bublik&#x27;s career where he didn&#x27;t seem to enjoy being on court, and yet Bublik was still able to keep those matches quite competitive (with one going to five sets). This is a big step up in competition for Shang, and I see Bublik coming through here.</td></tr>

I’m a Blues fan. They are awful, especially defensively. The Mammoth might score 5 by themselves. Only the Anaheim Ducks have given up more goals this year. Hofer will be in goal, who has been better than Binnington, but the defense is so bad it’s hard to trust anyone in net.

On the other side, Vejmelka has started 4 games in a row, so it seems possible that they go to the backup Vanecek in this one. He’s only got 2 wins in net this year with a .879 save percentage and 2.92 GAA.

Good Luck!</td></tr>

In that debut run, we drew barrier 1 (like we do here), but instead of using that to advantage, we stepped slowly and ended up 7/8 in the run. Despite this, we still won running away by over 2 lengths, running the fastest last 200m split of the race by a fair bit.     
    
Trainer has indicated that the desire is to lead this race, or at very worst be 2nd/3rd in run, which would be ideal as there’s nothing in this race that could match our last 400/200 split. Natural development and 2nd race start will help all horses, but I don’t think any horse from the debut race can reverse that result regardless, and the first starters haven’t shown much.

**Tennis - ATP Hong Kong - Rublev ML** \[2U to win 1.05U (-190)\]

Time: 1:40 AM EST

 

Reasoning:

2-0 H2H record, Rublev is a player with a big first serve and big forehand that&#x27;s been around the top 20 for a long time. He&#x27;s mentally weak in big moments - however he&#x27;s just starting his season off in a small ATP 250 so shouldn&#x27;t be any nerves, and beat Yibing Wu who&#x27;s in good form recently (beat Medvedev, Korda late last season) and beat marozsan in straight sets. He beat Yibing Wu 6-2 and 6-1 last couple sets after dropping the first which is a steamroll, and indicates he found his groove at the end of the match.

 

Borges is an all-around solid player, but his mobility is mid so he is prone to being hit through. His power is decent but not great - good fundamentals but no big weapons. He&#x27;s playing decently right now having beat Cilic (big server, old, no mobility) and Dzumhur (short clay specialist, good mobility 0 power). I think Rublev&#x27;s power will be too much for him here, as has been historically with their record. Don&#x27;t see borges winning this unless Rublev completely doesn&#x27;t show up or gets injured. I would give Rublev an \~80% chance of winning this, so this line is good value. I actually got it at -220 when it first came out so getting worse odds than what you guys can get.</td></tr>

• ⁠Model has Indiana winning by 6+ points

• Model projects that 80% chance Indiana ML 

• EV better betting 100$ = 10-11$ for this play

• You just have to keep betting the red-hot Hoosiers - both teams had GREAT games in the first round, so I expect another great one here - Indiana and Oregon have already faced off once this year, with the Hoosiers finishing on top, 30-20. Indiana defense is legit, they average about 11 PPG on the defensive end, which is top 3 nationally - they get turnovers, they get after QB&#x27;s, they are, in my opinion, the most complete defensive team in college football this year - On the offensive side of things, Mendoza is a dog - over 3,000 yards passing, over 35+ touchdowns, and their offense averages 41.6 PPG - Even though Oregon also has a great defense, I believe Indiana is more efficient and takes care of the ball here - Not to mention, Oregon&#x27;s RB room is running low, especially after the injury to Davison last game - Indiana has a slight edge in this rematch, they are one of, if not the hottest team in college football - Give me the Hoosiers -3.5

I am starting to believe the curse of 2026 is real. If you read this, be prepared to fade me. I have a lot of faith in turning this around but for now as long as the streak is like this, best thing to do is not listen to me.

Al Nassr failed us once again. Might be better to fade the ones making us lose. Lesson learned (or not?)

**Write Up:**

3U bets are not looking good but I am a lot of things and stubborn is one of it. Let’s try again.

This one might be a bit riskier but maybe that is the key to breaking this terrible streak.

Getafe are a menace at home. In 8 games they’ve scored 7 goals and conceded 6. Low scoring affairs are their thing and Real Sociedad with a 1-4-4 away record scoring only 9 in 9 away games are bound to walk into another disappointment.

Over in England we have an FA cup game between Wrexham and Nottingham Forest. Wrexham have scored in all their home games this season and Nottingham have conceded 17 in 11 games this season away from home.

All I am asking for is 1 goal and Getafe to do their thing. Is that too much? It probably is.

Fade or tail, BOL!</td></tr>

__Event:__ NCAAF: Indiana vs Oregon 7:30pm EST

__POTD:__ Indiana -3 (-125), 3.75u to win 3u (*bought .5 pt*)

__Write Up:__ This Semifinals matchup is a rematch from earlier this season, where Indiana won 30-20 in Oregon as an underdog. Indiana coach Curt Cignetti came into Indiana &amp; completely changed the program. In the 3 years before Cignetti’s arrival Indiana had a 9-27 record. Since his hiring he has led Indiana to its only two 10 win seasons in school history, with a 25-2 record in 2 seasons, &amp; they are currently undefeated playing for the national title. Cignetti was a former Nick Saban assistant so it makes sense how he has the blueprint for success. Interestingly, all 4 head coaches left in the playoffs were at one point on Saban&#x27;s staff. That includes Oregon coach Dan Lanning who also has only lost 2 games in the past 2 seasons &amp; is coming off a 23-0 win over #4 Texas Tech. Despite a 23-0 win, Oregon didn’t look great as they had a net success rate just above 5%. Lanning attempted 8 4th down conversions, converting just 4 &amp; went 4 for 19 on 3rd downs. TT’s offense also isn’t as strong as its 39.4 ppg suggests, ranking just 41st in offense FEI. Now Oregon looks to get revenge after their previous loss vs Indiana, which was a slugfest. 

Indiana’s defense stole the show in the 1st game, holding Oregon to just 13 offensive points. Oregon’s offense had just a 39.7% success rate. Oregon QB Dante Moore was sacked 6 times, the 3rd most sacks taken by an Oregon QB since 2014. He was pressured a massive 20 times. Indiana’s 50% pressure rate was the highest rate Oregon had allowed since 2020. But Moore is getting the ball out much faster in the 2nd half of the season. He went from averaging 2.8 seconds throw time down to around 2.3. But that hasn’t helped much as he has thrown 3 INTs in the playoffs, including a 0-1 TD-INT ratio vs TT. He’s had at least 1 TO worthy play in 5 of his last 6 games. Indiana ranks #1 in the nation in TO margin (+18). Moore has also struggled in the red zone, owning negative EPA when passing inside the 20. Oregon ranks just 47th in TD rate in the red zone. Indiana ranks No. 1 in TD rate allowed (26%). Oregon’s biggest success in the red zone has come from RB Jordon Davison, who is tied for 13th in rushing TDs nationally. Davison averaged 7.4 ypc vs Indiana in Week 7. But he has been ruled out with a broken clavicle. Oregon also just lost RB Jayden Limar to the portal. This is a major concern for Oregon’s offense since they run the 3rd most 2RB packages in the country. OC Will Stein runs a Sean McVay inspired offense utilizing 2RB’s/2TE’s. When these teams first met 52% of Oregon’s plays were in those formations, but that rate has jumped to 65% recently. Indiana allows just 3.4 yards per run (18th) vs 2RB/2TE formations. 48% of the Oregon’s carries go to the outside, they avg 6.6 yards/run. Indiana allows just 2.6 yards/carry (3rd nationally) against outside zone concepts, with the highest stuff rate and the most TFLs. Another issue with Davison being out is he ranks #2 among Big Ten RBs by PFF on pass blocking snaps, which will be tough to replace. It’s unlikely they pressure Moore 20 times again, but Indiana does currently rank 13th in pressure rate generated. However this is a new-look defensive front for Indiana since Week 7. Indiana will be without edge rusher Stephen Daley, who was injured in the Big Ten title. Because of this they primarily went with a 3 DL look vs Bama. Oregon has averaged 5.8 ypc vs 3 DL (7th) but that number is skewed by weak defenses in James Madison, USC, &amp; Minnesota. Texas Tech has a much more similar DL to Indiana &amp; used 3 DL sets 17 times. They held Oregon to just 2.4 ypc &amp; a negative EPA/play. In their last matchup Indiana went to 3 DL sets just 6 times, holding Oregon to -2.0 ypc. Indiana’s defense will look much different this time around, but their offense will as well.

Indiana’s offense has been elite this season. Heisman QB Fernando Mendoza has led their offense to rank #1 in EPA/Play. They’ve lost just 8 turnovers (3rd), they rank 1st in 3rd down conversion rate (56.5%), &amp; they’ve scored on 91.2% of their red zone possessions (17th). Ranking 8th in net drive starting field possession, every drive starts off on the right foot. Mendoza has been the most consistent QB in football. He has not been sacked nor turned the ball over on first down through 14 games. Mendoza ranks top 5 in throws of 20+ yards &amp; leads the nation with a 13% explosion rate. Against passes of 20+ air yards, Oregon ranks 86th in EPA/play allowed &amp; 95th in completion percentage (39.3%), without a single INT of 20+ yards. Mendoza’s depth of target has increased over the last several weeks with the emergence of Charlie Becker. Before Week 11, Becker had 8 career targets. Since then Becker is the #2 PFF graded WR with 21 catches for 399 yards, &amp; 2 TDs. He has destroyed man coverage. Oregon runs man coverage at the 12th highest rate in the NCAA. Becker ranks 3rd in yards per route run (4.7) vs man. He has a contested catch rate of 83% (12th in NCAA). Since Becker’s breakout Indiana ranks 6th in yards per pass (11.2) &amp; 10th in success rate (52.6%) vs man, including 2 great defenses in Bama &amp; Ohio St who ran man on 59% of plays. Since the first matchup between these teams, Indiana has dropped back against man the 13th most times in the nation &amp; has allowed just a 31.7% pressure rate. Indiana relies heavily on quick dropbacks &amp; Mendoza’s ability to get the ball out quickly helps avoid pressure. Indiana uses quick dropbacks 47% of plays (20th most). When forced into traditional dropbacks Mendoza has been even more elite, averaging 12.1 yards per pass (2nd). Another factor will be Mendoza vs blitzes. Oregon ranks 31st in total blitzes &amp; has blitzed 27 times this playoffs. Last game vs Bama, Mendoza went 9/10 for 167 yards, 3 TDs, 0 INTs, &amp; 27 rushing yards vs the blitz. The pass success &amp; recent emergence of Becker has made the offense more vertical, which has opened up the run. Indiana ran on 71% of snaps vs Alabama. Oregon who has stopped opposing RB’s for zero/negative yards just 15% of plays (88th). This happened in the first game as 8 of Indiana’s 11 carries gained 3+ yards. Indiana has also been incredibly disciplined this year. They committed just 50 penalties this year (8th), with 11 on defense (1st). They’ve only lost 380 yards to penalties. They’re the only team left in the playoffs with a positive Total EPA via penalties (9.21). Oregon has 71 penalties giving up 703 yards. They rank last in Total EPA via penalties at -30.19 of the remaining teams.

Indiana is going to play steady efficient ball. But the difference will be in the redzone, where Indiana has shined &amp; Oregon has struggled.

GETAFE VS REAL SOCIEDAD

Date: 09 JANUARY 2026 at 21:00

BET ON: Over / Under- Over +1.50

Odd: 1.68



\- In their pre-match press conferences, both coaches revealed tactical insights that suggest an open game with goals likely on the horizon. Pellegrino Matarazzo, Real Sociedad&#x27;s new head coach, emphasized the need for aggressive ball recovery and a high pressing game, noting that his team has struggled with creativity in the final third this season. Following a positive performance in his debut against Atlético Madrid, Matarazzo&#x27;s setup with a 4-4-2 formation and vertical attacking play has shown signs of rejuvenating the team&#x27;s offense, particularly through Oyarzabal and Méndez linking up with Kubo and Guedes. The coach acknowledged that Sociedad&#x27;s games tend to open up after halftime, making it more likely to see goals in the latter stages. On the other hand, José Bordalás of Getafe is facing a defensive crisis, with key absentees like Djené, Duarte, and Abqar, leaving the team with no natural center-backs for the match. Bordalás, known for his disciplined defensive approach, has expressed concern over the lack of defensive solidity, admitting that his team might struggle to maintain their usual compact shape. With Getafe likely to sit deeper and look for counterattacks, Bordalás&#x27;s side will have limited ability to resist Sociedad&#x27;s intense attacking play. Given the injury-hit Getafe squad and Matarazzo&#x27;s pressing game, goals seem inevitable, especially as Getafe&#x27;s defense is weakened, and Sociedad will look to exploit the spaces left open. All signs point to a match that will likely see over 1.5 goals, with both teams adapting to their respective tactical needs but struggling to prevent goals.</td></tr>

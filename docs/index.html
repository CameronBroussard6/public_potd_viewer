<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: 🏀 UConn -13.5 (-110)

Game starts at 8pm EST. Bet 2.25U

Writeup: Fading the public and taking UConn to cover the spread against Texas. 

Texas holds a 66th position in all-play percentage and an offensive efficiency ranked 43rd, boasting a field goal percentage of 47.92%. In contrast, UConn excels defensively, ranking 10th overall in defensive metrics. The game is expected to be played at a slower tempo, with UConn preferring this pace.

Texas is expected to hit 27.6% from three, 38.2% from mid-range, and 40.2% overall, whereas UConn is projected to achieve 39.8% from three, 37.4% mid-range, and an impressive 49.8% overall.

When it comes to rebounding, UConn shows a significant advantage, dominating both offensive and defensive boards, while Texas has faced challenges limiting second-chance opportunities. UConn effectively limits turnovers and maintains a high field goal attempt rate.

In free throw opportunities, Texas ranks second nationally in attempt rate but struggles with a 72.02% conversion rate.

I like the UConn defense to show up in this one as they still need to prove to the committee why they belong with the top dogs in NCAAB. Their slower, more methodical pace should help them find points in the paint as well as beyond the arc, with the massive rebounding advantage being a huge part of getting more shots up. Give me UConn to win by 14 or more tonight.

Remember to only bet what you can afford to lose, and BOL!</td></tr>

Last Pick: UT Rio Grande Valley -2.5 ❌ 1.1 Units for 1 Unit

Event: Cal Baptist at Eastern Washington (NCAAB) (6pm Pacific)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Cal Baptist -3.5 (-110) 1.1 Unit to win 1 Unit

Write Up:

Tough one with the Vaqueros on Thursday as they had a lead for about 25 minutes before the wheels fell off.

Looking to bounce back on Friday with one more small slate before we attack Saturdays insanity. Cal Baptist started 7-0 overall with some quality wins at Oregon State and UC Irvine. Since the start of December they’ve been playing in some hostile environments in altitude at Colorado, BYU and Utah. They had every chance to win the game in Boulder and Salt Lake City, but ultimately ran out of gas late in the second half.

Eastern Washington is 1-7 overall against D1 competition with their one win coming at home last time out against a very crappy UMKC squad. Prior to that, they played every other game on the road. 

Usually I’d be on the home team in this spot, but I’m not a fan of Dan Monson’s Eastern Washington’s group this year. I also believe the five true road games along with an active three game losing streak for Cal Baptist will keep them laser focused for a full 40 minutes.

I wouldn’t be suprised if this game is tight in the first half, but I expect the Lancers to settle in and win this game by 8+ points on the road. 

BOL and enjoy the games</td></tr>

Yesterday’s Pick: (NHL) Dallas Stars ML vs Minnesota Wild (-142) ❌

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: (NBA) Chicago Bulls ML vs Charlotte Hornets (-152) (7:00 PM EST)**

Reasoning: The 9-14 Chicago Bulls take on the 7-17 Charlotte Hornets on the road tonight in a battle of mediocrity however I like the Bulls to come away with the victory. Reason being, we have strong H2H trends in this game. In the last 10 meetings between these two teams, the Bulls are 8-2 in those games. The Bulls are also 8-2 ATS in the last 10 vs Charlotte. To further the reasoning, line movement has also favored the Bulls. The line opened at -110 and currently sits at -152. To go along with the trends and line movement, the Hornets will be without their best player, LaMelo Ball tonight along with some other key players. Looking at the bet and money %, Charlotte is receiving 40% of the bets and 28% of the money, meaning Chicago is receiving majority of the money, which is what we want to see. So with H2H trends, line movement, money percentage, injuries all going in favor of Chicago, let’s play the Bulls on the moneyline tonight.

Event: Bundesliga, Union Berlin vs RB Leipzig ⚽️

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: Union Berlin ML +215, 1 Unit


Its a bit of a risky <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> but everyone seems to be on leipzig. Leipzig’s back line is top tier but their attacking front is young (all 20 y/o or younger) and this feels like a bit of a trap of RB Leipzig. Union lost 3-1 to wolfsburg while only allowing 3 shots on target so ill wager on that not to happen again. Their loss against heidenheim they allowed two 90th minute/extra time goals. They also almost beat Bayern but a Harry Kane 93rd minute equalizer left that a draw. Unions showed the potential to win as an underdog and I’ll take the home side to put it together in this fixture and secure the victory at home.

Also the Blues are 1-8 SU as a favorite of -130 or less this season. Blackhawks ML a secondary play for those inclined (not counting on POTD record) just a tip</td></tr>

Last Pick: Kevin Durant o19.5 pt v LAC, Toumani Camara o1.5 3 pointers made v NOP, -154 on DK at time of writeup, betting 2.5u ❌

What a weird game from KD. 3 points in Q1, 0 in Q2, 13 in Q3, 0 in Q4. I didn&#x27;t watch this game so not sure exactly what was going on, but him having 2 scoreless quarters in a close game is very odd. Camara hit 2 3s early.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Josh Giddey o6.5 reb v CHA, Michael Porter Jr o19.5 pt v DAL, -135 on DK at time of writeup, betting 2u

Josh Giddey only had 3 rebounds last game in a blowout loss to GSW, but in a winnable game against CHA, the model likes him (again, we had Giddey a few picks ago) to bounce back to his typical rebounding performance. CHI is a team facing a lot of injuries, Ayo and Kevin Huerter are out, and Tre Jones, Coby White, Zach Collins, Jalen Smith, and Isaac Okoro are all probable. Assuming these probable guys play, they&#x27;re not going to be at 100%, which could create more rebounding opportunities for Giddey. This MPJ line seems like a trap if I&#x27;m being honest, but I can&#x27;t quite crack it. Cam Thomas is still out. MPJ has dropped 20+ in 12 of L13. His last games have been 35, 33, and 35 point outings. Yes, DAL is an opponent that typically plays in low scoring games. Yes, BKN is on the road and 8.5 point underdogs. But, we&#x27;re taking such a low number for the clear top scorer on this BKN team. Trusting my model&#x27;s second top play of the day. Standard 2u play for this parlay, let&#x27;s get back in the win column. BOL to all tailing</td></tr>

Sport | NHL Chicago Blackhawks vs saint Louis Blues

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Over 5.5 (-130)

Write Up: the last couple games for both these teams have been very high scoring. The blues are coming off one day of rest in which they got smoked 7-2. They have been leaking goals giving up more than three goals the last 3 games. On the other side the blackhawks are no better aside from their last game they gave up 7 and 6 goals before that.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: UMBC -6.5 (-105) (2u)

Write Up:
This <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> targets a significant mismatch in offensive efficiency and home/road splits. The core of this handicap is Army&#x27;s extreme reliance on the three-point shot; they attempt threes at one of the highest rates in the country but are converting just ~32% of them. 

Conversely, UMBC is shooting 47.4% from the field effectively and has posted a strong 4-1 record at home. The Retrievers have the perimeter defense to contest Army&#x27;s primary weapon, and Army&#x27;s defense (allowing ~78 PPG) lacks the interior resistance to stop UMBC’s more balanced attack. I expect UMBC to control the pace and pull away in the second half for a double-digit victory.

Rudy Gobert Over 9.5 Boards. $2.05

Rudy Gobert in the regular season has hit this line in 18 out of 19 games with the one game with him ending up on 9 boards. Furthermore Draymon Green is out, so that&#x27;s another big body that will not be on the floor. Now the issue here is Post is likely to be the replacement center, who is a stretch big who will likely pull gobert out from the ring, and GSW shoots a lot of threes meaning Gobert may not get to many boards rather than Randle. However, when GSW plays a rebounder that is top 10 in rebound chances they have gone over their line. Rudy gobert is ranked 6th in rebound chances at 19 potential rebounds a game. Currently GSW is also ranked 25th out of 30 in rebounds to centers per game. I expect gobert to crash the boards as well, as if he does not then I have no doubt chris flinch will bench Gobert instantly to have naz reid to go small ball. GSW is 27th out of 30th allowing opponents for Offensive rebounds and gobert is ranked 11th when crashing the boards. I think truthfully this bet may not hit as in the Playoffs Gobert has gone under this line, with his team mates varying with McDaniels getting 13 boards or Ant/Randle getting the boards. But at $2.05 i think there is a lot of value.</td></tr>

DARTS POTD RECORD **75-40** | Overall 75-42 | All <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> bets between 1U-2U

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: **Ian** **White ML** vs Mervyn King **@ 1.90** \[bet365\] / 1.5U

Well well well, if it ain&#x27;t that time of the year. Christmas is coming and that means one thing: the pinnacle of Darts, every night. Opening night was quite boring to be real, I didn&#x27;t manage to get a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> out in time but I&#x27;m looking to get this shit rolling tonight. 

Not a whole lot I like on tonight&#x27;s card but I am more than happy to back Ian White vs ole&#x27; Merv King who I genuinely can&#x27;t believe is here. Not because he&#x27;s playing badly but because he&#x27;s been in the darting wilderness last few years. I will say its great to have him back. One of the most hilarious characters in Darts lol. 

I wouldn&#x27;t say either of these guys have played particularly great this year at all but I do think White has the slight edge in this one and 1.90 is decent value. I know Ned has made his yearly appearance and is backing King so I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if he&#x27;s actually moved the line a fair bit, and fwiw I wouldn&#x27;t have taken this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> at the earlier price of \~1.66.

White edges almost all metrics that I&#x27;m interested in. White in his prime was notorious for destroying the trebles but not finishing well, and whilst the second part is still true he actually has an ever so slight edge in checkout % compared to Merv. His 3 and 6 month rolling averages are higher and one of my favourite stats is avg with throw of which he has an edge 91.4 vs 87.6. Power scores per leg White leads (0.24 v 0.2) and actually despite his poor form he is winning a higher % of deciding legs than Merv (43 vs 38). One factor that is hard to quantify is how Mervyn King will react to being away from the big stage for 3 years. His performance could go either way I think.

Honestly I don&#x27;t imagine many (if any) will be tailing me tonight given Ned&#x27;s on the opponent but still thought I&#x27;d put my 2c out there. And please no bullshit comments after regardless of who wins. I only post here for a bit of fun. Ta</td></tr>

I really don&#x27;t understand why Leipzig is plus money here. 

I&#x27;m not saying they will win surely, but I feel like this is a spot that is just too hard to pass up. Union Berlin hasn&#x27;t won a Bundesliga game at home since october; while Leipzig hasn&#x27;t been great away from home, at least they have looked better. They have scored 6 goals in a match twice since halloween, and overall just score a lot of goals. I&#x27;d say this is a fairly inconsistent team but I feel like they should have the upside versus a weak Berlin team. 

BOL, tail responsibly.

Monaco is one of the best offensive teams in EL across all categories, ranking in the top 3 in points, total attempts for 2 and 3 points, and %.

Fenerbahce has the best defense in EL, despite problems on the other end; their defense has led to 10 consecutive wins across all competitions. I like the given limit of 168 points; it is very manageable for the team that just broke the EL record with 125 points in one game. That game was with crazy 60% for 3, so hard to beat, but all that is needed here is 85 points from each team.

Fenerbahce had a canceled game last round with Olympiakos, unfortunately for them, since they are in good form, and Olympiakos is not.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Rounds handicap (overall) = MOUZ -6.5 vs FaZe Clan @ 1.85 - 5 units


Write Up: Sharing my CS2 picks here as my predictions have been 80% spot on.

The quality between MOUZ and FaZe is massive, to say the least. MOUZ are better tactically as a team and they have a better AWPER. For the uninitiated, the AWP is the most powerful gun in the game, usually held by a team&#x27;s best player. FaZe&#x27;s AWPER, broky, has been struggling a lot recently. He is the weakest link in this FaZe team, and many consider him to be the only one holding them back from reaching greater heights - which is true. Although broky performed well against Passion UA, no offense but Passion UA is a terrible team with an equally terrible AWPER. Against a tactically sound team like MOUZ with an arguably Top 5 AWPER in torzsi, FaZe doesn&#x27;t stand a chance. And FaZe is known for playing chaotic CS. They won&#x27;t stand a chance against MOUZ and I can see MOUZ covering this rounds handicap.

Although they beat Vitality in Round 1 of Stage 3, FaZe got wrecked by Team Spirit and Mongolz. They only got to the playoffs by beating weak and unstable teams like 3DMAX and Passion UA. And even though Passion UA is a bad team, they still managed to put up a fight against FaZe.

Meanwhile, MOUZ got to the playoffs by beating PARAVISION, B8 and Falcons in convincing fashion. They lost to Spirit 2-1, but it was evenly matched compared to the beating that FaZe got from the same team.</td></tr>

Last pick: Oklahoma City Thunder ML +  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander Over 29.5 Points(-120HR)❌ 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the day</mark> :Pascal Siakam OVER 31.5 Points + Rebounds (-105 Fanatics)

Reason •  
Siakam has been by far my favorite wagon this season and we go right back to him here in a great matchup versus the Sixers.

Coming off a bad game I love backing Siakam here for a great bounce back spot in a game he gets a perfect matchup.

Siakam has stepped up big for the Pacers after the team dealt with many injuries to star players seeing great usage this season averaging 31.5 PR a game on 11.6 rebound chances and 18.6 FGA per game.

Siakam gets a matchup versus the Sixers that gives him a favorable matchup to rack up points and rebounds here, let me break it down 👇

Siakam scores a majority 18% of his points from transition where the Sixers allow the 6th most PPG against, and another majority comes from the free throw line where the Sixers allow the 13 most FTA per game.

When looking at scoring zones Siakam gets a majority of his points from the RA where he records 31% of his points from, and the Sixers have been getting killed down low allowing the 4th most PPG in the RA, and when looking at shot type Siakam also gets a great matchup, he shoots 50% of his shots from &lt;10 feet where the Sixers allow the 7th most shots per game.

When looking at the rebounding matchup Siakam also gets an amazing matchup here 👇

We saw Siakam kill the glass against the Sixers last season averaging 7 rebounds per game against them on 15.7 rebound chances per game and I expect that to continue here as he now plays an even bigger role for this team than he did last season.

When seeing 13+ rebound chances Siakam has cleared this line in all 8/8 games this season averaging 39.1 PR per game.

The Sixers allow the 3rd most rebounds per game to PFs(11.53) 

Siakam has killed this line against weak rebounding defenses clearing this line in 9/11 games this season versus teams that rank 16th or below in rebounds allowed averaging 34 PR per game.

Siakam has been automatic this season when he gets the matchup, clearing this line in 8/10 games against teams that rank 15th or worse against transition and he’s over in 5/6 against teams bottom 15 rebounding and transition defenses avergaing 34.3 PR per game.</td></tr>

Soccer | Keuken Kampioen Divisie 🇳🇱 | TOP Oss vs. ADO Den Haag
Date: 12 December | Kickoff: 20:00 (Amsterdam time)
<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: ADO Den Haag Over 2.5 Team Goals +100 | 2 units

Write Up:

Unlucky on the last pick as the game finished with 3 total goals, just one short. The read was right, but that’s part of betting. We move on.

For this one I’m backing ADO Den Haag away at TOP Oss. ADO sit top of the league and continue to look like the strongest team in the Keuken Kampioen Divisie. Over their last five matches they average 2.4 goals scored, and their attacking output has been consistent home and away.

TOP Oss are a bottom-tier side. While they’ve managed to keep some recent games close, the quality gap here is still significant. Against top teams in the league, Oss tend to struggle to hold their shape and concede chances once the pressure builds.

The head-to-head strongly supports this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. For some reason, the last three games played at TOP Oss have all seen ADO score over 2.5 goals, and that was when ADO were still a mid-table or playoff-contending side. This season they are clearly a level above, leading the league from the start and playing with far more confidence and consistency.

Add in the fact that ADO have won the last six meetings overall, including the most recent 5-1 win, and this matchup continues to favor them heavily.

Even away from home, with promotion firmly in sight, I expect ADO to dominate possession, create volume chances, and score at least three goals again.

ADO Den Haag Over 2.5 Team Goals at +100 for 2 units. Let’s get back to winning ways.</td></tr>

Last Pick: Razma -1.5 v Van den Herik

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: Smith -1.5 v Harrysson 

Sport: World Championship Darts

Reasoning: Smith is a far stronger scorer with a massive ranking gap, so over a short best-of-5 he’s likely to control legs early and build a multi-set lead. Harrysson’s lower 12-month averages make it hard for him to win enough legs consistently to force a 3–2, which pushes the match toward 3–0 or 3–1 outcomes, and although Harrysson can take advantage if Smith briefly switches off, Smith’s overall consistency and quality should carry the handicap.

This rebounds line is too high. He has not recorded more than 7 rebounds in ANY game this season. He still seems to be frustrated and is a shell of his former self. His rebounds are reduced, he’s hurt, and the Sixers are being cautious with his use.

Writeup:

* Short writeup from me, bit unfortunate last night, caught two error lines that were later corrected and traded down by 2 deaths each, but we got two long games and losses which led to them going over anyway then going well under each of their next two maps each.
* HLE come into this game as over -600 favorites, last night they were -110, so this game should be significantly easier for them
* Kanavi is averaging 5.9 kills so far at Kespa Cup, he has a **7/7 cover rate** **on this line so far** and is averaging 6.16 kills per map win
* Kanavi is one of the highest kill share junglers in the entire world, he almost always plays carries and takes a high % of kills relative to others at the role, he is one of the most elite carry junglers there is and he has looked great on HLE so far, very low risk of tanks especially this early in the series
* Looking back at his previous map wins at more serious tournaments, 6/7 hitrate on this line at worlds, 11/13 hitrate in LPL playoffs
* As mentioned yesterday, this tournament has a higher pace of play, more kills higher tempo good for overs
* Books currently have kill total set to 36.5 with DKia \~22.5 kills, that would mean if these are accurate, Kanavi needs just \~17% kill share to hit this line, significantly lower then his normal number

Write up: 

Jalen Johnson has been a real solid and consistent player as of late and has to go up against a solid defense of the Detroit Pistons. Despite this, 42.5 is a seriously underplaced line at 42.5 with Jalen Johnson having at least 49 pra or more in the last 5 games. This includes an away game at Detroit where he had 49 pra despite coming off a double OT game from the previous night and on the road. With Trae Young still out, it leaves the main ballhandling opportunities in the hand of NAW, Dyson Daniels, and JJ and it seems that JJ has been taking more and more on this role as of late. Kristaps Prozingis has also been ruled out for this game leaving most of the defensive rebounding opportunities open for Jalen Johnson. Have played this line as a straight the last 4 games and I’m sure he’ll keep this hot streak up, BOL. </td></tr>

**2u**

write up: 

The Call of Duty league is back, and I think this season, in particular, so far, has been easier to predict than previous years. I am hoping for some beginner&#x27;s luck, but I don&#x27;t think I will need it with this one. 

This line is the result of the new COD being released in the last month, team changes happening, new game mechanics, etc.

We have already seen some action this season, so I could give some data to make my picks, but the reality is, if you have ever heard of the game mode search &amp; destroy, that is what map 2 is in the CDL game mode wise. 

In the one search and destroy Boston has played this year, they lost it to the Carolina Royal Ravens, who are not a very good team at the moment, 6-5. In the three SNDs G2 has played this year, they have won two and lost to the reigning world champs 6-4 in an extremely close game.

On top of that, G2 has the second-highest Search &amp; destroy Kill death ratio in the league and historically, have very good SND specialists like Estreal, Kremp had a 1.11 KD last season, Skyz(former world champion) and a really talented rookie in Mamba. While Boston has Snoopy who was a top 5 SND player, the rest of the team around him is incredibly mid at SND, Cammy and Nastie were ranked 40 and 41 out of 70 in KD last season, and Purj was ranked 59th. Compared to g2: Mamba(6th in a small sample size), Kremp(13th last season, 1st this year) Estreal(33rd), Skyz(56th). 

  
I am going to say don&#x27;t max bet this one. I would be comfortable around two-three units because it is still a brand new season, and things can get flukey, though this season is easier to predict because the game has a movement skill gap.

  
Lol I hope this made sense, not always easy writing about cod cause most people have no clue what I am talking about.</td></tr>

**Write Up:** Malen had a duck of a game. Couldn&#x27;t control the ball whenever it made it to him. Fluke bad game or bad read on my part, either way we move on. 

Not a ton of games <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, but I do like this bottom table La Liga matchup. Oyarzabal has been on a year lately, scoring or assisting in 4/4 last La Liga games. He is really the best player on Real Sociedad, takes penalties, and has played all 90 minutes for the last 10/10 matches. Sociedad is not in any sort of European competition this year and the team has been in good form, so I suspect we will see a heavy dose of Oyarzabal. 

Girona have been very poor this season. They have not held a clean sheet in an away match all season and have kept only 2 clean sheets all year, both at home. Fresh off a 3-0 loss away at Elche, I expect Girona to struggle here again. 

I thought about taking ATGS straight here, but Oyarzabal has 2 assists in his last 3 matches and I like the odds at even money here to buy it down and give us both options to cash.

Previous: 

Madars Razma (-161) v Jamai van den Herik ✅ 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Mervyn King (+120) v Ian White

Razma takes care of business for us on Day 1, winning 3-1, but with all but one set going down to that pivotal 5th leg. Even with a less-than-stellar performance, Madars turned it on down the stretch and advances to the next round. 

Here on Day 2 I am dead set on playing a slight underdog - really like the current world #125 Mervyn “The King” King to defeat current world #51 Ian “Diamond” White.

Do not be fooled by the current world ranking disparity here - King has a plethora of experience at the highest levels of darts, albeit some time ago. King reached the World Championship SF &amp; was Premier League runner up in 2009. More recently, King had his best PDC ranked finish at the 2021 Masters, a darts major, ultimately losing 8-11 in the Finals to Jonny Clayton. 

Since 2021, King took a bit of a hiatus from darts, though he has returned and been grinding hard on the Modus &amp; PDC Tours this year. 

King disclosed this year that a large factor in his hiatus was due to filing bankruptcy, as he owed $500k in unpaid taxes, admitting to reporters he was unaware he needed to pay taxes on his winnings. 

Ian White has been a consistent player on the PDC since 2010, but he has zero televised titles and has not won on the PDC Tour since 2020. White also historically has been solid at scoring, particularly hammering that triple-20, but his finishing has long been his biggest weakness. 

One other point worth noting on the Diamond is that- White has not won a single match on the PDC since October 14 of this year, finishing the tour season with four consecutive first round exits. 

Lastly, since 2021 these two have met three times in ranked matches. In those matches, King is 3-0, winning each 6-0; 6-3; 6-3 respectively. 

I expect more of the same from White in this one, struggling on the outer ring and letting King hang around. Expect King to keep pace on scoring, while punishing White for his finishing mistakes. I believe King still has tremendous talent, and entering with a bit of a chip on his shoulder, will prove it to the darts world <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.


————Edit- Loss ❌——————

King goes down 2-3 in a pretty gross match all around. The King missed seemingly countless opportunities, especially in the pivotal moments, especially in an extremely disappointing fifth set. 27 missed darts at double is inexcusable. 

Tough board tomorrow, with only one match even qualifying for the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>. Will look to bounce back in the days to come.</td></tr>

Kalinina appears in this tournament after a long break, and she impressed me quite a lot when she faced Kartal, showing solid groundstrokes from both sides and a gigantic clutch ability when it came to saving break points. While it&#x27;s true that Kartal had the chance to dominate the first set, it was clear that Kalinina stepped up after breaking back, and her typical &quot;warrior&quot; mentality ended up being the main difference. She&#x27;s not the most flashy player you&#x27;ll see, but she plays simple and efficient tennis. 

When it comes to Parks, I was expecting much more from her in Angers, but she had an awful match against Korpatsch, where she lost on her own with unforced errors and a low first serve percentage. While I recognize that Parks can play well on this surface when her serve is on fire, things quickly change when that particular weapon is not on point. I feel like any player who&#x27;s a decent returner can really punish Parks on the second serve and just keep the point alive until she makes an unforced error. 

Kalinina is known for always trying to stay on each rally and produce sharp angles, especially from the forehand. This playstyle is usually a good recipe to beat someone like Parks, who is currently 0-3 against Kalinina, with each loss happening on a different surface (Hard, Clay, and Grass). The American was never able to take a set from Kalinina.

With the momentum and the confidence of beating someone like Kartal just in the 2nd match since her return, I feel like Kalinina will find a much easier path to victory against Parks.

Explanation: Leipzig is coming in near top of the standings come with 9 wins, 2 draws, 2 losses and a +15 goal difference (28 scored, 13 conceded) through 13 games, while Union is not doing too well in 12th place, with just 4 wins, 3 draws, 6 losses and a negative goal difference. Also Berlin is in bad form losing there last 3 while Leipzig has won 3 of there last 4 with a draw as there non win.

Leipzig is generating about 1.77 expected goals for (xG) per game and allowing only 1.39 xG against, so they consistently create more and better chances than they concede, whereas Union are around 1.3 xG for and 1.5 xG against. 

Also, Leipzig is averaging roughly 16–17 shots per match compared to Union’s 12, which matters because over 90 minutes that shooting volume plus higher xG per shot tends to translate into at least one or two “big” chances created, which is crucial to score the goals necessary to win. 

Leipzig’s high-tempo, vertical attacking style,  pressing and pace in transition are exactly the recipe for them to win this match.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Niels Zonneveld -1.5 (-130), 2u to win 1.5u

Write Up: Puha has not looked good recently, losing his last 6 matches all by a good chunk. Zonneveld is coming off a loss to Nick Kenny in the players championship finals, however he averaged a 92.41 in that match and had 19 100+ throws in 10 legs. Zonneveld was just unable to hit his doubles, which I think will be corrected coming into the World Championship. Zonneveld and Puha have gone H2H twice this year, 6-1 Zonneveld and 5-6 Puha. However I feel Puha’s downtrend and Zonneveld’s consistency could allow Zonneveld to even take this match in straight sets.</td></tr>

It assigns ELO ratings to players and projects a win chance based on the combined ELO ratings of the players on each team. TeamReddit is projecting a 62% win chance here which creates value here on the ML.</td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>

**Last Pick:** (Bills vs Texans Week 12) Woody Marks 15+ Receiving yards (+126 on DK) 1u to win 1.26 U ❌

Been on a small hiatus celebrating the holidays and whatnot but we&#x27;re back

**Todays Event**: 🏈 NFL Monday Night Football Giants @ Patriots 7:15 PM CST🏈

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Todays pick</mark>**: Drake Maye 270+ Pass + Rush Yards (-128 on DK) 1u to win 0.78u

**Writeup:** The Giants are on the road to face the current second seed Patriots in what everyone expects will be a blowout. Patriots have been playing solid and Maye has been looking like a stud. Jaxon Dart is back in after missing two weeks taking back the QB spot from Jameis Winston, goodbye fun football.  The Patriots will be looking for an easy win to hit that 1 spot in the afc for the time being.

As I said Earlier, Drake Maye has been looking like a stud. He&#x27;s been averaging 260.8 passing yards and 25.6 rushing. Averaging 21 completions on 29,6 passing attempts with \~12.4 yards per completion

Patriots face the ranked 30th defense giants. Giants have been giving up an average of 25.1 rushing per game and 243ish passing yards. At home, Maye is sure to go above these numbers.

Now there is a chance that Treveyon Henderson gets some extra yardage as he&#x27;s been popping off these last few weeks, keeping Maye&#x27;s numbers in checks but I think there&#x27;s more to it. Patriots defense have been allowing 18.8 points per game and isn&#x27;t the best in terms of coverage, and their run defense is still solid but slowed down this past month. I could see this game being within one score for majority of the game.

Overall I think this game will be tight with Jaxon Dart giving the Patriots a surprise. Maye will have to put in some effort but they&#x27;ll clinch the 1 spot this week and Maye will clear this number.

What an emotional roller coaster with that last pick as Laf does jack shit in the 1st period, then rips a shot 10 seconds into the 2nd. On his very next shift, he has a backhand that hits the post and then gets another shot that I swore live was on net but at the time was ruled to have been blocked by his own guy.  Watched him dick around the rest of the game, as he is apt to do, and get looked off multiple times in OT and wondering why that 2nd period shot wasn&#x27;t counted.  Then a couple days later, get paid out for that because NHL stats looked at it and realized it was indeed a shot on goal.  Gambling is insane.

After a couple weeks off spent doing family stuff for Thanksgiving and partying in Miami, I&#x27;m back for tonight with one of my favorite standard plays: Ducks TT over.  For the life of me I cannot figure out why this is so damn low as the Blues are for my money one of the worst teams in the league. Yes, they are coming off a shutout of the Mammoth in their last game but before that they had given up 3 or more to opponents in 7 of their past 8 games.  I actually can&#x27;t believe the Ducks are underdogs and am sprinkling liberally on their ML and various props, but the over 2.5 goals seems the safest to me.

Event: Giants @ Patriots 6:15MST

Write Up: Patriots are going into this game without their star tackle Will Campbell. Going into this game New England has the 6th worst sack rate in the NFL with 9.4% and 7th in sacks allowed with 37.

Brian Burns is second in the league this year with 13 sacks and has sacked the QB in 9/12 games this season. Overall the giants pressure rate has been below average but Burns has been a shining star in this lack luster defense. 

Although the Giants have basically the worst run defense in the NFL, New England hasn&#x27;t necessarily been very effective in imposing a quality running game. I predict this game to be a fairly close contest without Will Campbell on the O-Line. The Patriots will be required to utilize their passing game to come out on top, giving Brian Burns more opportunities to take the quarter back down.

Write Up: Alright lads, here’s one I’m jumping on. Birmingham come into this one absolutely flying at home. Three straight wins at St. Andrew’s, four goals bagged in each, and most importantly for us they’ve hit the net in the first half every single time. They’re starting fast, they’re pressing high, and they’re not waiting around to get on the scoresheet. 

Now look at the visitors: Watford have been shaky on the road. They’ve conceded at least one first-half goal in four of their last five away matches, and they just haven’t shown they can tighten things up early. 

Put those trends together and it’s hard not to fancy Birmingham to find one before halftime again.

Yesterday’s Villa play ended in a push — close, but we move on.

For <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>’s POD, I’m rolling with a spread I really like. Detroit is in a strong spot, and the scheduling advantage should be strong.

**Play of the Day**  
NBA | Detroit Pistons vs. Atlanta Hawks  
**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Pistons -9.5 @ 1.94 (-106) | 1 Unit**

The Pistons are playing really well right now. That win over Miami was a big one — cutting their two game losing streak. They had back-to-back losses before that Heat win (on the road at Boston and then at home vs. Orlando), so I like the idea of them coming out strong in front of their fans tonight, trying to reset things on their home floor.

Atlanta is simply in a brutal spot. They’re coming off a double-overtime game where their starters logged huge minutes, and now they have to travel. Even though the Hawks have been playing well and might want payback after losing 112-120 to Detroit earlier, this is the exact kind of scheduling spot where tired legs show up — especially late in games.

Detroit, meanwhile, is fresh and getting healthier, with Jalen Duren listed as probable and the Pistons rested, motivated at home, and catching a Hawks team that just emptied the tank last night, I think Detroit should be able to pull away as the game goes on.

I’m laying the points with the Pistons. The momentum, the rest advantage, and the spot should be enough for them to have a double digits win.

Sorry about this loss. The game script didn&#x27;t go as predicted. They played at a slow pace, had narrow defending, no chase, an early red card, and a shorter time interval between goals. I&#x27;ll take corners next time when there is more on the line. We move on.

First of all, I like this kind of match-up. Pistons are on top of the Eastern Conference right now, and Hawks are competing against their conference top rival and would love to win them. Both teams will have to make use of their star players. So, rest assured, Cade Cunningham is gonna have high usage and full minutes. 

As Detroit&#x27;s lead guard and main creator/scorer, Cade will have heavy touches and will lean on him to set the tempo and offense. Detroit also has one of the top 5 FG% in the league right now in their last 10 games (They are scoring with more than 50% -&gt; good for assist).   
  
Cade&#x27;s home split with 30+ min, this has hit 5/6 times.  
Cade vs Dyson Daniels: 6/6 hit rate.

NBA | Hornets vs Nets | 🏀  

Paced first quarter with 4 and continued to set up his teammates that kept bricking, finishes at 8 assists after a very strong start. Hope some of yall tailed the picks in the props channel. We move

Nets have been a funnel for players who do their work in the RA where they’ve allowed 4th most points this season, perfect for the Hornets center who scores 90% of his buckets from that area. Has smashed this line this season, with 16+ minutes he’s over in 10/L10 games avg 10.3 PA with a 82% hit rate over the course of the season with the same filters avg 9.9 PA. This includes a game against the Nets where he had 11 PA with 4 potentials in 26 minutes.

On the road he’s over in 6/6 games with 23+ minutes, something he’s seen in every road game except once which was a big blowout win against the Wizards. Expecting close to his season avg in minutes here which should be 25+. With 25+ min he’s over in 11/12 games this season avg 11.1 PA.

Great spot for Kalkbrenner here to continue his streak, would run 6.5 points alone if 6.5 PA isn’t available as the read is ultimately for him to score against a good matchup.

**🏀 Evan Mobley Double-Double -130** vs the Indiana Pacers

Mostly a rebounds play, double-double for some extra juice. 

Pacers absolutely bleed rebounds to PFs and Cs as a bottom tier rebounding team. Mobley specifically dominates this matchup. He&#x27;s cashed in L5/6 vs the Pacers, recording 12+ rebounds 4 times.

Recently, Mobley has cashed in L4/5 averaging 11 rebounds a game in that time span over a very solid 34.6 minutes / game.

Jarrett Allen out is huge, with no other viable C or PF on the roster, expect rebounds to filter down to Mobley.

Rest splits add a benefit as well. Over all rest days, on back-to-backs, Mobley averages more rebounds than other days of rest.

Some blowout risk but Pacers have been playing decently well, and at home, I expect Mobley to cash.

Last POTD: Dalton Shultz Over 41.5 Receiving Yards ✅

Event: New York Giants Vs. New England Patriots 8:15 PM EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Tyrone Tracy Jr. Over 2.5 Receptions

Odds: -115

Write Up:

Role &amp; usage:
Tyrone Tracy isn’t just a random RB2:
On the season he has 103 carries for 398 rushing yards and 21 receptions for 206 receiving yards – about 20.6 receiving yards per game.
ESPN’s outlook notes that when he’s the lead guy, he plays around 67% of the snaps with roughly 13.2 carries and 3.5 targets per game, which is solid passing-game usage for a RB.
Since returning from his recent injury, he’s had at least 3 receptions and at least 4 targets in 3 of his past 4 games.
So 2.5 receptions is below his realistic involvement when the Giants are in “normal” and trailing game scripts.
On top of that, team beat coverage highlighted that in the recent loss to Green Bay, Tracy had 4 receptions as part of 88 all-purpose yards, and the coaching staff has talked about his versatility and importance to the offense.

Matchup: Patriots force RB targets
This is the big one.
The Patriots defense this year:
Is one of the best overall units in the league – allowing just 18.8 points per game and ranking top 10 in both yards allowed and scoring defense.
Has not allowed majority of RB’s to rush for more than 50 yards in a game all season.
So running straight at them is a bad plan. Teams adjust by throwing to their backs:
New England has allowed the second-most receptions to running backs in 2025: 65 catches heading into this week.
CBS’ positional stats have RB vs Patriots averaging 6.58 targets and 5.42 receptions per game for 34.2 receiving yards, which ranks them as the #1 easiest matchup for RB receiving production.
So structurally, this is a defense that:
Shuts down rushing efficiency,
Plays solid coverage downfield,
But willingly gives up underneath throws and checkdowns to backs.
That’s exactly the profile you want when you’re betting a RB receptions over.

Giants’ situation &amp; game script:
The Giants are in full “we’re outgunned” mode:
They come in 2–10, scoring 22.0 PPG but allowing 27.8 PPG, with a bottom-tier defense by yards and points.
The Patriots are 10–2, scoring 26.5 PPG and allowing just 18.8 PPG.
The line: Patriots -7.5, total 46.5, with NE about -410 ML and NYG +320.
Everything points to New England playing from ahead at home:
Covers’ preview leans Patriots early and often, even making their best bet Patriots -4 1H, expecting NE to jump out in the first half.
VSiN also notes that New England is undefeated straight-up as a mid-range favorite and consistently handles weaker teams.
For Tracy, that’s gold:
If the Giants are behind, Jaxson Dart (their mobile QB) will be forced to operate in pass-first, shotgun-heavy sets.
Against a front that stonewalls traditional runs and brings pressure, the natural counter is quick checkdowns and designed RB routes – dump-offs, angle routes, screens.
You don’t need the Giants offense to be good; you just need them to be behind and trying, which is exactly what this spread implies.

“Who guards who” &amp; how the Pats defend it:
The Patriots’ coverage philosophy under Vrabel/McDaniels this year has been:
Take away your primary explosives (WR1/WR verticals, big tight-end seams)
Make you play patient, underneath football
Rally and tackle with disciplined LBs and safeties
That shows up in:
Very strong overall defensive efficiency and points allowed, but
A ton of RB receptions allowed (second-most in the league).
So you’re not betting Tracy to win 1-on-1 vs a shutdown corner; you’re betting him to be the safety valve against zone looks and pressure, drifting into the flat or settling over the middle for easy 3–7 yard catches. That’s a role, not a matchup you can “take away” with one DB.

Pace &amp; play volume:
Both teams play at fairly normal NFL tempos; this isn’t a clock-killing slugfest like 38 carries per side.
With New England’s offense humming (top-10 in yards and points) and the Giants’ defense among the worst in the league, we can reasonably expect New York to face a lot of drives and pass plenty in the second half.
More drives + more dropbacks = more chances for Tracy to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> up cheap receptions, even on 2nd-and-long or 3rd-and-medium when Dart checks it down.

Weather:
Foxborough tonight is classic late-season New England: cold but not extreme, mostly dry, no crazy snowstorm scenario.
Cold weather can push teams slightly more toward the short passing game and runs – again, helpful for RB reception props, and not a major concern for catching 3 dump-offs.

What could go wrong?
Always important to be real about the ways this can lose:
Game script flips: If the Giants somehow jump out early and they are the ones protecting a lead, you’d see more traditional runs and fewer checkdowns.
Usage fluke: If Devin Singletary or another back unexpectedly takes most of the passing-down work, Tracy’s routes and targets could dip.
Ultra-low volume game: If New England absolutely smothers the Giants and NYG has like 40 total plays with Dart imploding, even good roles can come up short.
Injury: Any in-game injury to Tracy obviously kills the prop.
But given his recent usage (3+ catches in 3 of last 4), the Pats’ defensive profile vs RBs (second-most RB receptions allowed), and the likely trailing script for a 2–10 Giants team, those feel like risks, not the base case.</td></tr>

- AD has quietly become a steady playmaker over the past two seasons. He cleared this line in 63% of his games last year and is off to a strong start again, going over in 4 of 5 while averaging 3.2 APG on 6 potential assists. He draws a great matchup against the Nuggets, who have struggled to contain PF playmaking. Over their last seven games, Denver ranks 26th in assists allowed to PFs (5.5 APG) with a 77% hit rate on the season for the position.

- Recent PFs to beat this line vs. Denver include Harrison Barnes (5), Jaren Jackson Jr. (4), Zion (5), and Julius Randle (8).

- AD consistently creates easy looks because of the defensive attention he commands. Opening up cuts to the rim and corner threes, two areas where Denver has been vulnerable lately, ranking bottom-10 in points allowed at both spots over the last five games.</td></tr>

He has hit this in 5/5 🎯 of his last games and I think the line is super low. Maye loves the passing game and it always seems like Pop makes the big plays.

His recieving yards are also at great value.

I did a large straight bet and combined it with others.

(I also like Hooper over on receiving yards. He came out strong after coming back from concussion protocol. Sprinkled a little with a Dart rushing td since he has a streak going)

Write Up: This game is very intriguing to me. It’s a
complete contrast of the tempos. Iona ranks 18th in adjusted tempo compared to a Delaware team that ranks 258th in the country. I also like the average offensive possession length differential between the two. Iona ranks 52nd and Delaware ranks 356th in the country. Iona likes to run, Delaware likes to slow it down. Iona won’t be slowed down. Delaware will be playing catch up all game long and have to cave to Iona’s style of play. 

Iona scores 85ppg
Delaware only scores 69ppg
Iona averages 8 more shot attempts a game than Delaware.
Iona averages 5 more made free throws a games and 5 more rebounds a game than Delaware. These are all more scoring opportunities in Iona’s favor. 

Iona (5-2) has beaten a lot of good teams including Hofstra, Fordham, Princeton, and Oregon State. With losses to a stout Akron team and a gritty Green Bay squad. Iona = battle tested. 

Delaware on the other end comes into this matchup 2-4 on the year including a loss to a non D1 opponent. Their best win is vs a 1-7 UNC Greensboro team and that was their last game. Delaware = not battle tested. 

This spread of -1.5 doesn’t make much sense to me. I have this game handicapped at Iona -5.5. 

I simply don’t think Delaware has the offensive fire power to keep up with Iona. 

My prediction for the game is Iona 82 Delaware 73

__POTD:__ TreVeyon Henderson o63.5 rushing yards (-115), 3.45u to win 3u

__Write Up:__ Great matchup this week for the (10-2) New England Patriots as they are at home facing the (2-10) New York Giants. Patriots Rookie RB TreVeyon Henderson has broken out this season &amp; has been on a tear lately. This week he gets a juicy matchup vs a horrible Giants run defense that allows 157.2 rushing yards per game, LAST in the NFL. The Giants are allowing a LEAGUE HIGH 6.2 yards per carry to opposing running backs. They are also allowing a league high 2.23 yards before contact per run.They have given up the most explosive runs this season allowing a 15+ yard run on 9.6% of runs &amp; have given up the most 20+ yard runs in the NFL (15) and 40+ (6). The Giants are last in defensive EPA against the run (-50.5). Last week Jahmyr Gibbs went off for 219 rushing yards on just 15 carries, averaging 14.6 yards per carry. TreVeyon is averaging 5.4 yards per carry in his 5 starts &amp; Vegas has his rush total at 14.5 carries, which would equate to around 75 rushing yards. Henderson the last 3 weeks: 330 total yards, 252 yards after contact, 10 rushes for 1st down, 12 missed tackles forced. He has had 20+ Touches in consecutive games, seeing 18 &amp; 19 carries. Had a 72.4% backfield share last week, even after Stevenson returned. Stevenson had just 6 rushes for 5 yards. This is Henderson’s backfield. 

New England’s run scheme is pounding the Gaps, as opposed to Zone rushing. Their Gap rush attempt percentage is 45%, 6th highest in the NFL. The Giants allow a LEAGUE HIGH 7.3 yards per carry to Gap runs, by far the worst in the league, with the next closest YPC allowed being Cincinnati with 5.45 &amp; the league average being around 4 YPC. On Gap runs the Giants allow 60.3% run success rate, also worst in the NFL.

The Pats favored by -7.5 at home. They have trailed at halftime just once this season, fewest in the NFL. The Pats will play with the lead &amp; feed TreVeyon.

*Apologies for the short write-up. There’s a lot more to back the play but I’m traveling &amp; don’t have the time. I wanted to at least give the goods.*

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: TreVeyon Henderson (New England Patriots)

Prop: Over 60.5 Rushing Yards (BET365)

Odds: ~ -115 (Implied 53.5%)

True Probability: ~75%

Investment Strategy:
This prop should be the foundational piece of any Week 13 portfolio. The margin for error is significant; Henderson could perform well below his recent averages and still clear this number simply due to the Giants&#x27; defensive efficiency (or lack thereof).

If Lawrence is ruled out or limited, the confidence in this prop moves from 95% to near-certainty, as the interior of the Giants line would collapse entirely. Bettors should monitor the inactives list 90 minutes before kickoff, but the recommendation stands regardless of Lawrence&#x27;s status due to the perimeter weakness caused by Thibodeaux&#x27;s absence.</td></tr>

Patriots -6.5 alt line + TreVeon Henderson OVER 50 rush yards alt line

(+116 DK) 2 units

￼Write Up: The Giants are terrible, and the Pats should have no problem beating them soundly. Although they haven’t been especially sharp in the last couple games, the Giants lack any cohesive strategy, have a QB returning from injury and have a couple new coaches. They are utterly rudderless and probably have no motivation to dig deep in ice cold windy conditions at Foxboro. I think the one touchdown differential is pretty safe here.

The weather and game script will call for plenty of ground and pound with emergent RB TreVeon Henderson. Due to the timeshare with Rhamondre Stevenson I’m opting for his alt line of 50+ rush yards. Should be easy as the Giants rush defense is currently Swiss cheese.

FENERBAHCE VS GALATASARAY

Date: 01 DECEMBER 2025 at 18:00

BET ON: Match odds- FENERBAHCE

Odd: 2.19



\- Fenerbahçe come into this match with momentum and a relatively healthier squad, while Galatasaray are under serious strain. According to recent previews, several of Fenerbahçe’s summer signings are settled in and ready — giving their coach the flexibility and depth to field a competitive, balanced XI. Meanwhile, Galatasaray face significant injury and suspension issues: their star striker Victor Osimhen is sidelined with a thigh muscle problem and won’t be available; key defender Wilfried Singo is also out with a serious hamstring injury; and due to red-card suspension, winger Roland Sallai will miss the derby. Additional doubts linger over others: defenders like Kaan Ayhan, midfielders such as Berkan Kutlu, and attackers like Yunus Akgün or Ismail Jakobs reportedly could be unavailable or not match-fit. 

\- Tactically, this works heavily in Fenerbahçe’s favor. With Galatasaray missing so many defenders and offensive weapons, their usual structure will likely be disrupted — making them vulnerable at the back and less dangerous up front. Meanwhile, Fenerbahçe’s relative squad unity, fully fit attacking options, and stable back-line (despite some absentees) give them both balance and creativity. With the derby played in Fenerbahçe’s favor and their motivation high — chasing supremacy in Istanbul and eager to capitalize on their rival’s fragility — the conditions are ideal for a confident, dominant performance.

\- Given the contrast in fitness, depth and tactical readiness, Fenerbahçe appear significantly better placed to control the match and secure a victory.</td></tr>

Writeup: For Monday Night Football, we have the New England Patriots hosting the New York Giants. I don’t have a ton of statistics in this one as this is more of a play using the eye test and game scenario, but I like the Giants to cover the spread. 

The Giants have covered the spread in each of their last 3 games and are now going up a Patriots team that barely squeaked by against the Bengals last week, who have one of the worst statistical defenses in the history of the NFL. The Giants are getting their starting QB back in Jaxson Dart, who despite not winning many games, has been well above an average QB according to many statistical measures.

On top of this, it was expected that this offense would completely fall off the rails after their star WR Malik Nabers was out for the remainder of the season with an injury. Surprisingly, many of the Giants’s offensive weapons have stepped up in a big way in Nabers’s absence. On the other side of the ball, the Giants have a very underrated defensive front thanks to players like Brian Burns and Kayvon Thibodeaux. I expect them to get lots of pressure on the Patriots QB Drake Maye, as the Patriots starting left tackle is out with an injury.

I expect the Patriots to win this one, but I also expect it to be an ugly win. Giants will keep this one within a touchdown.

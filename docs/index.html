**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Dayton +10.5 vs Saint Louis (-102) (8:00 PM EST)**

Reasoning: Dayton has a history of playing Saint Louis close. In the last six meetings, Dayton has covered four times including four consecutive wins. Dayton is looking to bounce back tonight after dropping three straight and they know the task at hand against 20-1 Saint Louis. I see Saint Louis winning but covering a big spread here against a desperate Dayton team not so much. I expect maximum effort from Dayton tonight. Saint Louis edges Dayton in most offense and defensive stats however Dayton are respectable on defense ranking 76th defensively and 28th in steals which benefits them against a Saint Louis team that are top 40 in scoring. Public is going to be all over Saint Louis however line movement has moved in Dayton’s favor. That said, with h2h trends, respectable road form, motivation and line movement favoring Dayton, let’s expect them to cover this large spread in this conference game tonight

Event: NBA - Detroit Pistons @ Golden Stae Warriors - 10:00 PM eastern 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Cade Cunningham Over 32.5 Points + Assists Odds: -122


Write Up: Cade’s role is rock solid — he’s Detroit’s primary scorer and playmaker, giving us multiple paths to cash. He’s been even better away from home this season, averaging 26.6 points and 9.4 assists on the road (36.0 P+A), which clears this number comfortably. Golden State is shorthanded on the wing, removing key physical defenders and opening up driving lanes and passing windows. Even against a healthy Warriors team last year, Cade produced at a high level.</td></tr>

**ROI:** **68.9**%

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:**  Por Blazers Vs NY Knicks total 224.5 **UNDER** (1U to win 0.9U)

**Write Up:** Please be aware that recently are unreal. Even like last night I gave up already after 3rd Qs and there is more than 3 minutes to go which only has 7 points gap. But finally they picked up the scripts and saved me without any points for more than 2 minutes.

Please please this is only a demonstration.....

This <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> is from my sportsbook model that I found 2 weeks ago. It shows home team and away team are going to play a physical game instead of shooting party. After go through all information I could find from social media that&#x27;s why I made such <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> and I have 100% in it otherwise I won&#x27;t post.

&quot;Karl-Anthony Towns and the New York Knicks are in a strange position: The more they win, the more they&#x27;ll be connected to trade rumors involving Giannis Antetokounmpo.

The Knicks will look to remain hot Friday night when they host the Portland Trail Blazers in the final game of the season between the nonconference foes.

The Knicks were off Thursday after riding a dominant second half to a 119-92 win Wednesday night over the host Toronto Raptors. The Trail Blazers took their third straight loss Tuesday when they continued a three-game road trip with a 115-111 loss to the Washington Wizards.

The Knicks, on a four-game winning streak, are positioned to end January in a much steadier position than seemed possible last week. New York lost nine of 11 from Dec. 31 through Jan. 19, a stretch in which the team endured two four-game losing streaks.

Lol, please ignore above what I said as my entry was deleted/not recorded due to no reason provided. If you are in the game and you believe everything with scripts, you will know what I am saying. If the stats or commone sense works, why sportsbook still have to pay huge for generating these numbers. Only thing you have to do is to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> one side and see if you are same as books. Demonstration is still on the way and I believe win rate is around 65-70%.

Last Pick: Man City ML and Under 4.5 Match Goals v Galatasaray

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: Lens ML + Under 4.5 Goals Between Both Teams v Le Havre

Competition: Ligue 1

Sport: Football

Odds: 4/5

Reasoning: Lens home scoring rate (17 goals in 9) combined with Le Havre conceding 16 in 9 away points strongly to a Lens win without the game opening up. Le Havre’s low attacking output and injury-hit spine limit their ability to force a shoot-out, while Lens’ home matches are controlled rather than chaotic. That combination makes a Lens victory inside a low-to-moderate total (under 4.5) the most statistically aligned outcome.

I don’t usually bet on this guy but he’s clearly the grizzlies main rebounder with Edey and Aldama out and has only accomplished this line in the last 2/5 games The only thing that sways me is this

They allow double digit rebounds to almost every center they play and Jock averages about 7.8 rebounds in the last 5 games 8.4 in the last 10. I believe he could over perform getting 10+ rebounds. I know Jackson rebounds also but Landale avg more potential rebounds per game. Hoping for another good call <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> BOL 🔐🤞🏾</td></tr>

Next round of Unrivaled action kicks off with Breeze (4-3) vs Phantom (4-3). Each team has played each other once so this weekend has repeat matchups. Breeze won the first game vs Phantom 69-62 but I like the Phantom tonight. They average 74 PPG and play solid offense, leading Unrivaled with 55.19% eFG and 1.10 PPSA. Phantom use the 3PT shot more compared to other teams but shoot well with the 3rd highest 3PT% at 36.30%. On defense, Phantom have limited opponents to 2nd lowest PPG at 68.29. Opponent eFG% and FG% against the Phantom is just middle of the pack at 50.90% and 47.03%

I think Breeze have a slight edge defensively. While they&#x27;ve allowed opponent to score 70 PPG, teams do not shoot well against them. Breeze have lowest opponent FG% at 42.66% and opponent eFG% at 47.74%. On offense, Breeze score 71.71 PPG with middle of the pack shooting, posting 50.76% eFG%. and 46.60% FG%. While Phantom lead Unrivaled 3PAr at 35.27%, Breeze are last at 25.69%. Breeze&#x27;s last game on 01/26 has Rickea Jackson listed as questionable and she did not play. Breeze kept the game close early but ultimately lost 80-67 against Laces (6-1). Jackson&#x27;s status update <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> hasn&#x27;t been released and Breeze would like to have her available. But Jackson&#x27;s scoring in the last three games wasn&#x27;t great, posting 13/10/10 points.   

Phantom offense may struggled against this Breeze defense but I&#x27;m backing Phantom who have veteran players and been better offensively this year. Let&#x27;s get back on track but keeping this to 1u. I think Phantom have the edge but should be a competitive game. BOL</td></tr>

Event: UDel v. Utah in D1 Lacrosse

Time: 1230pm eastern

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Utah ML (-115)

Reasoning: Utah returns their entire team from last year, including arguably the country’s best LSM.  They also return an excellent face off guy, which is the reason I like this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>.  Delaware‘s #1 f/o guy is injured, and they struggled at the f/o x in their most recent scrimmage, which tells me that Utah is going to dominate possession time.  Given how Utah’s entire offense is returning, I anticipate that Utah will convert a ton of those possessions into goals.  Only issue is if Utah’s goalie doesn’t show up, but I really think that the disparity in possession time will make this irrelevant.</td></tr>

Write Up: Lazio haven&#x27;t won in two consecutive matches and need to bounce back, especially at home. Genoa is lower in class and has defensive issues. Lazio is an experienced side and will likely take control of the ball from the very first minutes. Lazio have a solid attacking line: there&#x27;s Isaksen, who can capitalize on a chance, and Dia, who will definitely want to prove himself <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Plus, the team will have strong home support. I think Lazio will eventually break Genoa down. Good luck to everyone!</td></tr>

**Todays Game:** NAC vs Twente

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Todays Pick</mark>:** Twente to win

**Odds:** $2.10

**Bet Size:** 3 units

**Time:** 5 Hours from post

**Write up:**

Twente at these odds feels like a total gift just because everyone saw NAC snag that weird draw against PSV last week. I really think that was a complete fluke where NAC basically parked the bus and prayed while holding their buttholes tight for 90 minutes. They’re still winless in like two months and stuck in the relegation muck for a reason. Twente is an absolute unit this year. they haven&#x27;t lost a game since october and they’re actually playing for a European spot. They’re just levels above a team that&#x27;s basically struggling to stay in the top flight.

It’s also looking like it’s gonna be a rainy one in Breda, which usually spells disaster for a shaky defense. Twente plays a really fast, possession heavy style that’s going to be a nightmare for NAC to track on a slick pitch. Plus, NAC&#x27;s best striker is apparently halfway to Portugal for a transfer, so who knows if he&#x27;s even focused?. Twente is way too organized to drop points here against a side this low in the table. I’m locking this in… should you? Maybe not, I’m no successful tipper.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Teuvo Teravainen over 0.5 pts +115 (theScore Bet)

Teravainen&#x27;s offensive metrics look very good in January: ranked 30th (out of 339) in xGF/60 among all forwards with at least 120 minutes. By comparison, that&#x27;s higher than Batherson, Kaprizov, and even Celebrini and Jack Hughes. His Corsi rating is ranked a solid 115th. Problem is actual GF/60 is not great and his TOI at 15:42 is a bit lower than I&#x27;d like. That&#x27;s why we&#x27;re getting plus odds; it&#x27;s not going to be a slam dunk.

The low GF/60 doesn&#x27;t worry me too much. Much of it comes from the fact that Connor Bedard hasn&#x27;t been great this month. But I still think Bedard is a world class player, and this is an opportunity to buy low.

Blue Jackets defense allows 8th most goals in the league. Their goaltending is bang average and their defense allows 8th most shots in the league. The Blackhawks first line should get their chances.</td></tr>

Write Up: Lazio last 10 league games they have 2 wins, 3 losses and 5 draws. Genoa have won 4, lost 3 and drawn 3 and Genoa have not lost a game in 5 matches. Lazio has not been scoring much so if Genoa can put one goal in this should cash. I also see a potential for a 0-0 tie here. Genoa to Win or Tie! Last time Cologne and Wolfsburg played they tied 3-3. Both these teams give up 2 or more goals per game on average. O1.5 will hit with ease.</td></tr>

Did not go over this line in his last 5 games and never hit that line in his last 10 games vs Chicago. Players like Werenski, who are going to the Olympics in a week, usually tend to play safer in order to not get hurt before the Olympics start. Just look at Nathan MacKinnon, who also has a 3.5 line shots and did not hit that line in his last 5. In other words, i&#x27;m going for a 6th game in a row where Werenski goes under that line!

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Cade Cunningham o31.5 pts + ast (-114) FanDuel 4u

**Write-up:** Here we go! Pretty confident in this play. Cade is averaging around 37 minutes in recent games. Taking another points + assists prop tonight, where Cade has cashed 29 out of 40 games this season. H2H against the Warriors, Cade is 3 out of 4, covering in the last three. In the first game, he managed to get 26 pts+ast, but Duren didn’t play that game. I like to think that had something to do with it. Minutes will be there as well, since in every H2H, Cade has logged at least 35. We can expect a full lineup tonight and another tight game, as the spread is sitting at -1.5.

Cade is playing extremely well in away games, covering in 9 straight. That dates back to Dec 3. In the entire season in away games, he has covered a phenomenal 17 out of 20. When playing with all the starters, he’s covered in 18 out of 23 games (11 out of 13 away, dating back to Nov 24). Also on a back-to-back tonight, where he has covered 4 out of 4 this season.

Cade has been in a bit of a slump recently, understandable though, as he has faced teams that defend point guards incredibly well: the Suns, Celtics, Rockets, and the Nuggets. Bit of an easier matchup tonight versus a team that ranks 28th in points to opposing guards, but a respectable 8th in assists allowed. The Warriors have been struggling this season in containing transition scoring, ranking 25th. Versus teams that rank 21st or worse, Cade has cashed 9 out of 9 times, with an average of 43.5 pts+ast. He is also torching teams that cannot defend pull up jumpers, where the Warriors rank 21st. Against teams that rank 16th or worse, Cade has covered in 14 out of 17 games. The Warriors sit middle of the pack in terms of pace, and in recent games are playing within the top 10 fastest. Cade is smashing teams that play with a fast pace, covering at around 80%. 

In the Warriors&#x27; last five, they rank 29th in assists allowed, 22nd in free throws allowed, and 26th in threes allowed. 

Let’s hope that with the soft matchup, Cade can dominate this game. He should get around 19 shots tonight, and he’s been averaging 19 potential assists to go with it. I see him having a 26-point / 9-assist type of game. 

Let’s cash again tonight. Good luck, fellas.</td></tr>

**Recap + overview(?):**

Celtic went up 3-0 early on and everything seemed like it would be a sweat free bet. But they just had to put me on the edge of my seat.

Utrecht managed to pull it back a bit to 3-2 but Celtic responded quickly to make it 4-2 in the 66th minute. The last half hour didn’t field any goals which gave us another win on a 4U bet.

3/3 on 4U bets and 1/1 on 5U bets. The big ones are pulling through tremendously which is the aim of the game of course.

Let&#x27;s keep riding the momentum.

**Write Up:**

For <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> I had a bet that is already taken due to me posting a bit later. Cologne vs Wolfsburg BTTS &amp; o2.5 goals is a very solid one that I will add as one of my other picks in the Soccer thread. I don&#x27;t like posting a copy of another bet.

But let’s not dwell on that, the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> I have here is very solid. It is close to a 4U bet in my mind but it just about didn’t make the cut.

Both teams are great home teams. Being #2 and #3 at home in the league is no small feat and that is part of the reason why this game caught my eye. One team has to play away and that can make the difference.

Radomiak are the lucky team that gets to play at home. They are 6-2-1 at home and boast a 22-7 scoring record in 9 games. Their only loss being against Jagiellonia, who are #3 in the league and #1 in away games. Their draws are against Wisla Plock (#1 in the league and #9 in away games) and Termalica (#18 in the league and #6 in away games).

Radomiak their wins are also impressive. With their latest home win a decisive 4-0 against Gornik Zabre (#2 in the league and #7 away from home).

The team they are facing is Arka Gdynia. Arka are a very solid home team with a matching 6-2-1 record. But away they are a completely different team. With a 0-1-8 record and only 2 goals scored whilst conceding 23 they are objectively terrible away from their home.

Arka Gdynia notable losses away from home are 2-0 against Termalica (#18 in the league and #18 as a home team), 1-0 against Motor Lublin (#11 in the league and #15 as a home team) and 4-1 against GKS Katowice (#16 in the league and #14 as a home team).

The only draw was 0-0 against Legia Warszawa. A bigger name in football but a mediocre team this season as they are #17 in the league and #12 as a home team. In this draw Legia Warszawa even outplayed Arka with 60-40 possession, 10-3 in shots and 3-0 in shots on target. So even in their 1 not-negative result they’ve been outclassed.

H2H this season the reverse fixture ended in a 1-1 draw and the match was pretty evenly matched. But that is why the home vs away statistics are important. Radomiak are the #16 away team and the #2 home team. That will make this game go from a draw in the reverse fixture to a win for Radomiak in the match <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.

The only thing that might prevent this from a straightforward win is that this is the first game after the winter transfer period. Both teams saw a few changes in the squad but no major players were transferred as far as I can tell.

That is the only thing stopping me from making this a 4U play. First game back can be interesting and might provide a different result.

Also, Radomiak had a coaching change in late october. In the 2 home games they’ve played under the new coach they managed to win 3-0 vs Cracovia (#6 in the league, #5 away from home) and, as mentioned before, 4-0 vs Gornik Zabre (#2 in the league and #7 away from home).

I love this play and am expecting another win.

If you have any questions, let me know!

Writeup: No matter how awful lazio plays or how great Genoa does there’s one thing that will always be true. Lazio will SPANK Genoa. All jokes aside, their last 5 h2h matches have been really one sided with lazio winning every single one while Genoa has never registered a goal. Lazio also has the 5th best defense in the league compared to Genoa who’s ranked 14th. Lazio averages about 1 goal per game which I feel like seeing this game go around 1-2 nil in favour of lazio.

Event: FISSURE Universe: Episode 8 — Upper Bracket Semifinal

Hi guys I’m starting my journey here. I’m immortal rank dota player have been betting on Dota 2 for a while and have made some profits and I wanted to share with you guys.

Analysis: The line 35min to me is insane because while Team Yandex is the favorite (#3 in the world), they aren&#x27;t &quot;stompers.&quot; Their 2-0 win over Power Rangers yesterday featured a 41-minute Map 2. They prefer a methodical, &quot;choke-out&quot; style rather than a 20-minute blitz and mind you Power Rangers are a tier 2 team. Aurora is much better team than PR, with Lorenof joining mid and Ws in offlane they just beat Betboom team who were the favourites. In their win against BetBoom yesterday, Map 1 was a 47-minute marathon. Even when they lost that first map, and that’s what I’m expecting <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> as well. Yandex overall has much more experience they are a better team and I think they are gonna win but at same time Nightfall and Lorenof were playing out of their mind yesterday against Betboom and Nightfall&quot; Grigorenko (Aurora&#x27;s carry) is notorious for a &quot;low-risk&quot; playstyle. He is arguably the best in the world at dragging games to the 40-minute mark by safely farming and avoiding bad fights, on top of that this is the Upper Bracket Semifinal, teams play much more cautiously here than in the group stages. No one wants to make a 20-minute mistake that drops them to the Lower Bracket. If you think this is too risky, you can go for over 35.5 map duration as well which is safer and still very good value. I also suggest to see the draft before betting sometimes since Dota games are highly draft dependent. Sorry for my English guys it’s not my first language.</td></tr>

Nurkic surprisingly played only 22 minutes against GSW, but still had a decent 11+5+5. If he goes to his usual 30-something minutes tonight, the 29.5 limit is undervalued here. 

Brooklin is a nice opponent for a win, and this is a nice chance to pump up the value before the trade deadline, if they want to sell him and to sell him high, now is the right time.

There are some uncertainties for me about his minutes, so 1 unit is enough.</td></tr>

Last pick: Desmond Bane “O”1.5 Made 3-Pointers❌

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the day</mark>: Cade Cunningham (DET) OVER 8.5 Assists

Reasoning • Cade is the primary engine for the #1 team in the Eastern Conference (34-12). He currently leads the NBA in assists, averaging 9.8 APG on the season. The Warriors play at a top-10 pace and frequently utilize defensive &quot;blitzes&quot; against elite lead guards. This strategy effectively forces the ball out of Cade&#x27;s hands and into the &quot;short roll,&quot; where he excels at finding Jalen Duren for lobs or shooters like Duncan Robinson on the perimeter. In a high-possession game against a Warriors team that allows over 30 assists per game to opponents, 9 assists is well within his floor.

Scenario A: The High-Pace Shootout The Warriors keep the game close by hitting their 3s, pushing the tempo. More possessions for both teams mean more assist opportunities for Cade. In his last two high-pace games against Denver and Sacramento, he recorded 11 assists in each.

Scenario B: The &quot;Decoy&quot; Role Golden State decides to sell out to stop Cade from scoring (as Phoenix successfully did recently). Cade is a high-IQ playmaker; if he’s doubled or trapped, he will simply facilitate. This actually raises his assist floor even if his points take a dip.

Scenario C: The PnR Masterclass The Warriors struggle to contain the Cade/Duren <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>-and-roll. Without a traditional elite rim protector available to slide over quickly, Cade racks up &quot;easy&quot; assists by feeding Duren at the rim or kicking to wide-open corner shooters when the defense collapses.

Scenario D: The white flag 🏳️ Detroit blows the Warriors out early. Even in a blowout win against Sacramento recently where he only played 30 minutes, Cade still managed to dish out 11 assists. He produces so efficiently that he can clear this line before the 4th quarter even begins.

Scenario E: Cold night The Pistons&#x27; supporting cast (Ivey, Fontecchio, Hardaway Jr.) goes cold on wide-open looks. Cade can make the perfect read, but if the shot doesn&#x27;t fall, the assist doesn&#x27;t count. This is the only realistic &quot;trap&quot; for this prop. Scenario Proof: Cunningham has cleared this line in 4 of his last 5 games, including massive outings of 14, 11, and 11 assists. He is currently the league leader in &quot;Potential Assists&quot; per game. Facing a Golden State perimeter defense that is missing key secondary defenders, the volume and matchup favor a big playmaking night for the Pistons&#x27; star.</td></tr>

NBA: Grizzlies @ Pelicans 7:30 PM EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Jaren Jackson Jr. o1.5 assists (-162); 1.62 units to win 1 unit

Write Up:  
The Grizzlies roster is empty right now thanks to injuries. Two of their three best contributors (Ja Morant and Santi Aldama) are out because of injuries. This means way more touches for JJJ.  
From the Pelicans&#x27; POV, their really is only one player to worry about scoring. In the game a couple days ago between the two teams (Grizzlies without Aldama and Morant), as soon as Jaren Jackson got within the three point line, the Pelicans would send help early. Even with Aldama out, the Grizzlies have capable shooters in Wells, Cam Spencer, Coward, KCP, and even Vince Williams Jr. (I think he&#x27;s a better shooter than his sub-30% suggests).  
Here&#x27;s where I can see things going wrong. Jaren Jackson Jr. is a pretty bad passer. Like I said earlier, a lot of times, the Pelicans would send help early if he was in the three point line. You would expect him to kick it out for an open shot. Instead, he chooses to keep going downhill. This worked out okay for him scoring; he finished 5/10 in the paint which is decent but definitely not good (league average paint field goal is around 54%). I see two reasons for this. Like I said before, he isn&#x27;t a good passer: strong-side help defense overhelps off Cam Spencer and he still doesn&#x27;t make the pass. Second, the Pelicans help was pretty lazy sometimes, and when help defense is lazy, the ball handler is basically still in a one on one.  
All in all, I still like this bet a lot.</td></tr>

Lens ML: The main <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. Lens (2nd place) have won all games at home this season except one against Lyon, which is a much more formidable opponent than 15th place Le Havre.

U6.5 cards: I’m not gonna lie. I just needed a filler to get this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> to proper odds. You can <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> something else here. Lens matches has U4.5 cards in last 6/8, Le Havre Matches U4.5 cards in last 5/6. There have been U4.5 cards in last 7/9 H2H and the ref averages 3.57 cards per game. ONE PROBLEM: Lens sometimes likes to get red cards. I think though that this inflates our odds and they’re unlikely to get rough enough to weak Le Havre to get a red.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: Under 6.5 Goals (-125) 2.5u To Profit 2u

Write-Up: Only game on the board <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> and it’s looking like a good under game. The Columbus Blue Jackets go to Chicago to play the Blackhawks. The goalie for the Blue Jackets is Jet Greaves, he has a .908 save percentage and a 2.66 goals against average. For the Blackhawks, Spencer Knight is in net. This season, Spencer Knight has a .910 save percentage and a 2.58 goals against average. Both teams aren’t great offensively with the Blackhawks ranking 26th in goals, and almost dead last in shots on goal, at 31st. The Blue Jackets are pretty average as well ranking 19th in goals but they do have the 3rd most shots on goal. Despite Columbus having high shots on goal, I think Spencer Knight will be able to save a good chunk of them. With both goalies being very good this season and neither team being an offensive threat, I could see this one going heavily into our favour.

Take The Under 6.5 Goals!</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>NBA 1/30/26 Celtics -4.5 (-110) vs Bulls, 2 units.

Boston has been much more consistent at home and their defense travels well even on short rest. Chicago tends to struggle when they cannot control pace, and that usually shows up in second halves against stronger teams. The number is still inside a reasonable range and I would rather lay a small spread than chase a juiced moneyline. This feels like a value spot rather than a lock, so keeping the stake modest.</td></tr>

Potential <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: 🏀 St. Louis -4.5 alt + Nevada -2.5 alt (-128)

Game starts at 8pm EST. Bet 3u

Writeup: Decided to switch out of Nevada -7.5 as those 7.5s immediately disappeared as soon as I posted this. Going back to the well with another 2 leg alt parlay. 

Let’s start with St. Louis vs Dayton. St. Louis comes into this matchup as the 21st best team in the country boasting a 20-1 record. The have a top 20 defense and an offense inside the top 50, and while they haven’t played any formidable opponents, their record and AP poll ranking is very true to their talents. They are dropping over 90 and 100 point games on many teams this season. On the other side, Dayton comes in with a defense inside the top 50, but with an offense around 150th. You can see where the disadvantage is. Haslametrics has this discrepancy ever greater, with a 16th best defense vs 165th offense. Both teams play up tempo, which is great for us as matchups with similar play styles tend to go to the better team (March Madness tip). The only thing to look out for is that St. Louis can be a bit erratic. I expect a double digit victory, but to compensate, we’ll bring the spread down to -4.5.

Now for Nevada vs UNLV. I’ll give the offensive rebounding advantage to UNLV, but beyond this, it’s all Nevada. The only other downside is Nevada has not played well at home while UNLV has been effective away, but Nevada has been far more consistent than UNLV. These teams also have opposite styles of play, with Nevada being the slower paced team. Nevada should win with a solid margin, but a 9 point win isn’t easy for a slower paced team who can be a little erratic at home. -2.5 is a far better number.

Paulo or Bane will likely be guarding him. Per StatMuse, both rank in the middle of the league as defenders. The Magic as a whole are an average defensive team. Poeltl is out, which should increase Barnes chances at rebounds. He is averaging 33.3 pra for the season and 35.6 for his last ten games (over 32 in 7/10). Barnes can have a big scoring night but he can also <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> up volume with rebounds and assists so I don’t like taking any one prop with him, but in a game that should be close, he should see a lot of minutes and a high usage rate against an average defense with a prop below his average.</td></tr>

**Write Up:** Sweat free as a two lay can get, Bologna saw out their game 3-0 with relative ease. Aston Villa/Salzburg was not even close, totalling 6 corners at the end of play. Feels good to get back in the wins after so many unfortunate and close losses - onto the next!

I would like to state I am a fan of all sports, hence what seems to be a random selection but a friend of mine suggested this line to me and from my own research I like the value it is at and hence put it in my two-lay. Firstly we go to the second division of Rugby Union in France - strange I know. BUT Aurillac are on a 4 game losing streak and Valence have won 7/9 games, the bet isn&#x27;t for them to win as Aurillac are the home team and it is a winnable game for them to push them out of their slump, however current form suggests that should Valence play well and keep it competitive by keeping their defensive shape and their kicking game in form then they should be able to cover the spread on this match, potentially come away with a win.

Secondly is just a bit of a juicer for the lay and it goes to one of my favourite leagues which is the NBA. Knicks are currently 18-6 at home, on a 4 game winning streak compared to Portland&#x27;s 10-13 road record on a 3 game loss streak. H2H Knicks are on a 6 game streak and with most of the squad&#x27;s being fit I don&#x27;t see there being a problem for Knicks to put another W in their win column. I won&#x27;t be overthinking this one, purely off form and records im backing New York in this spot.

Writeup: After Zagreb sold us yesterday, today im going back to Australia, where goals flow. The first leg is between 2 teams in different leagues, with eastern suburvs the favorites, being from a division above. In addition, the Hawks had lost their previous game in a 8 goal affair. 

The 2nd leg is quite similar to the first one, where Magic united is from a division above. The issue is Magic has recently been promoted &amp; Logan has recently been relegated, so i dont think there is any 1 clear favorite &amp; my mind says it will be a close 3-4 goal affair. So, copping out and going with over 2.5 goals for this leg.

In Bristol City&#x27;s last 9 games this line has hit in 8/9 of those games.

In those 9 games the average corners first half was 6.2 per game.

In their Last 5 home games this line has hit 4/5.

**--**

**Derby County- Rank 6/24 - Average 10.72 PG**

Given the weight behind the game I don&#x27;t expect either team to play pragmatic and quite frankly if one team leads the other should force field tilt and print corners so it works both ways for us. Derby will grab at the open space and i expect an end to end first half. They&#x27;ve played off the ball as of recent but Bristol home ground + 1 point difference will get us where we need to be.

**--**

**I see the first half being the play here as a home early lead could lead to a dwindle in output in the second half.**

**Total corners Over 9 is playable, but i&#x27;m personally staying away. Model and I just both see more corners first half.**

Nürnberg vs Preußen Münster, FIRST HALF OVER 1.5 GOALS @ 2.71

looks like a high-scoring first half candidate, especially for Over 1.5 goals in the opening 45. Historical data shows both clubs have been involved in matches with multiple goals, and past head-to-head clashes have featured early scoring action, including a 2-1 Münster win where both first-half goals came before halftime recently. League stats also indicate a strong trend for over 1.5 total goals overall and early goals. </td></tr>

Alcaraz is the stronger player here and is certainly motivated to win this tournament and complete the career slam. The question here is can Zverev keep up and grab a set. I think he can. Zverev has actually had a little bit of success historically against Alcaraz. Their H2H record is 6-6 and he has beaten him in a slam multiple times. The only time they played in a slam where Zverev didn’t win a set was the U.S. Open in 2023. Every other time, Zverev either won the match or won at least a set. Zverev has looked pretty good in this tournament and has a history of playing well here. I envision Zverev being able to nab the first or second set and then have Alcaraz pull away late.

Good Luck!</td></tr>

Write up: I’m backing the wolverines here on this one. They’re coming off a win against Nebraska where they struggled early and got it done. Those types of games build character for games like these, especially against a rival. I understand Michigan has been iffy recently but let’s just look at the facts. They score the ball better than Michigan State in terms of PPG and FG%. They defend better than Michigan State in terms of steals and blocks per game. The only area they’re worse at is 3 point percentage and they’ve still made more. And to add to that, Michigan is allowing opponents to shoot only 30.4% from 3 which is a huge drop off for Michigan State, and allow only 68.8 PPG to opponents. The 2 games Michigan State has lost they’ve been held well below this mark. And every game they’ve won they’ve been above this mark besides 1, they scored 68 that game. The 68 range will be the magic number. Michigan’s defense can completely shut opponents out down the stretch, and there’s no one on Michigan State I’m fearful of going and completely taking over a game. Let me know if you’re tailing, best of luck everyone!

* This line was a huge mistake during round 1, where they initially set him to 7.5, and then realized the mistake and changed his headshots to 4.5 for map 3, now they play their second series and the line is right back at 7.5
* Yxngstxr is traditionally a rifler averaging a 56.7% headshot overall in 2025, but returned to the HEROIC starting lineup to fill in for Alkarenn the teams AWPer. Anyone AWPing has a much lower headshot percentage which we have seen with ynxgstxr as well, since filling in he is averaging a 39% headshot overall a -17.7% headshot overall.
* With his kill line at 13.5 map 1, this means he would be projected \~5 headshots with this current headshot percentage but this line is missing the fact that he is AWPing now and isn&#x27;t accounting for the increase, and is instead based on his 2025 number of 56.7%.
* Since rejoining HEROIC he has played 10 maps and has gone U 7.5 headshots in 9/10 of them, only hitting on a massive 19 kill performance. He only has 2/10 maps with 15+ kills dropped so far, he has been HEROIC&#x27;s worst performing player so far at the tournament with a .59 KPR
* Since it is HEROIC&#x27;s map <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, they would start on CT side which is even better for U on headshots as the AWP is bought much more on CT side and we see a \~2-2.5% decrease in headshot on this side of the map</td></tr>

**New Event:**  Djokovic vs Sinner

So disgusted by the outcome of my last pick that I am not going into a long winded writeup for this one.  Djokovic looked slow and tired in the quarter finals vs Mussetti and gave up a 2-0 lead in the 1^(st) set only to lose the first 2 sets.  He was saved by Musetti’s injury who withdrew and now Djoker is in the semis.

Unfortunately for him, he is facing Sinner who is playing lights out at the moment.  Unless Djoker can break Sinner early, it will be over quick.  Although Novak is the “Goat”, he has not been able to get past Sinner and Alcaraz in recent years and this will be no different.  Sinner has matured and is no longer playing Djokovic his idol, his hero, the legend… Sinner now plays Djokovic the opponent.  Once he overcame that fear straight-sets wins became the norm in majors. 

Unless Sinner gets injured, I can’t see Djokovic stealing a set.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:**  **Zverev OVER 1.5 Breaks of Serve @ 2.25,  1 unit  (Bet365)**

https://preview.redd.it/7i6vo4ipodgg1.png?width=1122&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72fe582aab15596aa4ab68d672158b2f26e9cbd9

**Analysis:** 

Zverev is in very solid form this year in Australia, hitting 1st serve at 70% or higher and also hitting winners off both wings in play.

Historically Zverev has shown he can push Carlos in the Grand Slam format and even win.  
Let&#x27;s quickly go through past H2H at majors and see how it looks for Zverev:

* RG 2022:   Zverev  Won  3:1,  **broke Carlos 3 times from 8 breakpoints**
* US 2023:   Zverev  Lost  3:0,  Breakpoints: 0/5
* **AO 2024:  Zverev   Won  3:1,  Breakpoints: 7/10**
* RG 2025:  Zverev   Lost  3:2, **Breakpoints:  6/23**

**In 2024 Zverev defeated Alcaraz in Australian Open and broke him  7 times.** Clay is Carlos&#x27; best surface and still he cannot easily beat Zverev in Paris allowing 23 breakpoints in their last year encounter.

Overall Alcaraz-Zverev H2H is tied at 6-6 and in Grand Slams it&#x27;s 2-2.

You could say I&#x27;m building the case for Zverev to win or cover the handicap line (and that is indeed true) - so why focus on Breaks of Serve ?  
**Because Bet365 is pricing Zverev OVER 1.5 Breaks of Serve @ 2.25 and other bookmakers are much lower, e.g. looking at 22bet I&#x27;m seeing odds 1.67 for this event. Other bookmakers offer 1.85 etc.**

Furthermore I like this bet because it can easily cash even if Zverev loses the match.

There are some factors which could put me off such as Carlos improving his serve lately and also his own good form in the tournament, but I cannot pass on odds of 2.25.  I feel as Zverev breaking Carlos 2 times is 50-50 chance at absolute worst.</td></tr>

Sinner came through last round and I&#x27;ll be backing this bet yet again. Joker went down two sets to Musetti and Sinner will be playing even more aggressive and consistent than Musetti did in the quarters. Jannik has won their last 4 competitive matches in straight sets and hard not to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> that again at these odds. Sinner has only dropped one set so far and the heat played a big factor. Sinner will pressure every Djokovic service game and will make Djokovic have to play a pretty aggressive game to end up even taking a set. Give me the back to back champ to take care of business yet again and possibly set up yet another Sincaraz final.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Alexander Zverev 🇩🇪 to win a set vs Carlos Alcaraz 🇪🇸 5 units to win 3.1U @1.61 (Bet365)

Betting on straight set victories has been too easy in this dross of an Australian Open so we’re spicing it up. O3.5 sets is also a good bet but looking at the prices is marginally worse than this. Fairer odds in my opinion would be around 1.44. 

Zverev has been serving at an absurd level so far in Melbourne, topping it off with a serving clinic against Tien hitting 24 aces. He’s been averaging a 73% first serve rate so far this year (just behind Baez since last year) but it’s mostly his placement that has improved compared to 2025. Zverev has been serving a lot more clutch as well, Learner had 3 break points in their match which were all saved by virtually unreturnable winning serves. He also dismantled Cerundolo (a player against who he has struggled a lot against historically) in the fourth round to confirm his good form. The serving is obviously a huge reason alone to back Sasha to win a set at these prices but it’s also his game intentions that have improved this year. I haven’t found him all that great from the baseline compared to his usual standards and it was evident against last round that Tien was winning most of the baseline points. However his aggression has improved a lot in the past few months to make up for this to take time away from his opponent to force more errors. Zverev is going to be glad that it’s not Sinner on the other side of the net because against Alcaraz he can dominate the backhand to backhand rallies, unlike against the Italian. It’s the one tactic to truly be competitive against Carlos as it’s his slightly more erratic wing and Sasha has the first/second best backhand on tour. It’s no reason that their past matches have been close, with a 6-6 head to head. Sascha actually defeated Alcaraz here in 2024 in four sets. 

Alcaraz is understandably the heavy favourite going into this match but this is going to be a proper test for him. This is surprisingly his first time into the semis of the AO, compared to Sascha’s 3rd and being the defending finalist, and once again has been pretty flawless to reach this stage. He’s not dropped a set yet but I would be surprised if that trend were to continue <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Despite the comfortable win against De Minaur his first serve percentage was only at 58% and that could very well be punished by a good powerful returner such as Zverev. In general this match-up hasn’t been easy for the Spaniard as the German is a master at playing patiently and deep, better so than any other player at an elite level, and therefore the errors can start to creep in the No. 1’s game. If he can target the forehand though Zverev will be in for a long day. However, with how well Sascha has been serving especially on these faster courts I expect Alcaraz won’t be dictating many rallies on return which gives Zverev the upper hand on targeting the backhand and finishing points early. With Alcaraz’s occasional dips in focus Zverev can no doubt earn a break and hold for the rest of a set or come away with a tiebreak win. I predict Alcaraz to win 3-1 in some very contested sets but I wouldn’t necessarily be all that surprised if the German came away with the win especially on a good day. BOL !</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Match Totals - Over 6.5 Total Inhibitors (1.72) 2u to win 1.44u** ✅️

**Start Time:** 17:00 KST, \~8 hours from posting

**UPDATE: The line has moved up and some are asking whether o7.5 is still good, I&#x27;ll clarify here. It&#x27;s a coin toss at 7.5, too hard to call either way. o7.5 has pretty good value right now on my main book (2.00) so if you would still like to tail, a smaller value bet can work on the over. Otherwise fade if your risk appetite is low.**

**Writeup:**

Nongshim RedForce (1-3) were a team I was quite high on at the start. Their roster looked promising and they were going against the typical slow League played in Korea. Since then, they&#x27;ve mostly been up and down, struggling to find consistent play. They can be good, really really good but team cohesion and decision making in the late game needs work.

KT Rolster (2-2) are looking a bit washed to no one&#x27;s surprise. I feel as if this is just the yearly &quot;KT goes through a slump then somehow bounces back, rinse and repeat&quot; that they are known for. I hardly doubt that a week would be enough to fix whatever issues they&#x27;re dealing with so the match is quite close because of it.

Going in, KT are slight favourites on the eye test and on the books. This should be competitive, and I predict it&#x27;ll likely go the distance. At least 4 games and a likely 5th in my opinion. As such, I am taking the over on 6.5 total inhibitors for the match. Now what is an inhibitor? Each team has 3 at the start of the game, and guaranteed, there will always be 1 inhibitor taken before the game can end. o6.5 entails 7 inhibitors be taken in best of five series.

Therefore going the distance, in this case 4 or 5 games, increases the likelihood of hitting at least 7 because we are guaranteed more inhibitors. On all games played this season, Nongshim average 1.4 inhibitors/game both ways, KT average 2.2. Nongshim&#x27;s numbers are a bit low because of the fashion in which they win games, but when they are behind, they are averaging 1.66 per game during losses. So in losses Nongshim are holding and forcing a second inhibitor from the enemy team and KT&#x27;s tendencies lean toward taking multiple inhibitors to secure the game.

KT should win the series, but Nongshim will be right behind them. KT as a team play slow, and I don&#x27;t think they can get insanely ahead to the point where they&#x27;re ending the game with just one inhibitor destroyed. On the flipside, Nongshim can snowball a lead, but with it comes risks. They either end the game prematurely or they go into a bloodbath that often times hurts them more than it helps. This feast or famine style can up the inhib count if they choke a lead. I expect another good match with plenty of back and forth between both. **Please gamble responsibly and only bet what you can lose, BOL!**

Udinese scored first in the 23rd minute and things looked good early, but Verona equalised just three minutes later and that changed the whole flow of the game.

**Match:** Espanyol vs Alavés

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:**
Espanyol Double Chance (1X) &amp; Over 1.5 Goals @1.80 (1 unit).

Espanyol come into this sitting inside the top five and have been one of the more consistent sides in LaLiga this season. they average over a goal per game and usually find a way to score, especially in the second half where most of their goals come.

Alavés are a completely different team away from home. They’ve lost seven straight on the road, taken just one win in ten away matches, and have failed to keep a clean sheet in almost all of them. They also fail to score in a lot of these games, which puts them under constant pressure.

These two met earlier in the season and Alavés won 2–1, so Espanyol should be well aware of the threat and motivated to get revenge here. With Alavés struggling badly away from home and Espanyol usually creating chances at their own ground, it’s hard to see the visitors going to Barcelona and winning this.

The double chance covers a draw, which is always possible in LaLiga, while the over 1.5 goals fits how both teams play. Espanyol tend to score, Alavés tend to concede, and once the first goal goes in this matchup usually opens up.

As long as Espanyol don’t lose, two goals in this game feels very realistic.

Djokovic just doesn&#x27;t have what it takes anymore. In 2025, he lost twice to Sinner at Roland Garros and Wimbledon 3-0. And that was not on Sinner&#x27;s best surface. Djokovic beat some very low ranked players in straight sets this tournament. But when he faced Musetti who really should have no business beating Djokovic, he lost the first 2 sets and only won the match because Musetti got injured and was forced to retire. Djokovic also has a blister on his foot which doesn&#x27;t help. Meanwhile, Sinner has won his last three tournaments, only dropping one set to Zverev. The only issue I see is if Sinner gets cramps like he did against Spizzirri. He will be playing an evening match where the sun sets in an hour from start time so temperatures should be fine.</td></tr>

We are going to have the 6^(th) team at home against the last team on the road <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, with Munster being 2-0-7 and having a negative goal diff of 9:17.

What makes this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> even more interesting is that Munster have lost 2 key players for this match, due to a red card. Not to mention that Nurnberg are also 4-1-0 in their last 5 home games. H2H in advantage of Nurnberg, being 2-0-1.</td></tr>

**Last:** (CBB) Illinois -12.5 (1.5u) - L

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** (CBB) No. 7 Michigan State ML vs No. 3 Michigan

**Start Time:** 8:00 PM ET (FOX)

**Odds:** \+104 (FanDuel)

**Units:** 1.5U

**Reasoning:** While there’s no love lost between Michigan and Michigan State, both schools can agree on one sentiment: defense is the name of the game.

For the Spartans (19-2), they enter among the nation’s elite defensively, ranking 5th in scoring defense (63.5 PPGA), 5th in opponent field-goal percentage (38.9%), 9th in defensive efficiency (0.919) and 31st in opponent three-point shooting (30.1%). The Wolverines (19-1) counter with a defensive unit that might be even better, 42nd in opponent three-point percentage (30.4%) and 48th in scoring defense (68.8 PPGA). So while defense may win championships, it might also go a long way in settling one of college basketball’s most heated rivalries on Friday night.

Surprisingly, it’s been a rivalry that’s been awfully one-sided as of late.

Michigan State has won four straight and five of the last six contests against its in-state rival dating back to 2023. In fact, not only has the team won 11 of the last 15 overall meetings against Michigan, it also holds an impressive 19-3 mark at home. That includes seven consecutive victories at the Breslin Center, with all but two coming by 12+ points. You’d have to go back 2,938 days and two Wolverines head coaches ago to find the last time the Spartans dropped one at East Lansing (Jan. 13, 2018).

It certainly doesn’t help Michigan that its level of play has been heading in the wrong direction.

After two close calls against Wake Forest and TCU within their opening three games of the season, the Wolverines responded by winning each of their next 10 contests by 15 or more points, including all but two by 28+. Another deep run in March appeared all but assured with the team even being listed as high as +450 to cut down the nets.

However, things have taken a turn for the worse over the last seven games.

**MICHIGAN UNTIL JAN. 2 / SINCE JAN. 3**

* **Record (ATS):** 13-0 (9-4) / 6-1 (0-7) 
* **Barthag:** 1st (.9909)/ 13th (.9436)

* **3PTD%:** 36th (29.5%) / 140th (32.9%)

Not only has Michigan failed to cover its each of the seven contests, but the team suffered its first loss of the season in rather embarrassing fashion—a 91-88 loss to Wisconsin at home as 19.5-point favorites. The statistical fall-off across the board defensively would be concerning on its own, but its especially worrisome against a Michigan State offense that enters averaging 82.3 points on 55.6% shooting (39.3% from beyond the arc) over its last three games. Look for Big Ten POTY candidate Jeremy Fears Jr. to continue his torrid run—20.4 points and 9.2 assists on 56.4% shooting over his last five outings—to lead the charge in taking advantage of these weak points.

Rebounding will play a pivotal role on Friday night.

Both of these teams have made a living dominating opponents on the glass this season, as the Wolverines rank 6th in total rebounding (42.0 per game) while the Spartans rank 12th in the category (41.4). However, what could break the stalemate is offensive rebounding, where Michigan State ranks 22nd with 11.5 offensive rebounds per game and 1st in limiting such opportunities for opponents (6.2) while Michigan ranks just 107th in offensive rebounding (9.9) and a troubling 209th in opponent offensive rebounding (9.3). This is where the Spartans can truly do some damage, as the team ranks 23rd in second-chance points (14.4 PPG; 94th percentile) and 1st in opponent second-chance points (6.4 PPG; 100th percentile). That’s concerning news for the Wolverines who find themselves among the worst in the country in the category, ranking 304th in opponent second-chance points (12.6; 17th percentile).

Not surprisingly, turnovers will be the X factor in this one.

Neither of these teams have been the model of clean handling of the basketball thus far. Through 20 games, Michigan ranks 161st in opponent steals (6.6), 172nd in turnovers per possession (16.5%) and 267th in turnovers (12.7) while Michigan State enters ranked 216th in turnovers (12.2), 243rd in turnovers per possession (17.6%) and 254th in opponent steals (7.2). However, things have been especially alarming for the Wolverines as of late, as the team has seen its averages balloon to 8.1 opponent steals and 15.3 turnovers over its last four contests while registering a 21.7% mark in turnovers per possession. It will be imperative for a Spartans team that doesn’t force too many turnovers—225th in turnovers forced per possession (15.9%), 245th in turnovers forced (11.0) and 288th in steals (5.6)—to find a way to change that.

Finally, on a lighter note, Friday also marks the birthday of Michigan State head coach Tom Izzo.

If you love trends, consider this: The Spartans are 7-1 when playing on Izzo’s birthday, including 3-0 against Michigan. That includes an 81-62 throttling of the Wolverines back in 2024.

In what should be an early-candidate for Game of the Year, trust Sparty to emerge victorious.

Last POTD: [Wisconsin -3.5 + Houston ML](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/s/vxZwcsBDjy) ✅

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: NCAAMB: Michigan State +1.5 vs Michigan -108 (0.50U TO WIN 0.42U)** 

Write up: 0.50U on this one because this will be a nail bitter - On another note, I cannot believe Wisconsin shot that bad in the 1H and still found a way to cover the -3.5 for us - Model has this as the highest confident Edge % and EV % for the day. Will add some personal information in this write-up as well.

• ⁠Model has Michigan State ML at 52% 

• Model has Michigan State +1.5 at 53% 

• EV better betting 100$ = 7-9$ for this play

• Michigan State opens up as underdog, at home, vs a Michigan team who has continued to show us that they deserve to be a top 3 team in the country - You guys know me, the first thing I’m going to say here is that this is a rivalry game, and the team that is at home, is an underdog, and I’m taking the bait, once again - Home court advantage is a real thing, and will always play a factor one way or another - Michigan leads in most metrics but man MSU has been rolling, they have been battled tested, and are on a 7 game win streak - They should come out flying high after their awesome comeback victory over Rutgers on the road earlier this week - Michigan State is 11-1 at home this year, with the lone loss being Duke and the Boozier brothers - I took Nebraska +11.5 earlier this week against Michigan and a big reason for that bet was due to the fact that, although Michigan has been rolling this season, they are 0-7 L7 ATS - On the flip side, and a big reason why I am only laying 0.50U on this one, because Michigan has that offensive threat that will score 90+ points, any day of the week - that is the risk we run betting against Michigan - Michigan has fallen off a bit in scoring in conference play, and when teams can stop them from going on their shooting hot streak, which they have been, the chance of winning and more of a chance of covering - I think the over under should be set at around 160.5, given these offenses, the line should be higher than 145.5 - this line tells me that defense will play a big factor, and also tells me that Vegas may not predict many big Michigan runs, which favors the Spartans - Both teams have a top 5 defense in the country, Michigan State has a small rebounding edge, Michigan plays at a high pace, but Michigan defense tends to control the pace of play more at home, than on the road - Tom Izzo will have a game-plan in this one, and if the players can execute, I believe they will pull this one out towards the end - Taking Michigan State +1.5 here due to them being at home, Michigan’s ATS record, Michigan State’s defensive edge at home,  and Tom Izzo

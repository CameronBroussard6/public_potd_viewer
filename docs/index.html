USA are going to dominate the play and luckily this spread is smaller than the previous ones I’ve chosen, so the USA shouldn’t need to score at will to cover the spread. In the 2025 World Hockey Championship, they were outscored 15-2 over three games. They never scored more than one goal, and two of the losses were by a margin of six. Latvia won’t be able to keep up.

​Sport: Football | Premier League

​Event: Arsenal vs. Brentford 

Time: 3:00 PM EST

​<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Arsenal ML @ 1.66 odds (5u)

​Write Up:

Arsenal is sitting at the top of the table and cannot afford to drop points if they want to hold off Man City. Their form right now is scary, they have won 3 straight games beating Leeds, Chelsea, and Sunderland without conceding a single goal. Their defense is arguably the best in the world atm, allowing just 0.72 xGA over their last 5 matches. With Viktor Gyökeres firing upfront and the midfield fully healthy, they are clicking on all cylinders.

​Brentford is coming off a chaotic 3-2 win against Newcastle, but don&#x27;t let that fool you, their defense is leaky. They have conceded more goals at home than almost any other mid-table team this season. Historically, the Gtech Community Stadium has been a playground for Arsenal, the Gunners have won 4 games in a row at this stadium.

​You have a title-contending team with the best defense in the league playing against a team that bleeds high-danger chances. We take the superior team to handle business on the road.

​BOL.

**Last Five:** ✅❌❌❌✅

**Event:** Copa del Rey, Atletico Madrid v FC Barcelona, 3:00 pm EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Atletico Madrid 0.0, +0.5 Asian Handicap, -111, 5 units

**Write Up:** Oh yes, Barcelona are meeting Atletico Madrid in the semi finals of this year&#x27;s Spanish Copa del Rey. This matchup rarely disappoints, with the most recent first leg in the cup (last season) ending 4-4 with **Barca infamously choking a two goal lead twice.**

Atletico Madrid&#x27;s league title hopes are more or less dusted and they&#x27;re not exactly one of the favorites to win the Champions League either, so they&#x27;ve turned all their focus on the domestic cup competition. With their main rivals, Real Madrid, already eliminated, the only team that realistically stands in their way to silverware, is Barcelona. The idea that they&#x27;re putting all their eggs in one basket, so to speak, is backed by their **quarter final performance, in which they thrashed a very strong Real Betis side 5-0.** On the other hand, **Barcelona are being stretched thin,** still fighting hard on all fronts, and **their Copa del Rey campaign has been unconvincing** to say the least.

Taking all of that into consideration, plus all the **injuries on Barcelona&#x27;s side** (de Jong, Pedri, Gavi, Raphinha and Christensen are all out), I can&#x27;t see Barcelona taking the control of the midfield this time around, especially **not on Atletico&#x27;s ground.** Atletico are going to have all the fan support behind them and should, at the very least, snatch a cheeky draw here. BTTS Yes is also a reasonable angle to take, though I don&#x27;t exactly expect a goal fest here, as there&#x27;s still a whole second leg left to be played after <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. I wouldn&#x27;t miss the chance to fade Barcelona for anything, and let&#x27;s have some fun with a 5 unit nuke. <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>, we&#x27;re going to be hatwatching like never before.

<tr><td class='post'>Record: 180-149, +5.80 units

Last Pick: Olaf Pieczkowski ML vs Quinn Vandecasteele (+110, 1 unit): Win

Tennis | ATP Dallas | 9:10 PM EST (estimated)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Tommy Paul vs Miomir Kecmanovic | **Paul to win 2-0 at +100 (DK)**. 1 unit

Write-up: No CLV on that play, but that&#x27;s about the only negative I can find, as Pieczkowski scored a nice 2-0 win.

Tommy Paul is one of the more consistent performers on hard courts, having recently made the fourth round of the Australian Open and lost to Alcaraz in a match that was closer than the scoreline makes it look. He has an excellent record on these indoor hard courts here in Dallas, having won the tournament in 2024 and lost to a red-hot Shapovalov in the semis in 2025. There were some concerns about how he would adjust to new conditions a few days after playing a Davis Cup tie against Hungary on clay. However, he managed to squeeze past Jenson Brooksby in R1 with a solid 7.51 performance rating, and he should be prepared for the second round now.

In comparison, Kecmanovic is a former top junior who never quite lived up to the billing, but has nevertheless managed to hang around the ATP tour for quite a while now. But Kecmanovic has had a really rough start to the season, going winless through four matches before scraping past Shimabukuro in R1 here (7.20). While that win may give him some confidence after a ton of tight losses as of late, his form simply doesn&#x27;t suggest that he can challenge Tommy here. Prior to this year, Kecmanovic had an 0-2 record in Dallas, and it&#x27;s been a while since he&#x27;s shown the ability to beat against top players on any surface. Both of these players tend to stick at the baseline, but Paul will have the advantage in the serve and backhand departments. In general, most players who beat Tommy have some sort of &quot;special sauce&quot; or variation in their game that disrupts his rhythm. Brooksby is one of those players, and is in slightly better form than Kecmanovic, so I&#x27;m surprised to see Paul be a slightly smaller favorite here. I like the home player to move on in straight sets and get one step closer to a potential second title here.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s Event:** ACL | Pohang Steelers vs Gamba Osaka | 11:00 GMT +2

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Gamba Osaka or Draw + BTTS:NO@2.69 (Betsmith) | **Stake: 1.5u**

**Write Up**:

I’m really not super sure about this game, but it definitely isn’t smelling of a lot of goals. Pohang Steelers ended the season with only 3 of their last 21 games seeing more than three goals… They also only scored in four of their last nine games and saw three wins from the last league games. It doesn’t look like they have lost any important players since last season.

Gamba Osaka has the benefit of having a competitive game under the belt in 2026, but it did end in disappointing fashion as they could not score against CIty rivals Cerezo, despite their opponent having player sent off in the 1st half. Gamba lacks a special player that can open things up when the opponent sits back and defends, it ended up just being a bunch of sideways passes outside of the box. 

Gamba with a new manager in both meanings of the word, as this is also his first professional manager job. I think he might be a bit more careful here and be happy enough with a draw in the away leg and do the job at home next week. I was originally going to do Gamba draw no bet, but the odds have been sliced too much. My guess is 0-0 or 1-0 for the guests.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Arsenal to Win + Brentford over 2.5 Total Corners - 2.05 (Bet365)

*Recap: I was too ambitious. Leipzig never stood a chance.*

Write Up:

Back to Ol&#x27; reliable. Arsenal. They need every single point they can get to keep their title dreams alive and with City only 3 points behind, Arsenal  have a fire lit up their arse. Brentford is a good opponent and will have some decent chances (which is why I took their corners) but in the end, I think Arsenal will be able to edge out a win.

Saka is injured so that&#x27;s an important thing to consider however, I think Arsenal can make do with who they have available rn.

City have cut the lead down to 3 points and as obvious as that is a kick up the a for Arsenal the squad depth they&#x27;ve conjured will show here. They had an underwhelming away game against Forest which they rectified against Leeds last away day where they got 7 corners first half and 12 total. I expect a similar setup here as a win tomorrow puts them in prime position to make the lead 9 by midweek, regardless of whether or not they win corners are key part of Arsenals game away from home this season and I see them utilizing them well to breakdown Brentfords structure.

AARHUS VS MIDTJYLLAND

Date: 12 FEBRUARY 2026 at 19:00

BET ON: Asian handicap- AARHUS +0.00

Odd: 1.89



\- AGF’s motivation edge in this first cup semi-final is grounded not just in form but in mindset. Jakob Poulsen has repeatedly stressed the importance of consistency, mental sharpness and belief in his press interactions — emphasising that his side must “play their game and stay focused for all 90 minutes” and not assume anything is won before it’s earned, even against elite opposition. This reflects a clear tactical identity: Poulsen’s 3-4-3/3-5-2 setup is built around controlled possession, progressive wide play and overloads in transition, which has historically allowed AGF to generate superior expected-goals metrics against Midtjylland at Ceres Park. Meanwhile, FC Midtjylland arrive weakened defensively, with key defender Mads Bech out 4–6 weeks, and additional players sick or doubtful — a major disruption to their back line stability. The Wolves’ coach and leadership have talked more about survival and managing energy than domination — an indirect admission that FCM might be cautious away from home and prioritise avoiding defeat to take a result back to Herning. Danish coverage has highlighted Midtjylland’s reliance on structure and set-pieces rather than fluent attacking play recently, especially when missing personnel, while Poulsen’s setup is proactively constructed to exploit those exact weaknesses. With AGF chasing a historic first cup win in 30 years and visibly buoyed by their resilient late victory over OB — where substitutes changed the game — the psychological and tactical groundwork strongly supports AGF avoiding defeat, making +0.00 a convincing angle going into this semi-final tie.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Alex De Minaur total games u12.5 vs Stan Wawrinka (-104 odds via FD) 1U

Event: ATP Rotterdam Round of 16 7:30 A.M. CST

ADM came out with a very tough R1 matchup here in Rotterdam against Arthur Fils but his overwhelming consistency and strong baseline game took care of business. In his next match, I&#x27;m expecting a pretty straightforward match here against a player well past his prime in Wawrinka. Not much of a H2H here with ADM winning the only meeting between these two with ease. This matchup took place in 2024 on clay where Stans game actually has been pretty solid but now, indoors, this should suit ADM much nicer. De Minaur has been playing exceptional tennis lately with his only loss in his last 8 appearances coming to Carlos Alcaraz. In the last two years in this event, his losses have came to Alcaraz and Sinner, which tells us he feels pretty comfortable in these conditions unless he is playing top class players, which Wawrinka is not anymore. Give me a straight forward win for the world number 8.

**Write Up:** I&#x27;m back! Bit sweaty on the O&#x27;Sullivan <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> but he cashes us nonetheless. Took a break for a bit - as a Seahawks fan I couldn&#x27;t be happier! Feeling good after the break lets get back to cashing some lays.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Todays pick</mark> goes to the Switzerland Super League, FC Thun (1st) face off against Lausanne (7th), Thun are the home team here with a total record of 7-1-3 (W/D/L) but most recently winning their last 6 home fixtures. On the other hand are Lausanne going 3-4-4, recent away form of 2-2-2. Thun are simply in too good form for Lausanne, only losing 5 of their 23 fixtures and with the home advantage, coming in on a 7 game win streak and Lausanne winless in 3 I think the quality gap will see Thun through for another 3 points. 

For the second leg O2.5 goals we have seen this in the last 7 head-to-head fixtures, Thun have seen this hit in the last SEVEN games. The away team have hit this 3/6 last matchups. Another good substitute for this line would be BTTS as Thun have gone 7/7 and Lausanne have gone 5/6 last fixtures, with 6/7 last head-to-heads. Given both of these lines have a good hit rate, in addition to both of their attacking form being relatively decent (despite Lausanne&#x27;s results) I do see both teams scoring and both of these lines clearing with somewhat ease. I&#x27;m going to go with a 2-1 Thun dub.

Last Five Predictions (Old - New): ✅ ✅❌ ✅❌

Net Units: +14.77

Yesterday&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Esbjerg to win and u3.5 total goals v Middelfart. 4u @ $2.5❌

Absolute goal fest. Yikes. Esbjerg won by over the 3.5 goal threshold. Annoyed at myself for not going ML, but can&#x27;t say I was expecting two pens in the second half.  
  
Good job to those who read the analysis and went ML. 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Merthyr Town vs South Shields BTTS and o2.5 3u @ $1.80

Not a lot I like <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, so I picked this—keep that in mind. 

Don&#x27;t have much time <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> to do a full write-up, but here&#x27;s the thinking behind the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. 

\- Two of the top five scoring teams in the league  
\- While South Shields have been the best defensive side in the league by a long way, they&#x27;ve conceded in their last two league games, and last three games in all comps.   
\- Merthyr games seem to have a LOT of goals in them... along with being one of the top attacking sides, they&#x27;ve also conceded the second most goals in the league  
  
Now, South burned my a couple of days ago, so I guess we&#x27;ll see.</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>POTD Record: 150-102 | Profit: +99.52u | ROI: 13.7%

Season Record: 10-6 | Profit: +12.26u | ROI: 22.3%

 

Last Pick: LA Lakers -7.0 vs Charlotte Hornets @ 1.91. 3U. ✅

Another game spread, another strong team at closing out games, and another win. That’s two game spreads in a row, let’s try to make it three! That also brings up 150 <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> wins!

 

Next <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **Toronto Raptors -9.5 vs Brooklyn Nets @ 1.91**. 3U play.

It might surprise you to hear that the Nets have lost 4 out of their last 5 games by 16 or more points. They are also 1-9 SU this season and will continue to be without their primary scorer, Cam Thomas. This squad doesn’t really have a playmaker and doesn’t really have a scorer, two things that are kind of important in this sport. The Raptors meanwhile coming off a loss against the 76ers, a team they typically struggle against, but they had 4 wins prior to it, covering their spread in each of those. With Jakob Poeltl returning, the Raptors are at full strength here and I think they’re finally starting to show some promise with their starting 5 getting some minutes together. Let’s go Raptors!</td></tr>

Previous: **Celta Vigo v Barcelona: BTTS @1.45**✅️

Todays <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: **Stockport County FC v Wigan Athletic EFL Trophy: Stockport County DC &amp; u3.5 goals @1.82**

With qualification still hanging in the balance in Northern Section Group A, Stockport County host Wigan Athletic at Edgeley Park on Tuesday in what’s effectively a knockout clash for both sides. Stockport sit second with three points — a win guarantees progression, while a draw might be enough depending on results elsewhere. Wigan, meanwhile, are winless and need a two-goal victory plus a Salford win to stay alive.

Dave Challinor’s men were humbled 3–0 by Luton at the weekend, missing a penalty and seeing red, but that blip shouldn’t overshadow their recent form. Prior to that, they’d won four straight, conceding just once, and they’ve been solid at home, unbeaten in seven at Edgeley Park. Stockport’s previous EFL Trophy outing was a 3–1 loss to Salford, but their earlier 5–3 win over Wolves U21s shows they can score freely when needed. Expect a more disciplined, controlled performance this time as progression is at stake.

Ryan Lowe’s side face a mountain to climb. They’ve lost both Trophy matches 2–0 against Salford and 2–1 to Wolves U21s and have only managed two wins in their last ten overall. Goals have been the issue, as Wigan haven’t scored more than once in any of those ten games. Their away record against Stockport is dire, with no win since 1982, and Stockport have made Edgeley Park a fortress this season.

Stockport have more momentum, home advantage, and scoring depth. Wigan’s lack of cutting edge and poor away form make it unlikely they can win by the margin they need. Stockport’s steady defense and Wigan’s goal struggles point to a low-scoring affair. Stockport are likely to secure progression with a draw or narrow win.

Best of luck.</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>Record: 160-137, -0.89 units

Last Pick: Antoine Ghibaudo ML vs Clement Chidekh (-122, 1 unit): Win

Tennis | Montevideo Challenger | 11:30 AM EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Roman Andres Burruchaga vs Federico Agustin Gomez | **Burruchaga ML at -200 (BetRivers). 2 units.**

Write-up: Not sure how to feel about that <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. In terms of CLV, it was one of my worst picks ever, as Ghibaudo was pushed all the way up to +144 by the market before the match. However, it was somewhat redeemed by the result, as Ghibaudo came back from being an early break down to secure a 2-0 win. In general, it obviously wasn&#x27;t the greatest play, and I think I should have been more careful about analyzing how the player (particularly Chidekh) had recently been priced by the market.

South American clay has always been Roman Burruchaga&#x27;s favorite surface, and he&#x27;s shown that over the past few months. In 6 SA clay tournaments since the US Open, Burruchaga has captured two titles (with just one set dropped between them), and gone 6/6 in first-round matches. Here in Montevideo, his history is mixed, as he defeated Tirante and Guillen Meza to reach the quarterfinals in 2023, but suffered a tough first-round loss in 2024. Still, Gomez has only played one career match here in 2024, in which he won just two games in the first round against Gustavo Heide. 

Gomez, a talented player who has consistently battled injuries throughout his career, has had a tough run as of late. Fede has suffered a tough third-set loss in the first round of three consecutive tournaments, despite none of the draws he faced being particularly tough. In general, a lot of Gomez&#x27;s best results this season of actually come on hard courts, where his aggressive game can shine and his lack of fitness can be masked to some extent. However, that lack of fitness was actually brought to the fore in the first round of the US Open, where he actually gave Jack Draper a run for his money but ended up gassing out in the fourth set.

I considered taking the 2-0 here, but I decided that I preferred the ML odds instead. Still, I think that Burruchaga has the game to dominate this one from the start. The sun will be shining, as temperatures are expected to climb above 28 degrees Celsius, and wind gusts will reach above 20 mph, which should have some impact on Gomez&#x27;s signature serve and forehand combination. To me, someone like Burruchaga, who plays with heavy topspin and can extend rallies at will, is simply not the type of player Gomez wants to face right now.

For the odds analysis, we actually have a pretty good comparison match: both players faced off against Juan Pablo Varillas last week in Lima, and while Gomez was priced at around even money (3-set loss, 7.21 performance rating), Burruchaga&#x27;s ML closed at around -333, which implies that he should be closer to that number in this encounter (he did indeed end up winning 6-3, 6-2, with an 8.27/10). Burruchaga was similarly priced in the next round against Alvaro Guillen Meza, who I believe is in better form than Gomez, although he ended up losing that in 3 (7.12/10). Finally, Teelo&#x27;s model gives Roman a 70.3% chance of winning this, which is higher than the 67.43% implied by his ML odds. 

If the market ends up hating this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> as much as my last one, I might have to take a break for a bit. However, I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m expecting that, and the combination of value and risk level makes this a 2-unit play for me.

<tr><td class='post'>CBB record: 5-1

Last pick: Western Carolina Team Total Under 58.5 ✅ 

Event CBB: Kentucky vs Louisville 8PM Eastern Time

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **Ortega Oweh Over 18.5pts** (-118 Fanduel)

Back with another player prop. The UK/Louisville rivalry game is expected to be extremely high scoring. The Over/Under is currently 173 and opened at 169.

Ortega Oweh is the returning top scorer from last years Kentucky team. Oweh cleared this 18.5 line in 7 of his last 11 games last season. Of those 11 games he cleared the line 7/8 games in which he played 26+ minutes. 

With it being a rivalry game and spread being only 3.5 and an O/U of 173 i expect the high scoring and close game and can almost guarantee he will play those 26+mins. More like 32+ imo.

Also, Louisville just allowed 2 different guards for 276th ranked Jackson St go for 20pts &amp; 22pts on a combined 60% FG. Another guard also went for 18pts in the same game. It seems like Louisville will struggle to guard the perimeter players against Kentucky.

Take Ortega Oweh Over 18.5pts</td></tr>

East Kilbride are the favourites here, however they&#x27;re already qualified and will advance so Celtic should be scoring here even easier as they&#x27;ve done that on all teams they played so far. East Kilbride have allowed goals to the weakest teams in this cup as they beat Hearts B 3-2, Motherwell B 3-1 (the only goal that Motherwell scored in this cup).</td></tr>

Write up: 

Jalen Johnson has been a real solid and consistent player as of late and has goes up against a solid defense of the Detroit Pistons. Despite this, 42.5 is a seriously underplaced line at 42.5 with Jalen Johnson with at least 49 pra or more in the last 5 games including an away game at Detroit where he had 49 pra despite coming off a double OT game from the previous night and on the road. With Trae Young still out, it leaves the main ballhandling opportunities in the hand of NAW, Dyson Daniels, and JJ and it seems that JJ has been taking more and more on this role as of late. Kristaps Prozingis has also been ruled out for this game leaving most of the defensive rebounding opportunities open for Jalen Johnson. Have played this line as a straight the last 4 games and I’m sure he’ll keep this hot streak up, BOL. </td></tr>

Write-Up: Spirit are on a 6 game win streak whereas Venom have won 1/6. They just met last week Friday 5 December where Spirit dismantled them 93 - Venom 58. I think the spread is still “moderate” despite the thrashing as Venom will be playing at home this time, and will have Ashley Arlen suiting up to make her debut (as an injury replacement player).</td></tr>

Write up:

Coming back with yet another soccer <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> as this tends to be my bread and butter. Angers are 3-2-2 at home this year, with their losses and draws coming against much better teams (Lens and Monaco being the main 2). They&#x27;re 3-0-2 in their last 5 with the losses against much better squads in Lens and Lille. 

Nantes have been very poor this season, just 1-3-3 away from home this season and 0-2-3 in their last 5 games. 

While both teams have only scored 13 goals each in Ligue 1 this season, Angers have conceded 7 less in the competition. See them winning 1-0 or 2-0, something along those lines.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: **G2 MINNESOTA MAP 2 WINNER (-138) VS. BOSTON BREACH.** 

**2u**

write up: 

The Call of Duty league is back, and I think this season, in particular, so far, has been easier to predict than previous years. I am hoping for some beginner&#x27;s luck, but I don&#x27;t think I will need it with this one. 

This line is the result of the new COD being released in the last month, team changes happening, new game mechanics, etc.

We have already seen some action this season, so I could give some data to make my picks, but the reality is, if you have ever heard of the game mode search &amp; destroy, that is what map 2 is in the CDL game mode wise. 

In the one search and destroy Boston has played this year, they lost it to the Carolina Royal Ravens, who are not a very good team at the moment, 6-5. In the three SNDs G2 has played this year, they have won two and lost to the reigning world champs 6-4 in an extremely close game.

On top of that, G2 has the second-highest Search &amp; destroy Kill death ratio in the league and historically, have very good SND specialists like Estreal, Kremp had a 1.11 KD last season, Skyz(former world champion) and a really talented rookie in Mamba. While Boston has Snoopy who was a top 5 SND player, the rest of the team around him is incredibly mid at SND, Cammy and Nastie were ranked 40 and 41 out of 70 in KD last season, and Purj was ranked 59th. Compared to g2: Mamba(6th in a small sample size), Kremp(13th last season, 1st this year) Estreal(33rd), Skyz(56th). 

  
I am going to say don&#x27;t max bet this one. I would be comfortable around two-three units because it is still a brand new season, and things can get flukey, though this season is easier to predict because the game has a movement skill gap.

  
Lol I hope this made sense, not always easy writing about cod cause most people have no clue what I am talking about.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s Event:** Spanish La Liga | Real Sociedad vs Girona (12:00PM PST)

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Mikel Oyarzabal to Score or Give Assist (+100) 1.0 unit to win 1 unit

**Write Up:** Malen had a duck of a game. Couldn&#x27;t control the ball whenever it made it to him. Fluke bad game or bad read on my part, either way we move on. 

Not a ton of games <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, but I do like this bottom table La Liga matchup. Oyarzabal has been on a year lately, scoring or assisting in 4/4 last La Liga games. He is really the best player on Real Sociedad, takes penalties, and has played all 90 minutes for the last 10/10 matches. Sociedad is not in any sort of European competition this year and the team has been in good form, so I suspect we will see a heavy dose of Oyarzabal. 

Girona have been very poor this season. They have not held a clean sheet in an away match all season and have kept only 2 clean sheets all year, both at home. Fresh off a 3-0 loss away at Elche, I expect Girona to struggle here again. 

I thought about taking ATGS straight here, but Oyarzabal has 2 assists in his last 3 matches and I like the odds at even money here to buy it down and give us both options to cash. 

BOL and happy Friday!</td></tr>

🌶️ Overall: 52-32-1 

2026 PDC 🎯 World Championships: 1-0

Previous: 

Madars Razma (-161) v Jamai van den Herik ✅ 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Mervyn King (+120) v Ian White

Razma takes care of business for us on Day 1, winning 3-1, but with all but one set going down to that pivotal 5th leg. Even with a less-than-stellar performance, Madars turned it on down the stretch and advances to the next round. 

Here on Day 2 I am dead set on playing a slight underdog - really like the current world #125 Mervyn “The King” King to defeat current world #51 Ian “Diamond” White.

Do not be fooled by the current world ranking disparity here - King has a plethora of experience at the highest levels of darts, albeit some time ago. King reached the World Championship SF &amp; was Premier League runner up in 2009. More recently, King had his best PDC ranked finish at the 2021 Masters, a darts major, ultimately losing 8-11 in the Finals to Jonny Clayton. 

Since 2021, King took a bit of a hiatus from darts, though he has returned and been grinding hard on the Modus &amp; PDC Tours this year. 

King disclosed this year that a large factor in his hiatus was due to filing bankruptcy, as he owed $500k in unpaid taxes, admitting to reporters he was unaware he needed to pay taxes on his winnings. 

Ian White has been a consistent player on the PDC since 2010, but he has zero televised titles and has not won on the PDC Tour since 2020. White also historically has been solid at scoring, particularly hammering that triple-20, but his finishing has long been his biggest weakness. 

One other point worth noting on the Diamond is that- White has not won a single match on the PDC since October 14 of this year, finishing the tour season with four consecutive first round exits. 

Lastly, since 2021 these two have met three times in ranked matches. In those matches, King is 3-0, winning each 6-0; 6-3; 6-3 respectively. 

I expect more of the same from White in this one, struggling on the outer ring and letting King hang around. Expect King to keep pace on scoring, while punishing White for his finishing mistakes. I believe King still has tremendous talent, and entering with a bit of a chip on his shoulder, will prove it to the darts world <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.</td></tr>

Leonard got completely destroyed and her performance was awful. A bad look on my end as two previous tournament wins probably made her a bit more tired than usual and not so invested in Limoges. Sorry to those who tailed these last two losses.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** **Kalinina vs Parks - Kalinina Handicap -2 Games @ 1.89**

Kalinina appears in this tournament after a long break, and she impressed me quite a lot when she faced Kartal, showing solid groundstrokes from both sides and a gigantic clutch ability when it came to saving break points. While it&#x27;s true that Kartal had the chance to dominate the first set, it was clear that Kalinina stepped up after breaking back, and her typical &quot;warrior&quot; mentality ended up being the main difference. She&#x27;s not the most flashy player you&#x27;ll see, but she plays simple and efficient tennis. 

When it comes to Parks, I was expecting much more from her in Angers, but she had an awful match against Korpatsch, where she lost on her own with unforced errors and a low first serve percentage. While I recognize that Parks can play well on this surface when her serve is on fire, things quickly change when that particular weapon is not on point. I feel like any player who&#x27;s a decent returner can really punish Parks on the second serve and just keep the point alive until she makes an unforced error. 

Kalinina is known for always trying to stay on each rally and produce sharp angles, especially from the forehand. This playstyle is usually a good recipe to beat someone like Parks, who is currently 0-3 against Kalinina, with each loss happening on a different surface (Hard, Clay, and Grass). The American was never able to take a set from Kalinina.

With the momentum and the confidence of beating someone like Kartal just in the 2nd match since her return, I feel like Kalinina will find a much easier path to victory against Parks.

Good luck!</td></tr>

⚽️Bundesliga, Union Berlin vs RB Leipzig, 12/12/25 Fri, 2:30 pm Eastern Time

Explanation: Leipzig is coming in near top of the standings come with 9 wins, 2 draws, 2 losses and a +15 goal difference (28 scored, 13 conceded) through 13 games, while Union is not doing too well in 12th place, with just 4 wins, 3 draws, 6 losses and a negative goal difference. Also Berlin is in bad form losing there last 3 while Leipzig has won 3 of there last 4 with a draw as there non win.

Leipzig is generating about 1.77 expected goals for (xG) per game and allowing only 1.39 xG against, so they consistently create more and better chances than they concede, whereas Union are around 1.3 xG for and 1.5 xG against. 

Also, Leipzig is averaging roughly 16–17 shots per match compared to Union’s 12, which matters because over 90 minutes that shooting volume plus higher xG per shot tends to translate into at least one or two “big” chances created, which is crucial to score the goals necessary to win. 

Leipzig’s high-tempo, vertical attacking style,  pressing and pace in transition are exactly the recipe for them to win this match.</td></tr>

My theory was correct but maybe my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> was flawed. Littler came out to a slow start, and the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> looked good with only 1 180 in the first set, however, Labansuskas put up way more of a fight than I expected giving Littler more legs with darts in his hands, leading to too many chances for 180’s.

Event: PDC World Championship (Darts) : Niels Zonneveld v. Haupai Puha 7:30am EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Niels Zonneveld -1.5 (-130), 2u to win 1.5u

Write Up: Puha has not looked good recently, losing his last 6 matches all by a good chunk. Zonneveld is coming off a loss to Nick Kenny in the players championship finals, however he averaged a 92.41 in that match and had 19 100+ throws in 10 legs. Zonneveld was just unable to hit his doubles, which I think will be corrected coming into the World Championship. Zonneveld and Puha have gone H2H twice this year, 6-1 Zonneveld and 5-6 Puha. However I feel Puha’s downtrend and Zonneveld’s consistency could allow Zonneveld to even take this match in straight sets.</td></tr>

**Last:** (CBB) North Carolina -3.5 (1.5u) - L

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** (CBB) No. 16 Illinois (-1) at No. 19 Iowa State 

**Start Time:** 12:00 PM ET (FOX)

**Odds:** -114 (ProphetX)

**Units:** 1.5U

**Reasoning:** You can put lipstick on a pig, but at the end of the day, it’s still a pig.

In the same vein, although first-year head coach Ben McCollum has added a breath of fresh air for Iowa basketball, it doesn’t take away from the fact that facing Illinois has been his team’s House of Horrors as of late. Not only have the Hawkeyes (12-3) dropped four-straight games in the series—all by double digits—the team has only managed to register one win over the last 10 meetings. Did we also forget to mention that McCollum’s squad hasn’t defeated a ranked opponent since the 2023-24 season? 

Don’t expect that to change on Sunday afternoon.

Through 15 games, the Illini (12-3) boast one of the more lethal offensive attacks in the country. The unit ranks 2nd in offensive efficiency (1.242), 27th in scoring (86.7 PPG), 56th in field-goal percentage (47.6%) and 125th in three-point shooting (34.8%). More impressive, Illinois possesses four players who average at least 12.5 points per game—tied for the national lead. Although Iowa’s defense can counter with impressive rankings of its own—2nd in scoring defense (60.8 PPGA), 12th in defensive efficiency (0.919), 38th in opponent three-point shooting (29.9%) and 98th in opponent field-goal percentage (42.6%)—has the unit truly been tested? In fact, in six games against opponents who rank in the Top 150 in offensive efficiency, the Hawkeyes went just 3-3 while conceding 67.7 points per game with all but one of those opponents shooting better than 46% from the floor. 

Where the game truly will be decided will be on the other end of the floor. 

Iowa enters this matchup with a stellar offensive unit of its own, ranking 5th in field-goal percentage (51.9%), 10th in offensive efficiency (1.206), 24th in three-point shooting (37.5%) and 91st in scoring (79.8 PPG). The team is led by senior Bennett Stirtz (18.0 PPG, 5.0 APG), who has topped the 20-point mark a team-high seven times, including in each of his last three outings. However, after him…there’s nothing else. Literally. 

That should make the job a little easier for a stingy Illini defense that has been flying under the radar.

Thus far, the unit ranks 20th in opponent field-goal percentage (39.4%), 33rd in scoring defense (67.3 PPGA), 41st in defensive efficiency (0.964) and 65th in opponent three-point shooting (30.9%). Those numbers have shrunk even further over Illinois’ four-game winning streak, dropping to just 55.7 points per game on 33.8% shooting from the floor and 24.1% from beyond the arc. More impressively, Zvonimir Ivisic has made his presence known inside the paint, ranking third in the nation in block percentage, including blocking 11 shots in just 53 minutes over his last three outings. 

Backed by a raucous home crowd and seeking a true statement-making victory, expect the Hawkeyes to keep it close. However, trust the Illini’s depth and elite playmaking on both sides of the ball to be the difference in this one.

**EVENT:**  NFL: Los Angeles Chargers @ New England Patriots

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Stefon Diggs over 55.5 receiving yards @ 1.87 (5 units)

**Write Up:** In the 2025 regular season, Stefon Diggs led the Patriots in every major receiving category, finishing the season with team highs in receiving yards (1,013), targets (102), receptions (85), and receiving yards per game (59.6), making him the clear #1 target in this New England Patriots offence.

Diggs has a career post-season average of 64.9 yards per game. He&#x27;s covered this line in every game in this 2025 season where he had at least 6 receptions. He&#x27;s averaged 5 receptions per game this year, but in high-stakes playoff games, QBs tend to lean on their most trusted guys, which pushes that players&#x27; usage toward the higher end of their normal range.

The Chargers have an elite quarterback in Justin Herbert who has the ability and experience to make life difficult for the young Maye. I expect the New England sophomore to trust his most reliable and dangerous weapon in this contest between two of the leagues&#x27; top passing talents. Diggs should cover this line comfortably.</td></tr>

Event: Bills vs. Jaguars, 1pm

Reasoning: The Jaguars are bottom third in the league in tight end defense. They’re second worst in targets per game with 8.7, sixth worst in receptions per game with 6.1, and tenth worst in yards per game with 59.1. As for Knox, his usage went up dramatically in the second half of the season. He’s covered 20+ yards in eight of the last ten games, averaging 2.8 receptions and 32.9 yards during that time.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Patriots -3.5 (-110) | 2 units**

**Write Up:**

This <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> comes from EdgeBetAI - a model that analyzes 30+ factors per game including rest, travel, weather, coaching matchups, injuries, motivation, and playoff dynamics.

**Why Patriots -3.5:**

Our model projects Patriots 18-13 (Patriots -5 internal line). Getting Patriots at -3.5 gives us **1.5 points of cushion** on our projection.

**Key factors:**

* Both teams missing key players (updated Sunday injury reports)
* Home playoff advantage for Patriots
* Chargers road struggles in cold weather environments
* Low-scoring defensive game expected (model projects 31 total vs Vegas 45.5)
* Justin Herbert QB advantage over Drake Maye, but coaching edge to Patriots

**Model Note:** Saturday&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> Bears +1.5 won (Bears 31-27 outright). Model now 45-34 ATS (57.0%). Updated injury data Saturday morning moved edges 1+ point on multiple games.

Write Up: Arsenal travel to Portsmouth sitting top of the league and a 0-0 against Liverpool. 
Reason I like this play: Portsmouth have scored 21 league goals in 24 games. Arsenal has conceded 14 goals in 21 league games. 

Portsmouth have a packed treatment room at present, which got fuller this week when midfielder Mark Kosznovszky was ruled out long-term with a serious ACL injury, while centre-backs Hayden Matthews (ankle) and Josh Knight (back) have missed recent matches and will do so again here.

For this reason and arsenals complete dominance I will be taking BOTH TEAMS TO SCORE : NO</td></tr>

I am, again, going with this riskier bet. This time because Barcelona are more fresh coming into this game and simply because ML and &#x27;to win the cup&#x27; are already picked by others. Plus I want to watch this game the most out of all <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>

Mbappe is out and Real Madrid were lucky Atletico didn&#x27;t manage to get a draw or more from their semi final

Barcelona lost the earlier El Classico this season in which they were in a slump and away from home

**NFL - LA Chargers @ New England, 8:15 EST, NBC/Peacock**

***Omarion Hampton o11.5 Rush Att (-120) 1.25u***

Day 4 of our 5 day football adventure takes us to Sunday Night at Foxboro, as the Patriots host the Chargers.

I’m gonna get this one out of the way: *as of the time of writing, Omarion Hampton is still listed as* ***questionable*** - so if you are the type of person who isn’t a fan of having their money held up, or hate being in limbo - ***don’t tail this***.

That said, if you’re like me and you love some high upside suspense, this is your <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> - **Hampton said Thursday that “the plan” is to play tonight**, *he was a DNP early in the week* **but did have limited involvement with a brace later in week, taking strides** - the way the Chargers rushing game run evolved over the season (I’m an OG certified Vidal Stan) ***there’s not much trust in anybody but him***.

Jim Harbaugh is also not an idiot, winter football in the North-East is going to require a running game, and if your running back is going to be effective, you can’t have him sitting on the sidelines or simply blocking, not getting genuine, rushing touches - **I have also held the card that they’re possibly playing it a bit strategic not changing his injury status.**

The time off and the fact it’s a local time night game &amp; not a day game, means **more time to adjust and kill the pain**, even if it’s “colder” - it’s January in New England, the temperatures don’t flux that much, and it’s also not going to be insanely cold

As the data shows, he’s their man since his late start to the season: **Hampton has covered this 7 in a row &amp; 8/9 on the season**, the Chargers have leaned on him to open up the passing game with **14.5 rush attempts in the last 4 games** - I figure even if he’s playing at 70 to 80%, the Chargers are going to try to get him involved as much as possible, as they don’t seem to trust Vidal anymore.

Now, *the Patriots run defence is strong, they’re 6th best in the NFL in rushing yards*, but they’ve been leaky over the last few weeks, **giving up over 140 rush yards a game**, in some playoff type atmosphere matchups, and all ironically since their bye week. **The break may have broke their defensive rhythm**, and I expect the Chargers to use this to get Herbert more opportunities to get the passing game evolved

**I honestly expect Hampton to get a good solid amount of runs early in the game**, to see both if his injury is healed well, and also how effective they can be in a “trenchy” playoff situation - contrary to popular belief, **the Chargers run the ball 10th most attempts wise, and 12th on yards per game in the NFL**. It’s not elite, but it’s a tool in their repertoire where many people think they’re an outright pass first team - that’s Harbaugh.

As I’ve mentioned before, there seems to be a lack of trust in the Chargers other running backs, and if they’re going to get anything out of their passing game, they’re going to need to have the ability to make New England guess what’s coming. **If Hampton is in anyway shape or form healthy, he’s going to be involved enough to cover this number**.

Last play review:

**NFL - Kyren Williams 70+ All Purpose Yards/Caleb Williams 175+ Pass Yards** ✅

(Both scripts went to plan, Kyren grinded out his yards and got a receiving touchdown to cover this for us, meanwhile, Caleb Williams covered the yards well before the final drive, but that was essentially how I expected the game to go - really worked out well, even if it was a bit sweaty on the Kyren end)

**🏀 Toumani Camara o13.5 Points -114** vs the New York Knicks

This <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> is about as good as it gets on paper. Camara is fresh off a 25 point game against a good defense in the Rockets. In fact, he&#x27;s cashed this line in L5/5. 

He&#x27;s averaging 17.6 points on 36.8 minutes a game in his L5. That kind of minutes usage is a huge plus.

Against the Knicks, he&#x27;s cashed this in L2/2 The Knicks defense lately has been awful. They&#x27;re ranked 28th overall in Defensive Rating and specifically to SFs, they&#x27;re ranked 21st in Points allowed.

I&#x27;m loving Camara&#x27;s role on this Blazers team and off his minutes usage and recent numbers, this play looks excellent.

Past 5: ✅

Event: Real Madrid vs Barcelona 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Barcelona ML @2.0 (Bet365). Placing 1U on this to win 1U. 

Write Up: Barcelona go into <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>’s El Clásico full of belief and momentum — they were absolutely superb in their recent matchup against Athletic Bilbao, blowing them away with a dominant performance that saw Barça run riot and comfortably book their spot in the Supercopa final with a convincing win. Meanwhile, Real Madrid’s last outing, despite the win over Atlético Madrid, saw them persistently outplayed and dominated in key areas by Atlético, who controlled possession and territory for long spells but just couldn’t finish their chances, leaving Madrid’s performance looking far from convincing. Even if Madrid might have Kylian Mbappé available <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> after a knee injury, it’s his first match back from injury — so it’s uncertain whether he’ll start or how long he’ll be on the pitch, which could blunt Madrid’s attacking threat early on. All of that, plus Barcelona’s recent confidence and their knack for rising in big games against Real (including last season’s Supercopa success), gives Barça the edge to control this one and come out on top <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.  

Note: I’m specifically choosing Bet365 as they have a feature for early cashout, regardless of final outcome of the game, if your team goes 2 goals up so strongly recommend to do similar in case this game gets cagey close.</td></tr>

Gil Vicente U19 - Porto U19 ⚽ Portugal ⏳in 6 Hour

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: 2.5 Goals Over @ 1.60

Porto U19, by far the league&#x27;s top-scoring team, has found the net 61 times in their last 17 matches, achieving an incredible goal average of 3.59 per game. This statistic alone is a strong guarantee of a high-scoring match. Looking at Porto&#x27;s away record, they have scored 32 goals in 8 away games (an average of 4 goals per game), demonstrating their undiminished attacking prowess. Furthermore, the home side, Gil Vicente, currently second in the league, also has the potential to score at home, and the fact that their first-half match ended 3-0 (again, with over 2.5 goals) suggests that offense, not defense, will be the deciding factor in this encounter. Therefore, with Porto&#x27;s high tempo and Gil Vicente&#x27;s efforts to react, it&#x27;s highly likely that at least three goals will be scored.</td></tr>

Start Time &amp; TV 4:30pm EST (FOX)

Units: 4.25 Units

Reasoning: For <mark style='background:#fff59d'>todays pick</mark> of the day I like taking the points with the San Francisco 49ers (12-5) as they take on the Philadelphia Eagles (11-6) in the first round of the playoffs. One of my main reasons for this is because the Eagles offense has been very lethargic this year as they rank in the bottom half of the league in passing yards (23rd), rushing yards (18th), and points per game (19th) while this 49ers offense is 6th in the league in passing yards per game throwing for 255 yards per game, their backfield with Christian McCaffrey is dynamic in the running game and passing game as he has over 1200 rushing yards and 10 rushing touchdowns to go along with over 900 receiving yards and 7 receiving touchdowns and they are outscoring the Eagles in terms of points per game. I also believe that Christian McCaffrey and Brian Robinson will have a productive day running the ball against this Eagles defense as this Philadelphia run defense has been gashed on the ground this year as they rank 22nd in the league in rushing yards allowed per game allowing 125 rush yards per contest. The 49ers have a big edge in quarterback play as Brock Purdy ranks 3rd in EPA and 1st in the league in qualified quarterbacks in success rate while Jalen Hurts ranks 18th in EPA and 25th in success rate which contributes to the Eagles having the highest three and out rate in the league at 28.1%. The 49ers also rank 4th in offensive DVOA at 18.9% while the Eagles rank 27th in DVOA at 8.9%. With all of this in mind I like taking the 49ers getting 6 points on the spread here in this one.

Prediction: 24-22 49ers

**Read**: After a month break I am ready to get the year started here. I have seen this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> throughout the thread already. Not much else to add but more a reiteration of the same. Barca killed Bilbao and many of their stars had minutes managed and they also played a day earlier than Real Madrid did. This is nothing but positive for Barca. I expect them to even the score from the last time these teams faced each other where Barca fell short away at the Bernabeu. Madrid wanted that one more and eventually they had to get Barca back after getting BTA for the previous four straight matchups in a row. Not long ago fans were considering Barca as one of if not the best team in Europe. I believe they are back to that standard and it will show <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> and over the next month or so just like last season. Madrid have been subpar defensively and seemed to rely on talent more than cohesiveness as a team to score goals. Barca has improved defensively not conceding in five straight games while still being the most productive attack in football. 

Back Barca. BOL. </td></tr>

Write up: I simply can’t fathom Josh Allen not making a run for the bowl this year. The big 3 of AFC QBs including his kryptonite Mahomes aren’t in the playoffs. There’s simply not an excuse for Allen to not make a run. If he wants to be an all time great these are the games he needs to win. No disrespect to TLaw but he flat out can’t lose to him. I’m simply riding the better QB here with something to prove. I imagine this will be a grind but it’s plus money for a reason. Great QBs simply find ways to win and I expect nothing less here. Jacksonville is a good team but they aren’t battle tested yet. The Bills are a playoff regular and shouldn’t have much trouble getting adjusted on the road. I’m choosing to back the MVP here in a playoff setting without his 3 biggest threats. Let me know if you’re tailing as always, appreciate the support and hope you guys are having a fun wildcard weekend. Thanks everyone</td></tr>

Liam Coen definitely seems like he knows what he&#x27;s doing with Jags, as they have bouncebacked dramatically. But in terms of taking a side you always want to talk about dogs. Since 2017, they are 60-38 ATS good for 61%, and in the wildcard round even better at 64%. As a Bills fan, Josh Allen&#x27;s team is not built for the playoffs, but regardless he is 5-8 ATS in his playoff career, and yes on the road in the playoffs, it&#x27;s pretty embarassing 0-4 SU AND 0-4 ATS. This Jags team is just white hot right now, they have won and covered 8 straight games and are 8-0 ATS in those games. They have also scored more than 23 points and have allowed 20 or less points in 6 straight games, which sounds insane now that i have realized that. The Ref for this game will be Brad Allen, Favs and home teams with him as the official are 5-1 SU in the playoffs. I have the Jags winning by 4 in this game which is a crazy number but the Bills and Josh Allen have not been good on the road so it makes sense, it will be a tough atmosphere to play in.

* United showed last game before he got into foul trouble that theyre intent on making him a bigger focus on offense. They went down to him early and he was aggressive. If he stays out of foul trouble, he can easily drop 14+ tonight.
* This should be a high octane game with two high scoring teams with both teams up there in pace - both PPG scored and allowed. Edwards has shown he can stay on the floor in these games, logging big minutes against Illawarra and Brisbane.
* He can also stay on the floor against stretch bigs like he did against Perth and Adelaide.
* With Cooks out, Sydney have a serious rebounding problem in the middle. Edwards can be a rebounding machine, with a season high of 16 and regularly flirting hovering around the 10 reb mark.

Anyways onto our <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, GWEN’S GIRL has begun its preparation this time in with back to back 2nd’s.

The winner of that race has run again and won a high class Saturday race worth $150k, beating a few spruiked horses in the process.    
    
In our race against said horse we were quickly away, however the jockey elected not to cross and we sat outside the leader; coming around the home turn we swung really awkwardly due to the tight track and ended up near the middle of the track, costing us the race. <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> we get a bigger track, and a key jockey change with a great front running jock booked. I expect us to go straight to the front and attempt to keep running the whole way.    
    
Now we do have a threat in the favourite, MEET ME HALFWAY, who will be having its second start here. I expect it gets a perfect run on our back, but I’m hoping we can slip away around the turn and hold on. It is worth nothing that a horse beat it last start who had run 22 times before without winning, and who has subsequently run twice and finished 9th and 10th, so I’m not liking the form. GL</td></tr>

**Event:** Buffalo Bills @ Jacksonville Jaguars

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Jaguars ML

**Write Up:** The matchup specifically favors Jacksonville&#x27;s defensive strengths; while Buffalo relies heavily on NFL rushing leader James Cook, they face a Jaguars unit that has not allowed a single runner to reach 75 yards all season. By effectively neutralizing the Bills&#x27; ground game, Jacksonville can force the game into the hands of Josh Allen, who has historically struggled in this environment.

Furthermore, the situational and health advantages lean heavily toward the home team. History is not on Buffalo&#x27;s side in this scenario, as the Bills have lost eight consecutive road playoff games dating back to 1992, and head coach Sean McDermott remains winless (0-5) on the road in the postseason. This includes a previous wild-card loss in Jacksonville. While Josh Allen is dealing with a sore foot, the Bills&#x27; roster is significantly more depleted, with key defensive starters like linebacker Terrel Bernard and cornerback Maxwell Hairston already ruled out. With Jacksonville boasting a 7-2 home record and a healthy roster peaking at the right time, taking them as a slight underdog or on the moneyline offers excellent value against a Buffalo team that has struggled with consistency and health away from home.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Vegas Golden Knights @ SJ Sharks ML (+145 on BET365 at time of posting), 1U for 2.45U**

**Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> recap:** Well, he got the shots and the power-play time, but Logan Thompson had a great game and only conceded a PP goal, one that Bedard wasn&#x27;t involved in. Such is life. Well, back to it then.

**Write Up:** This is more of a gut <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> than anything else, and there are plenty of reasons not to like it, not the least of which is that *Vegas has won their last 10 matchups against San Jose*, the 2nd longest active winning streak vs. a franchise (the longest is Nashville, also vs. the Sharks), so by all means fade me, but I have this feeling that&#x27;s about to change. Check it out.

1. Both teams will be on back-to-backs, with the Sharks pulling out a 5-4 OT win after erasing 2 2-goal deficits and tying the game in the 3rd with 5 minutes remaining, a big morale boost for sure. Vegas will be coming off an as-of-yet unknown result because their game doesn&#x27;t start for another hour..see where I&#x27;m going here? 

2. Sharks are at home for both, where they&#x27;re 13-8-3, and they&#x27;ll be sleeping in their own beds, whereas Vegas playing away, where they&#x27;re 10-5-6, and will be traveling from home after a game that wraps less than 20 hours before this game starts...see where I&#x27;m going here???

3. Vegas won their last 2 (or 3, depending on tonight), but prior to that they lost 8 of 9. SJ are on a 3-game win streak and won 6 of their last 7. So they&#x27;re trending in different directions.

4. SJ started Nedeljkovic (7-8-2) <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, meaning Askarov (16-10-1) starts tomorrow. They&#x27;re also likely getting 1st-unit PP and top-4 D-man John Klingberg back tomorrow. Vegas, however, is in a bad way, goalie-wise. Newest Golden Knight and presumed r\*pist Carter Hart is week-to-week, and Adin Hill, last year&#x27;s primary starter, is going to be reevaluated Tuesday. They start Schmid (12-4-5) tonight, meaning they probably start 4th-string Lindblom (1-4-2) tomorrow, unless they go back to Schmid who will therefore be playing 2 games in less than 24-hours. Not great.

5. So far this season, SJ has had the 5th-hardest schedule vs. Vegas who&#x27;ve had the 6th-easiest. 

As I said, there are still plenty of reasons not to like this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>: Vegas leads the division, has better overall stats and, as I said, has had SJ&#x27;s number for a while, but there&#x27;s a reason there is only 1 longer active streak between teams, and I&#x27;m calling it now, this one is breaking tomorrow!

**Prop Bonus:** I mean, Macklin Celebrini? Kind of a no-doubter there. He cashed us <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> on 4-SOG (thanks lordestros!) and is on a 13-game, 27-point streak (9G 18A), over 2PPG in that span. On the other side, Mark Stone has points in his last 6 (6G 2A)

Game starts at 1pm EST. Bet 2u

Writeup: This is gonna be a fun one. The Buffalo Bills are taking on the Jacksonville Jaguars for the first game tomorrow. I would not be surprised if the winner of this game goes to the Super Bowl, but I’m giving the edge to the Jags in this one.

The Jags have won 8 straight games and have the highest point differential over those games. They are arguably the hottest team in football right now. They were originally underdogs in this one, but the line has shifted to favor the Jags. Quarterback Trevor Lawrence is looking like his former Clemson self and is playing the best professional ball of his career. He also has a supporting cast around him that has been far better than anyone could have guessed, especially considering both Brian Thomas Jr and Travis Hunter did not pan out like they thought they would. If that wasn’t enough, on defense, the Jags sport the best rush defense in the league. 

The Jags will be facing a Bills team that, quite frankly, looks the worst they have entering the playoffs in 5 years. Quarterback Josh Allen is absolutely elite, and running back James Cook is having another fantastic year, but the rest of the team is not where they need to be to make a run in the postseason. Allen has not had a high-tier receiving option all season, but he has been able to make do. The biggest problem is the Bills defense. Their run defense hasn’t been able to stop anyone all season, and Jags running back Travis Etienne should have no issues getting yards on the ground and in the air. 

There’s also the question of Josh Allen’s health. He has been dealing with a foot injury and has gotten X-rays 2 different times over the last few weeks. He’ll play and look like himself, but just something to keep in mind.

The best part, and quite frankly the only real effective part, of the Bills offense is the run game. Unfortunately for them, the Jags have stopped every single running back this season from having over 75 rushing yards. On the other side, the Jags offense should be able to gouge the Bills rush defense for good yardage, thus opening up passing lanes later. I’ll take the Bills QB and RB over the Jags, but the rest of the Bills team is so much weaker that it takes away from how good they are. Give me the hotter of the two teams to come out with the win.

Sunday’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> - 49ers +6 -112 (1.12u to win 1u)

I get why this line is 6 points, but I think last week’s game for the 49ers was a worst case scenario for them. Had they looked a little better and lost, this would’ve been closer to 3. I expect Mike Shanahan to have a good game plan and be able to put some points up. Before last week, they had put up 37, 48, and 42 points after their week 14 bye. 

The Eagles offense is still a hot and cold one. The inconsistency they’ve had throughout the season makes me nervous for them, especially as 6 point favorites in a playoff game. Their team total of 25 points feels high to me, even going up against a pretty banged up 49ers defense.

New manager effect at United is still ongoing, I might have backed them too early in the game against Burnley.

I don&#x27;t have any relevant stats to back up this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> since it is FA Cup but we can somewhat take the home and away form of the Prem in consideration.

The Pelicans are already without their best stopper (Herb Jones), an important perimeter defender (Jose Alvarado), and has Saddiq Bey listed as a game-time-decision. Guards Jordan Poole (6-foot-4) and and Jeremiah Fears (6-foot-3) are not known for their lockdown defenses, and that&#x27;s putting it lightly. I like Black&#x27;s chances to go inside and get fouled or shoot over either of them. New Orleans&#x27; Top 10 pace should afford Black and the Magic extra possessions. Oh, and in the last month of play, opposing guards have gone over assists in 70 percent of their games. It&#x27;s enough to consider sprinkling a little on assists or PA combo. But it tells me that point guards are having their way on the attack. As an aside, this feels like a must-win game for the Magic who are in an absolute battle with the Miami Heat for control of the Southeast Division. The Magic are 2-3 over the last five games, but 12-6 at home. Look to Black to help them get to 13-6. He&#x27;ll get minutes, even with Moe Wagner returning (but on a likely minutes restriction). 

Good luck and Godspeed!</td></tr>

__Event:__ NFL: Bills @ Jaguars 1pm EST

__POTD:__ Dalton Kincaid o40.5 receiving yards (-110), 3.3u to win 3u

__Write Up:__ The Buffalo Bills (12-5) are traveling to Jacksonville to take on the Jacksonville Jaguars (13-4) on Sunday in the Wild Card round of the NFL Playoffs. New Jags head coach Liam Cohen turned this franchise around. Since their Week 8 bye, the Jags are 9-1, winning 8 straight games with a league leading +153 point differential over that span. The next closest team over that run is at +97. Jacksonville has scored 2.83 points per drive over that streak, 4th in the NFL. The key to their success has been phenomenal play by QB Trevor Lawrence. TLaw had his third 4,000 yard passing season in the past 4 seasons, setting career highs for passing TD’s (29), rushing yards (359), &amp; rushing TD’s (nine). TLaw has thrown for 10+ yards on 31.4% of his passing plays since Week 9 (3rd). He’ll now face a Playoff experienced Bills team that made the playoffs 7 straight seasons in a row. The Bills have been the best team in the league at running the football this season. RB James Cook led the league in rushing yards this season averaging 95.4 yards per game &amp; ranked 1st in expected points added (EPA) per rush (0.08). The Buffalo Bills had the most rush attempts this season &amp; ranked 28th in pass rate compared to expectations (-3%). The problem with that strategy in this game is, the Jags have the best run defense in the league. The Jags allowed the fewest rushing yards per game (85.6), ranked 5th in yards per carry allowed (3.94), &amp; 2nd in explosive run rate (2.7%) allowed. They haven’t allowed a RB to run for 75+ yards this season &amp; faced some elite talent in CMC, Jonathon Taylor twice, etc. Opponents passed on the Jags at the 2nd highest rate over expectations (+4.4%). The good news for the Bills is, QB Josh Allen has once again been one of the best QB’s in the league this season.

Josh Allen had another stellar year, setting career highs in completion rate (69.3%, 4th in NFL) &amp; yards per pass attempt (8.0, 5th in NFL). He led Buffalo to have a 46.7% success rate on passing plays, 7th in the NFL. Since the start of 2024, the Bills have the highest EPA per dropback. Against a pass funnel defense that allows the fewest rushes in the league, the Bills are going to let Allen air it out. A huge part of Allen’s efficiency through the air this season has been Tight End Dalton Kincaid. Kincaid ranked #1 out of ALL pass catchers in the league in EPA/target. His 79.6% catch rate was the 4th highest in the league. He wasone of just 4 TE’s with multiple 100+ yard receiving games this season. Among the 29 tight ends with at least 49 targets in 2025, Dalton Kincaid ranked #1 in yards per catch (14.6), average depth of target (9.5 yards), yards per route run (2.79), yards after the catch per reception (6.7), &amp; passer rating when targeted (149.2). He did all of that while playing injured &amp; missing 5 games. Kincaid set a career high in TD passes (5) &amp; receiving yards per game (47.6). The Bills’ offensive success this season has been directory correlated to having Kincaid on the field and producing. The Bills 2025 splits with/without Kincaid:

__Points per game:__

With:  32

Without:  21

__Josh Allen TD/INT ratio:__

With (on field):  19 TD’s - 3 INT’s

Without: 7 TD’s - 6 INT’s

__Allen’s passer rating:__

With (on field): 111.77

Without: 81.9

__Record:__

With:  9-2

Without:  2-3

The Bills coaches understand Kincaid’s importance &amp; reduced his playing time down the stretch this season, to keep him healthy for the playoffs. In his first five games of the season, Kincaid averaged 49.1% of the team’s offensive snaps and the Bills record was 4-1. In those games, he averaged 57.4 yards per game on four receptions with a catch percentage of 83.3%. When Kincaid returned from injury in Week 14, his playing time was decreased to just 30.3% of the team’s offensive snaps with only 2.5 receptions per game &amp; 30.8 receiving yards. Kincaid sat out Week 17, then last week he only played 10 snaps, he still managed to catch 3 passes for 48 yards. Head coach Sean McDermott said after wards: I thought it was important that we got him going a little bit. Not too much to where he was too sore to come back and practice,” McDermott said. “So just some momentum, some wind at his back here.” It was clear they were getting him ready for the playoffs &amp; he’ll have the freshest legs of anyone on the field in this game. Over the prior 2 seasons, Kincaid regularly saw 60-70% snap shares &amp; route shares north of 80%. This season when Kincaid has played +50% of snaps he has had at least 48 yards every game, averaging 5 catches for 74 yards, including a 100 yard game. Now he faces a Jags defense that to Tight Ends this season have allowed the 2nd most targets per game (8.7), 6th most catches (6.1 per game), 61 receiving yards per game (9th most), &amp; 8 TD’s (9th most). Jacksonville deploys zone coverage on 78.6% of their defensive snaps, 5th most in the league. Only running man coverage on just 17.6% of snaps. Kincaid has been the Bills zone buster all season, ranking 2nd best among all pass catches in yards per route run vs. zones (3.91). Josh Allen has targeted Kincaid on a team high 30% of his routes vs. zone coverage. His 93.33% catch rate vs zone is the highest in the league amongst pass catchers with 100+ routes ran vs zone. He’s has 410 receiving yards vs zone compared to Dawson Knox’s 341 yards, &amp; he has ran 70 less routes vs Zone coverage. As for the Jags pass defense they have good metrics, but they also faced the 2nd easiest slate of passing opponents this season. Their defensive line has been below average with a 36.2% pressure rate (19th) &amp; at the bottom of the league with a 4.8% sack rate (30th). The Bills also have had to play from behind a ton this season. In the 1st half of games, the Bills had a -11 point differential compared to a +127 in the 2nd half. They trailed by 10+ points at halftime 5 times this year. The other 6 AFC playoff teams trailed by 10+ points 5 times at half combined. Meanwhile the Jags ranked 4th in 1st half points scored &amp; 3rd in 1st half point differential. Additionally, the Jags revved up the pass towards the end of the season. Since Week 14, they ranked 1st in pass rate over expected (+8.6%). The Jags veraged 27.9 points per game (6th) &amp; scored on 51% of their possessions since Week 9 (2nd). This should force Allen to have to air it out, you could make the argument that Kincaid is the best receiver that Josh Allen. It helps that Bills WR Joshua Palmer has been ruled out as well.

I wouldn’t be surprised if this hits in the 1st half.

Winnipeg Jets ML (-125)

The New Jersey Devils have **1.6 goals on average** in their last 10 games. They shoot a lot but are struggling to put it in the net. Their goalies can&#x27;t buy a save and the Devils are on the freefall ever since the Quinn Hughes trade rumors spread which a lot of veterans didn&#x27;t like hearing about especially with them being used as the trade pieces. They even announced <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> that Dougie Hamilton (top 2 defenseman on their team) is now healthy scratched to be traded so the vibes are really not good right now. They are on a 3 game losing streak and things are not going better on the road having lost 4 out of their last 5 away games. They also struggle against the Jets having lost their last 2 games against them (6-1 and 4-0).

Jets aren&#x27;t doing so great but they won their last game so they come with some momentum. What makes me confident with the Jets ML though is that in their last 10 games at home they have scored 3 goals or more 8 times which should be useful against a Devils team that struggles to score even 2 goals right now. Expecting Connor Hellebuyck to be starting for the Jets as he has an 8-1-1 record with a goals against average of 1.89 and a save percentage of .942 in his last 10 games versus the Devils.

**Event:** Spanish Super Cup, FC Barcelona v Real Madrid, 2:00 pm EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Real Madrid 0.0 +0.5 Asian Handicap, +108, 3 units

**Write Up:** Yeah, maybe I still haven&#x27;t learned my lesson, but I do think it&#x27;s all going to come crashing down for Barcelona <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Real Madrid are going to want to prove a point after being embarrassed in last season&#x27;s Clasicos and they&#x27;re for sure coming out swinging. They already beat Barcelona 2-1 earlier in the season and I felt the scoreline even flattered Barcelona a bit. Madrid&#x27;s attack is going to run riot - I think Barca&#x27;s ridiculous high line just isn&#x27;t prepared to deal with something as fast and technical, and Joan Garcia can&#x27;t keep bailing them out. They&#x27;ll be 2 goals down before they know it.

Securing a small profit even in case of a draw at these odds is just value I can&#x27;t overlook. The confidence is high after back to back wins and I think now&#x27;s a great moment to fade Barcelona again so I&#x27;m going in with 3 units. If you want to take the BTTS Yes and Over 3.5 goals angle, I don&#x27;t mind those either. BOL and let&#x27;s break this Barcelona curse once and for all ☘️🫡

Last pick: Suns -4.5 over Grizzlies, easy win

Event: Bills @ Jags

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Dawson Knox over 20.5 receiving yards 

Write Up: This one is pretty simple. Firstly, Knox has hit this over in 8 out of the last 10. Second, the Jags don&#x27;t have a good pass defense, so I expect the Bills to be slinging it. Thirdly the Jags have the best run defense in the league, so once again, I expect the Bills to throw more than their average. 




Vegas expects over 50 points in this game, and that means a lot of yards. Knox had a slow start to the season, so his season average is low, which is why I think this line is lower than it should be. He&#x27;s averaging over 30 yards per game in the last 10 games without a lot of variation, so he should be able to continue that in a high scoring high yardage game against a bad pass defense. </td></tr>

Time: 2:30AM EST

 

Reasoning:

Like Musetti here - his consistency and movement will make it very hard for bublik to break him down, who has solid groundstrokes and is rally-tolerant for a big server, though he&#x27;s outclassed in movement and consistency. I think the match will go 3 sets and musetti will wear him down. Bublik wants to play shorter points against Musetti but musetti is in good form right now. He&#x27;ll have to go bigger and bigger to win rallies and I think t

I&#x27;d give Musetti about a 60% chance to win here - I got this at +123 but +100 is good value still for 1U

**Write Up:** Chelsea made that a touch sweaty, but eventually came alive in the last 30 minutes and end up winning 5-1.

Fun fact, we&#x27;ve yet to lose a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> play with odds less than +100. Great to be back in the wim column to start the weekend! 

More FA cup action <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> and I&#x27;m targeting another EPL side against a Championship side as West Ham host Queen&#x27;s Park Rangers (QPR). West Ham are firmly in the relegation zone at 18th in the Premier League, and they burned us a few matches ago when they got trounced by Wolves. But to me, this is their chance to right the ship. They need a win badly, in any competition, and this is a prime time to do it. They get a week off after this match, so i expect them to come out with a strong team and take out some frustration on QPR. 

QPR are in the packed middle of the table in the Championship (England&#x27;s 2nd tier), but are only 3 points off from the playoff spots for promotion. They have the top 3 highest scoring games in the Championship, as their games average 3 goals/match. With that, they concede the 2nd most goals in the Championship behind relegation bound Sheffield. Because of that, we&#x27;ve seen some lineup changes for these mid pack championship teams eyeing a promotion spot - they are not prioritizing the FA cup as heavily. I do not expect them to rollover by any means, but I do expect them to lose. 

Not to be dramatic, but if West Ham don&#x27;t grab a win here in front of the home crowd, against a team a division below them - their already bleak season will look pretty dire. This is their chance to right the ship and build some momentum to take to the EPL next weekend. This is obviously a risky play and definitely feel free to sit this out if you&#x27;re weary of West Ham.

**Recaps:**  It’s a wash by ½ point.  Semi 1: Miami was clearly the better team, yet Ole Miss hung in there with a little help from the refs.  As expected, the game came down to the final few plays and could have gone either way.  We lost that bet by the ½ pt hook. 

Semi 2: Although Oregon started with a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> 6 and then fumbled time and again, Indiana was just was the better team by far.  Indiana made few to no mistakes other than a couple of penalties and dominated both sides of the ball.  I think they win it all.

**New Event:**  NFL – Buffalo Bills vs Jacksonvillle Jaguars

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:**  Dalton Kincaid Longest Reception Over 18.5 yards @ 1.80 (Usual 3 units)

Full disclosure:  This prop was recommended by the Betting Pros and Sharp Football and I have incorporated some details from those writeups.  As of earlier <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> this prop can still be found on Ceasars.  The line has moved to 19.5 most everywhere else.  I would still take it at 19.5, but not too juiced and no higher.

When it comes to the NFL wildcard playoffs, I have learned to narrow my choices and look for two types of opportunities for bets.  Overs on QB rushing yards and Tight-End receptions/yards. Normally I lean towards Unders on props but playoffs are a different animal.  Both are situational depending on how I believe the games will play out.  

In the case of QB rushing yards, we see year after year even those QB’s that never run, will do so out of desperation in a loser go-home scenario.  Brady, Manning, even Marino, characterized as statues in the pocket have gotten most of their rushing yard stats during the playoffs. I look for QB’s with a low rushing yard total offered.  In the case of tight-ends, this is where they shine the most and become key receivers in difficult situations.  Gronk, Kelce, Gonzalez, are examples of legacy favorite targets for QB’s in big games.  This year should be no different for both prop types. 

I was looking at the Over on receptions for Kincaid, currently at 3.5 and at plus money which seemed more than fair.  However, when looking at the data there was a lack of consistency as he barely hits this mark in half of his games.  Then I stumbled upon the Betting Pros who have that same prop recommended as a 5 star play with a +27% EV. (I have placed this bet as well)  It seemed as I was still missing something here.  So being OCD, I scoured every bit of data on Kincaid on the internet.  Then, bingo!  I found a more compelling stat driven bet thanks to the folks at Sharp Football.

Worth mentioning as a preamble is that in week 16 Dalton kincaid picked up an injury against the Browns in a game where he had 0 catches on 1 target. Then he missed the following game against the Eagles in week 17 due to the injury.  But came back last week (week 18) against the Jets where he had 3 catches for 48 yards with a long of 26. 

Bulletpoints are in order:

* Dalton Kincaid (DK) has played in 12 games this season and has a catch of at least 18 yards in 11 of them.  (week 16 vs Browns is the exception)
* He also has a 20+ yard reception in 10 of 12 games.
* His long receptions this year per game are: 22 18 20 28 23 23 47 20 20 24 0 26
* Kincaid leads the NFL in tight-ends with the highest average in yards per catch.
* If his projected over 3.5 receptions with a 5 star recommendation comes to fruition, I am confident that at least one will be for over 19 yards.
* There is a case to be made that Jacksonville’s pass defense has not faced many elite QB’s of Josh Allen’s caliber as they have had the 6^(th) easiest schedule this season.
* Jacksonvile is 29^(th) conceding receptions to tight ends.
* Jacksonville has the #1 ranked rush defense in the NFL.  
* The premise for this match is that as much as Buffalo would like to run the ball in Jacksonville, they will most likely be forced to throw the ball more than usual.  
* The Jaguars have only lost 2 home matches this season, against the Rams and Seahawks, perhaps the 2 best teams in the league. 
* Neither the Rams nor Seahawks were able to rush rush for more than 90 yards in Jacksonville.  Buffalo will most likely fail to do so as well and be forced to pass.

Kincaid should get his share of targets and if he has been as dependable as his numbers suggest in every game he has played healthy, then another long catch of over 18 yards is not out of the question.</td></tr>

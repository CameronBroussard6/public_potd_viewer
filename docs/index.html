Event - Feirense vs unia de leiria (Portugal - Liga pro ) 

Bet - Corners under 11 ( 1.52 ) 

Write up - Feirense and de leiria plays very defensive, and uses counter attacking a lot as I seen them play a lot . Even through Feirense is 17 in table they conceded less goals . They need to draw or win this game inorder to escape relegation. So this might be low scoring and low corners game .</td></tr>

Writeup: Going to try luck at football again. Hope it works out <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> :)

For the 1st Prop: Neco Williams has had a shot in each of his last five Premier League appearances, taking his overall tally to 20 for the season. Williams played as a wingback in the most recent head-to-head meeting between these sides &amp; had three shots in that game, with Forest having 19 overall. Even if Williams lines up as a conventional fullback here, his shot numbers from right back and left back have been strong, as displayed by his average of 1.29 shots per 90 in the Premier League. 

For the 2nd Prop: Mateus Fernandes has had 11 shots across his 16 Premier League starts (0.74 per 90) with this tally returning two goals. Fernandes is the most likely to get forward out of West Ham’s midfield trio, and should have more chances than usual to get a shot away here against a Wolves side that have conceded 23 (2.55 per game). 

Going a little greedy here &amp; taking the parlay for these 2 bets :)

Hope we continue our wins &amp; BoL

Writeup: Canberra United is currently 1st in the league (17 pts) while Western Sydney is 11th (4 points). Canberra is unbeaten in their last five (W4, D1) whereas WSW has lost four of their last five. WSW has conceded 18 goals in 8 games, meanwhile, Canberra, led by Michelle Heyman, is playing with elite structure and clinical efficiency.

Really exciting game tomorrow night with the 1 seed on the line. The 49ers offense has really been clicking recently and it’s going to make it a challenge even for the difficult Seahawks defense. Since the Seahawks bye in week 8, Darnold has been over this line in 6 of 9 games.

As good as the offense of the 49ers has been, their defense, specifically the pass rush, has been equally as bad. Caleb hit 330 yards and Rivers hit 277 yards in their last 2 games. Even Cam Ward, who only threw for 170, was able to score 24 points against this team.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Arsenal Over 4.5 Shots on target @ 1.65**

**Game: Bournemouth VS Arsenal**

**Time: 12:30 PM EST**

**---**

**Gonna keep this one shorter**

**Bournemouth haven&#x27;t won a single game in 10**.

Arsenal are coming into this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> as the only big six side to play, and after City dropped points. Considering they beat third-placed Aston Villa in a dominant 4-1 fashion on the weekend we ride the good form into this game. I&#x27;ve held off a bit on overloading Arsenal selections but I see the front line clicking a lot better with Oodegard slowly sliding back into form again. Zubimendi allows Odegard to be more free-flowing attacking-wise, and if it&#x27;s not working a slight reverse.

Usually Arsenal are bit more pragmatic away from home but that was down to the injuries to Saliba and Gabriel, when you want to dominate possession and put pressure on an opponent away from home those 2 are equally as important as any forward as they collect and redistribute to continue play.

Arsenal have not hit this line for 3 games straight and now with an away fixture against one of the worst teams in the league in form - I see them going for another goal drive to seperate themselves from City even more

**Expecting 6 SOT tomorrow, BOL.**</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>**POTD Record:** 6-21-3 *I stay winless in the new year. In the usual fashion, I managed to identify another freak match that saw a very early red card for the team I backed, and that pretty much sealed their fate. They also nearly conceded from the halfway line. We move though, and <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> we head over to an equally as exciting matchup that&#x27;s bound to throw some fun our way (but most importantly, a win). I&#x27;ve been eyeing this match since before the new year and I truly believe I&#x27;m ending my winless streak <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>*

**Last Five:** ❌❌❌❌❌

**Event:** LaLiga, RCD Espanyol v FC Barcelona, 3:00 pm EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** RCD Espanyol +1.0, +1.5 Asian Handicap -115, 2 units

**Write Up:** It&#x27;s safe to say Espanyol have been one of the surprise packages in the Spanish league, perhaps the whole of Europe. After finishing 14th last year in their regular midtable languishing season, they&#x27;ve made significant strides, collecting 10 wins, three draws and just four defeats from 17 matches. Their recent form has been outstanding, with **five consecutive league victories** over Sevilla, Celta Vigo, Rayo Vallecano, Getafe and Athletic Bilbao (all very respectable sides). Perhaps even more impressive are their **home performances** as Espanyol have taken **19 points from the possible 27** at their ground.

Now take into consideration this is a Catalan derby and Espanyol REALLY don&#x27;t like Barcelona. They&#x27;re always ready to turn up and despite the fact their *recent H2H has been disappointing,* they **don&#x27;t usually get blown out by the paper favourites**, notching up a respectable amount of draws. While it’s easy to see Barcelona as the favourite based on table position and firepower, there’s value in backing Espanyol to avoid a heavier defeat. First off, Espanyol enter this match with confidence and momentum. As I said, they’ve won **five LaLiga matches in a row**, a run that highlights how well Manolo Gonzalez’s side are playing, especially considering none of the teams they beat in that stretch are pushovers. At home, Espanyol’s record looks even stronger. They’ve taken points in **five of their last six matches at RCDE Stadium** and kept multiple clean sheets there this season. That defensive resilience matters when taking an Asian Handicap, where even a narrow defeat still yields a winning bet and I think that&#x27;s a smart play to take <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. **Espanyol are good at grinding out results** when needed, so that also gives me confidence heading into this.

Meanwhile, Barcelona’s away form isn’t as bulletproof as the headlines suggest. Though they’re top of LaLiga and score plenty of goals, their away matches often involve **multiple goals conceded,** with **Barcelona averaging nearly 2 goals conceded per away game** this season thanks to their **ridiculously high, dysfunctional defensive line.** This goal conceded number is far higher than the elite visitors normally allow and it&#x27;s why I truly believe Espanyol can stay in the game longer than the odds imply.

Finally, the rivalry cannot be underestimated. Espanyol historically rise to big occasions in front of their diehard fans, and with the +1.0, +1.5 line, I&#x27;m essentially backing them to stay competitive even if Barcelona edge it. Besides (and that&#x27;s a small consideration that hasn&#x27;t really influenced my decision behind this bet by a great deal, but still made me even more sure of it), this is **the first LaLiga match after the holidays** and players like **Lamine Yamal** are for sure going to be feeling the effects of all the partying. On the other side, the Espanyol players probably felt like they could have an edge if they just stayed disciplined during the holidays - I&#x27;m sure the management would&#x27;ve made that known. The underdog is always going to try to take such things into consideration to level the playing field in one way, because let&#x27;s face it, technique wise, they&#x27;re not touching the Blaugrana.

I also like the BTTS Yes angle, as well as an Under 2.5 goals line *(feeling like Espanyol are going to keep Barcelona relatively quiet),* but we&#x27;re just going to focus on the match result. All in all, fading Barcelona when I really need a sure win perhaps sounds counterintuitive, but if I win, I want to do it in style (and I do believe in the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> I&#x27;ve made, that goes without saying). We&#x27;ve waited far too long for my win, just to achieve it by betting on some heavyweights to score more than 0.5 goals and have more than 4 corners against a relegation threatened side or something. BOL whether you tail or fade, let&#x27;s enjoy this heated derby, which is for sure going to be even crazier now that I&#x27;ve placed a bet on it ☘️🫡</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: SGP 2 Leg - Emeka Egbuka 15+ Rec Yards, Rachaad White 5+ Rush Yards (-130 at FanDuel)** 

**Write Up:** 

**Emeka Egbuka:** Emeka Egbuka has had quite a downfall in the middle of the season, but with the Buccaneers playoffs hopes dying, Baker Mayfield will have to air the ball out a little more than usual against a sufficient Panthers team. In Week 16 against the Panthers, Egbuka reached 40 receiving yards despite having only 1 reception. He has reached 15+ receiving yards in every game this season despite his downfall. 

**Rachaad White:** Ever Since Bucky Irving has taken over for RB, Rachaad has been making more use of his carries, averaging 8.46 yard per carry. White has also hit this mark in every game this season, even after his usage declined. In Week 16 against the Panthers, Rachaad White rushed for 45 yards, with a long rush of 39 yards. The Panthers&#x27; defense this season allows 4.48 yards per carry to opposing RB&#x27;s this season. With Rachaad now averaging 4.2 carries per game, I have no doubt he will reach this mark.</td></tr>

Last Pick: PSG ML + Brentford ML +126❌

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: **Rachaad White o11.5 Rushing Yards -110 5u (Bet365)**

Rachaad White is over this line 14/16 on the year. He is the Bucs backup RB, and has played roughly 50% of the snaps all season. In the Bucs last game vs the Panthers, they ran the ball 33 times. Despite the loss, coach Todd Bowles defended the Bucs’ run-heavy game plan against Carolina, saying they beat the Panthers last year with 41 and 38 rushes. “We did everything we wanted to do.” Bucs OC Josh Grizzard says that &quot;Rachaad White has been “even keel” and has taken the opportunities he’s been given very well.” He says that his “ability to blitz pickup makes him a true three-down back. “ I expect the Bucs to run the ball at least 25+ times tomorrow, and if so Rachaad should get at least 3+ carries. In 6/16 games he has a carry of 12+ yards, and in 14/16 he has a carry of 7+ yards. This bet very well could cash on 1-2 rushes, but I do expect the Bucs to run the ball a ton tomorrow and that gives plenty of carry attempts for Rachaad White. BOL</td></tr>

Darts, 2026 World Championship 🎯

Last POTD: Gian van Veen -1.5 sets vs Gary Anderson @ 1.90 ✅

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Luke Littler vs Gian van Veen under 37.5 180s @ 1.81

This one takes a bit longer to write. First of all, the under 37.5 bet means everything from 37 and below is considered a win for this bet. 38 and above means a loss. 

To me, the total of the 180s on here feels off. If we compare it to yesterday&#x27;s matches; Littler’s match had 14 180s while playing 7 sets. Van Veen&#x27;s match had 25 180s while playing 9 sets. Due to this 37 180s at most already feels quite high. Keep in mind it’s first to 7 sets to win, compared to first to 6 sets yesterday.

If we compare it with the finals of the previous years, we see:

2025: 10 sets, 25 180s (Littler vs van Gerwen)

2024: 11 sets, 36 180s (Littler vs Humphries)

2023: 11 sets, 37 180s (Smith vs van Gerwen)

2022: 12 sets, 41 180s (Smith vs Wright)

2021: 10 sets, 23 180s (Anderson vs Price, covid year)

I can keep it going but in 2020 it didn’t hit either. 

We can conclude that this bet only went over the total of 37.5 once in the past years. With the recent stats of the semi-finals and the previous finals, I’m confident in taking the under 37.5 180s @ 1.81

Record: 13-12
Net Units: +0.22 Units ✅

Explanation: For starters, The Buccaneers are at home. You’ll always take that whenever you can get it. 

Panthers have been hot yes, but Carolina’s offense has been one of the league’s least efficient at turning plays into points. By 2025 efficiency metrics, Carolina sits near the bottom in EPA per play (about -0.05). I argue that matters in a divisional game where the spread is tight and you’re basically asking who can produce two or three scoring drives without self harming themselves.

If Baker Mayfield can stay protected in the pocket, he’s dangerous. And we already know he’s dangerous on the run. He’s not Lamar, but he’s so hard to knock down.</td></tr>

Alright, you either loved or hated my last write up. I’m a storyteller with my POTDs and it will stay like that. I find entertainment in writing these and love to throw some amusement towards y’all.

The <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> is Arkansas to win outright against the Volunteers. Oh man, I love me some John Calipari.

These are the types of games John has to win to keep his recruiting alive, I believe in him fully. 

Arkansas comes into this with a 8-0 record at home this season with two wins against ranked opponents (Texas Tech and Louisville). They have also played stiff competition all year with quality losses to Duke, Houston and Michigan State. They will be more prepared and mentally tougher than Tennessee in this matchup. I’ve been watching a lot of Arkansas basketball and they have two absolute studs on their team. Brazile and Acuff Jr have been a deadly duo heading into conference play and the leadership they provide will only intensify as the season progresses. Not much stats on this one as these two teams matchup pretty evenly. I just believe Arkansas is the better coached and more mature team coming into this coin flip game. And I always side with the home momentum in these types of matchups. BOL</td></tr>

Write up: first career 5unit bomb. JSN has hit this prop in 13/16 and expect him to show up on the big stage as Seahawks look to grab the 1 seed and bye. 49ers defense has huge holes in the secondary - they’ve won some shootouts lately but since the bye they’ve given up 24 to the titans, 27 to the colts and 38 to the bears. JSN has an insane 44% of the teams receiving yards and put up 138 against the niners last time they played. Weather is ok, some rain but not much wind and mid 50s. 

Last but not least, 49ers CB Deommodore Lenoir was asked about JSN this week and said “I hope he’s ready, man to man coverage, me and him. That’s what I want.” This is the same corner who earlier this year said on a livestream:

I&#x27;m going for a riskier <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> but I think there is some serious value here.   
So first of all their last H2H was 2-1 but that was February 2025 so take it with a grain of salt.  
Recent form in the last 5 games in terms of goal difference for Al Ittihad is 17-1 and 11-3 for Al Taawon respectively and this is where the value comes in. Al Ittihad&#x27;s numbers are pumped by 2 friendly games versus bad teams. They did play a 1-0 vs Nasaf Qarshi but that was an AFC Champion&#x27;s League game and they shot 19 times while Nasaf shot 16 times so there was plenty of attacking even though the shots were not converted.  
Al Taawoun achieved these defensive numbers vs mostly mid/lower table teams but they did score vs Qadsiah and NEOM who are both good teams and they are on a pretty good run. If we take a look at their whole season in the Saudi League, Al Ittihad have 22-16 goal difference while Al Taawoun have 27-13 in 11 games. This paints a completely different picture.

I think the odds overvalue the defensive aspect of the teams&#x27; recent games, especially for Al Ittihad. They are good defensively but I expect both teams to push and score goals. Al Ittihad want to climb back up the table where they feel they belong and I expect them to score first but Al Taawon is fighting to keep their 3rd place. I think both teams&#x27; offensive power can overwhelm the defenses.

This is a higher risk <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> anyway, so take that into account.

Keep in my mind I&#x27;m a random nobody from reddit, so tail with caution. BOL</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>**POTD Record:** 18-16-5 (Avg Odds +128)

**Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Milan ML + Pulisic 1+ SoT (+100) ✅️

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s Event:** English Premier League (Soccer) | Wolves vs West Ham (7:00 AM PST)

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Jarrod Bowen 1+ SOT and West Ham DC (+124) 1 unit to win 1.24 units

**Write Up:** The Milan game played out about as expected, low scoring but ultimately with Milan coming through. Despite Pulisic not starting, he came through with a SOT anyway after he subbed on around the 78&#x27; mark. Great plus money cash to start the weekend!

EPL is back <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> and we&#x27;ve got the game of the week here as 20th (last) place Wolves host 18th place West Ham. Let&#x27;s be honest and get out there that both of these teams stink. Wolves are historically bad, as they may be looking at the fewest points ever by an EPL team. West Ham have been spotty, but I think they are a better team than their record states and have shown signs of life. 

Bowen is the best attacking player for West Ham, the game goes through him. He has 6 of the club&#x27;s 20 goals this season (30%) and has been in great form lately, scoring in 3 of his last 5 matches. He also has 8 SOTs in his last 6 matches, only failing to land an SOT in one of these games against Man City. I love the odds we&#x27;re getting for Bowen here. 

Lets talk about Wolves. They are winless this season, going 0-3-16 so far. They lost at home to Burnley (19th place team), at home to Forest (17th place team) and at home to Leeds (16th place team) just to name a few notable results. They are on track to earn 6 total points this season at the halfway point, which would be firmly the worst EPL season ever, with the current honor of that award is held by Derby County with 11 points. Their stats back up their record, attacking wise they have the fewest SOTs (53) fewest goals scored (10 - the 2nd fewest is 18), fewest shots, fewest goals/shot, we could go on. Defensively, they&#x27;ve conceded the 2nd most goals (36) and 3rd most SOTs (90).

West Ham are not a great team and do not have the best defensive record themselves, but they really need a win here to start to work out of the relegation zone. This is a team they need to beat, and I suspect Bowen will take it on himself to make that happen. This <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> is more about fading the Wolves than anything, but I do think West Ham are a much better team. 

BOL and happy Saturday!</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>Last 5 &gt; WWLWW // Profit: €1,517.80

Aston Villa @ 1.79 - €280.00

This one should be self explanatory. 3rd placed Aston Villa against 17th placed Forest. When talking about home form Villa are one of the best with a 7-1-1 record. Away from home Forest are 2-2-5 and coming into this game they are on a streak of 2 losses away from home and 3 losses overall. Villa on the other hand have won their last 5 home games but just came from a defeat against Arsenal.

Let me say it one more time again, fuck Sean Dyche. I hated how he played at Burnley and I will never rate him as manager. And it shows, Emery is 6-1-1 in managerial H2H while Villa are also 6-2-2 in the club H2H. At home Villa are on a streak of 5 home wins against Forest.</td></tr>

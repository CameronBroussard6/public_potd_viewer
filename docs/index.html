Rudy Gobert Over 9.5 Boards. $2.05

Rudy Gobert in the regular season has hit this line in 18 out of 19 games with the one game with him ending up on 9 boards. Furthermore Draymon Green is out, so that&#x27;s another big body that will not be on the floor. Now the issue here is Post is likely to be the replacement center, who is a stretch big who will likely pull gobert out from the ring, and GSW shoots a lot of threes meaning Gobert may not get to many boards rather than Randle. However, when GSW plays a rebounder that is top 10 in rebound chances they have gone over their line. Rudy gobert is ranked 6th in rebound chances at 19 potential rebounds a game. Currently GSW is also ranked 25th out of 30 in rebounds to centers per game. I expect gobert to crash the boards as well, as if he does not then I have no doubt chris flinch will bench Gobert instantly to have naz reid to go small ball. GSW is 27th out of 30th allowing opponents for Offensive rebounds and gobert is ranked 11th when crashing the boards. I think truthfully this bet may not hit as in the Playoffs Gobert has gone under this line, with his team mates varying with McDaniels getting 13 boards or Ant/Randle getting the boards. But at $2.05 i think there is a lot of value.</td></tr>

DARTS POTD RECORD **75-40** | Overall 75-42 | All <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> bets between 1U-2U

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: **Ian** **White ML** vs Mervyn King **@ 1.90** \[bet365\] / 1.5U

Well well well, if it ain&#x27;t that time of the year. Christmas is coming and that means one thing: the pinnacle of Darts, every night. Opening night was quite boring to be real, I didn&#x27;t manage to get a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> out in time but I&#x27;m looking to get this shit rolling tonight. 

Not a whole lot I like on tonight&#x27;s card but I am more than happy to back Ian White vs ole&#x27; Merv King who I genuinely can&#x27;t believe is here. Not because he&#x27;s playing badly but because he&#x27;s been in the darting wilderness last few years. I will say its great to have him back. One of the most hilarious characters in Darts lol. 

I wouldn&#x27;t say either of these guys have played particularly great this year at all but I do think White has the slight edge in this one and 1.90 is decent value. I know Ned has made his yearly appearance and is backing King so I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if he&#x27;s actually moved the line a fair bit, and fwiw I wouldn&#x27;t have taken this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> at the earlier price of \~1.66.

White edges almost all metrics that I&#x27;m interested in. White in his prime was notorious for destroying the trebles but not finishing well, and whilst the second part is still true he actually has an ever so slight edge in checkout % compared to Merv. His 3 and 6 month rolling averages are higher and one of my favourite stats is avg with throw of which he has an edge 91.4 vs 87.6. Power scores per leg White leads (0.24 v 0.2) and actually despite his poor form he is winning a higher % of deciding legs than Merv (43 vs 38). One factor that is hard to quantify is how Mervyn King will react to being away from the big stage for 3 years. His performance could go either way I think.

Honestly I don&#x27;t imagine many (if any) will be tailing me tonight given Ned&#x27;s on the opponent but still thought I&#x27;d put my 2c out there. And please no bullshit comments after regardless of who wins. I only post here for a bit of fun. Ta</td></tr>

I really don&#x27;t understand why Leipzig is plus money here. 

I&#x27;m not saying they will win surely, but I feel like this is a spot that is just too hard to pass up. Union Berlin hasn&#x27;t won a Bundesliga game at home since october; while Leipzig hasn&#x27;t been great away from home, at least they have looked better. They have scored 6 goals in a match twice since halloween, and overall just score a lot of goals. I&#x27;d say this is a fairly inconsistent team but I feel like they should have the upside versus a weak Berlin team.

Fenerbahce has the best defense in EL, despite problems on the other end; their defense has led to 10 consecutive wins across all competitions. I like the given limit of 168 points; it is very manageable for the team that just broke the EL record with 125 points in one game. That game was with crazy 60% for 3, so hard to beat, but all that is needed here is 85 points from each team.

Fenerbahce had a canceled game last round with Olympiakos, unfortunately for them, since they are in good form, and Olympiakos is not.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Rounds handicap (overall) = MOUZ -6.5 vs FaZe Clan @ 1.85 - 5 units


Write Up: Sharing my CS2 picks here as my predictions have been 80% spot on.

The quality between MOUZ and FaZe is massive, to say the least. MOUZ are better tactically as a team and they have a better AWPER. For the uninitiated, the AWP is the most powerful gun in the game, usually held by a team&#x27;s best player. FaZe&#x27;s AWPER, broky, has been struggling a lot recently. He is the weakest link in this FaZe team, and many consider him to be the only one holding them back from reaching greater heights - which is true. Although broky performed well against Passion UA, no offense but Passion UA is a terrible team with an equally terrible AWPER. Against a tactically sound team like MOUZ with an arguably Top 5 AWPER in torzsi, FaZe doesn&#x27;t stand a chance. And FaZe is known for playing chaotic CS. They won&#x27;t stand a chance against MOUZ and I can see MOUZ covering this rounds handicap.

Although they beat Vitality in Round 1 of Stage 3, FaZe got wrecked by Team Spirit and Mongolz. They only got to the playoffs by beating weak and unstable teams like 3DMAX and Passion UA. And even though Passion UA is a bad team, they still managed to put up a fight against FaZe.

Meanwhile, MOUZ got to the playoffs by beating PARAVISION, B8 and Falcons in convincing fashion. They lost to Spirit 2-1, but it was evenly matched compared to the beating that FaZe got from the same team.</td></tr>

Last pick: Oklahoma City Thunder ML +  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander Over 29.5 Points(-120HR)❌ 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the day</mark> :Pascal Siakam OVER 31.5 Points + Rebounds (-105 Fanatics)

Reason •  
Siakam has been by far my favorite wagon this season and we go right back to him here in a great matchup versus the Sixers.

Coming off a bad game I love backing Siakam here for a great bounce back spot in a game he gets a perfect matchup.

Siakam has stepped up big for the Pacers after the team dealt with many injuries to star players seeing great usage this season averaging 31.5 PR a game on 11.6 rebound chances and 18.6 FGA per game.

Siakam gets a matchup versus the Sixers that gives him a favorable matchup to rack up points and rebounds here, let me break it down 👇

Siakam scores a majority 18% of his points from transition where the Sixers allow the 6th most PPG against, and another majority comes from the free throw line where the Sixers allow the 13 most FTA per game.

When looking at scoring zones Siakam gets a majority of his points from the RA where he records 31% of his points from, and the Sixers have been getting killed down low allowing the 4th most PPG in the RA, and when looking at shot type Siakam also gets a great matchup, he shoots 50% of his shots from &lt;10 feet where the Sixers allow the 7th most shots per game.

When looking at the rebounding matchup Siakam also gets an amazing matchup here 👇

We saw Siakam kill the glass against the Sixers last season averaging 7 rebounds per game against them on 15.7 rebound chances per game and I expect that to continue here as he now plays an even bigger role for this team than he did last season.

When seeing 13+ rebound chances Siakam has cleared this line in all 8/8 games this season averaging 39.1 PR per game.

The Sixers allow the 3rd most rebounds per game to PFs(11.53) 

Siakam has killed this line against weak rebounding defenses clearing this line in 9/11 games this season versus teams that rank 16th or below in rebounds allowed averaging 34 PR per game.

Siakam has been automatic this season when he gets the matchup, clearing this line in 8/10 games against teams that rank 15th or worse against transition and he’s over in 5/6 against teams bottom 15 rebounding and transition defenses avergaing 34.3 PR per game.</td></tr>

Soccer | Keuken Kampioen Divisie 🇳🇱 | TOP Oss vs. ADO Den Haag
Date: 12 December | Kickoff: 20:00 (Amsterdam time)
<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: ADO Den Haag Over 2.5 Team Goals +100 | 2 units

Write Up:

Unlucky on the last pick as the game finished with 3 total goals, just one short. The read was right, but that’s part of betting. We move on.

For this one I’m backing ADO Den Haag away at TOP Oss. ADO sit top of the league and continue to look like the strongest team in the Keuken Kampioen Divisie. Over their last five matches they average 2.4 goals scored, and their attacking output has been consistent home and away.

TOP Oss are a bottom-tier side. While they’ve managed to keep some recent games close, the quality gap here is still significant. Against top teams in the league, Oss tend to struggle to hold their shape and concede chances once the pressure builds.

The head-to-head strongly supports this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. For some reason, the last three games played at TOP Oss have all seen ADO score over 2.5 goals, and that was when ADO were still a mid-table or playoff-contending side. This season they are clearly a level above, leading the league from the start and playing with far more confidence and consistency.

Add in the fact that ADO have won the last six meetings overall, including the most recent 5-1 win, and this matchup continues to favor them heavily.

Even away from home, with promotion firmly in sight, I expect ADO to dominate possession, create volume chances, and score at least three goals again.

ADO Den Haag Over 2.5 Team Goals at +100 for 2 units. Let’s get back to winning ways.</td></tr>

Last Pick: Razma -1.5 v Van den Herik

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: Smith -1.5 v Harrysson 

Sport: World Championship Darts

Reasoning: Smith is a far stronger scorer with a massive ranking gap, so over a short best-of-5 he’s likely to control legs early and build a multi-set lead. Harrysson’s lower 12-month averages make it hard for him to win enough legs consistently to force a 3–2, which pushes the match toward 3–0 or 3–1 outcomes, and although Harrysson can take advantage if Smith briefly switches off, Smith’s overall consistency and quality should carry the handicap.

This rebounds line is too high. He has not recorded more than 7 rebounds in ANY game this season. He still seems to be frustrated and is a shell of his former self. His rebounds are reduced, he’s hurt, and the Sixers are being cautious with his use.

* Short writeup from me, bit unfortunate last night, caught two error lines that were later corrected and traded down by 2 deaths each, but we got two long games and losses which led to them going over anyway then going well under each of their next two maps each.
* HLE come into this game as over -600 favorites, last night they were -110, so this game should be significantly easier for them
* Kanavi is averaging 5.9 kills so far at Kespa Cup, he has a **7/7 cover rate** **on this line so far** and is averaging 6.16 kills per map win
* Kanavi is one of the highest kill share junglers in the entire world, he almost always plays carries and takes a high % of kills relative to others at the role, he is one of the most elite carry junglers there is and he has looked great on HLE so far, very low risk of tanks especially this early in the series
* Looking back at his previous map wins at more serious tournaments, 6/7 hitrate on this line at worlds, 11/13 hitrate in LPL playoffs
* As mentioned yesterday, this tournament has a higher pace of play, more kills higher tempo good for overs
* Books currently have kill total set to 36.5 with DKia \~22.5 kills, that would mean if these are accurate, Kanavi needs just \~17% kill share to hit this line, significantly lower then his normal number

Jalen Johnson has been a real solid and consistent player as of late and has to go up against a solid defense of the Detroit Pistons. Despite this, 42.5 is a seriously underplaced line at 42.5 with Jalen Johnson having at least 49 pra or more in the last 5 games. This includes an away game at Detroit where he had 49 pra despite coming off a double OT game from the previous night and on the road. With Trae Young still out, it leaves the main ballhandling opportunities in the hand of NAW, Dyson Daniels, and JJ and it seems that JJ has been taking more and more on this role as of late. Kristaps Prozingis has also been ruled out for this game leaving most of the defensive rebounding opportunities open for Jalen Johnson.

The Call of Duty league is back, and I think this season, in particular, so far, has been easier to predict than previous years. I am hoping for some beginner&#x27;s luck, but I don&#x27;t think I will need it with this one. 

This line is the result of the new COD being released in the last month, team changes happening, new game mechanics, etc.

In the one search and destroy Boston has played this year, they lost it to the Carolina Royal Ravens, who are not a very good team at the moment, 6-5. In the three SNDs G2 has played this year, they have won two and lost to the reigning world champs 6-4 in an extremely close game.

On top of that, G2 has the second-highest Search &amp; destroy Kill death ratio in the league and historically, have very good SND specialists like Estreal, Kremp had a 1.11 KD last season, Skyz(former world champion) and a really talented rookie in Mamba. While Boston has Snoopy who was a top 5 SND player, the rest of the team around him is incredibly mid at SND, Cammy and Nastie were ranked 40 and 41 out of 70 in KD last season, and Purj was ranked 59th. Compared to g2: Mamba(6th in a small sample size), Kremp(13th last season, 1st this year) Estreal(33rd), Skyz(56th). 

  
I am going to say don&#x27;t max bet this one. I would be comfortable around two-three units because it is still a brand new season, and things can get flukey, though this season is easier to predict because the game has a movement skill gap.

  
Lol I hope this made sense, not always easy writing about cod cause most people have no clue what I am talking about.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Mikel Oyarzabal to Score or Give Assist (+100) 1.0 unit to win 1 unit

**Write Up:** Malen had a duck of a game. Couldn&#x27;t control the ball whenever it made it to him. Fluke bad game or bad read on my part, either way we move on. 

Not a ton of games <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, but I do like this bottom table La Liga matchup. Oyarzabal has been on a year lately, scoring or assisting in 4/4 last La Liga games. He is really the best player on Real Sociedad, takes penalties, and has played all 90 minutes for the last 10/10 matches. Sociedad is not in any sort of European competition this year and the team has been in good form, so I suspect we will see a heavy dose of Oyarzabal. 

Girona have been very poor this season. They have not held a clean sheet in an away match all season and have kept only 2 clean sheets all year, both at home. Fresh off a 3-0 loss away at Elche, I expect Girona to struggle here again. 

I thought about taking ATGS straight here, but Oyarzabal has 2 assists in his last 3 matches and I like the odds at even money here to buy it down and give us both options to cash. 

BOL and happy Friday!</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>Darts 🎯- 2026 PDC World Championship 

🌶️ Overall: 52-32-1 

2026 PDC 🎯 World Championships: 1-0

Previous: 

Madars Razma (-161) v Jamai van den Herik ✅ 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Mervyn King (+120) v Ian White

Razma takes care of business for us on Day 1, winning 3-1, but with all but one set going down to that pivotal 5th leg. Even with a less-than-stellar performance, Madars turned it on down the stretch and advances to the next round. 

Here on Day 2 I am dead set on playing a slight underdog - really like the current world #125 Mervyn “The King” King to defeat current world #51 Ian “Diamond” White.

Do not be fooled by the current world ranking disparity here - King has a plethora of experience at the highest levels of darts, albeit some time ago. King reached the World Championship SF &amp; was Premier League runner up in 2009. More recently, King had his best PDC ranked finish at the 2021 Masters, a darts major, ultimately losing 8-11 in the Finals to Jonny Clayton. 

Since 2021, King took a bit of a hiatus from darts, though he has returned and been grinding hard on the Modus &amp; PDC Tours this year. 

King disclosed this year that a large factor in his hiatus was due to filing bankruptcy, as he owed $500k in unpaid taxes, admitting to reporters he was unaware he needed to pay taxes on his winnings. 

Ian White has been a consistent player on the PDC since 2010, but he has zero televised titles and has not won on the PDC Tour since 2020. White also historically has been solid at scoring, particularly hammering that triple-20, but his finishing has long been his biggest weakness. 

One other point worth noting on the Diamond is that- White has not won a single match on the PDC since October 14 of this year, finishing the tour season with four consecutive first round exits. 

Lastly, since 2021 these two have met three times in ranked matches. In those matches, King is 3-0, winning each 6-0; 6-3; 6-3 respectively. 

I expect more of the same from White in this one, struggling on the outer ring and letting King hang around. Expect King to keep pace on scoring, while punishing White for his finishing mistakes. I believe King still has tremendous talent, and entering with a bit of a chip on his shoulder, will prove it to the darts world <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.


————Edit- Loss ❌——————

King goes down 2-3 in a pretty gross match all around. The King missed seemingly countless opportunities, especially in the pivotal moments, especially in an extremely disappointing fifth set. 27 missed darts at double is inexcusable. 

Tough board tomorrow, with only one match even qualifying for the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>. Will look to bounce back in the days to come.</td></tr>

Leonard got completely destroyed and her performance was awful. A bad look on my end as two previous tournament wins probably made her a bit more tired than usual and not so invested in Limoges. Sorry to those who tailed these last two losses.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** **Kalinina vs Parks - Kalinina Handicap -2 Games @ 1.89**

Kalinina appears in this tournament after a long break, and she impressed me quite a lot when she faced Kartal, showing solid groundstrokes from both sides and a gigantic clutch ability when it came to saving break points. While it&#x27;s true that Kartal had the chance to dominate the first set, it was clear that Kalinina stepped up after breaking back, and her typical &quot;warrior&quot; mentality ended up being the main difference. She&#x27;s not the most flashy player you&#x27;ll see, but she plays simple and efficient tennis. 

When it comes to Parks, I was expecting much more from her in Angers, but she had an awful match against Korpatsch, where she lost on her own with unforced errors and a low first serve percentage. While I recognize that Parks can play well on this surface when her serve is on fire, things quickly change when that particular weapon is not on point. I feel like any player who&#x27;s a decent returner can really punish Parks on the second serve and just keep the point alive until she makes an unforced error. 

Kalinina is known for always trying to stay on each rally and produce sharp angles, especially from the forehand. This playstyle is usually a good recipe to beat someone like Parks, who is currently 0-3 against Kalinina, with each loss happening on a different surface (Hard, Clay, and Grass). The American was never able to take a set from Kalinina.

With the momentum and the confidence of beating someone like Kartal just in the 2nd match since her return, I feel like Kalinina will find a much easier path to victory against Parks.

Good luck!</td></tr>

Wager: 2 units

⚽️Bundesliga, Union Berlin vs RB Leipzig, 12/12/25 Fri, 2:30 pm Eastern Time

Explanation: Leipzig is coming in near top of the standings come with 9 wins, 2 draws, 2 losses and a +15 goal difference (28 scored, 13 conceded) through 13 games, while Union is not doing too well in 12th place, with just 4 wins, 3 draws, 6 losses and a negative goal difference. Also Berlin is in bad form losing there last 3 while Leipzig has won 3 of there last 4 with a draw as there non win.

Leipzig is generating about 1.77 expected goals for (xG) per game and allowing only 1.39 xG against, so they consistently create more and better chances than they concede, whereas Union are around 1.3 xG for and 1.5 xG against. 

Also, Leipzig is averaging roughly 16–17 shots per match compared to Union’s 12, which matters because over 90 minutes that shooting volume plus higher xG per shot tends to translate into at least one or two “big” chances created, which is crucial to score the goals necessary to win. 

Leipzig’s high-tempo, vertical attacking style,  pressing and pace in transition are exactly the recipe for them to win this match.</td></tr>

Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Luke Littler u5.5 180’s❌

My theory was correct but maybe my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> was flawed. Littler came out to a slow start, and the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> looked good with only 1 180 in the first set, however, Labansuskas put up way more of a fight than I expected giving Littler more legs with darts in his hands, leading to too many chances for 180’s. Onto the next. 

Event: PDC World Championship (Darts) : Niels Zonneveld v. Haupai Puha 7:30am EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Niels Zonneveld -1.5 (-130), 2u to win 1.5u

Write Up: Puha has not looked good recently, losing his last 6 matches all by a good chunk. Zonneveld is coming off a loss to Nick Kenny in the players championship finals, however he averaged a 92.41 in that match and had 19 100+ throws in 10 legs. Zonneveld was just unable to hit his doubles, which I think will be corrected coming into the World Championship. Zonneveld and Puha have gone H2H twice this year, 6-1 Zonneveld and 5-6 Puha. However I feel Puha’s downtrend and Zonneveld’s consistency could allow Zonneveld to even take this match in straight sets.</td></tr>

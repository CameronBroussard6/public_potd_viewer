<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Newcastle ML vs Wolves 3U (-143)

Write Up: 

Just to note. I don&#x27;t bet personally but I just like predicting sports so make of that what you will lol.

In their last 3 games in the PL, Newcastle have beaten Burnley, Palace and Leeds. All teams in the bottom half.of the table. Now they face Wolves who are dead bottom. 

A win for Newcastle takes them into UCL qualifying spots so I see them fielding a string team and being too much for Wolves.

Newcastle should win!</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>Record: 75-48(+28.134)

Last Pick: Chelsea ML v Brentford

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: Newcastle ML v Wolves 

Competition: Premiership

Sport: Football

Odds: 7/10

Reasoning: Newcastle’s underlying numbers are stronger across goals scored, goal difference and recent form, while Wolves are bottom-three, conceding heavily and struggling to sustain results. Newcastle also arrive with a near first-choice spine and momentum from recent performances, whereas Wolves’ home record and recent points return don’t offset their defensive issues. On data, form and structural quality, Newcastle should control the game and generate the clearer chances, making them to win the logical call.

**NBA: Magic v Grizzlies - Anthony Black under 25.5 PRA** **2U** $1.90 (Bet365) 4:00AM AEDT

Last game was an exhibition in Berlin for the Wagner brothers tour. Now it&#x27;s in London @ the O2. Most of the games that have played there have gone *under* the league&#x27;s average PPG for that season. 

It&#x27;s an exhibition game in what the NBA sees as one of their key target markets outside of China. With 4 days break between to travel back to the US, I expect the Magic to play their superstars heavy minutes. 

Being an exhibition game and a B2B, it would not surprise me at all if the Grizzlies end up winning this second leg. 

That said, Black performed above his season averages against a team that *shouldve* been pretty good at guarding his style of play - top 10 in transition and spot up defense. 

PGs rarely stack up rebounds against teams with Ja Morant and with Franz expected to log heavier minutes, the ball is out of Black&#x27;s hands a bit so the assists should dip too.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:**  (Newcastle - 1.75) &amp; (Aston Villa - 1.6)   1U @ 2.8

**Write Up:** Bottom of the league Wolves host Newcastle <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, with Newcastle winning the last 3 EPL games and Wolves going unbeaten in their last 4 matches. All 10 of these previosu match ups have seen both teams score, looking like a goal heavy game?!! Wolves&#x27; defence has been weak and inconsistent this season, alongside Newcastle&#x27;s only growing attacking strength through Harvey Barnes showing recent quality. I don&#x27;t think Wolves will be able to keep up with the pace of play of Newcastle <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, thus leading to a Newcastle win. 

  
Aston Villa are currently on an 11 game win streak at home at at Villa Park. Whilst Everton have lost 1 of their last 5 games on the road. Everton&#x27;s 3 game winless streak including an FA Cup last week alongside having lost the last 4 times these teams have met suggest that Villa will have that edge <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.</td></tr>

Write up:

Al Riyadh are in horrible form. They are on a 9 game winless run (3 draws, 6 losses). At home they are winless in their previous 3 games (1 draw, 2 losses).

Al Taawon is doing much better. In their previous 10 games they only last 2 (6 wins, 2 draws). Those two losses came against Al Ahli and Al Ittihad, two teams that have more star power than Al Taawon. Both games were highly competitive and they only lost with a 1 goal difference. Also on the road they are doing well. In their previous 9 road games they only lost 2, which ended a 7 game unbeaten run on the road (6 wins, 1 draw). Again, those 2 losses came against Al Ahli and Al Ittihad, which were close games.

AC Milan is also in great form. They are undefeated in their previous 19 Serie A games. This means that out of the 20 league games they have played this season they only lost once (the first game of the season). In the other games they won 12 and drawed 7. At home they have 6 wins, 3 draws and 1 loss.

Lecce is on a 5 game winless run (1 draw, 4 losses). They are one of the worst road teams in the league. They only won twice on the road so far (2 draws, 5 losses). Moreover they are on a 4 game winless run on the road (3 losses, 1 draw).

Milan also owns the H2H; AC Milan have won 12 of their last 13 home matches against Lecce in all competitions.

AC Milan have scored at least 2 goals in their last 14 home matches against Lecce in all competitions.</td></tr>

**Recap:** 

Another winning day. Fortuna scored very early in the game and PSV had to put in more energy than they would have liked. 

They did manage to get there and score later in the second half to take the win and get me closer to positive units after my horrendous start to 2026. 

**Write Up:** 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> Lyon take on Brest, a match that earlier in the season ended 0-0. In that game Lyon received a red card in the 7th minute. Now they are at home and that is a whole different story. 

Look at these records and goal difference 

Brest at home - 4-3-2 with 14-11 in goals 

Brest away - 2-1-5 with 9-16 in goals. 

Lyon at home - 6-0-2 with 14-6 in goals 

Lyon away - 3-3-3 with 11-11 in goals 

With these records and stats I already like this bet a lot. Let&#x27;s dive in a little bit deeper though. 

Lyon lost at home to PSG due to a 90+5 winner and to Toulouse due to 2 goals in the 87th and 90+6 minutes. These are their only home losses so far this season. 

Lyon are very strong at home whilst Brest lose away from home more often than not and especially to &quot;bigger&quot; teams in Lens (3-1), Toulouse (2-0), Marseille (3-0) and Rennes (3-1) 

I expect Lyon to do the same to Brest <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> and feel confident in another win. 

Back to back green days. Love to see it and love to continue it for as long as possible.

**Last:** Jaylen Brown u38.5 pts + ast (-124) DraftKings 1.5u ❌


**Event:** NBA: Trailblazers @ Kings 9:00 PM EST


**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Shaedon Sharpe u26.5 pts (-122) DraftKings 1.5u


**Write-up:** Sorry for anybody who tailed the last pick. Jaylen shot damn near 50% with 30 FGA. He’s only had like four 40-point games all season, and that was one of them. It happens. Let’s bounce back here.


I bet on Sharpe last night to go under, and it hit. I’m going back to it tonight as well. One of my favorite plays for this slate. Sharpe has gone under in 32/39 games this season… an insane 82%. 18/20 and 9/10 recently. In his last five H2H with the Kings, he is also 5/5.


I don’t know if the bookies are slow to adjust this line, but it has been just a little too high all season. He’s hitting the under so consistently. Tonight he’s on a back-to-back, and he has yet to surpass 25 points during those games. Also, with everybody that is expected to be out or injured, he has gone under 8/8 times. 


His matchup is against this Kings… who haven’t been great to say the least. They’ve been horrific, but they finally found something last week. They had some statement games versus reputable opponents in: Rockets, Lakers, Knicks, and (not so much) the Wizards. They won every game by double digits. All of those teams have some elite scorers as well. They were able to keep LeBron and Durant at 22/23 points(SG/SF), while not a single Wizard made it to 20. Last week, Sacramento allowed the 5th fewest points per game coupled with the ability to throw opponents shots off, allowing 45% of shots to be made against them (9th best in the league). Sacramento ranks 6th in defending the SG position. Shaedon Sharpe likes mixing some threes into his shot selection, which is going to be great since the Kings are defending the three incredibly well right now. Kings are only allowing 24.3% of threes to go in. That number is INSANE. They also just got Sabonis back, so that should help the interior defense if he looks to drive.


Kings should look to build upon their success and make a run here before all star break. Hard to tell if they are trying to make it back into playoff contention. Either way I cannot deny how good they’ve played recently and how their defense has stepped up. Let’s take the under 🥃.


Hopefully we get back into the win column here! As always, good luck, fellas. 🍀</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>:** Belgian Pro League, Dender vs. Antwerp, X2 + U3.5g (1.78), 3.5u

**Time:** 3:00 PM GMT

**Write Up:**   
\- Antwerp are on a strong run and very in form. 4 wins in last 5 league games, 2nd lowest conceded tally, decent-ish attack in the Jupiler. A win here pushes them into a playoffs spot.

\- Dender are mismatched. The worst attack in the league and the worst defense, but the catch here is that the defense isn&#x27;t irredeemably bad, the belgian league just happens to have low quality gaps and they&#x27;ve only conceded 4 more than Zulte Waregem who are 9th in the league.

\- Another thing is that Dender are a little more redeemable at home. They&#x27;re not a good team, but they&#x27;re not going to get annihilated fully because they&#x27;re a little reliable. In fact, it&#x27;s 1.35 for Antwerp win or draw, which is decent odds considering this is efficient playoffs tier team vs. mismatched 2nd division team.

\- Bookmakers are strongly protecting the u3.5 line. Odds for it are 1.29, and under 4.5 is 1.09. Combine their confidence with this knowledge on why Dender can&#x27;t win, and you have a very strong combo bet in X2+U3.5g or even the X2+U4.5g at 1.50 (which is high enough odds to be <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> eligible, but personally I&#x27;ll risk it for the extra .28)

Writeup: Parisi is a versatile player who can play on the wing or as a wingback, he’s been lining up on the right wing for Fiorentina in recent matches and is expected to continue in that role here. Parisi had two shots in Fiorentina’s 1-1 draw with AC Milan last time out, with Fiorentina having 20 shots in total in that clash. Both of Parisi’s attempts found the target. (if u wanna take a huge risk, SoT 1+ would not be a bad one). Parisi has had nine shots across his nine starts in Serie A this season (1.07 per 90).

**Event**: Diegem vs. Sporting Hasselt (⚽️ Belgium National Division 1 - VV)

**Time**: 15:00 local time

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>**: (First half result / second half result) Sporting Hasselt / Sporting Hasselt 

**Odds**: 1.97 (Napoleon Sports)

**Stake**: 1u to win 1.97u

Hi there 👋. Been watching from the shadows for years, decided to start sharing some picks. I’ll be posting limited to Belgian football and cycling.

Let’s get to it. Anything short of the title and promotion to the 2nd division would be considered a failure for Sporting Hasselt.

They came close last season and responded by strengthening an already very strong squad. Key additions include **Tibe Vanhaeren**, who was one of the most dangerous attackers in the league, and **Tuur Dierckx**, an experienced former Belgian 1st division player. Dierckx may be past his peak, but his experience is a clear upgrade.

The expectations do match reality. Hasselt sit **1st in the league** with a **+35 goal difference** and lead 2nd place by 3 points with two games in hand.

Now Diegem. They’re newly promoted from the Belgian 4th division, and started the season with 4 straight losses, and while results have stabilized, the overall picture is still poor. Diegem are **second-to-last**, with a **-7 GD**, and **at home they’re the worst team in the league: -8 GD and only 5 points**.

Diegem don’t look ready for this game. After the winter break, Diegem’s own coach admitted that **what he saw in training was alarming, saying that “if the players perform like this on Sunday it will be a disaster”**.

Hasselt have every reason and tool to make a statement here, especially in the first game after winter break.

Edit: First time posting so still figuring out layout.

Edit 2: Rewrote in my own words.</td></tr>

Event: Magic vs. Grizzlies, 12pm

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Franz Wagner over 25.5 points/rebounds/assists

Odds: -120 Fanatics

Reasoning: This is Wagner&#x27;s second game back from injury, but he played 27 minutes his first game back, so I expect something similar <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. In that game on Thursday, he had 29 PRA. And, during the 23 previous games this season (minus the Knicks game in December when he got injured 7 minutes in), he&#x27;s covered 26 PRA in 21 of those games. I&#x27;m actually not sure if Wagner is a PF or SF, but the Grizzlies defense sucks either way. The opposing team&#x27;s PF&#x27;s average 37.72 PRA against them, and the SF&#x27;s average 36.28 PRA.</td></tr>

Todays <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: **Langreo v Deportivo Fabril: Deportivo Fabril ML @1.86**

Writeup: Yes this is Deportivo La Coruna B.  They are a very good team in their own competitive league, and they play with senior teams where they lead the table.  The will be playing Langreo (13th and in relegation) have struggled to score (1.2 gpg) and leak goals (o1.4 gpg) – well below league attacking norms and above defensive averages. Deportivo La Coruña II sit top of the table, averaging 2.4 gpg and conceding only 0.8 gpg, far outperforming league averages on both ends. Expect a high‑scoring away win, with over 2.5 goals likely.

Langreo have won only twice at home, both to relegation battlers.  Deportivo have only lost once away and average more than 3.11 goals in their away games. I will be betting Deportivo win this game.

This is an ODI format match, which lowers the chances of ducks. Batters have enough time to settle in and build an innings without rushing. Both teams have good batting lineups, and the bowling attack is not overly threatening to force a first-ball dismissal. There were no ducks in the first two matches played, and we played it as <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> for the second match. Let&#x27;s hope we cash this once again.

Write up: I’ll begin by saying I understand how good the Texans defense is. Don’t reply to this mentioning that please and thanks. Bottom line is Stroud lost his WR1. I get they have Christian Kirk but the reality is his production from last game won’t be replicated. Only reason he did what he did was cause all eyes were on Collins. And I understand what they did to the Steelers offense but let’s be honest, the fire power on this Patriots team along with the coaching, is much greater. The Texans don’t have a strong enough run game to stay in this game for long. The Patriots defense also isn’t anything to brush over. They just came off a full on annihilation against the Chargers and I expect similar here. The Texans defense will make its presence known but it won’t be enough by the end of the game. Back the Patriots here. Let me know if you’re tailing and let’s finish this weekend the right way. Thanks everyone.

Write Up: Steve Smith is in top form after smashing one of the quickest centuries in the competition&#x27;s history in the last game. The standard of bowling in the Big Bash cannot be compared to the standard of big bash. He’s just seeing the ball too well. The bowling attack for the Brisbane Heat is too young. We saw last game Smith take advantage of the inexperienced bowlers, smashing 34 off an over in the power surge.

Senators on B2B after playing a OT with short rest time  
James Reimer in net for Ottawa

Sens travel from Ottawa after an OT to Detroit where they play tomorrow at 5pm EST, the Sens are alright on b2b&#x27;s but Reimer is not a NHL caliber goalie in my opinion. He let in 6 goals in his AHL warmup game on 28 shots so I believe a Red Wings team who can put 3.20 goals per game away on a A tier goalie will be able to bury 4-5 tomorrow. As for defending, Gibson has been amazing recently allowing just 1.79 GAA, if the Wings can stay out of the box they can secure an easy 2 points as they push for 1st seed in the Atlantic division while Tampa Bay has to play Dallas to get their points. You can play this without Raymond to get a point but if the Red Wings win I expect him to be a main reason of offense scoring 32 points in 24 home games, as well as their has been some odd OT&#x27;s happening recently (around 1 of 3 games) per being part of hockeys randomness.

XP total is a safer play than his O/U kicking points (7.5 @ -110) given this is the playoffs &amp; the weather report, they may go for it more on 4th down making his FG total (1.5 @ -200) harder to hit. Implied probability for this line is 59.5%, which has some value. Not offered at all books, but will be under D/ST if available. BOL.</td></tr>

Before the playoffs started, I felt pretty good about the Texans going far in the playoffs. However, I do think losing Nico Collins is a huge deal for this team. Both teams have really strong defenses, but without Nico Collins I see the Texans really struggling to move the ball on offense and could see them struggle to get to their implied team total of 18 points.

On the other side of the ball, I like the Patriots offensive weapons more as the season goes along. For the most part, they are fully healthy and I see them being able to eclipse that 20 point implied team total.

Good Luck!</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>⭐️:🏈Patriots -3 (-118) \[BallyBet\]

Start Time &amp; TV 3:00pm EST (ESPN)

Units: 3.5 Units

Reasoning: For Sundays <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick of the day</mark> well be heading to Foxborough, Massachusetts for this AFC divisional playoff matchup between the 2 seed New England Patriots (15-3) against the 5 seed Houston Texans (13-5). I like going with New England in this one because this Patriots offense is extremely more efficient than this Texans defense. These Patriots rank higher in overall yards per game coming in 3rd in the NFL with 380 yards per contest compared to the Texans coming in 18th place with 325 yards per game, their passing game is more efficient ranking 4th in passing yards per game while the Texans rank 14th, their rushing game is much more effective ranking 6th in the league while the Texans rank 22nd in the NFL with a rushing game that can be stagnant at times and an offense that is 2nd in the league in scoring putting up 29 points per game while the Texans come in 13th place with 23 points per contest. In terms of offensive DVOA these Patriots rank 3rd in the NFL while the Texans rank in 19th place and these Patriots have a yard per play differential of +1.11 while Houstons yard per play differential is only +0.47. This Patriots team is also paired with a very solid defense as this Patriots defense ranks top 10 in most defensive metrics and they rank 9th in the league in passing yards allowed per game, 6th in the league in rushing yards allowed per game and 4th in the league points allowed per game only allowing 18 points per game. CJ Stroud did not do a good job taking care of the ball last game as he turned the ball over three times so I can see this Patriots defense forcing more turnovers out of him in this one and he will be without his top receiving target in this game as Nico Collins is out with a concussion as he leads the team in receptions, receiving yards, yards per catch and receiving touchdowns so I see that effecting their passing game in this one. I see the Patriots moving onto the AFC Championship game with a win here at home in front of their fans.

Prediction: 26-17 Patriots

Last pick:🏈49ers +14/Broncos +7💩I cant even believe this 49ers team beat the Eagles last week with how they played.

Best of luck to everyone tailing and remember to bet responsibly! Lets cap off this weekend with a nice playoff dub!!🍀💜🐉

<tr><td class='post'>Record 5-0

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Rockets -12 **(I Bought down to a push as 13 feels much)**

I hate big lines like this but I feel like this one can be justified, I think .

The last time these teams met the Pelicans actually won in overtime by 5. Here&#x27;s the catch in overtime, the rockets were leading by 25 and just completely choked in the last quarter. And guess who was responsible for it, Herb Jones and a legacy game from Saddiq Bae. This was also during the 5 game win streak at home, when they were on fire. Now though? Not so much.

Rockets on the other hand are a stinky team rn, but that&#x27;s the best part. What else better for a .500 team who also is 13-3 at home to bounce back from. Also this match up is heaven for the rockets, they suck at threes and score mainly within the paint. Pelicans are one of the worse teams to guard the paint as Derrick Queen is a rookie center who isn&#x27;t a 7 footer or rim protector and Missi is also not an amazing protector. Amen, Sengun and KD will absolutely eat this team alive and this team has always shut down Zion Williamson. With no defensive goat aka Herb Jones, I think KD and Sengun will be able to single handley win this game. If you really want to be safe you can wait for Tari Easen to be confirmed if hes in or out as well.</td></tr>

Event: Texans at Patriots 


<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Treveyon Henderson over 8.5 carries (-120), 1 unit (always 1 unit) 


Write Up: posted this in the Saturday thread like a moron. 


Most obvious evidence in favor of this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> is that he&#x27;s gone over this total in 10 of the last 11 games. Henderson has come on in the 2nd half of the season, and the Patriots are using him more and more. 


I thought about going over on his 32.5 rushing yards total, but the Houston defense is amazing, and especially so in their last 3 games (only 71 yards allowed per game!), so I&#x27;m taking the attempts route. It&#x27;s also supposed to be snowing all day in Boston tomorrow, and I think that makes for more rushing attempts but lower rushing averages. I may end up regretting it, but attempts seems more likely to hit. 


New England ranks #6 in the league in rushing attempts per game with 29. Houston ranks #2 with 23 rushing attempts allowed per game. Part of that is winning a lot of games, which means the other team spends a lot of the game passing to keep up or in NE&#x27;s case, they&#x27;re winning and therefore run a lot. Even if they meet in the middle with 25 attempts, I think Henderson can easily get 9 of those. 


Between the weather making more rushes likely and TH going over this number 10/11 games, I think it&#x27;s a safe bet he&#x27;ll clear. He&#x27;s averaged 13 rushes per game the last 11, and I just don&#x27;t see New England falling behind enough to abandon the running game (I think they win). Other than somehow getting blown out, I think TH gets his normal carries or even more from the snowy weather. 


Treveyon Henderson over 8.5 rushes.

&amp; Zylan Cheatham 9+ Rebounds @ 2.41

It&#x27;s going to be the Perth Hoopfest Bryce Cotton show at the RAAC Arena once again, but this time the fivetime MVP doesn&#x27;t have to put a dagger in the Wild Cats fan side (his former team) doing it for Adelaide against Perth, because this time he can do it against Southeast Melbourne, which is much more enjoyable for them to watch. Now Bryce Cotton has put up 25 plus points against Southeast Melbourne at RAC Arena in the last 10 games, and if he&#x27;s going to do it, he&#x27;s going to do it from the three-point line. So I’m backing him with good odds at 3 plus threes for the match. Now, Southeast Melbourne live and die by the threepoint shot. They have taken over 130 more three point attempts and have actually made 45 more three pointers than anyone else in the league. That&#x27;s huge. But they come up against Adelaide who have the best opposition three point percentage in the league and also have
the best three point shooting percentage in the league. So it&#x27;s why Adelaide have beaten them twice this season. They&#x27;ll shut down their three point shooting which opens up the door for another prop in Zylan Cheatham. He&#x27;s had 13 and 15 rebounds in the two games that he&#x27;s played against Adelaide. He basically just sits underneath the rim and watches them miss their three point shots and cleans up the scraps. So 9 plus rebounds for Cheatum, which is his daily effort these days and shouldn’t be a sweat.

Tennis | Australian Open (M) | 9:50 PM EST (estimated)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Stan Wawrinka vs Laslo Djere | **Djere ML at -102 (FD). 1 unit.**

Write-up: Korda and Zheng are set to take the court in 5-6 hours, but I already have a new <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> for tomorrow, so I&#x27;ll update my record when that one finishes.

There&#x27;s no doubt that Stan Wawrinka will attract a big crowd at this year&#x27;s Australian Open. The 40-year-old 3-time Slam champion recently announced that this will be his last year and tour, and he was granted a well-deserved main draw wildcard as a result. Wawrinka started the year well at the United Cup, as he was able to play multiple strong players quite close, but the best-of-5 slam format is a different beast. Different players decline in different ways as their careers wear on - some retain much of their endurance, but start to drop off in terms of agility and explosiveness, whereas some can still come close to their old level for a set or two but then drop off quickly after. To me, Wawrinka falls into the latter category. His last couple years on tour have been mixed, but one constant has been faltering as matches go to three sets and beyond. Since the start of 2024, Wawrinka has only managed a combined 7-21 record in matches that went the distance, several at the Challenger level. He has also gone just 2-6 in the best-of-five format in that span; both of those wins were more than a year ago, and they came against a nearly retired Andy Murray and an inexperienced Charles Broom. While Stan deserves respect as a former champion here in Melbourne, he has also lost in the first round in four consecutive cracks at this event (2025, 2024, 2023, 2021). 

Of course, it would only be fair to note that Djere has a 1-8 record in AO main draws, but he does have some more recent wins under his belt (Heide in 2025 qualies, Bergs in 2023 MD). Djere had a somewhat disappointing 2025 that was partly the result of injury disruptions, but he got this campaign to a solid start in Hong Kong, beating Ymer and Nava in qualifying. Sure, he proceeded to get smacked around by a resurgent Giron, but I thought his short price (+120) was a sign that the market has some newfound confidence in him. Djere&#x27;s slightly enlongated groundstrokes are most effective on clay, but he his strong serve and flat backhand give him a decent floor on hard courts. He also won the most recent meeting between these two players in Belgrade 2024, at a time when Stan was making waves on indoor hard. The market has already pushed him down from a +114 opening priced in this match, and I believe it is for good reason. Djere&#x27;s form is nothing incredible, and nobody expects him to make a deep run here, but he has the game, and more importantly the legs, to beat a 40-year-old in a grueling best-of-5 match.</td></tr>

**Liga MX | Tigres vs. Toluca**

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Toluca -1 Goals (-130) (pending result)

—---------------------------------------------------------------

**Liga Portugal | FC Porto vs. Vitória Guimarães**

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** FC Porto -1 Handicap (-122)

Porto’s defensive consistency has been unreal — just **4 goals conceded in 17 league matches** tells you everything you need to know about how disciplined and structured this side is. They control games, limit chances, and rarely allow opponents to build momentum.

They’ve also been nearly flawless in terms of results. Porto has **only tied once all season**. That result feels more like an outlier than a trend, especially with Porto’s current form and control in matches.

Vitória is a solid side, but this is still a massive step up in class. Porto’s ability to dictate tempo, apply sustained pressure, and stay defensively sound makes the **-1 handicap at -122** a strong number.

If Porto gets ahead, they’re built to see it through — and often add another.

Backing the quality, the structure, and the consistency here.

***Colby Parkinson o19.5 Rec Yds (-114) 1.25u***

The divisional round finishes up this Sunday with an enticing match up full of **prop-tions** - as much of a Kyren Williams Stan as I am, for me Matt Stafford’s security blanket is the easy choice

Easy and upfront: **Colby has covered this 8 games in a row &amp; 9 of his last 10, averaging 3.7 targets per game, and 27.6 yards on 2.8 receptions**. Matt Stafford has always relied on having a 4th option for safety reasons dating back to his Lions days, and in the recent development of the Rams offense, Park has been a piece of that puzzle: **A consistent enough 9.4% target rate - but he’s a very solidly targeted 19.0% in the red zone** - rates that shouldn’t deviate despite the return of Davante Adams.

Bears pass D? **25th in the league**. Bears against TEs? **They gave up the 8th most receptions &amp; 14th most yards** - not exactly awful, but a combination that seems drawn up perfectly for the Parkinson’s short to mid cut routes.

Depending on how far back you wanna reference, Parkinson has recent “success” against the Bears: Week 4 last season, **4 receptions on 7 targets for 33 yards**. Pretty much all we need. We’ll take a copy/paste game plan for this one. 

Last play review:

Buffalo Bills +3.5 (-167) 2u ✅

(What, a, game - I guess the reality is everything I predicted for this game came to fruition: if Buffalo was going to lose this game, it was going to come down to Josh Allen protecting the ball, the running game being effective, and despite both being good enough for us to cover, they weren’t good enough to win it all. Huge graduation game for Denver, and win number 20 for me!)

Villa Park has become a fortress this season, and Villa have won their last 8 home matches, scoring 18 goals in those matches, averaging over 2 goals per game. I expect Villa to take care of business again here <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. 

But that&#x27;s not our play, we&#x27;re backing Watkins to find the back of the net.

If you step back to last season, Watkins scored 3 goals vs Everton - 2 at home and 1 away. 

To sum it up, I&#x27;m backing a striker in form, who has a great track record scoring vs Everton, on a team that plays incredibly well at home. BOL and happy Sunday!</td></tr>

**Write Up:** We&#x27;re not done until I say we&#x27;re done. I really believe <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> is going to be the day my Barcelona fade strikes gold. Real Sociedad have really picked up their form, remaining **unbeaten in the last three LaLiga games** (including a draw against a strong Atletico Madrid side) and they&#x27;ll be looking to cause another upset at home against Barcelona. The recent *H2H really doesn&#x27;t look too promising with 4 losses in the last 5,* but they did record a 1-0 win in late 2024, while the losses were pretty bearable for the most part. **Barcelona didn&#x27;t look too good against a second division side** in the cup a couple of days earlier and they&#x27;re going to be feeling the effects of that game <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> - in fact, they&#x27;re probably still a bit **fatigued from the Super Cup madness** and this all aids our case. I feel this match should stay fairly close with both sides finding the back of the net (here&#x27;s your BTTS angle) and the Asian Handicap of +1.0 gives us some cushion in case Barcelona turn up. I feel a fine game coming from **Mikel Oyarzabal** in attack, as the Spain international has already registered **five goals and three assists** this season.

**Write Up:** As a Blues fan, this has been my lock all season and all season has it delivered. The Blues have sucked but Justin Faulk has had incredible offensive production with averaging 1.9 SOG this season. With Justin&#x27;s last 5 games has had 2/4/0/3/4 SOG. With Robert Thomas being out, the team will be looking for their second highest goal scorer for offensive some more offensive production. BOL</td></tr>

AEK vs Panathinaikos, over 2.5 goals @ 2.02

The Athens derby between AEK and Panathinaikos promises a fast, aggressive contest with goals expected. AEK typically push the tempo at home, creating plenty of chances, while Panathinaikos have the attacking depth to respond and exploit spaces on the break. Derbies bring intensity, mistakes, and set-piece opportunities, all of which favor scoring. With both teams needing points and rarely settling for caution, over 2.5 goals offers strong value here.</td></tr>

Aston Villa are still on a run at home having won 11 in a row at Villa Park. With City and Arsenal having dropped points this is a huge game for them which they will want to capitalize. Away from home Everton are not too bad (4-2-4) and they have only lost just 1 in their last 5 road games.

Even with all of this they will still be heading into this clash with a 3 game winless streak having even been kicked out of the FA Cup prior to this. In the H2H Villa are even 7-2-1 and at home Villa have won 4 in a row.

Villa have showed that they can get back on track fast, having won their home game immediately after that Arsenal defeat. An 11 game home W streak combined with a 4 game home H2H streak might be too much for Everton <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Atlético ML + Barcelona ML @2.00 (4u) 

**Write-Up:**

Atlético Madrid have been extremely solid at home this season. They’ve won all league games at the Metropolitano except the opener, where they drew against Elche. That’s 8 wins and 1 draw in 9 home league matches. Alavés, on the other hand, struggle badly away from home: in 9 away games, they’ve managed just 1 win, 1 draw, and 7 losses. Atlético’s home dominance combined with Alavés’ poor away form makes this a very favorable matchup for Atlético.

Barcelona have been absolutely demolishing teams this season. They are in amazing form, having won their last 10 matches in all competitions. They currently sit 1st in La Liga with a record of 16 wins, 1 draw, and 2 losses, with all dropped points coming away from home. Real Sociedad are having a disappointing season, sitting 13th, and their recent form reflects that: 1W 2D 2L in their last 5 league games. Their home record is particularly weak, with just 3 wins, 2 draws, and 4 losses, placing them among the poorest home sides in the league this season.

BOLOGNA VS FIORENTINA

Date: 18 JANUARY 2026 at 15:00

BET ON: Both teams to score- Yes

Odd: 1.78



\- Both Bologna and Fiorentina enter this clash with clear attacking intentions but exposed defensive structures that make Both Teams to Score a very logical bet. Bologna’s coach Vincenzo Italiano has repeatedly spoken about his side needing to regain attacking momentum after a difficult run — they’ve shown signs of rediscovering their aggressive pressing and vertical play, but defensive lapses remain a concern, especially with Lucumí still out and rotation needed to manage fitness. Italian commentators note that Bologna’s lines are pushed high and that the team “has been playing with a short attacking blanket”, meaning they can be vulnerable on the break when possession is lost.

\- On the Fiorentina side, Paolo Vanoli has been vocal in Italian media about needing courage and collective effort to change their fortunes, emphasising that his players must be fearless (“bisogna tirar fuori il coltello”) and attacking even under pressure, which suggests a willingness to commit numbers forward rather than sit back. His recent comments also underline a psychological rebuild in the squad — trying to shake off fear and improve in both offensive and defensive phases.

\- Additionally, Vanoli will be suspended and not on the touchline, adding an unusual dynamic that often leads to less rigid in-game defensive organisation from Fiorentina in favour of attacking risk-taking, especially backed by a large contingent of travelling fans eager for goals.

\- Historically this fixture has produced goals (e.g., a memorable 2-2 draw with late Fiorentina equaliser), and with both coaches openly talking about attacking improvements while defensive issues linger, BTTS is strongly supported by tactical intent, motivation and Italian press commentary.</td></tr>

Event: Australian Open R1 🎾

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Francisco Comesana 🇦🇷 -2.5 games handicap vs Patrick Kypson 🇺🇸 5 units to win 4.2U @1.83 (Bet365)

Write-up: With the first grand slam of the season upon us I feel like it’s only right that I go back to my roots.

These odds would make sense to me if Kypson had come through qualifying and therefore adapted to the conditions here in Australia. However, he’s a wildcard and has had the same amount as preparation as Comesana (No. 68). The American is a decent challenger player (No. 116) with very little experience on the pro tour. He had a great end to 2025 going 20-3 and winning two titles. These are challenger events though (despite facing up against decent opposition just isn’t the same as ATP events) and were indoors. The courts this year, just like most years, are moderately fast but you can’t really compare indoors with outdoors too much. Kypson has the basics pretty nailed with a solid all around game but just misses that killer shot to bring him to the top 100. On the ATP tour, he played just one match last year losing to Landaluce in Cincinnati. He has played little BO5 action as well so physically I feel like it’ll be tough for him considering that grand slams are a different beast, playing just two and losing comfortably in both in the first round. Even including qualifying his GS record is just 2-6 on hard courts. Patrick is also 1-2 this year, losing to Nava and Mmoh in qualies of 250 events so it’s not like he’s been bringing his good fantastic form into the new year onto a stage that is closer to the pro tour. 

Meanwhile Comesana is a regular on the tour, having played a pretty full ATP schedule barring two challengers so has a clear experience advantage in a sport where it’s so necessary in terms of conditioning and tactically. Similarly to Kypson he prefers playing on clay with a strong baseline game but with a higher ceiling with his better movement, defence and most importantly experience should mean he takes care of business here. He may only be 5”10 but his serve is sneakily quite good (level with Kypson imo) and is generally just more consistent than his opponent of the day. Obviously not a world beater but a player who has room for improvement and a match-up that I would consider to be favourable to him as he loves dragging out rallies and Patrick isn’t a player who will overpower him to force errors, I expect it to be the other way around as the match goes on as the Argentine’s heavy topspin should weigh on the American’s flatter strokes in the long-term as they’re both more neutral players in their gamestyles. This year he’s opened with a loss to young star Shang, followed by a win over Royer (No. 57) and a competitive loss to Shelton (No. 8) so pretty promising for the play in my opinion. Francisco was “only” 7-10 on hard courts on the tour but picked up some decent wins over the likes of Munar, Opelka, Michelsen, Goffin. The big advantage apart from simply being a stronger player though is clearly his exposure to BO5 tennis, having played nine of these matches. On hard courts Comesana is 3-3 picking up big wins over Humbert (No. 17) and Michelsen (No. 28). His three losses were against Fritz (logical), a brutal 5-setter against Altmaier (No. 101) and a really close match against Norrie (No. 35) at the US open last year. 

Even if Kypson starts well I believe that his 
lack of top competition action will cost him especially with Comesana’s ability to make things physical so I strongly trust in him to cover the spread. My prediction is 3-1 to the Argentine. BOL !</td></tr>

• EV better betting 100$ = 16-17$ for this play

• I don’t understand this line at all, I really wanted to put 3U on Patriots ML but the odds are just terrible - is it just me or do you all think the Patriots should be atleast -5.5 favorites? - I know that Texans defense is legit, one of, if not the best in the league, but man their offense has been BAD, after watching Stroud against the Steelers, and them being without Nico, I just don’t see how they don’t win by at-least 5 here - Patriots defense ranks top 5 in the NFL in PPG, top 10 in total yards, top 5 in rushing yards, and top 10 in passing yards - I don’t need to go into how good the Texans defense because they have proven themselves damn near every game this year - they are just about top 5 in every defensive category - Houston averages about 95 rushing yards on the road, going against a top 5 rush defensive in the Patriots - I can see the Patriots stopping the run early, forcing Stroud to throw the ball most of the game - which, I believe, will lead to a few turnovers - Stroud has thrown 4 interceptions in his last 4 away games - Weather report shows rain and snow, and I think the Patriots are a more comfortable team in the bad weather (obvious observation, I know) - Texans have some OL issues/injuries right now, which will help the Patriots pass rush get to Stroud, like the Steelers did, and hopefully force him to turn the ball over - The over under is low, which suggests this will be a close game throughout because of the two monster defenses - I see the Texans turning the ball over, Texans are without Nico, and I think the Patriots have a edge on offense - I don’t see how Vrabel and the Pats lose here - Patriots -3 for the W

__Event:__ NFL: Rams @ Bears 6:30pm EST

__POTD:__ Luther Burden o37.5 receiving yards (-110), 5u to win 4.55u - __MAX BET__

__Write Up:__ The Rams (13-5) &amp; the Bears (12-6) take the field in the final Divisional Round playoff game on Sunday night in what will be an electric frigid environment in the Windy City. Both the Rams and Bears are here due to closing out games with a late touchdown and then hanging on for the win. The Rams beat the Panthers 34-31, after QB Matthew Stafford threw a TD with 38 seconds left. 5 of the last 7 Rams games have been 1 score games. The Bears also had a comeback after trailing 21-3 at the half &amp; 21-6 going into the 4th qtr. Chicago scored 25 in the 4th with Caleb Williams throwing a 25 yd TD with 1:43 left, ending in a 31-27 over Green Bay. Their 18 point comeback is the largest in playoff franchise history. They have 7 wins when trailing with under 2 mins left in the 4th, most in NFL history. They avg a league high 3.46 points per drive in the 4th this season, compared to 1.96 points per drive in the first 3 qtrs (19th). This season, Williams is averaging 7.5 yards per pass (9th) with 11 TD’s &amp; 2 INT’s in the 4th, ranking 8th in the 4th qtr rating (96.2) &amp; 14th in success rate (42.3%). In the first 3 qtrs Williams is 29th in rating (84.8) &amp; 25th in yards per pass (6.7) with 17 TD’s &amp; 7 INT’s. The Bears rank #1 in 4th qtr points (9.6) averaging 17 in their last 3 games (1st), the next highest team in their last 3 is Houston with 12.7. But the Rams also have done well in the 4th in their last 3, ranking 3rd in points (11.7). The Rams are #1 in the NFL in ppg (30.7). The Bears are 9th at 26.2 ppg. Both rank top 3 in plays per game, averaging 64+. This game features 2 of the most explosive teams in the NFL. The Bears (14.4) &amp; Rams (14.0) are 1st &amp; 2nd in plays per game that gain 10+ yards. The Rams are 2nd in plays gaining 20+ yards (4.8), &amp; the Bears are 4th (4.4). The Bears &amp; Rams both have outstanding offenses. Chicago was 6th in EPA/play (0.07), 9th in EPA/pass (0.08), 4th in EPA/rush (0.06), 9th in success rate (45.24%), &amp; 9th in yards/play (5.7). The Rams were 2nd in EPA/play (0.12), 3rd in EPA/pass (0.22), 11th in EPA/rush (-0.01), 1st in success rate (50.46%), &amp; 1st in yards/play (6.2). However their defenses have been much to be desired. Chicago is 30th in DEF success rate (54.3%). They lead the NFL in takeaway rate per drive (17.2%), but they allow 2.69 points per drive (27th). In the Rams last 7 games, they’ve allowed 2.35 points/drive (23rd), a TD on 28% of possessions (25th), &amp; 5.9 yards/play (30th). Before that, they allowed 1.52 points/drive (3rd), a TD on 14.9% of drives (2nd), &amp; 4.8 yards/play (6th). Thru Week 11 the Rams ranked #1 in scoring defense. Since then they’re 27th, allowing 30+ points in 4 of their last 7. The total for this game opened at 50.5. But dropped down to 48.5 due to the weather. The forecast is predicting 18 degree weather &amp; 20 mph winds. But both of these QB’s have actually done well in cold weather. In Stafford&#x27;s 6 career games in freezing conditions he&#x27;s avg 253 yards with 15 TD’s &amp; just 3 INT’s. Last year in playoffs he played in a snowstorm vs an elite Eagles d &amp; threw for 324 yards &amp; 2 TD’s. As for Williams his QBR climbs to 103.7 in temps below 21 degrees. He has played in 3 games since week 15 in cold weather. In Week 15 it was 9 degrees, facing the #1 pass d in the NFL with a -0.088 EPA per drop back allowed, the Browns, who allowed just 165 passing yards per game (1st). He threw for 242 yards, 2 TD’s, avg 14.23 yards per completion, his 2nd most this year &amp; the 2nd most passing yards the Browns allowed. He then went on to throw for 250 yards 2 TD’s in Week 16 &amp; 361 yards 2 TD’s in playoffs vs the Packers in cold games. GB was the 7th best pass d before that game allowing 185 ypg. I’m not concerned about weather, this will be a shootout. 

In his 1st playoff game, Williams threw for 361 yards &amp; 2 TD’s. Williams has thrown multiple TD’s in 6 straight games. Now he gets a Rams d that allows opponents to pass on 59.68% plays, 8th most. Since Dec the Rams have allowed 9.4 yards/target (27th) &amp; 51 open targets (27th) to WR’s. They just gave up 215 yards to McMillan &amp; Coker. Coker is the slot WR. Rams captain Quentin Lake, a hybrid Safety/CB, came back from an elbow injury last game after being out since Week 11. Lake covers the slot, on 92% of snaps. He got TORCHED by Coker. He had 9 rec, 134 yards &amp; a TD with a catch of 52 yards. The Rams d allows the 3rd most targets to the slot. Luther Burden ran 51% of his routes from the slot last week &amp; had 3 rec for 42 yards on 7 targets. He has 3+ rec in 9 straight games. Last week Williams targeted the slot 16 times for 176 yards &amp; 2 TD’s. Burden has been elite this year avg 2.7 yards per route run, 3rd in NFL. He avg 7.1 yards after catch per rec, 3rd. __Burden has 40+ rec yards in 4 of his last 5, avg 6.6 targets with a 29% target rate &amp; a 23% 1st read rate. He’s averaged nearly 60 receiving ypg since Week 10.__ He has a rec of 25+ yards in 4 of his last 5, including a 40 &amp; 35 yard catch. Burden has been even better vs zone specifically. __The Rams run zone 79.8% of their plays, 3rd most. Burden is the Bears zone beater &amp; the #s are insane:__

On 54 routes vs man -&gt; 2.48 yards per route run (15th), 0.22 targets per rote run (46th), total epa 8.71 (85th), Carch rate 75% (10th), 11.32% target share (87th), 9 receptions (69th), 134 receiving yards (61st), 71 Yards After Catch (23rd), 0 TD’s

On 177 routes vs zone -&gt; 2.89 YPRR (4th), 0.27 TPRR (7th), Total EPA 32.14 (45th), 80.43% Catch Rate (7th), 37 receptions (35th), 511 receiving yards (33rd), 252 YAC (15th), 2 TD’s

__His #s vs zone compared to the other Bears WR’s:__

__Burden:__ 37 rec, 511 yards, 80.43% catch rate, 252 yards after catch, 0.26 targets per route run, 2.89 yards per route run - on just 177 routes!

__DJ Moore:__ 35 rec, 487 yards, 58.33% catch rate!!!, 165 yards after catch, 0.15 targets per route run, 1.20 yards per route run - on 407 routes!

__Rome Odunze:__ 29 rec, 478 yards, 47.54% catch rate!!!, 174 yards after catch, 0.21 targets per route run, 1.63 yards per route run - on 294 routes!

Moore &amp; Odunze have catch rates below 59%, OUTSIDE TOP 100 IN NFL. Plus both are injured &amp; wont be at full speed. TE Loveland is the only pass catcher with more targets, but Rams allow 2nd least yards/target to TE’s. 

The entire world will know Luther Burden’s name after Sunday night.

*Write-Up*:

Sabonis averages around 15+ combined rebounds and assists per game this season, clearing this number comfortably in a typical outing. He’s also been consistently productive against New Orleans, posting strong rebounding and playmaking numbers in the matchup.

The Pelicans are middle tier at best in limiting rebound and assist production to opposing bigs, and Sacramento’s offense continues to run through Sabonis as a primary facilitator. With secure minutes and steady usage, this line sits a bit short of his expected output.</td></tr>

Last Pick: Breeze vs Hive u140.5 at -115 AND Laces ML vs Lunar Owls at -375 || 1.5u at +136 ✅️ || Unrivaled 3v3 Basketball 02/06/26

Alrighty got my first <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> parlay to hit. Breeze vs Hive final score was 70-68 (138 total points) and Laces kept it closer than I expected but still won 74-70 over Lunar Owls. There are two more Unrivaled games <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> before the 1v1 tournament and I&#x27;m taking a similar <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> the last time Rose and Mist played 

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Mist -1.5 point spread vs Rose || 1.0u at -115 on BetMGM || 3v3 Unrivaled Basketball 8:45pm ET

These teams played a couple of weeks ago and Mist won 89-71. I took Mist ML at -128 in that game and liking the same outcome tonight. Mist (6-4) have lost their last two games to tougher opponents (Phantom and Laces) that allow the 2nd and 3rd lowest opponent FG% in Unrivaled. While the Rose (5-5) won their last game against Vinyl (74-66), it was a shaky 4th quarter getting outscored 28 to 12. Rose allow the highest opponent FG% at 50.78% and highest opponent eFG% at 56.87%. In the two games prior to Vinyl matchup, Rose lost to Breeze (81-56) and to Lunar Owls (85-75). This current Mist vs Rose game is still being priced as a toss up. Mist are middle of the pack defensively and Rose&#x27;s offense has the ability to go off at any point. But I&#x27;m taking the more balanced side in Mist. BOL

I had a rough initial <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> run and pre-2026 record is (13-19-2) with -7.76 net units and -15.17% ROI.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: 76ers @ Trailblazers over 118.5 1st half total points (-115)…1 unit

Write Up: The 76ers have an efficient first half offense and regularly close in on 60 points. They tend to tighten defensively in the second half. My concern here would be a cold Portland start. They’re inconsistent and sometimes go sub 50 in the first half. But they typically set a fast pace and then can’t seem to slow opponents down. So even with a cold start, the game still stays loose. Put these two teams together and this stacks up as a solid first half over.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: over 172.5 points in the game, 1.88, 1.5u

The two best teams in this group, theoretically, are Partizan, with a win imperative: if they win more than 13 points, they can take over first place in the group. In the last 7 games of these 2 the winner was always the home team, but I don&#x27;t believe in Partizan this season anymore, or to play against them. They can win anyone, but also lose when it&#x27;s not expected, so I <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> the safer option, points, which seems to be set low.

In the first game in Dubai in November, Partizan was in a big crisis; now they are slowly coming out of it, so the 82-70 score should not repeat. Dubai has a big offensive Potential, as does the home team, so I think this goes above 180.</td></tr>

Cremonese away from home probably have the worst mid/low block structure Ive seen in a while and that shows considering they have 1 win in 10.

NBA | Pistons @ Hornets

Ausar Thompson is one of the best perimeter defenders in the league and he&#x27;s been on an absolute tear stealing the ball lately.

The numbers are hard to argue with:

* 2+ steals in 9 of his last 10 games (only miss: 0 stl u/PHX)
* Currently on a 5-game hit streak
* Averaging 2.8 steals per game over his L10
* Had 3 steals in 26 minutes against Charlotte earlier this season

The matchup is the cherry on top. Charlotte is one of the most turnover-prone teams in the league right now -- averaging 14+ turnovers per game since mid-January. Their primary ball handlers are careless:

Brandon Miller (3.3 TO/g), Coby White (3.2 TO/g), Kon Knueppel (2.7 TO/g), and LaMelo (2.3 TO/g). Opponents are averaging 10+ steals per game against CHA over that stretch.

Ausar&#x27;s role is literally to create havoc in passing lanes. My projection model has him at 2.3 steals tonight with a 63% hit rate at this line.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Thunder -5.5 (-110 to -115 range) | 1.0u

Write Up:
OKC -5.5 is the side I’m playing tonight.

Yes, it’s a weird one on paper because both teams are missing major creators (SGA out / Luka out), but that’s exactly why I like the Thunder here. When games get messy and scoring comes harder, I want the team that can still win possessions, stay organized, and keep pressure on you for 48 minutes.

Why I’m on OKC:
	•	More ways to score without the star. OKC can still generate looks through pace, ball movement, and multiple handlers. They don’t have to rely on one guy bailing them out every trip.
	•	LA’s offense can get sticky. Without Luka, the Lakers can drift into slower possessions and tougher shot quality. If that happens for even a few 3–4 minute stretches, that’s where OKC can create separation.
	•	Depth matters in this spot. Bench minutes + second/third options decide games like this. I trust OKC’s rotation more to keep the same level of effort and execution.

I’m not expecting a blowout, but -5.5 is basically asking for a solid two-possession win. If OKC wins the “extra possessions” battle (turnovers, rebounds, transition chances), they cover.

Projected: Thunder by ~7–10.</td></tr>

**Odds // Units:** DraftKings (-150) 2.5u

**Write-up:** KPJ has got 33 and 38 since he&#x27;s been back. Without Giannis, he is 8/10 on his line. The minutes are steadily going up aswell since he started with a bit of a minute restriction. Magic got scorched in the last game against the Jazz until the Jazz benched all their starters in the fourth for obvious tanking, lmao. JJJ, Markkanen, and most importantly, Collier all reached 30 pra. Magic tend to play isolation defense and force guards to make plays. Guards are seeing higher usage rates against the Magic because of this. They also don&#x27;t defend PNRs the best, which is KPJ&#x27;s main play type. Should see a lot of opportunity come from the PNR with some assists dished out if they collapse onto him. He is mostly driving to the basket off the screens and forcing contact. Plus, he is taking half his shots in the paint or under the basket. Good for us as the Magic have been weak down low all season, and especially in the last week.  On top of that, they are allowing opposing teams to shoot a ton of free throws, where KPJ gets around 20% of his points. Magic in their last ten are ranked 24th in assists allowed and 19th in rebounds allowed. KPJ without Giannis is seeing 18 potential assists + 10 rebound chances a game.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: New Orleans Pelicans ML and Miami Heat ML

This is probably the safest <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> that I made. 

Pelicans are against the Kings who are one of the worst teams in the league, ESPECIALLY ON THE ROAD. 

The Pelicans show more fight than them and are a better team. I just love watching Trey Murphy play. Malik Monk and Lavine are out. 

The next game here is the Heat against the Jazz. We’re comparing a playoff team against a team that is tanking their ass out. I also expect the Heat to win after losing to Boston after leading by 20.  

All Net Adjusted Efficiency comparison are won by both picks by a significant margin.

Let’s all hope for no voodoo shit again like we did last night.

Apologies on that game and hoping we can bounce back on this one.

Game 1 starts at 6:30pm EST. Bet 2.25u

Writeup: In both matchups, we are betting on the better of the two teams who both have similar play styles to their opponent. 

St. John’s goes up against Xavier, and the only thing I like for Xavier in this one is 3 point shooting. Everything else goes in the favor of St. John’s. St. John’s has a top 15 defensive efficiency rating, whereas Xavier is around 100th on offense. Similarly, the St. John’s offense should find success with their 30th ranked offense against Xavier‘s 100 ranked defense. Both teams have a fast paced pace of play, so we’ll take the St. John’s team who is better in nearly every category.

UTRGV should have a closer match on their hands against Nichols, but they are also the better team in this game. Their offense should have a slight advantage against the Nichols defense, but the big advantage here will be the UTRGV defense. They come into this with a top 100 defense, whereas Nichols has an offense ranked around 250. On top of this, UTRGV currently has the 3rd best momentum rating in the league, meaning the difference between their average play and their play now is better than almost everyone in the country. They also play some of their best ball away with a top 20 rating in that department, whereas Nichols ranks 275th when playing at home. The books are pretty much calling this game a toss up, so we’ll give UTRGV a slight cushion for a good price.

&gt;The semi-finals are <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> and USA is facing Italy. The USA looked like the best team throughout the round robin, while Italy are lucky to have made it through to the playoffs based on their performances. USA has the advantage at both positions but Dropkin in particular will be the difference-maker. He has been the best curler on the ice all week. My metrics had USA as the top team in the world coming into the event and they&#x27;ve looked the part so far; Italy is being hugely overrated by the books simply because they won this morning&#x27;s meaningless round robin game. Italy focused on their 4-person teams this year and it has shown at the Olympics. USA were 4-1 against intermediate level teams like Italy this season coming into this event and 29-4 overall.

**Explanation:**

We are trying one of the more risky bets again with a odds 2.1. 

Bertola has had a solid run this year and won against players like Mannarino, Kotov and Huesler. Now he is up against Bertrand who always lost against a WC yesterday and was struggling. I believe Bertola is in his best shape currently and Bertrand shape seems questionable, losing 3 matches in a row before almost losing to a WC who is a 18 year old kid, who is number 1260 in the world.

I believe the odds is too good to not play.

Good luck!

**CET 21:45 Football Liga Portugal**

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>: Porto vs Sporting **over 4,5 goals** at **8** odds

Explanation: We are looking for a final here. One of them is bound to be the winner of the league and the question is which one. Sporting has to do everything here vs Porto, and Porto needs at least a draw to keep Sporting away. They sit currently on 55 points for Porto, and 51 points for Sporting. Benfica is sitting 3rd with 46 points, therefore watching the final here. I can’t say who will win or lose this one, but I do expect an entertaining game with lots of chances and goals from two of the best teams in this league. I also don’t expect these teams to sit back and play slowly, instead watching forward for an all out attacking game. I also learned to not pay too much attention to head to head statistics etc. Another thing to mention is that Sporting has scored the most goals and conceded the second fewest 54-11, and Porto had the best defense so far with 41-6. Meaning conceded the fewest and scored one of the most in this league. But this is a FINAL we are witnessing here. 



On the side note: My tactics won’t change by lowering the odds. The goal is to find high odds to play here. I’m trying to keep track of the results in all of the top leagues. We will **always aim for** **long term** gains here and make sure to manage your bankroll. I will try to post another <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> in the coming days.

Write Up: Now let’s try for the 50th win. Hopefully no one here is superstitious. 

I like the Danish teams, I’ve been having good luck there. AGF (1st place) hosts OB (8th place) - AGF at home is strong, with 6W1D2L while OB away is very mid (3W3D3L). In their last three meetings, AGF has won 2/3, most recent being a 3-1 win in December. AGF did lose against OB while away in December too, but their meeting before that in August, AGF won 5-1.

I’m trying to say that I think AGF will win.

I also like O2.5 goals at 1.7, you might want to look into that. I’m going to place that as a side bet, as long as various small variations of AGF + O1.5, AGF/Draw + O2.5, O3.5 etc - but my main big bet will be AGF to win.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **Domantas Sabonis o7.5 rebounds** (-128); 4 units to win 3.12 units

Write Up:  
This line is just insane. First, the Pelicans are the worst rebounding team in the league. Second, Sabonis physically overpowers both Queen and Missi on the Pelicans. Missi has the vertical athleticism and speed over Sabonis, but Sabonis&#x27; strength on the floor is just too much too handle. In 4 games against the Pelicans last season, Sabonis grabbed 28, 15, 16, and 20 rebounds. In these games, Missi was the Pelicans&#x27; starting center.  
Something to note is that he is currently listed as questionable at the time of this writeup (which could maybe explain why this line is so low). The report says he has lower back inflammation. Not sure how big this is, but if Sabonis chooses to play, I believe this will have no effect. Sabonis has zero pressure to play in games if he isn&#x27;t 100%. The Kings are bad with or without him, so they probably wouldn&#x27;t pressure hurting starters to play. Zach Lavine is sitting out because he has a sore finger. Maybe this is worse than it sounds, but I feel like players have played with worse injuries and still played.</td></tr>

* These first round matchups are super interesting because its the bottom two teams from the best group who we have only seen against the best teams in the league, vs. the best teams in the bad group who have both looked quite strong in their own right. However, I think TES has noticeably improved this split according to both their results as well as the eye test, I think JiaQi is a complete star, while initially expected to be the weak point of TES this split with Jackeylove out, he has had some insane games and monster plays/moments this season, TES solo lanes have gotten back on track a bit, and naiyou has improved from a horrible early start to the split.
* TES are -455 favorites to win the series overall, they have choice in game 1 as well being the higher seed.
* TES average the 4th most kills in the LPL in match wins, at 20.5 kills per map
* WE die the 3rd most in losses in the LPL averaging 21.4 deaths per loss
* WE have lost 7 maps this split and allowed O 17.5 kills in 100% of those losses</td></tr>

Last POTD: __Alperen Sengun O8.5 Rebs @1.74 1U__ ✅

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: __Isaiah Hartenstein O11.5 RA @1.76 (Bet365) 1U__

NBA | Lakers vs OKC | 🏀  

Beast performance by Sengun who ends with a tripple double, love it when the good reads actually ends up cashing

Watching the OKC game for the Sengun bet, I was really interested to see how OKC would manage without Shai, Jdub and Ajay Mitchell as they’re basically their main creators &amp; all of them were out. Shai is still out and so is Ajay, but Jdub is not on the injury report and is potentially playing his first game after missing 10 games.

They’re missing their primary ball handlers and Jdub could be limited. First game without Shai this season for Ihart was against the Rockets last game where he had 19 RA, and the game prior he dropped a 20 RA tripple double performance against the Magic where Ajay and Jdub was sidelined. 

Hes taken the roll beautifully of running the offense these past two games and has cleared this line significantly, had 11 assists on 13 potentials last game not counting the handoffs as potentials where he gets a lot of his dimes from.

Lakers have been a good rebounding team and maybe aren’t the best matchup for rebounds, but we’ve still seen bigs with good rebounding numbers lately against them

KAT 13, Allen 9, Vucevic 11, Zubac 19 etc..

Since joining the OKC, Ihart has had 8, 15, 6 &amp; 18 rebounds against the Lakers.. facing Ayton who isn’t a stretch big should make him stay close to the rim for rebounds, not to mention his activity on the offensive glass.

Has cleared this 11.5 RA line in 2/4 against them but again, that’s with Shai playing where the assist upside hasn’t been there. Without Shai and Ajay, Ihart will as I mentioned run the offense in large parts of the game and we’ve seen the assist numbers as of late that backs it up. Love the assist upside, and we’ve seen him clear this in rebounds alone in numerous games this season

Minutes have been ramping up after his return so upside there aswell, overall a spot I like for Hartenstein here.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>: Spain | La Liga 2 | 2pm Eastern | Racing Santander vs Mirandés | Racing to win and Over 1.5 goals | 3U @ -117

Racing Santander enter this matchup with a clear structural advantage, particularly at home, where they have been one of the more reliable attacking sides in the Segunda División. Their home performances are defined by consistent chance creation, sustained possession in the final third, and an ability to score early, which often forces opponents into more open game states. Racing have scored in virtually every home match this season and average close to two goals per game at El Sardinero, making them well positioned to control the tempo and scoreboard.

Mirandés, by contrast, continue to struggle away from home. Their road form is marked by defensive instability, especially against teams that press high and attack through wide areas—an approach Racing use effectively. Mirandés concede regularly on their travels and rarely keep games tight for a full 90 minutes, which increases the likelihood of Racing finding multiple scoring opportunities. Even when Mirandés remain competitive, they often allow high-quality chances that eventually translate into goals.

From a goals perspective, this matchup strongly supports over 1.5 total goals. Racing matches routinely clear this line due to their scoring consistency and willingness to commit numbers forward, while Mirandés games also trend higher because of their defensive concessions. Historical meetings between the two sides further reinforce this pattern, with most encounters producing at least two goals.

Taken together, Racing’s superior home form, stronger attacking output, and Mirandés’ away defensive weaknesses point toward a Racing Santander victory in a match that realistically surpasses 1.5 total goals.</td></tr>

Last Pick: Furman -12.5 vs UNCG

Result: LOSS ❌ (Furman lost by 3)

Furman didn’t cover the –12.5 largely because the game never developed the type of possession separation a double-digit favorite needs. While Furman actually shot slightly better overall (43% vs 42%) and dominated points in the paint (32–18), that advantage was neutralized by UNCG’s three-point efficiency gap — UNCG hit 10 threes at 53%, while Furman went just 5-for-19 (26%) from deep. That alone erased Furman’s interior edge and kept scoring compressed.

Add in nearly identical foul counts, similar free-throw volume, and limited fast-break scoring, and there was no late-game scoring accelerator to stretch the margin. Furman controlled the game for most of the night (led 79% of the time), but without perimeter shot-making or turnover-driven runs to create distance, control never translated into separation — resulting in a straight-up loss that never seriously threatened the spread.

Yale @ Howard
Time: 7:00 PM

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Under 147.5 

Odds: -115 (DraftKings)

Write-Up:

Yale–Howard sets up as a matchup where game flow and structure matter more than raw scoring potential. Yale consistently plays with strong pace discipline, prioritizing half-court execution, shot quality, and clock management. That approach naturally limits possessions and reduces scoring swings, especially against teams that are more comfortable playing in rhythm than pushing tempo. When Yale controls the pace, games tend to settle into longer offensive possessions and fewer transition opportunities.

From a broader profile standpoint, this matchup leans toward stable scoring outcomes rather than high volatility. Yale games often stay close to their expected scoring range, with fewer explosive runs that dramatically inflate totals. Howard’s offense is capable but tends to be more shot-dependent, which can lead to uneven scoring stretches when defenses force them into longer half-court sequences. Without consistent pace acceleration or extended transition play, scoring remains more measured across both sides.

Late-game tendencies also support a controlled environment. Yale is comfortable closing games without speeding things up, and Howard is less likely to introduce chaos unless the game completely deviates from script. With disciplined tempo, limited transition volume, and a game state that favors execution over urgency, this matchup projects as one where the overall scoring environment stays contained relative to faster or more volatile pairings.

Fenerbahce vs Genclerbirligi, OVER 5.5 CORNERS FIRST HALF @3

Fenerbahce take on Genclerbirligi in a game where corner opportunities should be frequent. Fenerbahce play very attacking football at home, using wide players and fullbacks to deliver constant crosses into the box. Genclerbirligi are likely to sit deep and defend for long periods, which usually results in plenty of set-piece situations. With strong pressure expected from the hosts and counterattacks from the visitors, over 5.5 corners at odds of 3.00 looks a very solid option.</td></tr>

Cagliari is on a very good streak, 3 wins in a row Including Juventus, Roma on the other hand, is 3 games without a win, so why are we betting on Roma and on Monday? Well Roma rotated in UEL, because they need to focus on top 4, specially after Juventus dropped points, I can&#x27;t hide that I also like Cagliari +1 but the Olímpico stadium will be a deciding factor, Cagliari strength is a solid defense but I believe Gasperini can figure them out.

**8 IN A ROW.** The derby was exactly the war we expected—8 yellow cards and another 3-unit bomb cashed. We are on an absolute heater, but we stay disciplined. Back to a 1.5-unit play for tomorrow.

* **The Matchup:** Estudiantes is playing at home, where they are incredibly solid. They are arguably the strongest team in Argentina outside of the &quot;Big 5.&quot; They have a clear tactical identity and a much higher quality roster than their opponents.
* **The Opponent:** Riestra is a &quot;peculiar&quot; team. They are known for being very physical, &quot;dirtying&quot; the game, and having strong ties with AFA officials (which often leads to favorable refereeing). However, in terms of actual football and talent, they are tiers below Estudiantes.
* **The Play:** If Estudiantes plays their game and doesn&#x27;t get frustrated by Riestra&#x27;s antics, they should take the 3 points comfortably. The 1.82 price offers great value considering the massive gap in quality.

PORTO VS SPORTING

Date: 09 FEBRUARY 2026 at 21:45

BET ON: Both teams to score- Yes

Odd: 1.92



\- Porto’s Francesco Farioli has made it abundantly clear in the lead-up press that his side will not sit back after their surprising loss to Casa Pia, emphasizing repeatedly that Porto must enter the clássico with “atitude e grande espírito” and proactive aggression, using the rare full week of preparation to work specifically on ball entries, transitions and high pressing patterns — a sign he plans to impose his typical vertical, possession-oriented attacking style rather than bottleneck into a low block. Sporting’s Rui Borges, on the other hand, has publicly stated that his team only thinks about winning even if the game isn’t “decisivo” for the title, underlining his motivation to attack with purpose and not simply manage the match, which fits his tactical profile of possession control, dynamic wing play and pressure after loss seen in training reports this week. Porto’s defensive lines are weakened by suspensions and absentees, forcing Farioli into a less familiar back setup that could be exploited on transitions, while Sporting, although also missing squad members through injury, has repeatedly trained with a compact midfield and quick vertical passes to exploit half-spaces — a risky but attacking-leaning tactical setup. With both coaches stressing attacking intent and competitive spirit in their Portuguese press build-ups, and tactical plans that favor forward momentum rather than containment, BTTS Yes becomes a highly plausible outcome.

No EPL <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> so we&#x27;re going to head to Italy and try out Serie A. But the player we&#x27;re backing <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> will be familiar to many of you who have followed my picks. Malen, the ex-Aston Villa striker, was sent to Roma a few weeks back on loan. Since joining he has only played 3 Serie A matches, but has racked up some great numbers in those games. He is averaging 5 shots and 2 SOTs per game, scoring one goal between the three matches. He has recieved fantastic praise from the coach and I&#x27;m excited to see what he can do for Roma through the rest of the season.

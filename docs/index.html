**Write Up:** Quite frankly just don&#x27;t understand this line. UNCG came out last week and were beating KSU at KSU (a notoriously tough place to play)--they did end up getting blown out in the second half, but they showed they could hang for 20-minutes. Elon is a smaller program, coming off a bad year. UNCG has been a solid SOCON team for years. Just think this line is abnormally low. Give me the Spartans to win easy.</td></tr>

Event CBB: Duke vs Western Carolina 1:30PM Eastern Time

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **Western Carolina Team Total Under 58.5**
(-118 FanDuel)

Bouncing back <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Western only scored 63 in their first matchup versus Cincinnati. Duke just held a much better offensive Team in Texas to 60points, while giving up 10 offensive rebounds in the first half.
Duke fixed their rebounding woes quick against Texas.

Duke’s defense is very versatile and they have NBA level defenders that guard 1-5 in Maliq Brown and Dame Sarr. Texas was not ready for the switch ability of Duke’s defense and they missed their Team Total by 11 points because of it.

Under Jon Scheyer, Duke has always had an Elite defense with the ability to force the other team into Scoreless runs. Notable Non-Conference games Duke held their opponent to under 58.5 in last year: Army 58pts, Wofford 35pts, Seattle 48pts, Incarnate Word 46pts.

They don’t have the same roster as last year of course, but Jon Scheyer’s Duke teams have always started the year out with a defense that is way ahead of the offense. 

Take Western Carolina Team Total Under 58.5</td></tr>

Event: UFC – Muslim Salikhov (+130) vs Uros Medic

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Muslim Salikhov ML (+130) — 2.31u to win 3u

Battle for RUSSIAAA 🇷🇺🔥

This one’s going to be a banger — should honestly be the main event. Whenever you have a Ruski and a Serb slugging it out, you know it’s going to be heat.

This fight is tough to call. Muslim Salikhov is a technician — excellent feints, great striking, solid distance management, and high fight IQ. But at 40 years old, time isn’t on his side, and he needs to get it done early. I’m just not sure he still has the power to end it fast… but I do think his technique carries him here.

Uros Medic is younger and explosive but still raw. He’s got power, but he lacks composure and tends to overcommit — something Salikhov can take advantage of with his counter game.

This is a tough one, but I’m siding with experience and intelligence. Salikhov might not be young anymore, but his striking is still chef’s kiss.

Write up :

Liverpool did us dirty but hey at least we all got to see Laimer masterclass. So we move on to our next bet.

Bayern vs Union Berlin - Picking Bayern because it&#x27;s Bayern 

Hoffenheim vs Leipzig - Leipzig are a top 3 team in the German football at the moment. They have lost only one game so far this season( no points for guessing who they lost to) . They do not have european football this time and have their sole focus on the league. Playing a catch-up game with Bayern and it&#x27;s fair to say they&#x27;re doing a great job ( 5 point difference). 

Hoffenheim are finding their form back but their home record hasn&#x27;t been good. Lost to Frankfurt and Bayern there. 

I expect Leipzig to atleast get a point in this match because of their better form and better quality overall.

Good luck if you&#x27;re playing!!</td></tr>

**Write up:**

So I&#x27;ve had my eyes on 3 picks <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> and it was very difficult to decide which two to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> here but I analyzed all 3 picks to death and prefer these 2 the most. &quot;Sporting to win&quot; drew the short straw <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.

**Spurs v Man United**  
Two inconsistent teams this season, but they are consistent in one thing: seeing goals in their matches. Spurs have seen **25 total goals in 10 PL matches: Exactly 2,5 on average**. Man United even exceed that with **33 goals in 10 PL matches, 3.3 on average.** Man United&#x27;s **Expected Goals are even higher at 35.28 (+2,38)**. That tells us that these stats aren&#x27;t just a fluke. Their Expected Goals Against are also in line with the actual goals they conceed (-0,52), which means they concede very easily according to the data. And according to my own eyes, I can confirm.

Spurs have seen this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> hit in **9/16 of their matches in all competitions this season**, and coming off a spectacular 4-0 win against Copenhagen on Tuesday. I reckon this will be an entertaining game to watch.

**Parma v AC Milan**

Even though I do not like picking Italian games, I couldn&#x27;t find a reason not to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>.

**Parma are near the bottom of the league** and haven&#x27;t even faced any of the top 4 teams, this is their first time. They&#x27;ve only managed to scrape **7 points in 10 games,** 1 win against Torino (13th) and 4 draws against Atalanta, Cremonense, Genoa &amp; Como (11th,10th,18th,7th). I don&#x27;t think they have the quality to hold off Milan <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. They&#x27;ve also only managed to **score 5 times in 10 matches**.

**Milan** are quite the opposite as they now reach the easier part of their schedule. They&#x27;ve faced Juventus, Bologna, Roma and Napoli (6th, 5th,4th,1st) already, with 10 points out of those matches they **sit 3rd** in the table. They&#x27;ve **only conceded 7 goals** so far. They also **haven&#x27;t lost since the first gameweek**. It seems as if their absence in an European league gives them the edge in their matches this season.

**Best of luck if tailing! 🍀**

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Albon H2H Bortoleto (Albon) (Stake) (-200)

Bet 5U to win 2.5U

WRITE UP:

Sprint overtakes are quite rare to see, especially this season with the massive downforce, dirty air, and wide ahh cars. I know Brazil is known to be an overtake heavy track but the very small pace differential makes it very hard for it to be the case.

Albon lines up P12 and Bortoleto P14 and Williams have shown the pace in long runs during free practice     [Proof here](https://youtu.be/9s6OSxlf7DE?si=p5YguwNK3Tzj1_AT), Saubers car seems to be more quali heavy rather than race pacey as we have since the last few races with Hulkenberg but Sainz and Albon also had quali pace jus couldnt convert in sprint quali especially Sainz. But I still am very confident that Albon can outpace Bortoleto in the sprint.

Light rain is somewhat forecasted for Saturday and if thats the case then it will help Albon more as DRS will be off but even if it doesnt, I&#x27;m still confident as they are well out of the points and both Gabi and Albon wont take much risks trying to overtake so they wont shatter their car

Always bet responsibly and this is not financial advice other than that BOL</td></tr>

Time : 4:00 PM EST

**Writeup:**  
First leg: *Not Marcos wins inside distance* means Marcos shouldn’t finish Miles Johns. Marcos isn’t a finisher; most of his fights are competitive and go the full 15 minutes. Finishing upside is on Miles&#x27; Side. This is the safest angle on this matchup. (If your book doesn’t offer this prop, Over 2.5 is the alternative, but our official <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> remains as listed.)

Second leg: *Not Marco Tulio wins by KO/TKO/DQ.* Finishing Christian Leroy Duncan on the feet is extremely difficult, and nobody has succeeded it. He has never been finished. If Tulio needs to win, he will wrestle and clinch, not through a KO. We’re fading his KO threat from Tulio here.

Tail responsibly.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: NCAAF, BYU +11.5 v TTU -110

2.2 Units to win 2

Took a couple days off, needed a pallet cleanse. 11-11 isn’t good enough to post so ill stop shooting daily and only shoot at games I like enough to post. 

For example, BYU +11.5 is just simply too many points. Texas tech is a better team but they are not 11.5 points better. TTU ranks top 5 in both offense and defense and have won the last two weeks by a combined 65 points scoring over 40 in both game. That will not be the case this week. 

This is going to be a hard nose football game. BYU is coming off a bye and will have had this one circled all season long. BYU will have to slow the game down and not let this one turn into a shootout. They have had 2 weeks to prepare and rest up for this one and they’re healthy again whereas TTU will be on its 6th straight game. 

Not overthinking this one. This game has huge implications. BYU had rest and gets a couple huge pieces back. I don’t think it’s enough to win, but it is enough to keep it close. Take the points.

__Event:__ NCAAF: Oregon @ Iowa 3:30pm EST

__POTD:__ Oregon -6.5 (-105 DK), 2.1u to win 2u

__Write Up:__ This week I went back &amp; watched every game from both teams. The #9 ranked Oregon Ducks (7-1) are set to clash with #20 Iowa Hawkeyes (6-2) at the famed Kinnick Stadium, a stadium known for intimidating top 10 teams &amp; feeding off its rowdy home crowd. The Ducks aim to silence the crowd as they’ve successfully continued to do lately. __Under head coach Dan Lanning, Oregon has built a 10 game active road winning streak, longest in the FBS, with a 15-2 record in away games since 2022.__ Coach Lanning is going to motivate the hell out of this team with Kirk Herbstreit &amp; all of the media calling for an upset, &amp; the CFB ranking Oregon at just #9 despite their only loss coming to the #2 team ranked in the nation. The forecast is calling for a cold (42 degrees), windy (11 mph), &amp; rainy (73%) day at Kinnick Stadium, &amp; neither team plays at a fast tempo, so points will be at a premium. Oregon has the much better offense in this matchup.

Oregon is running a much more balanced offense with a rushing attack under Offensive Coordinator Will Stein this season. __Oregon passes just 0.9% above expect this year with QB Dante Moore, down from +7.8% in 2024 with Dillon Gabriel, &amp; +11.7% in 2023 with Bo Nix.__ Dante has been solid this season not making many mistakes. __Moore has just 4 INT’s on the season, ranking 6th in the Big 10 in QB Rating. He has led this offense to score 41.3 points per game (6th in NCAA) &amp; rank 6th in EPA/play (+0.352).__ Most of his success though should be attributed to his OLine which will be a problem for Iowa. __Iowa has won their games in the trenches this season. Now they’ll face Oregon’s massive OL that weighs on average 315 pounds. Their OL ranks 8th in the NCAA, including 3rd in pass block &amp; 13th in run block.__ They are going to be able to keep Moore from getting pressured this week. __Per PFF, Oregon ranks 2nd in pressure rate allowed. They also rank 11th in non-blitzing pressure rate allowed at just 23.4%. Iowa ranks 72nd in pressure rate generated. Against traditional dropbacks, Iowa ranks 115th in pressure rate generated.__ This should allow Moore plenty of time to find an open receiver, &amp; Moore loves the deep ball. __26% of Moore’s passes outside the red zone have been 15+ yards, 26th highest rate. Moore is completing 59% of those throws (6th) with a a 73% on target rate (2nd).__ But where this offense has really succeeded has been on the ground. Oregon deploys a tandem of talented RB’s which has allowed them all to be fresh through the game. __Oregon RB’s are gaining 107.5 more yards per game than their opponents are allowing vs others, best in the nation. They average 235 yards on the ground (9th) &amp; rank 1st in the NCAA in EPA/Rush (+0.189).__ Not only do RB’s get to the line fast, they also have broken a ton of tackles. __Oregon’s RB’s rank 2nd in the nation yards before contact &amp; 3rd in the nation in yards after contact. Iowa defense ranks just 57th in tackling &amp; 98th in broken tackles allowed.__ Oregon uses a balanced rushing attack with multiple different tight &amp; spread formations, which allows them to adjust their rushing strategy based on their opponent&#x27;s weaknesses. __Iowa’s biggest weakness is against RPO’s. 37% of Oregon’s rush attempts have come from RPOs, the highest rate of Iowa&#x27;s opponents. When defending the run out of RPOs, Iowa is allowing 5.1 yards per rush, ranked 71st. Indiana 9 carries for 73 yards off RPOs, while Penn St also had 73 yards on 16 runs.__ All that said it should be mentioned that Iowa does have a stout defense. But Oregon does as well, the difference is Iowa’s offense is levels below.

Iowa’s has run heavy offense led by 2nd year OC Tim Lester. Iowa runs the ball at a rate 4.6% above expected, with the NCAA’s 8th slowest pace. This is due to disappointing QB play by their South Dakota St transfer QB Mark Gronowski. __Gronowski has just 4 TD’s, with 4 INT’s this season. He ranks 120th in the NCAA in pass rating &amp; has the 2nd worst QB rating in the Big 10 (50.5). On traditional dropbacks, he averages just 5.6 yards per attempt, ranked 131st. He can’t hit WR’s in stride, ranking 121st in on target rate, leading his offense to rank 130th in passing downs Success Rate. He won’t have much success vs this week vs an Oregon secondary that ranks 6th in the NCAA in coverage, per PFF. He’ll also be facing a ton of pressure against Oregon’s that ranks 3rd in pressure rate generated.__ Gronowski’s passing issues have caused the most problems on 3rd &amp; long. __Iowa converts a horrible 9.6% of 3rd &amp; long attempts. Oregon forces 3rd &amp; longs 32% of the time, 5th most in NCAA.__ But where Iowa has had their success this season has been on the ground. Well, sort of. They just don’t create big runs. __Iowa ranks 120th in explosive play rate. Oregon’s defense, ranks 1st explosive play rate allowed. Iowa ranks 82nd in ybc, Oregon ranks 39th in ybca.__ Iowa typically runs out of heavy formations. __They avg 1.4 ybc (74th) in those formation. Oregon vs heavy allows 1.0 ybc (26th). Oregon has produced a quality Success Rate vs heavy at 49%, generating a negative play on 15% of opponent attempts.__ 

I’m running out of room but this is simple. Both defenses are good. But only 1 offense is good. Oregon will break out a few big plays which Iowa is incapable of &amp; that will be the difference.

__Oregon -6.5__

NCAAF // Indiana Hoosiers @ Penn State Nittany Lions

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Indiana -14.5 (+100 ESPNBET) 1u**

It&#x27;s time to head to Unhappy Valley where unfortunately for Penn State, the pain train is rolling in to town. Indiana brings in its punishing offense and #2 ranking to face a team who has experienced the biggest fall from grace in maybe college football history.

Rewind the clock to September 27th. It&#x27;s white out conditions at Beaver Stadium as #6 Oregon faces #3 Penn state. The game goes to double overtime and Oregon escapes with a win. This game effectively broke Penn State. The following week they lose to UCLA as 24.5 point favorites. The week after that they lose to Northwestern as 21.5 point favorites. Follow that up with 2 more losses against Iowa and Ohio State and this puts the Nittany Lions at 3-5 and winless in the Big Ten. They were ranked #2 in the preseason and have now fired their coach and are playing meaningless football, it really is quite remarkable.

Compare and contrast Penn State&#x27;s situation to that of Indiana&#x27;s who is in year two of the Curt Cignetti era (congrats IU fans on re-signing him 😒) and is absolutely rolling. They made the playoffs last year and are looking great to return this year as well. Indiana is 9-0 on the year with several quality wins including beating #9 Illinois by 53, beating both Iowa and #3 Oregon on the road, and also taking care of the middle of the pack Big Ten teams with ease.

Ok, so Indiana wins all their games why are they going to cover this large spread? Let&#x27;s look at how they&#x27;ve been winning these games. Their average margin of victory against Big Ten competition is over 31 points, that is absolutely absurd. Penn state has proven to be a less than average Big Ten team, why on earth should this game be any closer than the previous drubbings they&#x27;ve been doling out. But Penn state has a very talented roster!! Ya they sure do, one that has gotten them to a 3-5 mark and has their players looking ahead to the combine. Their leader, QB Drew Allar suffered a season ending injury and his freshman replacement looks like he&#x27;s stuck in quicksand and has a 0-3 TD to INT ratio in his 2 games as a starter.

The stat comparisons are laughable.

Indiana is 6-3 ATS on the year and 2-1 ATS on the road. Penn state is 1-7 ATS on the year and 0-5 ATS at home.

Penn State just played a comparable team to Indiana last time out in Ohio State and lost 38-14.

A couple final things to consider, Curt Cignetti is an absolute savage. He will run up the score and takes great pleasure in doing so. He will aim to have people heading to the exits before the start of the fourth quarter. Indiana&#x27;s QB Fernando Mendoza currently sits 2nd in Heisman odds, and they will be looking to pad his stats for sure. Indiana has been Penn State&#x27;s bitch year in and year out with a 2-25 all-time record against them. Those days are over. This Indiana team is locked in and extremely well coached, the pain train keeps on rolling.</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>**POTD Record :** 92 – 58 - 8

**Previous :** UCL - Chelsea ML &amp; Newcastle ML - Loss

**Recap:**  Simply put, Qarabag was feistier than expected and outplayed Chelsea on several fronts.  The only one that matters is that Chelsea could not beat them.  Newcastle on the other hand did their job well but it did not help our bet as it was already lost.

**New Event:**  Hajduk Split vs Osijek (Croatia) &amp; Tottenham vs Man United (EPL)

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:**  Hadjuk Split ML &amp; Man United Over 1.5 cards @ 2.09 (Usual 3 units)

**Leg 1**:  Hadjuk Split ML vs Osijek

Croatian League leaders Hajduk host last place Osijek.  Hadjuk have only lost a single home game all season, to 2^(nd) place Dinamon.  Other than that Hadjuk have a +12 goal differential vs Osijek’s -4.  Hajduk come into this match unbeaten in their last 5 (3 wins, 2 draws), while Osijek are winless in their last 4 and have managed just 3 goals in their most recent 5 league outings.  The difference in class and recent results is enough for Hadjuk to get a comfortable win at home against the worst side in the league.

**Leg 2**:  Man United Over 1.5 cards vs Tottenham

This is a much anticipated match between 6^(th) place Tottenham and 8^(th) place Manchester United which should see plenty of friction.  The over 2.5 match cards for the game was very low at odds of 1.13, but the line for Man United to receive 2 cards is far more attractive at 1.4.

This line has covered in the last 15+ matches between these sides when Tottenham hosted for a Premier League match.  I stopped looking beyond 15 matches as it was getting difficult to find match stats for games before 2010.  Needless to say this is a high percentage outcome probability play and should easily cover.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: [NCAA Basketball] Milwaukee -1.5 vs Wofford (Caesars -110) 2:00 PM EST

Analysis: Moving away from the big favorites <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> and targeting a Mid-Major <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>’ em where I believe that recency bias with Wofford gives us some value in the better team, that team being Milwaukee. 

Milwaukee is a program that has been on the upswing ever since Head Coach Bart Lundy has been on the sidelines. Under Lundy the Panthers have had 3 straight 20+ win seasons and are the preseason favorite to win the Horizon League this year. They have superior size, experience, and talent compared to the Terriers who I will get into.

The Wofford Terriers are coming off of a 19-15 season where they won the SoCon and made the NCAA tournament, which on top of being the home team, is the reason I believe they are being overvalued in this matchup. The Terriers fired their Head Coach from last year, Dwight Perry, just about a month ago due to an improper benefits investigation from the NCAA. Perry has been replaced with first-time head coach Kevin Giltner and Giltner is in charge of a roster welcoming 12 new players. Already ranked 9th of 10 teams in the SoCon preseason poll, the Terriers were beat 70-46 by George Mason on Monday. It will likely take this squad some time to mesh under a rookie head coach that was hired September 22nd, I do not expect that to happen in Game #2. Milwaukee wins this game by multiple possessions.

Thank you to everyone who has tailed so far, more wins will come.

Once again this is gambling at the end of the day so bet responsibly, control your emotions, and best of luck🧏‍♂️</td></tr>

Start Time &amp; TV: 12:00pm EST (FOX &amp; ESPN)

Units: 2.75 Units

Reasoning: Going with another two legger for this college football Saturday and I feel confident about the Indiana Hoosiers and the Georgia Bulldogs being able to win their games by more than a field goal. This Indiana team may be the best Indiana team in school history. Fernando Mendoza is having a heisman candidate year as he has over 2100 passing yards, a passing touchdown to interception ratio of 25 to 4, a 72.3 completion percentage, almost 10 yards per pass attempt, and also four rushing touchdowns. This offense does not just revolve around the passing though as their rushing attack is 6th in the nation averaging 246 rushing yards per game and this well balanced offensive attack ranks first in the nation in scoring averaging just over 46 points per contest. Their defense is also amazing as they are 17th in the nation in pass defense, 4th in FBS in rush defense and 3rd overall in points allowed only averaging just over 10 points per game allowed. I also like Georgia in this one as they come into Starkville 7-1 with all seven of their wins being by at least a field goal. They face Mississippi State who comes into this one 5-4 and 1-4 in conference play. My key factor in this one comes down to the defensive side of things as I believe the Georgia Bulldogs have the better defensive in this one as their run defense is amazing ranking 15th out of 136 FBS teams holding teams to less than 100 yards on the ground per game and ranking 25th in points allowed per game allowing less than 20 points per game. Their defense only gets better as the game goes on as in their past five conference games they have only allowed an average of 6 second half points in those games. The Dawgs of Georgia and Kirby Smart have historically had Mississippi States number as Kirby Smart has never lost against Mississippi State and Georgias all time record against Mississippi State is 20-6 so I am expecting history to repeat itself in this one and the number five team in the nation to prove why they are a top 5 team in the nation.

Prediction: 38-21 Indiana, 27-20 Georgia

[Over write up](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/s/3rJTY4Gjvo)

We had a total of 6 goals to start the 3rd period, glad we cashed in as there was only 1 goal scored in the 3rd period after and average of 3 per period before that. Way to bounce back as always, now let’s have a weekend 😈 

Event: Texas A&amp;M @ Missouri (2:30pm central) And Auburn @ Vanderbilt (3pm central)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Two Team standard 6.5 point teaser (Texas A&amp;M ML/Vanderibilt game under 52) (-120) (1U)

-everything is bet to win unit amount-

Write up: let’s start with A&amp;M heading to Missouri, under their current coach against top 10 SEC teams they are 0-8 SU. The public is actually siding with Missouri in this one and the points and we have seen the line go from 6 to 7 on some books but most are steady at 6.5 right now. This is a game in which A&amp;M should purely dominate the trenches. Their offensive line has allowed just a 2.94% sack rate (#11 nationally), while Missouri’s pass rush generates pressure on just 7% of dropbacks. on the defensive side of things, the Aggies’ front seven neutralizes Missouri’s primary offensive weapon – the ground game. Mizzou averages 5.2 YPC, but that’s been inflated by cupcake non-conference opponents. Against quality SEC defenses, they’ve struggled to establish consistent rushing attacks, and A&amp;M’s run defense ranks in the top 15 nationally. not to mention this team is number 3 in the nation in qb sack percentage and the last thing a freshman qb wants to face is constant pressure, and Missouri is 94th in FBs is allowing their qb to get sacked. Oh and by the way A&amp;Ms leading defenseman in sacks, cashius Howell is from Missouri and will have multiple friends and family in attendance (9.5 sacks on the year) A&amp;M is also top 15 in the nation in protecting their qb so they have a clear cut advantage on that side of the ball. This is a battle tested team that should have no issue taking care of a freshmen qb on the road, and this is one of the least favorable matchups for a freshmen qb to make his first appearance.  When the time comes for the new kid to make the plays, I’m just not sure he’s going to be able to do it. This is a popular underdog spot but the wise guys know this battle tests A&amp;M team will continue on the war path they’re currently on. Now let’s get to the Vanderbilt/Auburn under in which our teaser has moved this to the key number of 52 points. Theo public saw the high scoring affair last week between Vanderbilt and Texas and rushed to place their money on the over, not so fast! I love betting splits as a sign of things to come (they don’t tell the whole story but my god a blind chicken could follow these sometimes and be profitable) at mgm they are taking 41% of the bets on the over, and ya know what, only 19% of the handle is on the over!! Meaning big time money is going on the under as they are taking in a whopping 81% of the handle. Over at draft kings they are taking in 70% of the wagers on the over yet once again… only 34% of the handle. Not good. Go look at some stats why dont ya Public! This Vanderbilt team loves loves loves to run the ball and pound the rock, tik tok tik tok, that clock is expiring! 😂 in all seriousness though Vanderbilt is almost dead last in FBs in seconds per play at almost 30 seconds! In comparison to a fast paced team such as Tennessee, they would come in 3rd in the nation at 21 seconds, a whopping 9 per play. Auburn has only averaged 17 points over their last 3 games and I’m not sure how much that program really gives a fuck anymore to be completely honest with you. Vanderbilt knows the type of situation they are in and I expect them to try and control the pace all game with their run game and look to lock down Auburn from the jump, as they know the reason they lost to Texas last week was solely due to the fact that they allowed so many damn points right out of the gates! Auburn ranks 117th in FBS in yards per play at only 4.6 and Vanderbilt is 6th in the nation at 6.9. Yes I know what you’re thinking “that’s not good for the under!” Well let’s look deeper. Vanderbilt opts to rush a lot like I said. They average almost 5.9 rushing yards per attempt which is top 5 nationally. However, auburns one bright spot is their run defense which is stout at only 2.5! 5th in the nation! These numbers have remained true throughout the course of their sec season as well as they have averaged less at 2.4 through their last 3 games! Not to mention Auburn is allowing their qb to be sacked at 13% which is one place off dead last in FBS, new coach and new qb is a recipe for disaster here for Auburn. I expect field goals and an under. 
Let’s have a day fellas, cheers 🍻

**League - Premier League**

**Game: Tottenham VS United**

**Time: 7:30  am EST**

**-----------------**

Let&#x27;s get back to some good English futball!

Starting with the first game of the gameweek, we have another big 6 matchup here. Tottenham&#x27;s performance against Chelsea last week was dreadful, but after a midgame 4-0 in the Champions League, I expect a much better performance against Amorism Reds. Especially considering their fixture list gets even harder after the international break.

Since joining United, Lammens has played 4 games and has covered this line in 3/4 of those games and I&#x27;m expecting that to continue tomorrow.

<tr><td class='post'>**POTD Record 43-36-1**

Another fucking winner. That’s 4-straight. Spurs were sloppy, but luckily Houston was even sloppier. Durant had 8 TO by himself, and the rockets had 23 as a team. Wemby got into foul trouble again, but made big time plays down the stretch, and like I mentioned in the last post, I just felt like hed have a bigger impact on this game, due to the size of this rockets team. He made the right plays, and demanded so much attention when he was on the floor. Castle, is a god damn stud too. Bad shooting night, but HUGE PLAYS. Assists, rbs, d. Man this team is without Fox and Harper, yet they already look like one of the best in the NBA.

Okay, back at it tomorrow, and getting this win streak up to 5. I want to preface, I am not as strong on this play as I usually am, due to so many teams playing B2Bs on Saturday and me not having a feel this early in the season on what they’ll do, I am left with only a few games to choose from. I like it though.

**Lakers -3.5**

Man, this Lakers streak has been buzzing. Four consecutive wins and each one felt like another gear shift. The offense is humming, the defense is finding its edges, and every guy on the roster looks like they might actually believe they’re the team people expected last year.

Luka has been the reason. It’s absurd how smooth he looks with this roster around him. He’s not just scoring he’s orchestrating, baiting defenses, hitting shots you swear no one else on Earth attempts (hes done it his whole career, but skinny luka is different). When he’s locked in, nobody has a chance. Hes averaging fucking 40ppg. Yes, Reaves is out, and prior to seeing them play two games already without him I was worried, yet they are 2-0 and putting up 120ppg.

I have watched a bunch of Lakers games so far this season, and even though most of my life, I have been a Lakers hater, I have always loved Luka, and find myself having a week spot for this squad. The lakers are #1 in 2P% (63.8%), #1 in overall FG% (52.0%), #3 in eFG% (58.3%), and #3 in getting to the line, and #5 at FTM.

The Hawks are #22 in eFG%, #15^(th) in FG, and #10 at both FTA and FTM. Even though lakers have the edge in shooting, the Hawks are young (no pun intended), scrappy, athletic and dangerous. Even without Trae. They are 2-2 so far since he exited with the injury, avg 115ppg, while holding opponents to 111ppg.

I do think there is a scenario this game is tight down the stretch, however even if so, I will take Luka all day in the close game. I think the Lakers keep rolling on their win streak, and I do too.</td></tr>

Last Pick: Otto Virtanen ML vs Emil Ruusuvuori (-137, 1 unit): Win

Tennis | Knoxville Challenger | 1:30 PM EST (estimated)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Daniil Glinka vs Darwin Blanch | **Glinka ML at -143 (BetRivers). 1 unit.**

Write-up: Nice win for Virtanen, who never looked to be in too much trouble. I didn&#x27;t see much value in his odds against Cilic in the SF, but he actually ended up winning that one in straight sets as well.

This should be a fun match between Darwin Blanch and Daniil Glinka in the semifinals of the Knoxville Challenger. Glinka is a high-ceiling player who had been playing some of the best tennis of his career in recent months with the help of his strong serve and aggressive instincts. Here in Knoxville, he has marched through his opening three matches without conceding a break, including a win over an in-form Shinsuke Mitsui (7.11 performance rating). He possesses the unique combination of left-handedness and a one-handed backhand that is rarely seen on tour these days, and can often trouble inexperienced opponents. 

Speaking of inexperienced opponents, it&#x27;s hard not to describe Darwin Blanch as one, even if some of the tennis he&#x27;s played this year has been beyond his years. The 18-year-old Blanch has long been one of the USTA&#x27;s big hopes for the future, and even got to play in the US Open main draw this year after winning the 18 and under National Championship. At the same time, it still feels like he&#x27;s more of a prospect than an established professional player right now. One can point to wins over guys like Valentin Royer, Johannus Monday, and Andres Martin as signs that he&#x27;s one step away from breaking through, but you can also look at the match he dropped from a set up to Keegan Smith last week in Sioux Falls (6.51 performance rating) and see that there&#x27;s a lot of work left to be done. As I mentioned, Glinka has found some really nice consistency over the past few months, and it feels as if he&#x27;s had the same highs as Blanch without any of the lows.

In terms of odds analysis, Glinka closed at around -182 against Shinsuke Mitsui last round, which is a useful comparison point to this match. I honestly feel like Mitsui is playing at a similar level to Darwin right now: he closed at a similar price against Smith, but actually won his encounter in straight sets; he was also able to avenge a loss to Dhakshinewar Suresh, with his move to +104 from +179 in their last encounter showing just how much oddsmakers are liking him right now. Blanch also closed as a bigger underdog than he is here against Andres Martin in the second round, and Martin has generally been getting less market respect than Glinka as of late. 

Overall, I think Glinka&#x27;s experience should carry him through in what should be a high-octane match. Blanch has a really nice lefty serve and forehand, but Glinka recently played two good matches against strong lefties (Martin Damm and Alejandro Tabilo). Looking at the backhand side, I feel like Glinka has a few more options, as I&#x27;ve been really impressed with the angles that his one-hander can generate. I don&#x27;t see a crazy amount of value here (would take to around -150), but I see enough to take this for 1 unit.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Iowa +6.5 (-110 FanDuel)

Event: Oregon @ Iowa 1:30MST

Write up: <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s matchup is a defensive clash between the #4th (Iowa) and the #6th (Oregon) ranked defenses currently in the nation, and I predict this matchup to be a close one. I believe Iowa’s ability to keep games close at home this year gives this team the legitimacy to keep this matchup within a single possession with a sneaky chance at taking this game outright. Oregon has allowed an average of 114 rushing yards per game, and although they have been effective at keeping teams out of the redzone, they have allowed touchdowns in 10/13 trips into the redzone to teams this year, and all 13 trips have resulted in a field goal or a touchdown. On the other side, the Hawks have been extremely productive at running the ball, rushing for an average of 185 yards per game and making the most out of their redzone trips this season in scoring on 32/34 attempts while scoring a touchdown at a 67% clip. The Hawkeyes&#x27; suffocating defense and ability to give their offense incredible field position will allow them to run the ball effectively, control the overall tempo of the game, and expose Oregon’s biggest weakness in stopping the run and their ability to stop teams once they enter the red zone.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Enzo Fernandez 1+ SOT (-110)

**Write Up:** Hi friends! I have lurked for a while and thought I&#x27;d share some insights here and in the Soccer thread. I watch a ton of EPL so I figured this would be a great fixture to start on. 
I see great value in this line. Chelsea, sitting 7th in the PL table, has been inconsistent this year and ravaged with injuries. Enzo has had at least one SOT in 6 of 7 matches in all comps (4 of 4 PL) since Cole Palmer has been out injured. He is also their main penalty taker and team captain. In his last 4 PL matches, Enzo has averaged 3 shots, 1.75 of those being on target. Chelsea is facing off against a last place Wolves team who just sacked their manager. I fully expect Chelsea will control the ball and fire off 15+ shots, we just need one from Enzo to be on target for this to hit.

The spray from the cars will also make it harder to overtake from behind, as Lando will have a clear view of the track in front of him. Also with the weather, for the sprint, at least half of the 24 lap race must be completed, with at least two laps not being behind the Safety Car to award points. If this criteria isn&#x27;t met, this bet will be a push.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> : Bayern Over 2.5 Goals @1.8 for 5u

Bayern have been scoring goals for fun this entire season and have an incredible record of hitting over 2.5 goals in almost every match they play. Bayern have scored 56 goals in just 16 games this season, which averages out to 3.5 goals per game, and they have hit over 2.5 goals in last 10 matches. Harry Kane is on fire with 22 goals so far this season, and he is supported by Luis Díaz with 10 goals and Michael Olise with 7 goals, meaning Bayern have multiple players who score regularly. Even though Union Berlin has been playing good at home this season, it would be difficult for them to stop Bayern especially since how they have been playing this season. Bayern won 16 games in a row and this is first time a team had a start like this in Top 5 leagues. This is the last game before the coming international break and Bayern would be looking to enter the break with 17/17 record.

<tr><td class='post'>Record: 46-34. 

Last Pick: Crystal Palace vs AZ. Under 3.5 goals.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: Martin Schindler ML vs Luke Woodhouse

Sport: Darts, Grand Slam

Reasoning: Schindler’s season average sits around 94.3 alongside a recent checkout rate of 57 %.  ￼ Woodhouse’s finishing has been weaker (checkout 35 %) and his average hovers slightly lower, making Schindler the more consistent option in a short-race format.

Yesterday&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: HIK to win vs FC Helsingor. 3u @ $1.91 ✅

Nice win to get us started. Ended 3-2, there was a few shaky moments, but happy with that. 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:  South Shields HT/FT v Kings Lynn 4u @ $2.30

South Shields are the best team in the league, with and 11-2-1 record. Kings Lynn sit 15th with a 4-6-6 record. 

South Shields are one of the best performing defensive units in the country, conceding only 8 goals in 14 games... And 2 of those were last week away to the second place side. 

In their 14 league games this season, South have won the first half 9 times, been drawing three times, and down twice. That record at home is even better.... Being in front 6 out of their 7 home games. They&#x27;ve only conceded two first half goals at home this season, scoring seven of their own. 

To their credit, Kings Lynn have also been good in first halves this season - however South Shields are proving to be a class above this season and this bet is to echo that instead.</td></tr>

Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>: geno smith under 11.5 rush yards ✅
<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s pick</mark>: Hyder Amil ML -140
Event: UFC Vegas 111

I have a couple big bets I love on this card and multiple smaller bets, but I think my favorite is Hyder Amil to beat Jamall Emmers. 

All things equal I think Hyder is the better fighter, but Jamall is also older and has suffered much more damage over his career so I expect it to be even more one sided. The line is what it is because Amil was brutally KOed in 30s his last fight, but there are not many Delgados out there capable of doing that to Amil and I don’t think Emmers is one of them.</td></tr>

POTD RECORD 24-6

Last pick: Man City -1.5 v Dortmund @ 2.06 (2.5U)✅

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s Fixture: England v Fiji (Rugby Union 17:40pm UK / 12:40pm EST)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: England -23.5 @ 2.01 (2U)

Write up: 

Going against the grain with this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. If you read any analysis of the game most people expect England to win but by a small margin. 

I disagree. England have won 8 in a row , beat Australia extremely comfortably at home last week and are playing a side in Fiji who have endless attacking flair but will concede points for fun. 

Really liking the England lineup and think we are in for an exciting game. 

Prediction: England 48-12 Fiji 

BOL to those tailing , and as always , see you on the other side🫡🫡</td></tr>

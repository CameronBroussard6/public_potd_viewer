NCAAF: Navy -7.5 🏈🏈🏈🏈



•	Cincinnati’s starting QB (Brendan Sorsby) is out
	•	That’s massive against a Navy team that:
	•	Controls clock
	•	Forces you to be efficient with limited possessions
	•	Backup QB vs triple option = bad combo
	•	Navy is fully intact, disciplined, and experienced

What this means for covering:
	•	Navy doesn’t need explosive offense
	•	They just need:
	•	A couple long TD drives
	•	One or two defensive stops
	•	That’s how 10–14 point wins happen

👉 This absence directly supports Navy -7.5</td></tr>

**SPL: Al-Ahli - Al-Nassr, 12:30 PM EST**

*Cristiano Ronaldo Goal (-125) 1u*
 
<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> we head to the kingdom of Saudi Arabia to jump on a bit of a media loop, mixed with an obvious lucrative trend on the field, as we are picking Ronaldo to score <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> against Al-Ahli

Full transparency: it was either this or the Al-Nassr ML <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> (I considered a Lens/Toulouse draw, too - if you know you know). The main thing stopping me from choosing Al-Nassr’s ML is the fact that *Al-Ahli are off to a fantastic start themselves. This is where the roadblock both ways comes into play.*

*Al-Ahli have only conceded 8 goals in 11 matches so far this season* - so they are stout despite missing a handful of players to injuries and AFCON. In fact, the top 4 teams in Saudi Arabia have only 2 defeats between them, so there’s parity there.

Which is why we are gonna pounce on the other form: **Ronaldo has scored in all but one game in the Saudi Pro League this season, he has 13 goals in 13 matches this season, and has scored in 5 of his last 6 in all competitions.**

Yes, he *played 2 full matches in 3 days prior to the new year*, but with 6 days off til their next match &amp; a top of the table clash against Al-Hilal on the horizon, this is an important spot for the club and Ronaldo has risen to the occasion this year, in what could be his final season in Saudi Arabia.

This week the media have been talking about his statement about **not retiring until he gets 1000 goals**, and this seems as good a platform as ever to continue to get rolling to that milestone. ***Stick to the guy putting the ball in the net.***

Last play review:

NHL - Winnipeg @ Toronto

Toronto ML (-150) 1.5u ✅

(All I can say is the gambling gods were shining down on us again last night… down 4-1, the Leafs came back to tie it, only to give up a goal right after - only to score 2 to win it 6-5. If I’m the Jets at this point I’m trying to find every voodoo and rabbit foot in town because they snatched defeat from the jaws of victory - all that aside, we were quite possibly treated to the game of the season to start the new year)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> - Las Vegas Knights 60 min ML +100 Fanduel 
Risk 1 unit.

Reasoning - both teams goaltending has been a mess but Vegas has consistent offensive power. Better Corsi (Shot attempt diff/Puck possession) and xG Share (Shot quality)   on top of that 5v5 advantage goes to Knights as well.  Look for Vegas to have solid blue line control and blues to continue to struggle when defending extended cycles.   Lines trending in Vegas favor as well.  I dont think goalies are confirmed but I don&#x27;t think it will matter much.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** NYR +1.5 Puck Line &amp; Total Goals Under 7.5

**Odds:** 1.90 | -111 | 3 units to win 2.7

**Write up**: The first thing jumping off the page is the venue for this matchup, outdoor ice in miami is gonna be sluggish, creating grinders paradise that plays right into the hands of the under. with the humidity spiking and the cooling systems working overtime, the puck is gonna be all over the place, impacting passing plays and forcing a dump n chase style that burns clock. the rags are already playing a low event style on the road, with a 14-8-2 record away from MSG, and this swampy ice neutralizes the speed advantage the cats usually flaunt at home. looking between the pipes, shesty is the ultimate equailizer for that +1.5 puck line, having a ridiculous 2.25 gaa on the road compared to his home splits. his high danger save %% remains elite, meaning even when the defense breaks down hes bailing them out. the rags cover the puck line in nearly 80% of games where theyre catching odds, basically making them the kings of the one goal game. with fox back on the blue line moving the biscuit, the rags have the transition game to clear the zone and limit the sustained zone time that usually threatens the total. Offensively the cats are declawed without their big guns (Barkov and Tkchuck(probaly not how you spell his name)) making the under 7.5 feel even safer. Reinhart has been hot with 7 goals in his last 10, but hes gonna see the rags top checking unit all night.

The rangerss have the 31st ranked offense in the league, potting a measly 2.55 goals per game, which is the best friend for under 7.5 ticket. Panarin is doing heavy lifting with 41 points, but if the cats lock him down, the secondary scoring is virtually non existent. they simply dont have the firepower to blow this game open, especially on slow ice. Combining these metrics, the game script screams a low scoring, tight checking affair where the rags hang around until the final buzzer. seeing as outdoor games historically trend under due to sightline issues for shooters and bad ice, grabbing a line as high as 7.5 provides a massive cushion for a game that likely ends in the 4 to 6 total goal range. we are taking the insurance. we don&#x27;t need the rangers to win.we just need them to not lose by two goals. with floridas offense banged up and the soft ice slowing the game down, this is going to be a grinder.

Todays Match - Darts PDC World Championship 🎯 Gian Van Veen vs Gary Anderson

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> - Gary Anderson over 13.5 180&#x27;s @1.83 (-120)

Writeup - was thinking a lot and even though I like Gian very much, been a fan of his for a long time, it&#x27;s just hard to go against The Flying Scotsman when he&#x27;s on fire. Think Gian is a favourite for reason but not as big as the odds are implying that&#x27;s why I decided to stay away from ML cause this should be an instant Ally Pally Classic. 11 180&#x27;s against MVG (5 sets played), 14 against Wattimena (7 sets played), 9 against Scutt (4 sets played) he can hit them for sure, not so lucky against Hood, but I think he felt as if he didn&#x27;t need to hit a lot of 180&#x27;s, Hood just didn&#x27;t pose any trouble, Gary did hit a lot of 140&#x27;s though. MVG, Wattimena were dangerous opponents and it looks like that&#x27;s when Anderson goes into high gear, he knows his scoring power is needed to play against these world class players. If this was a second round match for example, I&#x27;d say Gian beats him to zero, cause Scotsman was having an average season, said plenty of times motivation is not as big as before, doesn&#x27;t have any thoughts of playing Premier League, but looking at it now he did turn it around somehow and is having a wonderful championship. I think this goes to the distance, Anderson managed to push Littler all the way at Grand Slam, can do the same <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Van Veen trashed Humphries yesterday but early stages at the game it looked like Humphries had him, just missed couple of key doubles and randomly gave up, started throwing faster, looked beaten already at 3-1, if those early doubles went it for Luke, I believe we have a much closer game. Hopefully Gary capitalizes on his chances and we have a close game, BOL!</td></tr>

Event: Ligue 1 (Soccer) - Toulouse vs Lens (19:45 GMT)

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Draw or Lens @ 1.5 (1 unit)

**Write Up:** Hoping to continue our great start to the New Year I&#x27;m going to the French top division for a major clash between **7th place Toulouse** and **1st place Lens**. Lens have surprised everyone this campaign as they sit top of Ligue 1 after 16 games played having picked up **13 more points than they had this time last season**. With PSG breathing down their neck week after week the title contenders have so far held strong and <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> is another opportunity to uphold their 1 point lead to the 4 time consecutive league champions.

Our home team <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> is **7th place Toulouse** who have been pretty average throughout the current league 1 campaign but ended 2025 on a good run, going **4 unbeaten in all comps**. They have **won their last 2 games** in the league which were against **Paris FC (14th)** and **Strasbourg (8th)** and have recorded only **1 loss across their last 6 matches** which came against **10th place Angers**. This has resulted in **9 points from an available 18**. During this time they have also **scored 7 goals** whilst **conceding 4**. This season Toulouse are scoring **1.5 goals per game** which rises to **1.75 when they are playing at home** like they are <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Alongside this they have **conceded a pretty good 1.19 goals** per game but this also **rises to 1.38** when they play on home turf, something the visitors will look to exploit. The team from South Western France are just the **12th best home team** in the league in the current campaign, having **won only 3 of their 8** **games** played at home, **scoring 14 and conceding 11**. Toulouse will be a tough opponent <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> as the chance at a European spot for next season has suddenly opened up for them as they sit just **4 points behind the European spots** in the table.

As for the visitors they are enjoying an incredible season atop Ligue 1 as they hope to topple French giants PSG which no team has managed to do **for the last 4 years**. Lens are currently on a **7 match unbeaten run** across all competitions, **winning all 6 of their last 6 games** in the league. During these games they have **scored 14 goals whilst conceding just 3** and their defensive displays are exactly why they are in the position they are in this season. Lens hold **the best defensive record in the league** conceding an average of just **0.81 goals per game** this season however this does rise to **1.13** when they play away from home. As for their goal scoring they are finding the net **1.75 times per game** this campaign which drops slightly to **1.5** when they play away from home turf. The current league leaders are the **2nd best away team** in the league as they have **won 5 of their 8 games** played away from home whilst **losing 2, to 2nd place PSG** (not a disaster) and **17th place Metz** (more of a disaster). Overall Lens are performing so much better than expected this season and they **haven&#x27;t lost a game since the end of October**.

Personally I am putting 1 unit on Lens or draw <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> as I don&#x27;t see them losing this game with so much on the line but I wouldn&#x27;t be shocked if Toulouse mounted a decent challenge based on their recent form which could potentially end in a draw. I am also having half a unit on Lens to win the match altogether @ 2.55 but this is slightly riskier so be careful with that one.

As I said it won&#x27;t be an easy game for the league leaders but I&#x27;m backing their defense to hold up as it has so often this season to see out something like a 2-1 win for the visitors.

Write up: To me this seems a very clear <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, if anyone watched Zvezda these past few games you would have noticed Jared Butler sticking out like a sore thumb.

In the last 5 games Butler passed this line 3 times. Against Paris, while Butler was on the court Zvezda was very close to turn around the game, the moment he got subbed off Zvezda&#x27;s attack just died down. 

The story was the same against Hapoel, Butler is just a level above all other Zvezda players currently, and if coach Obradovic doesn&#x27;t sub him off again for Yago (bruh), Butler will pass this line very easily.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** **Over 5.5 Goals (-115) 1 unit**

**Reasoning:** Gonna start off my write ups on here with some NHL featuring the reigning champs vs the New York Rangers. To start Panthers are a high goal scoring team, season average of 3.18 goals per game while boosting an 3.33 in their last 10 games. Panthers defense has been lack luster allowing 3.15 goals per game and similar numbers in their last 10. Rangers offense has been a bit lack luster, averaging 2.55 goals per game and in their last 10 still around the 2.5 point mark. Their defense has been a bit better allowing 2.76 per game, however in their last 10 they have given up 3.2 goals per game, with their most recent match giving up 6 goals to the capitols. Panthers are the better team here as well as playing at home, i expect them to grind out a win and should cover the over.

Todays <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: **Toulouse v Lens: Lens Draw No Bet @1.95**

Lens come into this one as the stronger and more reliable side and the numbers back it up across the board. They are top of the table in red hot form and generating elite attacking output with 17.6 shots per game and an xG above 2.0. That level of chance creation travels well and explains why their away scoring remains consistent even against compact home setups.

Toulouse on the other hand are a split personality team. They have shown flashes away from home but their home attacking numbers are a real concern with just 0.5 goals per game and limited shot volume. That is a serious issue when facing a Lens side that defends efficiently concedes under a goal per match and is comfortable controlling games without needing to overextend.

The model makes Lens clear favourites to win outright but the draw still carries some weight given Toulouse’s tendency to stay competitive. This is exactly where draw no bet makes sense as it backs the better team while removing the main downside risk. If Lens play to their metrics which they have done consistently over the last ten matches they win this game more often than not. If Toulouse manage to grind out a draw the stake is protected.

In short Lens have the sharper attack stronger underlying data and superior recent form. Lens draw no bet keeps the value while reducing variance and avoids overexposure to a low upside Toulouse home win.

Best of luck.</td></tr>

Going back to McBride, as his line has good value. 50% on the season covering 11 points. In the last two seasons **without Josh Hart, he has covered this line 7/8 times and 3/3 this season**. Atlanta is ranked 24th in opponent points per game and allows the **22nd most points to opposing point guards**. Atlanta is also ranked 23rd in opponent shooting %.

We get a high total of 245.5 in this game, Hawks plays high pace ball hopefully should lead to a high scoring game.

The Pacers are on a brutal 10 game losing streak with a 6-28 record and just 5-13 at home. The Spurs, at 24-9 overall and coming off a win, have the clear talent and form edge to cover this number comfortably.</td></tr>

Total Match runs over 323.5 @ 1.70 (1u)

Writeup: Going to look at the BBL, which has started sometime back and we have some matches to look at trends

In this match, Melbourne stars are rightly considered favourites, with 4/4 wins, but the match is happening in Brisbane (Gabba), where the home side has won both their matches. So, felt it&#x27;s a little risky to go to the ML markets.

I feel, this run total is probably easy to hit, if there is no rain or a sudden batting collapse, as the ground is quite easy to score + both the previous matches in this ground have hit this target quite easily.

Hope we go back to winning ways &amp; BoL</td></tr>

Tip off is 7:40PM PST. I am returning to the Luka blocks system. His record this season is not going more than 4 games without a block and this will be game 2. With Reeves being out and the way the Lakers are looking I have to assume he will be playing harder leading in to the all star break and trade deadline. That is emphasized with the comments from pundits criticizing his lack of defensive prowess as of late.

Should this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> miss I will double my units when he plays again on Sunday. As of right now this prop is not yet on the board but I suspect the odds will be +135. I will update it if need be.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Melbourne Victory Vs Perth Glory - **Melbourne Victory ML @ 1.75 (Melbet)**

**Write Up:** Melbourne Victory come into this match focusing on staying organised and in control, especially at home where games are usually close. Perth Glory return to league action after mixed results and they’ve shown they can be dangerous going forward, but still struggle to stay solid when under pressure for long periods.

Victory’s recent form shows a team that knows how to win without taking unnecessary risks. Wins at home against Adelaide United and away at Melbourne City came from staying compact and patient on the ball. Even their draws with Macarthur and Auckland FC showed how hard they are to break down. While losses to Sydney FC and Brisbane Roar came during a tougher spell, recent matches show better balance between defence and attack. At home, Victory usually keep games tight and controlled.

Perth Glory have picked up some strong wins against Melbourne City, Macarthur, and Newcastle Jets, but those results have been mixed with losses that highlight ongoing issues. Defeats to Adelaide United and Sydney FC showed how little room for error they have, especially when they fall behind. Away from home, Glory often struggle to stay organised defensively. Heavy losses at Melbourne City earlier in the season and problems sustaining pressure suggest they may spend long stretches without the ball in this match.

Perth Glory look like a classic glass-cannon side, dangerous going forward but vulnerable defensively. They also rely heavily on Taggart for goals, and with his fitness in doubt, that could be a concern. Even if he plays, Melbourne Victory should have the edge, especially at home.

Stats wise, it points towards a Melbourne win for me here. Melbourne are on a three-game winning streak, including a 5-1 win over Wellington Phoenix, and have won five straight against Perth. They also took a 2-0 win at HBF Park last time out.

**Recap:** Unfortunate situation that Sheffield Wednesday is in across the board. One that lead us to capitalize on their misfortunes.

**New Event:**  NCAAF – NAVY vs Cincinnatti

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:**  NAVY -7 @ 1.88 (Usual 3 units)

(Full Disclosure - I have the flu, can&#x27;t think straight and am using some AI to help write part of this, so I can drop some Nyquil and pass out)

Navy finished the regular season with a strong 10-2 record, going 8-1 in the AAC and narrowly missing a potential College Football Playoff berth.  Despite a blowout defeat to Notre Dame (49-10), the Midshipmen closed strong with wins over USF, Memphis (on the road), and rival Army (17-16).

Some bulletpoints as always:

* Navy boasts the nation&#x27;s #1 top rushing attack averaging 289.3 yards per game
* Service academies have won seven straight bowl games since 2021.
* Service academies do not have many opt-outs because they consider it the same as going AWOL. Big no-no.
* Cincinnati ended the season on a four-game losing streak (7-5 overall) and has been hit hard by opt-outs and the transfer portal.
* Cincinnati will be missing starting QB Brendan Sorsby, who accounted for over 2,800 passing yards, 580 rushing yards, and 36 total tds.
* The QB position replacement is completely inexpererienced.  Options include either backup Brady Lichtenberg and redshirt freshman Samaj Jones.
* Multiple defensive starters are also opting out for Cincy, leaving a depleted roster.
* Navy&#x27;s elite ground game faces a vulnerable Cincinnati run defense, while the Cincy Bearcats&#x27; quarterback uncertainty limits their ability to keep pace.
* Navy&#x27;s QB Horvath&#x27;s dual-threat ability should control the clock and exploit gaps, with Navy likely attempting fewer than 15 passes unless trailing.

Navy&#x27;s full-strength roster, dominant rushing attack, and Cincinnati&#x27;s significant absences (especially at QB) give Navy a clear edge. I expect Navy to grind out long drives and cover the spread in a relatively one-sided dominant rushing affair.  Laying the 7 points with Navy.</td></tr>

Event: Hawks @ Knicks 6:30 pm CT

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Karl Anthony Towns to have 12+ rebounds (-142); 2 units 

In <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>’s NBA, KAT may be the most feminine, estrogenic player. But dammit does he summon up his only testosterone when he plays the Atlanta Hawks. In his career he has played them 21 times averaging 24.9 points, 12.4 rebounds, and 3.9 assists. This year was no different on Trae Young’s lil ass as he played the Hawks 5 days ago and had 36 points and 15 rebounds. I can just hear KAT screaming “After all that 💅” in the locker room after that absolutely disrespectful performance while Brunson and Hart are in the back fingering each other. 

But I digress, the man has hit this line 4 times in the last 5 games (L5: 7, 12, 15, 14, 13). He is averaging 11.7 rebounds this year. I know his average is lower than the line barely, but there are key factors that are going to contribute to his rebound production. Josh Hart is out (a very reliable rebounder for NY) and Mitchel Robinson is questionable (another glass eater), KAT is gonna have to carry a heavier rebounding load than usual. The Hawks are also constantly out-rebounded by teams as they rank 25th in rebounds as a team this year. Both of these teams shoot a lot of three pointers, NY is 7th and ATL is 11th in attempts per game. 3 pointers are the lower FG% shot so there will be more rebound opportunities. I expect KAT to be inside the lane more than usual to counteract the key rebounding pieces Hart and Robinson (potentially) being out for the Knicks. I am no fortune teller, just a man.

On the other side, Anaheim has really been struggling, with a 2-6-2 record in their last 10 after a hot start to the year. Dostal has really been struggling since coming back from injury, and if Mrazek starts, he hasn’t been good this year either.

Last pick: Kevin Durant Over 4.5 Assists (-145)HR✅

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the day</mark> :Chet holmogren O 1.5 block(-138)FD


Reason • :
Draymond Green is officially OUT (rest) for the Warriors. Draymond is their defensive heart and the one player with the veteran &quot;IQ&quot; to pull Chet away from the hoop. Without him, the Warriors&#x27; interior is a revolving door, and Chet is the only person holding the keys.
Chet is averaging 2.2 blocks over his last 10 games, hitting the Over in 70% of those contests.
GSW ranks 3rd-worst in the NBA, allowing about 4.0 blocks per game

Scenario A: (Quinten Post Starts)
   With Draymond out, 7-foot rookie Quinten Post is expected to start. This is a dream for Chet. Post lacks NBA-level speed, which allows Chet to stay deep in the paint. Rookies often try to test established rim protectors; Chet’s 7&#x27;6&quot; wingspan will be waiting to swap out shots 

Scenario B: The Warriors Go Small (Speed vs. Length)
   If Kerr plays Jonathan Kuminga or Al Horford at the &quot;5,&quot; the Warriors will try to drive and kick. Since Isaiah Hartenstein is OUT, Chet has zero &quot;vultures&quot; taking his blocks. He is the only rim protector on the floor for OKC. Every drive from Steph Curry or Podziemski must eventually face Chet at the apex.

Scenario C: The Blowout (OKC leads by 20+)
   You might worry about Chet sitting early. However, the data shows Chet is a &quot;fast starter.&quot; In his 6-block masterpiece against Portland, he had 3 blocks before halftime. Trailing teams get desperate and attack the rim faster, which actually feeds Chet&#x27;s stats in the first three quarters.

Scenario D: The Offensive Slump (Ugly Shooting)
   If it’s a &quot;brick fest,&quot; the Warriors will stop settling for 3s and try to draw fouls. This funnels the game directly into Chet&#x27;s office. An ugly game for shooters is a &quot;Block Party&quot; for Chet.

DPOY Hunt: Chet is the betting favorite for Defensive Player of the Year (+150). 
And I hope he takes it from Wemby (as a thunder fan of course, I love wemby as rival competition)  He isn&#x27;t just playing; he&#x27;s &quot;stat-hunting&quot; to solidify his trophy case. 

Scenario-Proofing 
- Blowout: OKC is heavily favored (Thunder around -8 to -10 spread). Chet often racks up 2+ blocks by halftime in lopsided wins because desperate teams attack the rim more.

- Close Game: 32–35 minutes guaranteed, and GSW&#x27;s guards/forwards will challenge him repeatedly.

- Ugly/Slow Pace: More rebounding → more transition → more rim attacks for Chet to erase.</td></tr>

Love this spot to fade Cotton, will be matching up against an elite defender, Bul Kuol, who&#x27;s been locking up players as of late. Kuol is a suffocating defender who&#x27;ll force the ball out of Cotton&#x27;s hands, and in the 2 H2H matches this season Cotton has had a season low 7pts and 25pts (Kuol had early foul trouble). Cotton will know this matchup is heading his way, and will be smart enough to use it to his teams advantage, so think he&#x27;ll be dishing assists rather than forcing shots over a defensive system in place to limit him.

Reasoning: generally I don’t like betting over unders but I really like this line at the this price. Tsitsipas is the superior player but has not played an ATP match (with the exception of Davis cup) since the US Open due to back injury issues. Tsitsipas had been getting very poor results. Since grass court season he is 5-11. His opponent Mochizuki does best on hard courts but is ranked 99 so definitely not an elite player. Last year on hard courts won sets against both Ruud and Michelsen and took Khachanov to 5 sets in Wimbledon. Given Stefanos current form and Mochizuki being a competent top 100 player I’m expecting a close match and think this goes 3 sets.</td></tr>

*Adam Fox over 0.5 points (-130)*

Adam Fox didn&#x27;t get picked for the Olympics and he was definitely not happy about it when he got called yesterday. He&#x27;s pissed and wants to prove to team USA that they made the wrong choice especially to his own coach who will be the head coach for team USA in Milan. He has points in seven consecutive games (12 points btw which is insane for a defenseman) so you&#x27;re damn sure he&#x27;s gonna try to keep his streak alive to shove it in team USA&#x27;s management face especially when it&#x27;s a big game like the Winter Classic. The game is outside but the last outdoor game Fox played he got 2 assists so it&#x27;s not a factor for him.

**Event:** Lige One McDonald&#x27;s, Toulouse v RC Lens, 14:45 pm EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Toulouse DNB -120, 1 unit

**Write Up:** We&#x27;re venturing into the French league and I&#x27;m eyeing up the match between Toulouse and a flying Lens side. But make no mistake, Toulouse are in a pretty decent spot too. They&#x27;ve quietly turned their season around and come into <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>’s clash with **real momentum of 3 wins on the bounce** and 4 matches without defeat, making them a strong candidate to stun the slight favorites on paper. After a frustrating first half of the campaign, they look much sharper, more confident, and far harder to break down. They’ve gone unbeaten in their last four matches across all competitions and have won their last three games, including a **convincing 3-0 victory over Paris FC** that boosted both morale and momentum heading into 2026.

What I think is especially encouraging for Toulouse is their **home form.** They’ve picked up points in **five of their last six home matches**, keeping **two clean sheets in their last three outings** at the Stadium de Toulouse.

Meanwhile, *Lens may be leading Ligue 1,* but they **don&#x27;t look very threatening going forward** and don’t have an overwhelming H2H edge. **Toulouse actually defeated them twice in 2025**, only conceding one singular goal across the two fixtures, and Lens have generally **rarely cruised past this opponent** recently. The hosts also have **key attacking threats like Santiago Hidalgo and Yann Gboho** in good form, giving them real scoring potential even against strong defensive sides.

Considering Toulouse’s upward curve, solid home performances and the fact that they’re not outdone by Lens, I&#x27;m leaning towards a Toulouse win, but going to cover my stake in case of a draw. BTTS Yes is a fine bet too, but I&#x27;m sticking to match results for now.

Milan head to Cagliari as a clear favorite. I like them to come away with all 3 points here and put themselves back in 1st place. I debated taking -1, but there&#x27;s a very good chance they only win by 1 goal. So we are adding Pulisic SOT to up the odds. Pulisic had been in great form, scoring 4 goals in his last 4 matches. He was out injured for a chunk of the season, but is now hitting his stride and playing much further forward than last year, leading a dual pronged attack.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Gian van Veen -1.5 sets vs Gary Anderson @ 1.90

Alright, I’ve been thinking what I really wanna bet here. ML doesn’t seem like a value, 180’s are inconsistent. One thing or person that has been consistent and that’s Gian van Veen. 

He almost slaughtered Humphries into a 5-1 win with an average of 105.41. I knew I was going to take the winner of their game against Anderson because Anderson didn’t turn up as much as I expected him to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Just unfortunate to see the ML is at such low odds.

Anderson has been playing great but his performance <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> was even worse than Humphries’ performance against van Veen. Of course, it’s a different opponent and everything. Still haven’t seen Anderson play as well as Gian van Veen has been doing this tournament. The guy literally smashes all of his opponents. 

I’m still convinced that Gian van Veen will be winning this with -1.5 sets. Take into account that yesterday was the first to 5 sets to win. This game is first to 6 sets to win the match. 

Gian van Veen -1.5 sets @ 1.90 it is.

CAGLIARI VS AC MILAN

Date: 02 JANUARY 2026 at 20:45

BET ON: Over / Under team Cards- CAGLIARI Over +1.50

Odd: 1.50



\- Cagliari over 1.5 cards is well supported by the match context, tactical setup and referee profile. Pisacane’s side are expected to adopt a compact, low-to-mid block against a stronger Milan team chasing the top of the table, prioritising intensity, duels and disruption rather than possession. With key attacking absences such as Belotti, Felici and Folorunsho, Cagliari’s main way to stay competitive is through aggression, tight marking and stopping Milan’s rhythm with tactical fouls, especially in midfield and wide defensive areas against Leão, Pulisic and Nkunku. At home, Cagliari have consistently shown they are hard to beat against top sides, but that resistance often comes at the cost of discipline. Referee Rosario Abisso is known in Serie A for a relatively high incidence of disciplinary actions — averaging around 4+ total cards per game across recent seasons and often breaking up play with frequent fouls and cautions compared to league norms, including in matches involving Cagliari and big teams like Milan. With Milan expected to dominate possession and Cagliari forced into prolonged defensive phases, the likelihood of the hosts picking up at least two cards is high.</td></tr>

&gt; **Write Up:** This <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> is from my soccer model that I&#x27;ve been using for the past two years. It assigns ELO ratings to players and projects a win chance based on the combined ELO ratings of the players on each team. TeamReddit is projecting a 62% win chance here which creates value here on the ML.</td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>

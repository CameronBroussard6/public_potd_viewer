PSG VS TOTTENHAM

Date: 26 NOVEMBER 2025 at 21:00

BET ON: Over / Under team corners- TOTTENHAM Over +3.50

Odd: 2.10



\- Without creative playmakers like Maddison and Kulusevski, Spurs are unlikely to fashion many chances from open play — which pushes them to lean on transitions and set pieces, where they remain dangerous. Under Thomas Frank, they often switch into a more direct, transitional style when away, inviting pressure but aiming to draw fouls and win corners rather than dominate possession.

\- Statistically, Tottenham are among the league’s leaders in corners per game this season, averaging well over five per match. Their aerial presence — especially via van de Ven — means opponents must be alert, and that often forces fouls or clearances under pressure, creating corner opportunities. Tactically, Frank’s set-up uses a mix of inswingers, late runs, and second-phase attacking from corners, designed precisely to exploit defensive hesitation.

\- Given the likely tactical shape: a compact, defensively solid PSG, Spurs will probably absorb pressure, win multiple set plays, and use those to relieve stress — making the over 3.5 corners bet very logical under those match conditions.</td></tr>

Kylian Mbappe Anytime Goalscorer-160 (FD)


Write up: B4 I begin glazing, Mbappe hasn’t scored in his last 3 club appearances- he’s hungry and fuming. Kylian is almost inevitable in front of goal—his pace forces defenders to panic, his first touch creates separation instantly, and his finishing is cold, clinical, and effortless. Give him even half a yard and he’ll turn it into a highlight. He glides past defenders like they’re training cones and strikes with the kind of confidence only the elite have. On a big night, when the lights are bright and the pressure’s highest, Mbappé doesn’t just show up—he takes over. Tomorrow should be no different.</td></tr>

Arsenal vs Bayern Munich

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> : Bayern to Win or Draw @1.7 for 3u

Bayern are in sensational form and have a huge historical advantage over Arsenal. Both teams are missing players. Bayern have been absolutely incredible this season, putting together a European record of 16 straight wins before drawing with Union Berlin, and they just thrashed Freiburg 6-2 last weekend after going 2-0 down, showing they have the mental strength and firepower to come back from any situation. Vincent Kompany&#x27;s side are top of the Champions League with 12 points from 4 matches and have won 17 of their 18 games in all competitions this season, making them one of the most dominant teams in European football right now. Harry Kane has been lethal with 5 goals in just 4 Champions League games and continues to terrorize defenses, and even without Luis Diaz who is suspended for three matches after his red card against PSG, Bayern still have world-class attacking options in Michael Olise, Serge Gnabry, and the rising star Lennart Karl.

Arsenal will be without their main center-back Gabriel Magalhaes who suffered a thigh injury on international duty with Brazil and will be out for weeks, which is a massive blow because he has been the leader of their defensive line that has only conceded 5 Premier League goals all season. The historical record between these two clubs heavily favors Bayern, who have won 8 of the 14 meetings against Arsenal compared to just 3 Arsenal wins, and the Germans have scored 30 goals past Arsenal in those 14 matches including the infamous 10-2 aggregate thrashing in 2017. Arsenal have not beaten Bayern in their last 5 Champions League encounters, with the visitors winning three of those games by a 5-1 scoreline, memories that still haunt Arsenal fans and give Bayern a huge psychological edge.

The arsenal side have enjoyed some very high scoring games so far in the league phase against a mix of teams - they&#x27;ve lost 1-5 to Slavia Prague, lost 3-4 to ATL. Madrid, lost 1-2 to Olympiacos and a 1-3 loss to Bilbao. Bayern have also seen some high scoring games, despite not hitting this line not as often - they&#x27;ve lost 0-3 twice vs Brugge and PSG, good chances for them in the PSG game, and Brugge are just too good with no goals allowed so far. They also lost 2-3 to Chelsea and a 3-0 win vs very weak Pafos. Bayern also struggle for clean sheets in their domestic league, clearing this line very often. Both teams are also desperate for points as after 4 games they are near the bottom of the table.</td></tr>

Event:  **NHL - Buffalo Sabres @ Pittsburgh Penguins**

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:  **Pittsburgh Penguins ML (-120) 1.2U**

Write-Up:

This feels like a great line to get the Penguins here as they look to be back at full-strength tomorrow against the Sabres. After an IR stint, Jarry will suit up without an injury designation. Before the injury, he was 5-2 with a .911 save percentage.

Joining Jarry’s return, Bryan Rust will be back for the Penguins as well. As one of the Pen’s top goal scorers, his presence will be greatly felt by this squad. 

On the opposite side of the puck, the Sabres are struggling on the road with a 1-5-2 record on the road. They’ve also allowed 75 goals so far this season, and the Pens should be able to add quite a few to that tomorrow. 

The Penguin’s spread is set at -1.5 (+204) so I’m just sticking with the ML. 

*As always, BOL*</td></tr>

**Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Enzo Fernandez 1+ SOT (+100) ✅️

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s Event:** UEFA Champions League | Liverpool vs PSV Eindhoven (12:00 PM PST)

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:**  Virgil van Dijk 1+ SOT (+255) 1 unit to win 2.55 units

**Write Up:** What a roller coaster of a game. Enzo looked the best player on the pitch, with two disallowed goals in the 1st half, both disallowed due to questionable offsides calls (on his teammates). But, he comes through for us late in the match with a SOT, after passing up an easy goal opp for an assist. This is why I like to back players that work hard, because they can hit at any point in the match and never give up. 3rd time Enzo has cashed us at plus money, gotta love our guy!

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> we head back north to Liverpool as the reigning EPL champions host the 1st place Dutch side PSV Eindhoven. Liverpool are on a major downturn after losing 3-0 to Nottingham Forest over the weekend. I think Liverpool will recognize they won&#x27;t win the premier league this year and will focus on winning Champions League, which looks to be fairly open for the taking. A win here puts them level in points with 1st place in the UCL. 

If you guys have read/tailed my picks, you&#x27;ll know I don&#x27;t play picks much under even money. I&#x27;m not about low odds, high win percentage. **I&#x27;m about data, trends, and perceived value.** I will also see occasional value way above plus money that I can&#x27;t pass up. That&#x27;s where we are at <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Van Dijk is a center back for Liverpool, not your typical shot taker. That said, I&#x27;ve noticed an interesting trend. Van Dijk has cleared this line in 3 of 4 UCL matches this year, playing all 90 minutes in every match and scoring 2 goals in the process. The odds are too tempting to pass up. Yes he hasn&#x27;t shot a ton in EPL fixtures, yes he&#x27;s a defender, but this is a different league with squad rotations and different points to play for. 

Our play here is really corners (and set pieces), as most of Van Dijk&#x27;s shots come from headers off corner kicks. PSV play an attack heavy style which favors this, as I expect the pitch to be stretched and a lot of set plays. They conceded an average of 6.5 corners per match, but usually 7-8 against better sides. Vegas is also expecting 7+ corners, and I like the chances of one of the 7+ corners landing on their top target van Dijk.

Van Dijk is also Dutch, playing against a Dutch team, comprised of mostly Dutch players. There will be a bit of ego/pride in play here, as van Dijk knows many of these players on PSV and will want to show out. Van Dijk is the Netherlands team captain after all, on top of being the captain for Liverpool.

**Mind your units here**, the play is +255 for a reason. But I like the value, BOL if tailing and as always feel free to fade. Have a great Wednesday!</td></tr>

Sport: Champions League - Atletico Madrid vs. Inter Milan @ 3:00pm EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: BTTS + Under 5 goals = +115 (5 units)

Write up: Atletico Madrid has been finding form in La Liga recently and has been defensively very solid while Inter Milan has carried on their scoring ways. Inter Milan is sitting in a great position in the CL table, Atletico needs to start bringing their form into the CL and I believe Simeone will have his team ready. Therefore, I believe both teams to be good enough to be dangerous however they both won’t take outrageous risks. Therefore, I expect each to score but this not to be a high scoring affair. This is subject to change based on starting lineup announcement. 

BOL!</td></tr>

This feels like a long time ago now. But I can actually remember it very well now that I&#x27;m writing about it again.

A very cruel loss here , the away side and under dogs Schalke raced to a 2-0 lead in the first 14 minutes.

They then sat back and defended for most of the game and despite scoring 3 times , all 3 goals for Hannover got overturned by Var, so many chances and goals ruled out I&#x27;m still pissed about this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> 2 months later 😂



<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>:
 
Uefa Champions League:

PSG Vs Tottenham 

**PSG win and over 2.5 goals 

(1.80) 2 units **

Defending champions PSG host a Tottenham side who started the season well but the wheels have started to come off badly for them.

The sides met at the start of the season for Super Cup, which ended 2-2 , the PSG squad had just played the club world cup 3 weeks before this and the players had just come back from their summer break, with no training or match fitness they still almost won this.

PSG come into this game with 3 wins from 4 champions League games, **scoring 14 goals conceding 5**, they are outrageously stacked in attack so even with injuries to Dembele and Doue, Kvaratskhelia should start coming back from an injury, and Barcola and Ramos look good as has midfielder Joao Neves who&#x27;s scored 6 goals in his last 5 matches in all competitions.

For Tottenham they started the season well, but have just **1 win in their last 5 matches** , it&#x27;s not just the fact they&#x27;ve not been winning it&#x27;s how they&#x27;ve been getting dominated alot of matches, Dominated against Arsenal in a 4-1 loss, dominated at home to Chelsea where they lost 1-0 but Chelsea managed 3.67 XG. Away matches against Leeds who managed 16 shots and 1.6xg, Everton managed 1.78 xg against them Leeds and Everton both teams without a good striker between them.

Leeds and Everton didn&#x27;t punish Tottenham despite playing well and creating a ton of chances they both lack great attacking players,but a team as good as PSG really should score at the very least 2 goals here.

Tottenham will get chances though, and do usually find a way to score.
Since Hakimi&#x27;s injury at right back , midfielder Zaire-Emery has been filling in and although he&#x27;s an incredible midfield he&#x27;s out of position here only 19 years old, they have conceded a lot more shots in the 2 games he&#x27;s played out of position whether that&#x27;s a coincidence or not.

As long as PSG can break Tottenham down reasonably early I can&#x27;t see why they don&#x27;t win this and the match has at least 3 goals here.

Cadenasso transitioning from a final on clay in Montemar three days ago to now *indoor* clay in Maiai might find him taking a while to adjust.

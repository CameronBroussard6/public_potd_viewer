1/6: Miami Heat @ Minnesota Timberwolves 8:10pm EST
<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Over 238.5 Points -110

Tonight I’ll be looking at the 1st game of the NBC Coast to Coast games. The Heat will travel to face the TWolves after just facing each other in Miami on 1/3. In that game we saw a final total of 240 points and big games from Ant and Naz Reid. 

I’m expecting another high scoring affair with the Heat leading the NBA in pace at 104.3 and the TWolves being slightly above average with 100.3. Both teams play fast but have also been towards the top/middle in terms of offensive efficiency (Heat #17 &amp; TWolves #8). 

Norman Powell is coming off one of his best games hitting 9 3s and leading the Heat with 34 in their 16 point win over the Pelicans on Sunday evening. 

Both teams have the capability to reach 125+ points but we should just need one to break that mark and the other around the 115 mark. The current spread favors the TWolves by -4.5 so I’m expecting a competitive game similar to the prior matchup a few days ago.</td></tr>

Event: Islanders vs. Devils, 7pm

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Ilya Sorokin over 24.5 saves

Odds: -125 Fanduel

Reasoning: The Devils are fifth in the league in shots on goal at 29.6 per game. They’ve played the Islanders twice this year and had 31 and 33 shots in both of those contests. Sorokin was in the net for one of those, and has cleared 25 saves in 6 of the last 7 games. He’s been up and down this year, but at home he’s averaging 25.3 saves and has covered the line in 7 of 12 games.</td></tr>

Event: NCAAB: UNLV @ Wyoming (10PM EST)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Wyoming ML (-185) 1u to win 0.54u

Write Up: Going with late night NCAAB again <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> to try to stretch the streak out to 4 wins in a row! Wyoming is currently 5-1 in their last 6 games as a favorite and 8-1 at home. They are a solid team at creating second and third chances through offensive rebounding (46th) and a top 50 team in terms of opponent&#x27;s 3PT % (42nd).

UNLV is not a great 3PT shooting team (28.2%) , and so they will have to attack down low. However, attacking down low can only get you so far if you are mediocre at offensive rebounding (132nd) and trash at the free throw line (289th at 68.6%).

If ML isn&#x27;t enough juice for the squeeze, I&#x27;d feel comfortable with a line up to about -5.5, but it is late night CBB and anything can happen so I&#x27;ll be content in just riding with Wyoming ML and hopefully continuing this streak.</td></tr>

Competition: Turkish Super Cup

Sport: Football 

Reasoning: No value <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> but the line here is good value for a potential edge. Over 2.5 goals comes in because Fenerbahçe’s home attacking rate alone pushes the match total close to three goals, and Samsunspor contribute enough away threat that the game rarely stays at 2–0 unless Fener completely shut it down.

**🏀 Wendell Carter Jr. o8.5 Rebounds -110** vs the Washington Wizards

Big man play. Wizards are ranked **last** in the NBA in rebounds allowed to Centers. Beautiful.

Wendell has seen his minutes slowly rise, averaging 32.4 minutes / game in his L5 up from 30.4 this season. His coach two days ago has openly praised his performances lately, adding more incentive to play.

Wendell&#x27;s cashed in L3/3, getting 10+ rebounds against the Pacers twice, and the Bulls. He&#x27;s also cashed in L3/4 vs Wizards. 

He already sees an average of 16.1 Potential Rebounds / game, looking great to hit 9 against a bad rebounding team.

**Write Up:** Vucevic cashes us out with a strong 2nd half to make us hit 3 POTDs in a row! <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>, I like Siakam to go over 3.5 assists. This should be a pretty fast paced game and I can see Siakam getting a couple assists in transition. Siakam has hit this mark in 4 of his last 5.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: (NCAAB) Houston Cougars -3.5 vs Texas Tech Red Raiders (-188) (9:00 PM EST)**

Reasoning: Houston are 13-1 on the season and are at home for this matchup with 11-3 Texas Tech. Houston’s defense is no joke. They rank 6th in the country in adjusted defensive efficiency. Houston hasn’t been great on the offensive end ranking 95th in adjusted offensive efficiency and are up against a Texas Tech team that are solid defensively and offensively however not elite. Despite how good Texas Tech has been offensively, Texas Tech ranks 235th in the nation in field goal percentage and going against an elite defense in Houston which is worrisome. Texas Tech rely on  offensive rebounding and limiting turnovers to generate points but against Houston, that won’t be so easy. Line movement has also moved in favor of Houston. With that being said, I’m laying the 3.5 points on Houston to cover at home (playable at -6.5).

Event: Mavericks at Kings 


<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Naji Marshall over 17.5 points amd rebounds 


Write Up: PJ Washington is doubtful with a sprained ankle, so there will be more minutes amd rebound opportunities for Naji. Naji actually averages over 20 PR on the road, and on top of that, the Kings are one of the worst in the league at giving rebounds to opponents. The Kings embarrassed the Mavericks last time they played, so tjere will be revenge on the mind for the Mavs. Between the Kings being bad on defense, bad at giving up rebounds, and Naji playing really well on the road (a full 3PR more than his home average), I think Naji goes over here. </td></tr>

They have one common opponent which is FSU, Georgia won 107-73 at FSU and Florida won 78-76 at home. Georgia is the highest scoring team in NCAA and can put up points with anyone.

**NCAAB - Bowling Green @ Kent State, 7 PM ET**

***Kent State -1.5 (-120) 1.5u***

To college basketball we go! - the only thing that’s good about the football season winding down, is the opportunity to diversify the things I gamble on in the winter time, as spring comes into focus. <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> I love this trend:

Kent State are 11-3 on the season, meanwhile Bowling Green are 11-4 - but **Bowling Green have lost 12 STRAIGHT games against Kent St, losing by an average of 11 points a game. Bowling Green haven’t beaten Kent St this decade.**

Now - I emphasize, this is a full blown gut play. There is definitely a *roadblock* here, which is why Vegas had the original spread to Bowling Green, and the total is still in the mid 150s:

These are two top 20 offensive units in the country, both scoring on average in the 80s, *BUT Kent St are literally one of the nations WORST defensive teams (324th PPGA).*

I’m not scared of Bowling Green outshooting Kent St, *as much as I am Kent State losing the battle up and down the floor*. On paper, Bowling Green’s defensive advantages should keep the game close, but I can’t bet against history.

This isn’t one to tail for the faint of heart. This could be one to fade for fun. Either way this is gonna be one worth watching if you love high pace basketball.

Last play review:

***Leicester/West Brom, Total o2.5*** ✅

(As I was preparing my write up for a 4th consecutive defeat, an absolute world class goal by Fatawu (who should be on the AFCON stage with Ghana , but they’re awful right now) won us the bet. He saved our asses, I will be donating to a charity of his choice if I can find one 😂)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: **Andrew Nembhard O25.5 PA -122 (FanDuel) 1U**

Event: NBA | Cavaliers @ Pacers (7:10 pm EST) | 🏀

*Recap: Wild game. William and Mary shot out of the cannon and led by seven early before Charleston settled in. The Tribe converted 2-of-18 from deep in the first half, and the Cougars led by 14 at the half. William and Mary started the second half absolutely on fire, and even pulled within one possession, but Charleston had enough answers at home. That&#x27;s four wins in a row to begin my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> experiment. Not too bad. We move!*

We&#x27;re going back to the well with one of the worst teams in the league. I must be an idiot. But pride counts for something, and the Indiana Pacers are trying to avoid a dubious distinction. A loss tonight sets a team record for consecutive futility. Indiana has stared at an unlucky 13th-straight defeat three times before in the team&#x27;s history. The last time was the 1988-89 season. Well, they have another inglorious chance at it. But tonight.... at home... against a divisional foe... with pride on the line? Yeah, I&#x27;m rolling with Andrew Nembhard again.

What am I missing? He *just* got this exact same line against an Orlando Magic team that is lights-out at defending opposing points guards. Nembhard cleared it playing against Jalen Suggs - the &quot;eater-of-assists&quot; - and easily did it again, days later, with Suggs out. Now, we&#x27;re supposed to be afraid of Darius Garland? Garland, the same guy with a defensive impact rating in the bottom 20 percent of the league? Garland, who Nembhard shot better than 50 percent from the floor when he was the closest defender during the 2025 playoffs? Garland, who is four inches shorter than Nembhard? I see Nembhard playing bully ball and aggressively looking for baskets since Benedict Mathurin and Obi Toppin are still out. *(See my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> write up from Jan. 4 as to why you would back him in points alone).*

Need more? See also: December 1. Nembhard cleared 25.5 PA by netting 21 points and six assists against the Cavs and a much better defender (Donovan Mitchell) on him. Sure, the Pacers lost that game, 135-119, but Mitchell is out tonight and Jarrett Allen is questionable with an illness. My thesis is the offense will absolutely go through Nembhard, who has already seen a spike in usage rate this year. Full disclosure: I looked at Siakem for points, but I don&#x27;t like his history against Evan Mobley. Meanwhile, Cleveland ranks a very pedestrian 15th against opposing point guards scoring. But I&#x27;m banking on Garland&#x27;s underwhelming defense, and Mitchell&#x27;s absence, to allow Nembhard opportunities to go inside or pull up from midrange. And don&#x27;t discount the pride factor. These are professionals in a highly-professional organization. They don&#x27;t want to be known for this streak. Trust.

Good luck and godspeed!</td></tr>

I truly understand why Žalgiris is an underdog here, they play away, the situation behind the scenes and locker room were not so great and etc, but.. Everything is in the past already, Žalgiris showed that they can play away, seems that coach Masiulis have found right talk with his team leaders and everything is cool right now. Žalgiris has great perimeter players in Fracisko and Goss, while Virtus relays on Edwards who sprained his ankle in game vs Milano, moreover Žalgiris defense 1on1 is great, because of Butkevičius and Goss. Źalgiris have no injuries(except D. Giedraitis who is not playing at all either way) while Virtus is still uncertain about Smailagic and Edwards.

Finally back in the winning column after 4 losses in a row! This line seems low as Auston Matthews seems to be back in form lately. Ever since William Nylander has been out (last 4 games), he&#x27;s been an offensive juggernaut hitting that line easily (6,5,5,9) and scoring 6 goals so he&#x27;s definitely feeling confident about his shot again.

Event: NBA / Magic @ Wizards &amp; Cavaliers @ Pacers 7:00 pm EST

Two good players vs two horrendous defenses. I could end the write up here. 

To start things off Black has hit this line 8/8 times without Wagner &amp; Suggs in the lineup. He is now playing the most amount of minutes tied with Banchero. The Wizards rank 29th in opponent points per game, 28th in rebounds , and 28th in assists this season. Now, they have tightened up just a bit in their L3 games so we will take a bit of insurance on his line. 

Now, Garland hasn’t been a world beater this season, but let’s not forget last season when Donovan Mitchell didn’t play. He has hit this line 7/10 times and had multiple 25+ point games, plus a 40 bomb on the Raptors. Max Strus also is not playing, and when they are both out he has exploded for 42 &amp; 45 pra. Jarrett Allen is also listed as questionable with an illness. The Pacers rank 24th in opponent points per game, 30th in rebounds, and 6th in assists. They have been miserable lately. In their L3 they sit at 27th, 22nd, and 21st respectively. 

I love both to have great games, and I expect Garland to erupt and remind everybody just how good he is when he is the No1 option.</td></tr>

Reasoning: Como come into this match in better overall form and with more momentum than Pisa, especially in away performances where they’ve shown they can control games. On the other hand, Pisa have struggled for consistency, particularly defensively, and tend to leave spaces late in matches when chasing results. Como’s stronger structure, sharper transitions, and higher confidence level give them the edge to take this by at least one goal.

**Event**: English Premier League - West Ham United vs Nottingham Forest - 20:00 GMT+0

**Write Up**: Two teams in poor form in 17th and 18th possession but I think there is honestly miles between them. And it mainly comes down to the midfield Gibbs-White, Anderson, Dominguez is leagues above Fernandes, Potts and Magassa. Now, the way Dyche sets Forest up doesn&#x27;t let them shine as they could do but still. West Ham haven&#x27;t won in 9 and haven&#x27;t looked close to doing it either. They are a haphazard team with no cohesion and no quality. I&#x27;ve mentioned on here before how little I believe in this team and I&#x27;m going to do it again. They are BAD. And not only are they bad, I think they&#x27;ve largely given up and the press have been leaked a few things about Nuno and his relationship with the players and that is the clearest sign that this moment is nearly complete between the two. I suspect if he&#x27;s really lost the dressing room, that West Ham will roll over for Forest and Nuno will be sacked.</td></tr>

**Write-up:**  
Going with Juventus here. They’ve been much more consistent than Sassuolo this season and usually take care of business in these kinds of matchups. Even when Juve isn’t flashy, they tend to manage games well against lower-table sides.

Sassuolo can be dangerous on their day, but they’ve been unreliable defensively and struggle when teams control possession and tempo - which is exactly how Juve likes to play these spots. Juventus also has more depth and experience, which usually shows over 90 minutes.

Not a lock, but at these odds I’m comfortable backing the better team to get the win.

Rangers have completely transformed under new manager Danny Rohl. They are the much better team here, and I wouldn’t hate placing a bet for them to put 2 or 3 past Aberdeen along with the win, but I’m keeping it simple and low risk. Rangers expected goals have been insane lately, and they recently beat Hibernian 1-0 who just beat Aberdeen 2-0.

I really can’t see anything but a Rangers win here so should be fine to place a bigger bet here to get some return.</td></tr>

NBA | Magic v Wizards | 🏀  

Payday! Thanks chef curry who ends on 6 dimes

Wizards has been an elite matchup for rebounds for opposing PF’s &amp; centers this season, perfect spot for Banchero here who had 11 rebounds in the earlier meeting this season. Paolo only played 26 minutes in that game due to a 31 point blowout win, with Franz Wagner and Suggs active who are both out for this one.

Books are expecting a closer contest with a 6.5 spread, and it does make somewhat sense with Suggs/Franz out &amp; the Wizards playing more competitive as of late.

With both of them out he’s over in 5/8 games this season and is now facing a Wizards side that has allowed 5th most rebounds to PF’s this season. Perfect spot for Paolo to rack up the weak side rebounds with Sarr back for the Wizards who like to stretch the floor.

Saw Giannis with 15, Ighodaro 10, Aldama 10 &amp; 10 &amp; Mamu 11 rebounds.. just to name a few PF’s matched up against the Wizards recently.

This is a model play, converted my old model into a kenpom-esque model.  Model seems to think the let down spot &amp; travel spot for UCF is not significant enough to make up for the talent discrepancy; UCF looked unphased in their only road game this year, and should be able to keep this a close game.  If UCF can contain Anthony Roy, they should cover this number easily, if not win outright.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Paolo Banchero Double Double YES (+100) 1 unit**

**Last Pick Write Up:** Wow we managed to hit this line, it was looking really bleak until we got two quick goals out of the Kings in the 2nd period. The Wild had multiple power plays where they just couldn&#x27;t convert and we even had a goal called back from the Kings (it was the correct call), Wild managed to close the goal gap 2-3 and emptied their net which allowed for an easy Kings goal to push us across the line. Saved by the bell but ill take it.

**Write up:** Finally onto our first NBA <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, we&#x27;re gonna take what people might view as a &quot;risky&quot; <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. I think Paolo should clear this line, he has looked much better every game he plays coming back from injury and looking like his allstar self. These last few weeks havent been kind to his public perception, however he was coming off of a groin injury which resulted in him not being able to do simple things such as even jumping. Paolo is a phyiscal guy and he knows how to use it when hes healthy. I favor him to get to this line. In the last 5 games hes hit this 3 times, and he has looked much better every game he plays.

**This is a somewhat risky <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> so please do your own research/fade.**

**Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> Reaction:** The curse continues. Luka had 30 at the end of 3Q. Surely the NBA&#x27;s scoring leader can manage 3 points in an entire 4th quarter? Nope. Bricks every shot and free throw, finishes with 30. Ah well, no more Luka bets.

After a little break I&#x27;ll take another shot here with a reliable strategy in backing forwards/centers against the Wizards. 

Banchero has been playing well lately and seems to be fully recovered from injury, recording 40+ PRA in 4 straight games and averaging 44.8 PRA in that stretch. This is a good spot for him to continue this streak against the most favorable matchup in the league. 

WAS is in the bottom five in all three categories of points, rebounds, and assists given up to opposing power forwards. Their front court is either too inexperienced (Sarr), too old (Middleton), or too foul-prone (Bagley) to put up meaningful resistance against the more talented big men in the league. This has been a recurring issue for WAS for the last several years. 

In his last five games against the Wizards , Paolo is over this line in 4/5. The one miss was when Wagner was playing, and Paolo&#x27;s numbers all increase without Wagner. Interestingly, all 4 hits were games in Washington (the one miss last season was in Orlando). 

Blowouts are always a consideration in a Wizards game, though the point spread is set to 6.5 so it is expected to be competitive. And in their one previous matchup this season, Paolo covered anyway despite the blowout and playing only 26 minutes. 

Rough stretch lately but this is one of the more favorable spots I&#x27;ve seen. Tail with caution, on account of the curse.</td></tr>

BOYS, yall  won&#x27;t believe the facts I have for you <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> so fasten your seat belts lads



I&#x27;m confused whether to take the under 2.5 here or the BTTS NO, I finally ended up with the BTTS NO and here is my analysis.



PISA HAVE SCORED ONCE IN 9 HOME GAMES. You read that right ONCE. A SINGLE GOAL. Away they&#x27;ve scored 12 in 9 games which is very weird.



PISA HAVE A 0% HOME BTTS RECORD while Como only have a 33% away BTTS record.



4/5 last away games for Como didn&#x27;t see BTTS 



And  as I said before none of Pisa&#x27;s home games have seen BTTS.



I&#x27;m not calling this bet a lock, cuz no bet is a lock. But with these statistics we gotta bet man, if we lose so be it, BUT my job here is to bring y&#x27;all bets with an edge so we keep winning long time and trust me, we will! GL!</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: San Antonio Spurs -5.5 (-105) 2 Units

1/6/2026 5:00pm PST / NBA / San Antonio Spurs @ Memphis Grizzlies

Narrative: Grizzlies on a 4 game losing skid, while the Spurs took a tough loss themselves in their most recent match up against Portland. A good get back spot for SAS to bounce back into the winning column and sustain their position amongst the top of the Western Conference. The Grizzlies are a fringe play-in team with a lack of identity this year in my opinion. Rookie, Coward, has really been the engine for them and he’ll be out for this game, only the 2nd missed game of his career. Ja Morant of course is a high powered engine himself, but he is questionable to play after coming down with a calf contusion last game, which a strain on the same calf caused him to miss 10 games back in November. I’m going to assume MEM doesn’t push their franchise guy to play here unless he insists. On the other hand, Vassell will be out for the Spurs, and Wembanyama with a questionable designation. Wemby has missed the last 2 games after hyperextending his knee, but took part in 5-on-5 work <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> according to the Spurs, which gives us hope for him lacing up. Spurs have won 10 of 14 games without Wemby so far this season, by an average of 8.3 points. Wemby or not, -5.5 sounds good to me. GG!

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Pisa Vs Como - **Como ML @ 1.76 (Melbet)**

**Write Up:** Pisa and Como come into this match in very different form. Pisa are still struggling to find consistency, while Como arrive full of confidence with a clear game plan. Como head into the game after two straight wins without conceding and are pushing for a top-four spot and European football. Pisa, on the other hand, have managed just one win all season and are already facing a tough battle to stay in the league.

Pisa have drawn three of their last five games, including 1–1 away at Genoa and 2–2 at Cagliari. These results show they can stay competitive, but often struggle to see games through. They’ve scored just 13 goals in 18 league matches, which explains why tight games usually don’t go their way. At home, losses to Juventus and Parma without scoring highlight their attacking problems.

Pisa have failed to score in three of their last five matches and conceded first in four of them. Even when they’re well organised, goals are hard to come by. Nine draws from 18 games show resilience, but also a lack of cutting edge. Against a more clinical and in-form Como side, that pattern could prove costly.

Como’s recent form has been well balanced. They’ve won three of their last five matches, including clean-sheet victories over Udinese and Sassuolo. Even their losses to Roma and Inter Milan were more about facing top opposition than any drop in performance.

Defensively, Como have been one of the standout teams in the league, conceding just 12 goals in 17 matches. That strength carries over away from home, highlighted by a convincing 3–0 win at Lecce where they stayed in control and took their chances. They’ll also take confidence from past meetings, having beaten Pisa 3–1 in March 2024 and remaining unbeaten in the last five head-to-heads. Overall, Como look more settled and reliable at both ends of the pitch.

Pisa struggle to score and often fall behind early, which makes this a very tough game for them. Como are organised, confident, and strong at the back, giving them a clear advantage. Based on the form and stats, Como should be comfortable winners here.

**Write Up:**

Rangers are coming off of an amazing away win vs Celtic. The last 3 times they&#x27;ve won away at Celtic a win followed in the next fixture

Aberdeen are out of form away from home. Winning 4 and losing 6 games with no draws. Scoring 7 goals in those 10 games combined. This includes a 3-1 loss away at Celtic recently who just lost to Rangers

It doesn&#x27;t bode well for Aberdeen this game with Rangers being the in form team having won 4 out of L5 games except against surprising league leaders Hearts. They also boast an impressive 5-4-1 home record. They rarely lose at home with the only loss being against Hearts earlier in the season

Rangers have also had the upper hand in this fixture in recent years. L10 went 7-2-1 in favor of Rangers

The 23rd of December Sporting CP beat Vitoria 1-4 away from home. I don&#x27;t think things have changed enough for Vitoria to get their hopes up

Vitoria in the league have played 8 games away from home, only scoring 4 in the process

Sporting have scored 27 goals in 8 home games whilst only conceding 3

It might be a cup game but those numbers are very telling of the way this game will probably go

Sorokin will be back in goal tomorrow for the Islanders after being out with a lower body injury for the last 2 weeks. He’s had a good year so far (.910 save percentage and 2.55 GAA). The Islanders are underdogs at home, despite being 13-8-2 this year and they get their star goaltender back.

The Devils will be starting Markstrom most likely. He has been good over the last month, but this is still a matchup that favors the Islanders. Markstrom started against the Islanders on 12/23 and only allowed 2 goals on 25 shots. 

But the issue with the Devils is scoring goals. They are near the bottom of the league in goals scored per game and are going up against one of the best goalies in the league, and the Islanders are + money.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>**: Dimitrov -3,0 games @ 1,93



Odds here are reflecting lack of Dimitrov match shape as he only played Paris since he retired in that match in Wimbledon where he had Sinner on ropes. In that match in Paris I backed Dimitrov against Mpetshi Perricard and it was an easy win. However, he withdrew from the second round. It&#x27;s been more than couple months since them and I guess he is match fit. He should especially be match fit in his first match of the tournament/season, and I&#x27;m much more inclined to back him in R1 than later.



Carreno Busta played two Q rounds here, managing to win Bellucci in 3rd set tie breaker and then Cazaux retired in first set. Should be better prepared for conditions here, but quality difference at this age is bigger than ever and surface advantage should be huge. Odds are going down on Dimitrov, but since I expect him to cruise here I like this line. Dimotrov has a SF and a title here last couple of years.

Edit: OK, I’ve noticed my comments are not being published although I can see them as posted. Same thing about the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> I posted yesterday and I guess the reason is this is a new account. Maybe comments get visible later. I’m not really experienced reddit user so not able to post a screenshot here (don’t know if it’s possible), but I posted one in an unpublished comment. I can send dm of my yesterday pick as I see it to anyone interested.

Al wahda vs Bani Yas, over 3.5 goals @ 2.31

Al Wahda vs Bani Yas has goals written all over it. Al Wahda are strong at home, play attacking football, and rarely slow the tempo, while Bani Yas struggle defensively and concede plenty of chances. Both sides are capable of scoring, and with open play expected, this matchup suits a high-scoring game. Over 3.5 goals at 2.31 looks excellent value in a game that should be fast, aggressive, and full of chances.</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>**POTD Record:** 7-23-3 *Can you believe it, the curse is lifted at last and once again, it&#x27;s the AFCON that does it for us! Some luck finally came my way as Egypt scored first, but they were quickly stunned. The BTTS <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> that I suggested also came through for us. What a day, but now&#x27;s the time to build on this, and two hours later I&#x27;ve identified just the right match to get us over the line. Onwards and upwards, there&#x27;s still a very long way to go if I want to properly recover the good old bankroll*

**Event:** Serie A, Pisa v Como, 9:00 am EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Pisa Win or Draw +100, 1 unit

**Write Up:** We&#x27;re backing the underdog again in the always unpredictable Serie A *(or rather, the only predictable thing about it is that the matches are going to be dry as hell).* On paper, Como’s league position and recent form make them look stronger, but there are some reasons as to why I think Pisa are getting something out of <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>&#x27;s game. Hear me out.

Firstly, Pisa are very tricky to play against, constantly suffocating the opposing forwards and **grinding out draws at home,** thanks to their physical and well organised defence. The narrative that Pisa are easily beaten ignores how hard they’ve made games tough at their ground. Despite flirting with relegation, they&#x27;ve proven they can absolutely grind out results as they&#x27;ve just earned an impressive 1-1 draw away at Genoa, and **five of their last six away trips have ended in draws or narrow results.** Their ability to keep matches tight makes them a strong <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> against a Como team that isn’t unbeatable. Frankly, I find this team overrated, the media and people genuinely seem to have inflated their value because of the vibes (Fabregas is the manager, they&#x27;ve signed well known semi washed players as well as a wonderkid in Nico Paz, the location is rich and aesthetic etc.) and the &quot;small club making it in the top flight&quot; narrative, even though they&#x27;ve spent crazy amounts of money for their size just to languish in upper midtable and be questionable in a match against Pisa, with all due respect to Pisa (I want them to do well as I&#x27;m backing them).

Yes, Pisa have struggled for goals *(only one scored in nine home league games),* but they’ve often frustrated opponents and forced teams to slow down the tempo. Against a Como side that has been more vulnerable on the road and **missing some key players** (more on that later), Pisa’s organised defence is there to limit chances and raise the likelihood of a draw or narrow win for the hosts. They generally concede fewer high-quality chances than raw tables suggest.

Next up is the H2H that includes several draws and tight contests. Pisa aren&#x27;t a side that would collapse against Como out of all the teams; past meetings have often been close. In the past **3 years, Como have only registered one league win against Pisa,** while two matches ended in a draw.

What also gives Pisa hope ahead of this clash is that Como&#x27;s key man, **Nico Paz is just returning from injury and therefore won&#x27;t be at 100%,** some minute management is also likely. The pacey **Assane Diao is also out,** as is Alvaro Morata, while Jayden Addai remains questionable. The Douvikas-Paz partnership has been fairly fruitful for Como this season and with the latter not being at full strength, Pisa&#x27;s defence shouldn&#x27;t be tested quite as much.

All in all, I think Como have just been punching over their weight class this season and they&#x27;re bound to drop points against a resilient side in Pisa, who will be looking to escape the relegation scrap in front of their diehard fans. The odds of +100 that cover a win and a draw are just too good to ignore here. I also like the BTTS No and the Under 2.5 Goals narrative if you&#x27;re up to some experimentation, *but I&#x27;ve just focused on match results after the Mozambique debacle*. Going with just a unit once again as I&#x27;m saving my bankroll for a huge play on Wednesday. BOL and let&#x27;s get a streak going ☘️🫡</td></tr>

**Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Jordan James 1+ SOT (+125) ❌️

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s Event:** English Premier League (Soccer) | West Ham vs Nottingham Forest (12:00 PM PST)

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Neco Williams 1+ SOT (+240) 1 unit to win 2.4 units

**Write Up:** Tough loss yesterday as James took 3 shots, two of which were very close to finding the target. He also logged an assist instead of shooting inside the box, which was not ideal for us. Still like the read and would play it again, just unfortunate luck this go around. We move on.

A proper relegation battle here as 18th place West Ham host 17th place Forest. Neither of these teams are good, but both desperately need a win here. Forest are 4 points ahead of West Ham in the League, a win for them brings them 7 points clear of the danger zone. Conversely for West Ham, a win here brings them within 1 point of the safe zone. Huge implications at this point in the season, as both teams are losing to every team above them. 

Neco Williams is the 1st choice fullback (plays both left and right) for Forest (and Wales). Yes, I&#x27;m playing another defender in a shot prop. This is another combination of current form and data. Neco has been in great form, landing a SOT in 4 of his last 5 matches including vs Man City who allow the 2nd fewest SOTs in the league. He&#x27;s also had 6 SOTs in his last 7 matches. Coach Dyche has been encouraging him to play further forward and take shots, and I expect that trend to continue here. 

West Ham conversely are the worst defensive team in the league. They have conceded the most SOTs in the EPL this season with 105, 2nd most shots in league with 300 (avg 15 per game), and the most goals with 40. They also look like a team defeated, giving last place Wolves their first win of the season over the weekend 3-0. In that match, they let in 9 SOTs. Interestingly, the entire back 3 for Wolves each got an SOT in that match. Backtracking one more game where West Ham hosted Brighton (who play a similar shape to Forest), West Ham conceded a SOT to each of the two Brighton wingers, including a goal. The point here is that West Ham are weak against fullbacks, that combined with Neco&#x27;s current form and playing further forward in a wingback-type role put this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> on my radar. 

**The odds are high on this for a reason, so mind your units here.** There&#x27;s always risk in these plays as the odds climb, but we&#x27;ve hit a +245 play before here when Woltemade cashed us with 2 SOTs, so they can hit and I love the value this one brings. 

BOL and happy Tuesday!</td></tr>

West ham are a surprisingly great corner generating team, averaging around 6 for them at home, covering in 9/10 home PL games, one miss vs Spurs, where they had a red card around the 50th min. Between them, this line hit last season twice, this season, it hit again in the reverse matchup with 7 for West Ham playing away @ Forest. Forest allow close to 5 on average when playing away as well. Forest have been carded in 9/10 away games this season with west ham at home averaging around 2 cards per game for their opponents. Ref is not the best, but we are not asking for much here.</td></tr>

Last Pick: Wu to win first set vs Marozsan (+110, 1 unit) ✅

Tennis | ATP Hong Kong | 5:00 AM EST (estimated)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Jan-Lennard Struff vs Botic van de Zandschulp | **Struff to win 2-0 at +175. 1 unit.**

Write-up: Jan-Lennard Struff comes into this first-round Hong Kong match in a strong position. He already won two qualifying matches against Zsombor Piros and Nishesh Basavareddy, which means that he should be more accustomed to these conditions than Botic. It was hard to find a streakier player than the German in 2025, but his highs, which included US Open wins over Holger Rune and Frances Tiafoe, were certainly high. One pattern, however, is that the faster the courts are, the better Struff&#x27;s aggressive shot selection and willingness to come to net work out for him. From what I watched of yesterday&#x27;s action, these courts seemed to be extremely quick, with big hitter Cilic scoring an easy win over the crafty Mannarino and most players performing well on serve. 

Meanwhile, I&#x27;m a bit less certain that Botic can take advantage of the conditions. Unlike Struff, he ended last year on a downswing, and it&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve felt as if he was fully committed to a tournament. I don&#x27;t doubt that Botic has the tools to be performing better, and the new year can always inspire fresh motivation, but I don&#x27;t think this is the tournament where he turns things around. In general, his heavy forehand is most effective on slower hard courts, and Indian Wells/Miami in March has historically been when he finds his stride. With that in mind, it&#x27;s hard to ignore Struff&#x27;s preparation advantage and strong qualifying performance to back someone who ended last year on very uncertain terms. 

Keep in mind that I like Struff&#x27;s ML as well if you can get it at -150 or better. This is my personal play simply because the odds are more favorable, and I think there&#x27;s a good chance that Struff can take control early and roll from there. There&#x27;s not really an inherent level gap between these players, so I wouldn&#x27;t feel confident in Struff coming back or outlasting in a third set if Botic does come in strong.</td></tr>

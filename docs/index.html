**ROI: +12.33%**

**Ice Hockey** | **NHL** | **8PM EST**

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Vegas Golden Knights @ SJ Sharks ML (+145 on BET365 at time of posting), 1U for 2.45U**

**Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> recap:** Well, he got the shots and the power-play time, but Logan Thompson had a great game and only conceded a PP goal, one that Bedard wasn&#x27;t involved in. Such is life. Well, back to it then.

**Write Up:** This is more of a gut <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> than anything else, and there are plenty of reasons not to like it, not the least of which is that *Vegas has won their last 10 matchups against San Jose*, the 2nd longest active winning streak vs. a franchise (the longest is Nashville, also vs. the Sharks), so by all means fade me, but I have this feeling that&#x27;s about to change. Check it out.

1. Both teams will be on back-to-backs, with the Sharks pulling out a 5-4 OT win after erasing 2 2-goal deficits and tying the game in the 3rd with 5 minutes remaining, a big morale boost for sure. Vegas will be coming off an as-of-yet unknown result because their game doesn&#x27;t start for another hour..see where I&#x27;m going here? 

2. Sharks are at home for both, where they&#x27;re 13-8-3, and they&#x27;ll be sleeping in their own beds, whereas Vegas playing away, where they&#x27;re 10-5-6, and will be traveling from home after a game that wraps less than 20 hours before this game starts...see where I&#x27;m going here???

3. Vegas won their last 2 (or 3, depending on tonight), but prior to that they lost 8 of 9. SJ are on a 3-game win streak and won 6 of their last 7. So they&#x27;re trending in different directions.

4. SJ started Nedeljkovic (7-8-2) <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, meaning Askarov (16-10-1) starts tomorrow. They&#x27;re also likely getting 1st-unit PP and top-4 D-man John Klingberg back tomorrow. Vegas, however, is in a bad way, goalie-wise. Newest Golden Knight and presumed r\*pist Carter Hart is week-to-week, and Adin Hill, last year&#x27;s primary starter, is going to be reevaluated Tuesday. They start Schmid (12-4-5) tonight, meaning they probably start 4th-string Lindblom (1-4-2) tomorrow, unless they go back to Schmid who will therefore be playing 2 games in less than 24-hours. Not great.

5. So far this season, SJ has had the 5th-hardest schedule vs. Vegas who&#x27;ve had the 6th-easiest. 

As I said, there are still plenty of reasons not to like this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>: Vegas leads the division, has better overall stats and, as I said, has had SJ&#x27;s number for a while, but there&#x27;s a reason there is only 1 longer active streak between teams, and I&#x27;m calling it now, this one is breaking tomorrow!

**Prop Bonus:** I mean, Macklin Celebrini? Kind of a no-doubter there. He cashed us <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> on 4-SOG (thanks lordestros!) and is on a 13-game, 27-point streak (9G 18A), over 2PPG in that span. On the other side, Mark Stone has points in his last 6 (6G 2A)

Onto this, Brandon has been playing some good tennis. In past outings I have found him to be alright but he is consistent in Brisbane. I see this match going one of two ways. Daniil wins 7-6 6-4 or we go into 3 sets. I am hoping for 3 sets. I&#x27;ll be asleep during the match so I&#x27;m hoping to wake up to a win.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: 🏈 Jaguars ML (-115) 

Game starts at 1pm EST. Bet 2u

Writeup: This is gonna be a fun one. The Buffalo Bills are taking on the Jacksonville Jaguars for the first game tomorrow. I would not be surprised if the winner of this game goes to the Super Bowl, but I’m giving the edge to the Jags in this one.

The Jags have won 8 straight games and have the highest point differential over those games. They are arguably the hottest team in football right now. They were originally underdogs in this one, but the line has shifted to favor the Jags. Quarterback Trevor Lawrence is looking like his former Clemson self and is playing the best professional ball of his career. He also has a supporting cast around him that has been far better than anyone could have guessed, especially considering both Brian Thomas Jr and Travis Hunter did not pan out like they thought they would. If that wasn’t enough, on defense, the Jags sport the best rush defense in the league. 

The Jags will be facing a Bills team that, quite frankly, looks the worst they have entering the playoffs in 5 years. Quarterback Josh Allen is absolutely elite, and running back James Cook is having another fantastic year, but the rest of the team is not where they need to be to make a run in the postseason. Allen has not had a high-tier receiving option all season, but he has been able to make do. The biggest problem is the Bills defense. Their run defense hasn’t been able to stop anyone all season, and Jags running back Travis Etienne should have no issues getting yards on the ground and in the air. 

There’s also the question of Josh Allen’s health. He has been dealing with a foot injury and has gotten X-rays 2 different times over the last few weeks. He’ll play and look like himself, but just something to keep in mind.

The best part, and quite frankly the only real effective part, of the Bills offense is the run game. Unfortunately for them, the Jags have stopped every single running back this season from having over 75 rushing yards. On the other side, the Jags offense should be able to gouge the Bills rush defense for good yardage, thus opening up passing lanes later. I’ll take the Bills QB and RB over the Jags, but the rest of the Bills team is so much weaker that it takes away from how good they are. Give me the hotter of the two teams to come out with the win.

Remember to only bet what you can afford to lose, and BOL!</td></tr>

Sunday’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> - 49ers +6 -112 (1.12u to win 1u)

I get why this line is 6 points, but I think last week’s game for the 49ers was a worst case scenario for them. Had they looked a little better and lost, this would’ve been closer to 3. I expect Mike Shanahan to have a good game plan and be able to put some points up. Before last week, they had put up 37, 48, and 42 points after their week 14 bye. 

The Eagles offense is still a hot and cold one. The inconsistency they’ve had throughout the season makes me nervous for them, especially as 6 point favorites in a playoff game. Their team total of 25 points feels high to me, even going up against a pretty banged up 49ers defense.

Good Luck!</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: FC Barcelona to win the cup @ 1.61 odds (5u)

Write Up:

I’m hammering Barcelona to lift the cup, mostly because of the rest advantage. Madrid just went through against Atletico on Thursday and their defense is banged up, while Barca played Wednesday and basically got a practice session against Bilbao. They were able to rest their starters early, so they’re coming into this final way fresher. Madrid looked heavy in their semi-final, and I think that fatigue catches up to them <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. I&#x27;m taking the Barca to win the cup option just to be safe against a draw, but I think Barca’s will get it done.

Bayern Munich vs Wolfsburg looks set for goals, making over 4.5 goals a strong <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. Bayern’s attacking depth and high tempo at home usually create multiple chances, while their aggressive style can leave space at the back.

New manager effect at United is still ongoing, I might have backed them too early in the game against Burnley. I watched the game against Burnley though and I can see the glimpses of Fletcher&#x27;s football, which is looking very good. Anyway, <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> is the interim&#x27;s manager 1st game in charge at home and I expect things to kick off lively.

I don&#x27;t have any relevant stats to back up this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> since it is FA Cup but we can somewhat take the home and away form of the Prem in consideration. At home United are 5-3-2 with a 18:13 goal diff while Brighton are 2-4-5 and 18:19. H2H is evenly matched where United are 4-0-6 in their last 10 meetings with Brighton. At home United are 7-0-3 against Brighton. So yea, this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> is more based on how they have played this season and I trust the team to have the new manager boost for his 1st game at home.

Event: NBA | Pelicans @ Magic (3:10 pm EST) | 🏀
  
*Recap: Right idea. Wrong half. Sacred Heart sailed past 32 points and made me look like the idiot that I am. Then, they got entirely shut down in the second stanza, scoring just 28 points en route to a loss. Meanwhile, my two losses are both NCAA first-half unders, so let&#x27;s try to lose a different way <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Back to the NBA for a player prop.*  
  
The Orlando Magic are hurting, and Anthony Black has been asked to step up. Boy, has he. Over his last 10 games, he&#x27;s averaging 20.3 points on 15.7 field goal attempts. He&#x27;s been efficient, making 49% from deep and 46% overall, despite the increased usage. Meanwhile, New Orleans is giving up 24.3 points to the primary ball handler, which puts them in 23rd in the Association. Black&#x27;s 6-foot-7 frame is going to be a problem for New Orleans. The Pelicans are already without their best stopper (Herb Jones), an important perimeter defender (Jose Alvarado), and has Saddiq Bey listed as a game-time-decision. Guards Jordan Poole (6-foot-4) and and Jeremiah Fears (6-foot-3) are not known for their lockdown defenses, and that&#x27;s putting it lightly. I like Black&#x27;s chances to go inside and get fouled or shoot over either of them. New Orleans&#x27; Top 10 pace should afford Black and the Magic extra possessions. Oh, and in the last month of play, opposing guards have gone over assists in 70 percent of their games. It&#x27;s enough to consider sprinkling a little on assists or PA combo. But it tells me that point guards are having their way on the attack. As an aside, this feels like a must-win game for the Magic who are in an absolute battle with the Miami Heat for control of the Southeast Division. The Magic are 2-3 over the last five games, but 12-6 at home. Look to Black to help them get to 13-6. He&#x27;ll get minutes, even with Moe Wagner returning (but on a likely minutes restriction). 

Good luck and Godspeed!</td></tr>

__Event:__ NFL: Bills @ Jaguars 1pm EST

__POTD:__ Dalton Kincaid o40.5 receiving yards (-110), 3.3u to win 3u

__Write Up:__ The Buffalo Bills (12-5) are traveling to Jacksonville to take on the Jacksonville Jaguars (13-4) on Sunday in the Wild Card round of the NFL Playoffs. New Jags head coach Liam Cohen turned this franchise around. Since their Week 8 bye, the Jags are 9-1, winning 8 straight games with a league leading +153 point differential over that span. The next closest team over that run is at +97. Jacksonville has scored 2.83 points per drive over that streak, 4th in the NFL. The key to their success has been phenomenal play by QB Trevor Lawrence. TLaw had his third 4,000 yard passing season in the past 4 seasons, setting career highs for passing TD’s (29), rushing yards (359), &amp; rushing TD’s (nine). TLaw has thrown for 10+ yards on 31.4% of his passing plays since Week 9 (3rd). He’ll now face a Playoff experienced Bills team that made the playoffs 7 straight seasons in a row. The Bills have been the best team in the league at running the football this season. RB James Cook led the league in rushing yards this season averaging 95.4 yards per game &amp; ranked 1st in expected points added (EPA) per rush (0.08). The Buffalo Bills had the most rush attempts this season &amp; ranked 28th in pass rate compared to expectations (-3%). The problem with that strategy in this game is, the Jags have the best run defense in the league. The Jags allowed the fewest rushing yards per game (85.6), ranked 5th in yards per carry allowed (3.94), &amp; 2nd in explosive run rate (2.7%) allowed. They haven’t allowed a RB to run for 75+ yards this season &amp; faced some elite talent in CMC, Jonathon Taylor twice, etc. Opponents passed on the Jags at the 2nd highest rate over expectations (+4.4%). The good news for the Bills is, QB Josh Allen has once again been one of the best QB’s in the league this season.

Josh Allen had another stellar year, setting career highs in completion rate (69.3%, 4th in NFL) &amp; yards per pass attempt (8.0, 5th in NFL). He led Buffalo to have a 46.7% success rate on passing plays, 7th in the NFL. Since the start of 2024, the Bills have the highest EPA per dropback. Against a pass funnel defense that allows the fewest rushes in the league, the Bills are going to let Allen air it out. A huge part of Allen’s efficiency through the air this season has been Tight End Dalton Kincaid. Kincaid ranked #1 out of ALL pass catchers in the league in EPA/target. His 79.6% catch rate was the 4th highest in the league. He wasone of just 4 TE’s with multiple 100+ yard receiving games this season. Among the 29 tight ends with at least 49 targets in 2025, Dalton Kincaid ranked #1 in yards per catch (14.6), average depth of target (9.5 yards), yards per route run (2.79), yards after the catch per reception (6.7), &amp; passer rating when targeted (149.2). He did all of that while playing injured &amp; missing 5 games. Kincaid set a career high in TD passes (5) &amp; receiving yards per game (47.6). The Bills’ offensive success this season has been directory correlated to having Kincaid on the field and producing. The Bills 2025 splits with/without Kincaid:

__Points per game:__

With:  32

Without:  21

__Josh Allen TD/INT ratio:__

With (on field):  19 TD’s - 3 INT’s

Without: 7 TD’s - 6 INT’s

__Allen’s passer rating:__

With (on field): 111.77

Without: 81.9

__Record:__

With:  9-2

Without:  2-3

The Bills coaches understand Kincaid’s importance &amp; reduced his playing time down the stretch this season, to keep him healthy for the playoffs. In his first five games of the season, Kincaid averaged 49.1% of the team’s offensive snaps and the Bills record was 4-1. In those games, he averaged 57.4 yards per game on four receptions with a catch percentage of 83.3%. When Kincaid returned from injury in Week 14, his playing time was decreased to just 30.3% of the team’s offensive snaps with only 2.5 receptions per game &amp; 30.8 receiving yards. Kincaid sat out Week 17, then last week he only played 10 snaps, he still managed to catch 3 passes for 48 yards. Head coach Sean McDermott said after wards: I thought it was important that we got him going a little bit. Not too much to where he was too sore to come back and practice,” McDermott said. “So just some momentum, some wind at his back here.” It was clear they were getting him ready for the playoffs &amp; he’ll have the freshest legs of anyone on the field in this game. Over the prior 2 seasons, Kincaid regularly saw 60-70% snap shares &amp; route shares north of 80%. This season when Kincaid has played +50% of snaps he has had at least 48 yards every game, averaging 5 catches for 74 yards, including a 100 yard game. Now he faces a Jags defense that to Tight Ends this season have allowed the 2nd most targets per game (8.7), 6th most catches (6.1 per game), 61 receiving yards per game (9th most), &amp; 8 TD’s (9th most). Jacksonville deploys zone coverage on 78.6% of their defensive snaps, 5th most in the league. Only running man coverage on just 17.6% of snaps. Kincaid has been the Bills zone buster all season, ranking 2nd best among all pass catches in yards per route run vs. zones (3.91). Josh Allen has targeted Kincaid on a team high 30% of his routes vs. zone coverage. His 93.33% catch rate vs zone is the highest in the league amongst pass catchers with 100+ routes ran vs zone. He’s has 410 receiving yards vs zone compared to Dawson Knox’s 341 yards, &amp; he has ran 70 less routes vs Zone coverage. As for the Jags pass defense they have good metrics, but they also faced the 2nd easiest slate of passing opponents this season. Their defensive line has been below average with a 36.2% pressure rate (19th) &amp; at the bottom of the league with a 4.8% sack rate (30th). The Bills also have had to play from behind a ton this season. In the 1st half of games, the Bills had a -11 point differential compared to a +127 point differential in the 2nd half. The Bills trailed by 10+ points at halftime 5 times this year. The other 6 AFC playoff teams trailed by 10+ points 5 times at halftime combined. Meanwhile the Jags finished the season 4th in 1st half points scored &amp; 3rd in 1st half point differential. Additionally, the Jags revved up the pass towards the end of the season. Since Week 14, Jacksonville ranked 1st in pass rate over expected (+8.6%). The Jags finished the regular season 6th in scoring offense (27.9 points per game). They have scored on 51% of their possessions since Week 9, 2nd best. This should force Allen to have to air it out, you could make the argument that Kincaid is the best receiver that Josh Allen.

I wouldn’t be surprised if this hits in the 1st half.

Winnipeg Jets ML (-125)

The New Jersey Devils have **1.6 goals on average** in their last 10 games. They shoot a lot but are struggling to put it in the net. Their goalies can&#x27;t buy a save and the Devils are on the freefall ever since the Quinn Hughes trade rumors spread which a lot of veterans didn&#x27;t like hearing about especially with them being used as the trade pieces. They even announced <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> that Dougie Hamilton (top 2 defenseman on their team) is now healthy scratched to be traded so the vibes are really not good right now. They are on a 3 game losing streak and things are not going better on the road having lost 4 out of their last 5 away games. They also struggle against the Jets having lost their last 2 games against them (6-1 and 4-0).

Jets aren&#x27;t doing so great but they won their last game so they come with some momentum. What makes me confident with the Jets ML though is that in their last 10 games at home they have scored 3 goals or more 8 times which should be useful against a Devils team that struggles to score even 2 goals right now. Expecting Connor Hellebuyck to be starting for the Jets as he has an 8-1-1 record with a goals against average of 1.89 and a save percentage of .942 in his last 10 games versus the Devils.

Real Madrid are going to want to prove a point after being embarrassed in last season&#x27;s Clasicos and they&#x27;re for sure coming out swinging. They already beat Barcelona 2-1 earlier in the season and I felt the scoreline even flattered Barcelona a bit. Madrid&#x27;s attack is going to run riot - I think Barca&#x27;s ridiculous high line just isn&#x27;t prepared to deal with something as fast and technical, and Joan Garcia can&#x27;t keep bailing them out. They&#x27;ll be 2 goals down before they know it.

Securing a small profit even in case of a draw at these odds is just value I can&#x27;t overlook. The confidence is high after back to back wins and I think now&#x27;s a great moment to fade Barcelona again so I&#x27;m going in with 3 units. If you want to take the BTTS Yes and Over 3.5 goals angle, I don&#x27;t mind those either. BOL and let&#x27;s break this Barcelona curse once and for all ☘️🫡

Last pick: Suns -4.5 over Grizzlies, easy win

Event: Bills @ Jags

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Dawson Knox over 20.5 receiving yards 

Write Up: This one is pretty simple. Firstly, Knox has hit this over in 8 out of the last 10. Second, the Jags don&#x27;t have a good pass defense, so I expect the Bills to be slinging it. Thirdly the Jags have the best run defense in the league, so once again, I expect the Bills to throw more than their average. 




Vegas expects over 50 points in this game, and that means a lot of yards. Knox had a slow start to the season, so his season average is low, which is why I think this line is lower than it should be. He&#x27;s averaging over 30 yards per game in the last 10 games without a lot of variation, so he should be able to continue that in a high scoring high yardage game against a bad pass defense. </td></tr>

**Tennis -** ATP Hong Kong **- Musetti ML vs Bublik** \[1U to win 1U (+100)\]

Time: 2:30AM EST

 

Reasoning:

Like Musetti here - his consistency and movement will make it very hard for bublik to break him down, who has solid groundstrokes and is rally-tolerant for a big server, though he&#x27;s outclassed in movement and consistency. I think the match will go 3 sets and musetti will wear him down. Bublik wants to play shorter points against Musetti but musetti is in good form right now. He&#x27;ll have to go bigger and bigger to win rallies and I think t

I&#x27;d give Musetti about a 60% chance to win here - I got this at +123 but +100 is good value still for 1U

**Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Chelsea -1.5 (-110) ✅️

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s Event:** England FA Cup (Soccer) | West Ham vs QPR (6:30 AM PST)

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** West Ham ML + O 1.5 Goals (+100) 1 unit to win 1 unit

**Write Up:** Chelsea made that a touch sweaty, but eventually came alive in the last 30 minutes and end up winning 5-1. Match went about as expected, with the big names coming on in the 2nd half to help pull away. Fun fact, we&#x27;ve yet to lose a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> play with odds less than +100. Great to be back in the wim column to start the weekend! 

More FA cup action <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> and I&#x27;m targeting another EPL side against a Championship side as West Ham host Queen&#x27;s Park Rangers (QPR). West Ham are firmly in the relegation zone at 18th in the Premier League, and they burned us a few matches ago when they got trounced by Wolves. But to me, this is their chance to right the ship. They need a win badly, in any competition, and this is a prime time to do it. They get a week off after this match, so i expect them to come out with a strong team and take out some frustration on QPR. 

QPR are in the packed middle of the table in the Championship (England&#x27;s 2nd tier), but are only 3 points off from the playoff spots for promotion. They have the top 3 highest scoring games in the Championship, as their games average 3 goals/match. With that, they concede the 2nd most goals in the Championship behind relegation bound Sheffield. Because of that, we&#x27;ve seen some lineup changes for these mid pack championship teams eyeing a promotion spot - they are not prioritizing the FA cup as heavily. I do not expect them to rollover by any means, but I do expect them to lose. 

Not to be dramatic, but if West Ham don&#x27;t grab a win here in front of the home crowd, against a team a division below them - their already bleak season will look pretty dire. This is their chance to right the ship and build some momentum to take to the EPL next weekend. This is obviously a risky play and definitely feel free to sit this out if you&#x27;re weary of West Ham. 

BOL and have a great Sunday!</td></tr>

Write up: First ever 2U play!! Let’s get rocking, BILLS MAFIA - Model has this as the highest confident Edge % and EV % for the day. Will add some personal information in this write-up as well.

• ⁠Model has Bills ML at 55%

• Model projects Bills +1.5 hitting at 59%

• EV better betting 100$ = 14-15$ for this play

• Part of me hates this bet, the other part of me loves this bet - regardless of how hot the Jaguars have been, and how bad the Bills have been this year, Josh Allen’s record in the playoffs vs good teams/QB’s - To give Josh Allen +1.5 in a playoff game, I’m all over that - Bills have the playoff experience, and they have Josh Allen - Allen has thrown for 3.5k + this year and his running game is great (he hasn’t ran much as of late probably because of his small foot injury) - James Cook, almost 2k rushing yards this year, has been on a tear all year - While Jaguars run D is pretty efficient,  I think Cook and the Bills have the edge here on the ground - If the Bills give the ball to Cook, feed him how they should, this game is 100% their’s, let’s just hope Joe Brady does that - Jaguars are HOT, riding a 8 game win streak, with their biggest win being on the road against the Broncos a few weeks back - The Buffalo Bills have the QB edge in this matchup, and I love that - Jaguars are a good team, do not get me wrong, but their schedule was not the best this year and in my opinion, that is concerning - The Bills have gotten a lot of criticism for their defense this year, but the last two games, they have turned it up, only holding the Eagles to 13 points - Josh Allen has been very good in the playoffs - he is efficient and he turns into MVP Josh Allen - Trevor Lawerence on the other hand, does not have the eliteness that Josh has, nor the playoff experience - I am riding with Josh Allen here, give me the Bills +1.5 for our first ever 2U play

<tr><td class='post'>**POTD Record:**  105 – 68 - 11

**Previous:**  **NCAAF – Semifinal 1 - Miami Hurricanes vs Ole Miss** \+3.5 – LOSS,  Semifinal 2 - Indiana ML &amp; Over 38.5 pts – WINNING

**Recaps:**  It’s a wash by ½ point.  Semi 1: Miami was clearly the better team, yet Ole Miss hung in there with a little help from the refs.  As expected, the game came down to the final few plays and could have gone either way.  We lost that bet by the ½ pt hook. 

Semi 2: Although Oregon started with a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> 6 and then fumbled time and again, Indiana was just was the better team by far.  Indiana made few to no mistakes other than a couple of penalties and dominated both sides of the ball.  I think they win it all.

**New Event:**  NFL – Buffalo Bills vs Jacksonvillle Jaguars

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:**  Dalton Kincaid Longest Reception Over 18.5 yards @ 1.80 (Usual 3 units)

Full disclosure:  This prop was recommended by the Betting Pros and Sharp Football and I have incorporated some details from those writeups.  As of earlier <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> this prop can still be found on Ceasars.  The line has moved to 19.5 most everywhere else.  I would still take it at 19.5, but not too juiced and no higher.

When it comes to the NFL wildcard playoffs, I have learned to narrow my choices and look for two types of opportunities for bets.  Overs on QB rushing yards and Tight-End receptions/yards. Normally I lean towards Unders on props but playoffs are a different animal.  Both are situational depending on how I believe the games will play out.  

In the case of QB rushing yards, we see year after year even those QB’s that never run, will do so out of desperation in a loser go-home scenario.  Brady, Manning, even Marino, characterized as statues in the pocket have gotten most of their rushing yard stats during the playoffs. I look for QB’s with a low rushing yard total offered.  In the case of tight-ends, this is where they shine the most and become key receivers in difficult situations.  Gronk, Kelce, Gonzalez, are examples of legacy favorite targets for QB’s in big games.  This year should be no different for both prop types. 

I was looking at the Over on receptions for Kincaid, currently at 3.5 and at plus money which seemed more than fair.  However, when looking at the data there was a lack of consistency as he barely hits this mark in half of his games.  Then I stumbled upon the Betting Pros who have that same prop recommended as a 5 star play with a +27% EV. (I have placed this bet as well)  It seemed as I was still missing something here.  So being OCD, I scoured every bit of data on Kincaid on the internet.  Then, bingo!  I found a more compelling stat driven bet thanks to the folks at Sharp Football.

Worth mentioning as a preamble is that in week 16 Dalton kincaid picked up an injury against the Browns in a game where he had 0 catches on 1 target. Then he missed the following game against the Eagles in week 17 due to the injury.  But came back last week (week 18) against the Jets where he had 3 catches for 48 yards with a long of 26. 

Bulletpoints are in order:

* Dalton Kincaid (DK) has played in 12 games this season and has a catch of at least 18 yards in 11 of them.  (week 16 vs Browns is the exception)
* He also has a 20+ yard reception in 10 of 12 games.
* His long receptions this year per game are: 22 18 20 28 23 23 47 20 20 24 0 26
* Kincaid leads the NFL in tight-ends with the highest average in yards per catch.
* If his projected over 3.5 receptions with a 5 star recommendation comes to fruition, I am confident that at least one will be for over 19 yards.
* There is a case to be made that Jacksonville’s pass defense has not faced many elite QB’s of Josh Allen’s caliber as they have had the 6^(th) easiest schedule this season.
* Jacksonvile is 29^(th) conceding receptions to tight ends.
* Jacksonville has the #1 ranked rush defense in the NFL.  
* The premise for this match is that as much as Buffalo would like to run the ball in Jacksonville, they will most likely be forced to throw the ball more than usual.  
* The Jaguars have only lost 2 home matches this season, against the Rams and Seahawks, perhaps the 2 best teams in the league. 
* Neither the Rams nor Seahawks were able to rush rush for more than 90 yards in Jacksonville.  Buffalo will most likely fail to do so as well and be forced to pass.

Kincaid should get his share of targets and if he has been as dependable as his numbers suggest in every game he has played healthy, then another long catch of over 18 yards is not out of the question.</td></tr>

**Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Bruno Fernandes ATGS (-120) ✅️

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s Event:** UEFA World Cup Quals | Germany vs Slovakia (11:45AM PST)

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Nick Woltemade ATGS (+110) 1 units to win 1.1 units

**Write Up:** Portugal *really* wanted that win as they thrashed Armenia 9-1. Our guy Bruno came through with the cash before halftime, and ended game with a hattrick and an assist. 

Off we head <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> to Germany for a winner take all game in Group A. Winner goes to the world cup, loser heads to the playoff games in March. Germany is in a similar spot <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> as Portugal was yesterday - at home against a side they should beat with World Cup qualification on the line. 

If any of you have followed my picks in the soccer thread, you know how much I like the Lanky German - Nick Woltemade. He&#x27;s a 6&#x27;6&quot; tall old school striker&#x27;s striker who can do it all. He works hard, chases everything, and can score with his head or his feet. He has cemented himself as the top choice for Germany up front and is coming into this match hot, scoring in each of his last two games for Germany and coming off a 2 goal game at Luxembourg on Friday. I also think our lanky German will take charge of penalty duties, given his current form and that their captain Kimmich is still questionable to play with injury. 

2nd place Slovakia will want to spoil Germany&#x27;s fun here, as they handed Germany their only group stage loss in Slovakia back in September. However, this is a different team on the road, with a 1-0-5 record in away matches over the last year. With their only win and clean sheet being against Luxembourg. 

I&#x27;m backing our guy Woltemade to find the back of the net <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, keep up his great form, and secure Germany&#x27;s spot in the World Cup, BOL!</td></tr>

Event CBB: NC State vs VCU 7PM Eastern Time

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **NC State -11.5** (-120 FanDuel)

NC State is having a good start to the Will Wade era. They’ve won and covered the spread by a comfortable margin in their first 3 games - winning by 48, 24, and 46. They haven’t scored less than 94pts yet. 

State is currently ranked #1 offense in the country at a crazy 1.4pts per possession.

Per Bart Torvik, with preseason bias removed, NC State is the 21st team in the country, while VCU is at 101.

Their opponent VCU isn’t looking the best to start the season. They scored only 78pts against 296 ranked Saint Peter’s.

Will Wade and NC State brought in some dawgs from the portal also. 

Notable starters for NCSU that were added in the portal: 
-Darrion Williams, who was the #1 player in the portal according to multiple medias. 
-Tre Holloman, started at MSU last season and was a key player. 
-Van Lubin who started at C for UNC and had a great second half of the season.
-Copeland who was a top player on viral McNeese team last season where Wade coached prior. 

Counting on NC State’s high powered offense, the motivation of their first relevant home game of the season, and Will Wade to cover this line.

Take NCSU -11.5</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>Record: 25-15

Form (old to new): ❌✅ ✅❌✅

Net Units: +19.03

Yesterday&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: England to win and no for BTTS vs Albania. 3u @ 2.10✅

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Netherlands v Lithuania. Netherlands -5 corner line. 3u @ $1.85

Not a great deal on <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, so keep that in mind. 

However, I really like this.

There&#x27;s not a whole lot to say here... The Netherlands should be the dominant team and do all of the attacking at home. There&#x27;s a tiny tiny (and I mean TINY) chance Poland can jump Netherlands here. 

The Netherlands will dominate possession and look to attack frequently in this game... With that in mind, I see them dominating in the corner game. 

On top of that, the Netherlands were pretty shit in their game away to Poland a few days ago, so I expect them not to muck about too much here. 

The Netherlands have a fair few out for this window, and Kluivert has gone back early - but it shouldn&#x27;t matter considering the depth in the squad compared to a side like Lithuania.

Again, not a whole bunch I like <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, but I think they should cover this corner line pretty comfortably.</td></tr>

LAST PICK: Scotland -3.5 @ 2.0 (2U)❌

TODAYS FIXTURES: Northern Ireland v Luxembourg &amp; Germany v Slovakia (both 19:45UK / 14:45pm EST) 

PICKS: Northern Ireland ML + Germany ML @ 1.79 2U

WRITE UP: 


Right guys, heavy focus on these two games in the same group for Monday as we enter the last couple of days of the international break.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> 1 - Northern Ireland to win. NI come into this one off the back of a last minute defeat to Slovakia. However, as mentioned previously - they are a different side at home! Prior to defeat in their last home game against Germany, Northern Ireland hadn’t lost at home for 8 games and rarely concede. Couple that with the fact that the guests have only won 1 of their last 17 games and sit bottom of the group with a record of 0-0-5 having only scored 1 goal in those 5 games. Football is a funny game , but all of the facts point towards and Irish victory in Belfast.


<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> 2 - Germany to win. The Germans come into this one level on points with their guests knowing that a win will see them top the group. Germany haven’t been in vintage form recently and did lose in the reverse fixture in Slovakia. However, at home in a must win game - there are few countries in world football who prove time and time again they get the job done. Can see this being scrappy but again a 2-0 / 2–1 home win seems the likely outcome.

As always nothing is guaranteed in sport but the facts and history point towards this being  routine win… whether that is true or not only time will tell.

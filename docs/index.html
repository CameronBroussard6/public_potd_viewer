<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s bet have Villa at home coming up again a Forrest side in bad form. The sports books use algorithms to make their odds which explains why Villa are being offered at such a great price. They have consistently been out performing their Xg all the year, which I don’t believe is due to luck at all. Taking on bet365 in hopes of early payout. Watkins is in great form so can always add props with him if you after better returns.

Event: Scottish Premiership - Celtic vs Rangers - 12.30 GMT+0

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Rangers DNB @ 2.75 - 1u

Write Up: Despite getting their first couple wins under Nancy, Celtic still look far from convincing. They are far too open and weak on set pieces, giving their opponents far too many chances to score. That isn&#x27;t to mention the fact that the atmosphere around the club is poor with fans unhappy at the board, managerial choice and underperforming players. It&#x27;s coming to a bit of a boiling point. While Rangers are on the upswing since sacking Russell Martin. There is much more optimism that they&#x27;re on the right path forward than at Celtic and an early goal for Rangers (Celtic have conceded 5 goals during the opening 15 in Nancy&#x27;s 7 in charge) could well and truly set the tone for a bad night for The Bhoys and possibly spend the end for Nancy&#x27;s time in charge. This game is being priced as if this is a typical Celtic vs Rangers. It&#x27;s not and bettors should look to take advantage.

Additional Thoughts: I wasn&#x27;t going to start doing this yet but I&#x27;ve decided to say fuck it, why wait? I&#x27;ve gotten my last few bets correct and I&#x27;m feeling in form. And this bet I feel could be particularly good value I&#x27;m afraid to say as someone who does not have any appreciation for Rangers Football Club.</td></tr>

Wolves are scoring recently despite their awful record. Even vs top 6 teams in the league like Arsenal, Liverpool and Man Utd

They even beat West Ham 3-2 earlier this season at home in the EFL cup so a surprise win for Wolves here wouldn&#x27;t even be a huge shock to me 

Arsenal are amazing right now and are beyond in-form. With an incredible, balanced midfield, structured backline and depth in the squad they are currently the team to beat

Bournemouth their last win dates back to october 26th which does not give them the confidence to expect a win <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>

Event: Serie A, Como - Udinese  

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Oumar Solet o0.5 shots, 5U @1.90

Write up: The only reason this odd is this high is because he&#x27;s a defender. He&#x27;s a pretty big guy (192cm), so he rushes up the field whenever there&#x27;s a corner or freekick, to go for a header. But he also tries a long shot pretty frequently. We only need one shot, it doesn&#x27;t even have to hit the target. 
In his last 4 games he made 1-4-1-2 shots, and 2 games ago he even scored. This will raise his self esteem to try more shots. Should be an easy win.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Southside Flyers (W) -6.5 (1.87 on Bet365, 5 units for 4.35 units) ✅ game ended Southside 94 - Geelong 52

Write-Up: Flyers (6-8) take on the Venom (3-12) at home <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, and come into this in good form. The last game they played they scored 113 points, the season highest for the WNBL. Granted, that was against the Sydney Uni Flames (4-12), but it shows they’re clicking as a team. Venom on the other hand have lost 8 games in a row, with their last victory being on 14 Nov against our Southside (game ended Venom 66 - Flyers 54). 

These two teams have met once between 14 Nov and <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, on 16 Dec with the game ending Flyers 86 - Venom 58. This displays the rising form of the Flyers, and I think they win tonight to get 4th rank of the WNBL against the UC Capitals (who will be playing against Perth Lynx tomorrow afternoon, who are just completely dominating with the addition of Han Xu.)</td></tr>

Last POTD: **Toulouse v Lens: Lens Draw No Bet @1.95** ✅

Todays <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: **Aston Villa v Forest: Villa DC &amp; o8.5 corners @1.85**

A fast paced Premier League matchup awaits as Aston Villa welcome Nottingham Forest in a game that profiles extremely well for pressure football and sustained attacking phases.

Villa’s recent form has been excellent, especially at home, where they control territory, push their fullbacks high and spend long spells in the attacking third. That style consistently drives corner numbers. Even in matches where Villa do not score early, they continue to apply pressure through wide overloads, cutbacks and recycled possession, forcing defenders into blocks and clearances rather than clean exits. This repeated pressure is exactly the type of game state that produces steady corners across both halves.

Forest also play a key role in supporting the corner line. While they are less efficient going forward, they actually generate a healthy volume of shots and attacking moves, particularly in transition. Those attacks often end in deflections, saves or blocked efforts rather than clean finishes, which adds to their own corner output. Defensively, Forest tend to concede territory and invite pressure, especially against top half sides, leading to sustained waves of opposition attacks and corner concessions.

With Villa expected to dominate possession and Forest still capable of contributing corners of their own, the over 8.5 line is well supported by both teams tendencies. The double chance on Villa adds protection against match variance while aligning with their strong form and control at home, making this a well balanced bet builder built on game flow rather than a single outcome.

Best of luck.</td></tr>

Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Washington Wizards -3.5 (-108) 5 Units

Recap: Bang! As predicted, Nets shoot 20% from three and the Wizards cruise to a 20pt win. No sweat.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: Ivica Zubac Under 9.5 Rebounds (-105) 1 Unit

1/3/2026 7:30pm PST / NBA / Boston Celtics @ Los Angeles Clippers

Narrative: Dec. 20, 15 days ago, Zubac was diagnosed with a Grade 2 ankle sprain and expected to be out 4-6 weeks. In <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>’s NBA, rarely do you see early returns from injury which makes this odd… Especially for a 7 footer pushing 250lb. I’m glad he’s healthy, as I am a big fan of his, and he is a rebounding machine, but I’m banking on the fact here that he’s not cracking the 20min mark in this game and for that reason alone will stay under. Clippers are on a 7 game win streak with Zubac out, after a rough start to the season, and shouldn’t be motivated to rush him back. Along with that, BOS is not a big team, their starting center averages 24min a night, also influencing less minutes needed of Zubac as they opt for a smaller line up. Zubac on the season is averaging 32min played and 11.1reb, which equates to 0.346 rebounds per minute. I don’t see Zubac surpassing 25min played here, which 25min would yield 8.67reb, which keeps us under the 9.5. I expect sub 20min played here for Zubac which is why I like this wager. Tempted to hammer this, but keeping it at one unit in case for whatever reason he plays his 32min.</td></tr>

Has been a very good assister as of late but now finds himself coming from the bench. First game all season starting from the bench last game and only managed 22 min and 3 assists. Coming from the bench again tonight, due to Illawarra opting for the double big lineup. Is also under in L5/6 and was averaging 30+ min during that period. All in all, a minutes play and lack of volume to have 7 assists.

Event: 🏈 Panthers v Buccaneers 4:30pm EST

Playoff hopes on the line for both teams in a game that should be tightly contested. The Panthers are back and forth with wins and losses, and their last win was against the Bucs on 12/21 (23-20). 

Meanwhile, the Bucs have lost 4 straight and only won one game since October (Cardinals on 11/30). Baker Mayfield is somewhat banged up dealing with shoulder and knee injuries. He’s also thrown at least one interception in 6 of his last 7 games. 

In a tight divisional matchup, I’ll lean toward Carolina keeping this close.</td></tr>

Event: CBB | UNC Asheville @ Charleston Southern (2 pm EST) | 🏀

*Recap: What a sweaty <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> debut! Giannis clears the line on a walk-off lob dunk with four seconds to go. Milwaukee trailed by as many as 16, but the Greek Freak made the most of his 29 minutes -- oh, and how about 8-for-8 from the charity stripe!*

If you don&#x27;t like low mid-major college basketball, you don&#x27;t like degenerate sports betting! UNC Asheville has won nine straight against Charleston Southern. During that stretch, UNCA&#x27;s winning margin is 12.2 points per game. In fact, the last Chuck South win was a 1-point upset in the first round of the Big South Conference tournament in 2022. So why am I taking a team that hasn&#x27;t won on the road this season (0-5) against a team that hasn&#x27;t lost at home (3-0)? Easy. Strength of schedule. Throw out the records. UNCA&#x27;s Pomeroy strength of schedule is 151. CSU&#x27;s is 338. The Bulldogs (6-9) also have Big South Preseason Player of the Year in fifth-year senior Toyaz Solomon, and were picked to finish second in the league. When it comes to these one-bid leagues, the conference slate is everything. That&#x27;s why I raised an eyebrow when I saw CSU (10-6) needed a 55-point second half to erase a 12-point halftime deficit against a 2-14 Gardner-Webb squad that was picked to finish below them. For context, Pomeroy has just six teams ranked lower than Gardner-Webb in all of Division 1. *That&#x27;s* Charleston Southern&#x27;s lead-in to UNCA?

Fun fact: CSU&#x27;s Buccaneer Fieldhouse is one of the smallest arenas in Division I with an 881 capacity, but students don&#x27;t return to classes until January 12. I&#x27;m not saying it won&#x27;t still feel like playing in a raucous bandbox, and it *is* a unique atmosphere. But the Bulldogs are battle-tested, and they have the better coach. Eighth-year coach Mike Morrell comes from the Shaka Smart tree, and CSU&#x27;s Saah Nimley is navigating his second year at the helm after going 10-22 last season.

The danger for UNCA will be the deep ball. CSU ranks second in the NCAA with 13.2 made threes per game. Their style is run and gun. But if the Bulldogs - and Solomon - can avoid foul trouble, dictate the pace, and limit 3s, I&#x27;ll gladly take 5.5 points in a matchup that has been entirely one-sided in recent years.

Good luck and godspeed!</td></tr>

Canadiens are beasts on the road this season with a 12-3-5 record. Blues meanwhile will play a 2nd game in less than 24 hours and Binnington will start in net where he&#x27;s been atrocious lately with 4 losses in a row and allowing 18 goals in those last 4 games. Jacob Fowler will probably start for the Canadiens and will look to bounce back after his close loss against Tampa. Last time he lost a game, he answered right back with a shutout in the next one so I expect him to be solid in net for this game.

**Writeup:**
Panthers go to Tampa for the deciding spot on who gets in (well Falcons could screw over the Bucs). Tampa has been looking disastrous lately and panthers, well they&#x27;ve been the panthers. The Bucs are favored and I don&#x27;t understand why, they&#x27;ve lost the last 4, with all the losses being to mid to bad tiered teams. I understand its a divisional match up for basically a playoff spot but I don&#x27;t think Irving will have his time to shine here, as I feel panthers will easily cover the spread, and likely take the lead forcing more passing

Irving has been doing good since he came back in late november from injury but not putting up amazing numbers akin to other rbs. He is only averaging 2 receptions with 14.3 receiving yards in his last 5 games (since he came back from injury), and he&#x27;s been averaging 15.2 carries for 53.2 yards.  Bucky didnt get a single target in the last game against them. While only being a single yards off twice (against Cardinals and New Orleans), he hasn&#x27;t hit this once in his last 5 games. TB also has Rachaad white who gets limited carries yet seems to get more consistent targets compared to Irving

Another thing to think about Panthers give up a low number of yardage to RB, being the 9th best in the league in that area

Writeup: Going to try luck at football again. Hope it works out <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> :)

For the 1st Prop: Neco Williams has had a shot in each of his last five Premier League appearances, taking his overall tally to 20 for the season. Williams played as a wingback in the most recent head-to-head meeting between these sides &amp; had three shots in that game, with Forest having 19 overall. Even if Williams lines up as a conventional fullback here, his shot numbers from right back and left back have been strong, as displayed by his average of 1.29 shots per 90 in the Premier League. 

For the 2nd Prop: Mateus Fernandes has had 11 shots across his 16 Premier League starts (0.74 per 90) with this tally returning two goals. Fernandes is the most likely to get forward out of West Ham’s midfield trio, and should have more chances than usual to get a shot away here against a Wolves side that have conceded 23 (2.55 per game). 

Going a little greedy here &amp; taking the parlay for these 2 bets :)

Hope we continue our wins &amp; BoL

As good as the offense of the 49ers has been, their defense, specifically the pass rush, has been equally as bad. Caleb hit 330 yards and Rivers hit 277 yards in their last 2 games. Even Cam Ward, who only threw for 170, was able to score 24 points against this team.

**Game: Bournemouth VS Arsenal**

**---**

**Gonna keep this one shorter**

**Bournemouth haven&#x27;t won a single game in 10**.

Arsenal are coming into this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> as the only big six side to play, and after City dropped points. Considering they beat third-placed Aston Villa in a dominant 4-1 fashion on the weekend we ride the good form into this game. I&#x27;ve held off a bit on overloading Arsenal selections but I see the front line clicking a lot better with Oodegard slowly sliding back into form again. Zubimendi allows Odegard to be more free-flowing attacking-wise, and if it&#x27;s not working a slight reverse.

Usually Arsenal are bit more pragmatic away from home but that was down to the injuries to Saliba and Gabriel, when you want to dominate possession and put pressure on an opponent away from home those 2 are equally as important as any forward as they collect and redistribute to continue play.

Arsenal have not hit this line for 3 games straight and now with an away fixture against one of the worst teams in the league in form - I see them going for another goal drive to seperate themselves from City even more

After finishing 14th last year in their regular midtable languishing season, they&#x27;ve made significant strides, collecting 10 wins, three draws and just four defeats from 17 matches. Their recent form has been outstanding, with **five consecutive league victories** over Sevilla, Celta Vigo, Rayo Vallecano, Getafe and Athletic Bilbao (all very respectable sides). Perhaps even more impressive are their **home performances** as Espanyol have taken **19 points from the possible 27** at their ground.

Now take into consideration this is a Catalan derby and Espanyol REALLY don&#x27;t like Barcelona. They&#x27;re always ready to turn up and despite the fact their *recent H2H has been disappointing,* they **don&#x27;t usually get blown out by the paper favourites**, notching up a respectable amount of draws. While it’s easy to see Barcelona as the favourite based on table position and firepower, there’s value in backing Espanyol to avoid a heavier defeat. First off, Espanyol enter this match with confidence and momentum. As I said, they’ve won **five LaLiga matches in a row**, a run that highlights how well Manolo Gonzalez’s side are playing, especially considering none of the teams they beat in that stretch are pushovers. At home, Espanyol’s record looks even stronger. They’ve taken points in **five of their last six matches at RCDE Stadium** and kept multiple clean sheets there this season. That defensive resilience matters when taking an Asian Handicap, where even a narrow defeat still yields a winning bet and I think that&#x27;s a smart play to take <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. **Espanyol are good at grinding out results** when needed, so that also gives me confidence heading into this.

Meanwhile, Barcelona’s away form isn’t as bulletproof as the headlines suggest. Though they’re top of LaLiga and score plenty of goals, their away matches often involve **multiple goals conceded,** with **Barcelona averaging nearly 2 goals conceded per away game** this season thanks to their **ridiculously high, dysfunctional defensive line.** This goal conceded number is far higher than the elite visitors normally allow and it&#x27;s why I truly believe Espanyol can stay in the game longer than the odds imply.

Finally, the rivalry cannot be underestimated. Espanyol historically rise to big occasions in front of their diehard fans, and with the +1.0, +1.5 line, I&#x27;m essentially backing them to stay competitive even if Barcelona edge it. Besides (and that&#x27;s a small consideration that hasn&#x27;t really influenced my decision behind this bet by a great deal, but still made me even more sure of it), this is **the first LaLiga match after the holidays** and players like **Lamine Yamal** are for sure going to be feeling the effects of all the partying. On the other side, the Espanyol players probably felt like they could have an edge if they just stayed disciplined during the holidays - I&#x27;m sure the management would&#x27;ve made that known. The underdog is always going to try to take such things into consideration to level the playing field in one way, because let&#x27;s face it, technique wise, they&#x27;re not touching the Blaugrana.

I also like the BTTS Yes angle, as well as an Under 2.5 goals line *(feeling like Espanyol are going to keep Barcelona relatively quiet),* but we&#x27;re just going to focus on the match result. All in all, fading Barcelona when I really need a sure win perhaps sounds counterintuitive, but if I win, I want to do it in style (and I do believe in the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> I&#x27;ve made, that goes without saying). We&#x27;ve waited far too long for my win, just to achieve it by betting on some heavyweights to score more than 0.5 goals and have more than 4 corners against a relegation threatened side or something. BOL whether you tail or fade, let&#x27;s enjoy this heated derby, which is for sure going to be even crazier now that I&#x27;ve placed a bet on it ☘️🫡</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: SGP 2 Leg - Emeka Egbuka 15+ Rec Yards, Rachaad White 5+ Rush Yards (-130 at FanDuel)** 

**Write Up:** 

**Emeka Egbuka:** Emeka Egbuka has had quite a downfall in the middle of the season, but with the Buccaneers playoffs hopes dying, Baker Mayfield will have to air the ball out a little more than usual against a sufficient Panthers team. In Week 16 against the Panthers, Egbuka reached 40 receiving yards despite having only 1 reception. He has reached 15+ receiving yards in every game this season despite his downfall. 

**Rachaad White:** Ever Since Bucky Irving has taken over for RB, Rachaad has been making more use of his carries, averaging 8.46 yard per carry. White has also hit this mark in every game this season, even after his usage declined. In Week 16 against the Panthers, Rachaad White rushed for 45 yards, with a long rush of 39 yards. The Panthers&#x27; defense this season allows 4.48 yards per carry to opposing RB&#x27;s this season. With Rachaad now averaging 4.2 carries per game, I have no doubt he will reach this mark.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: **Rachaad White o11.5 Rushing Yards -110 5u (Bet365)**

Rachaad White is over this line 14/16 on the year. He is the Bucs backup RB, and has played roughly 50% of the snaps all season. In the Bucs last game vs the Panthers, they ran the ball 33 times. Despite the loss, coach Todd Bowles defended the Bucs’ run-heavy game plan against Carolina, saying they beat the Panthers last year with 41 and 38 rushes. “We did everything we wanted to do.” Bucs OC Josh Grizzard says that &quot;Rachaad White has been “even keel” and has taken the opportunities he’s been given very well.” He says that his “ability to blitz pickup makes him a true three-down back. “ I expect the Bucs to run the ball at least 25+ times tomorrow, and if so Rachaad should get at least 3+ carries. In 6/16 games he has a carry of 12+ yards, and in 14/16 he has a carry of 7+ yards. This bet very well could cash on 1-2 rushes, but I do expect the Bucs to run the ball a ton tomorrow and that gives plenty of carry attempts for Rachaad White. BOL</td></tr>

Darts, 2026 World Championship 🎯

Last POTD: Gian van Veen -1.5 sets vs Gary Anderson @ 1.90 ✅

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Luke Littler vs Gian van Veen under 37.5 180s @ 1.81

This one takes a bit longer to write. First of all, the under 37.5 bet means everything from 37 and below is considered a win for this bet. 38 and above means a loss. 

To me, the total of the 180s on here feels off. If we compare it to yesterday&#x27;s matches; Littler’s match had 14 180s while playing 7 sets. Van Veen&#x27;s match had 25 180s while playing 9 sets. Due to this 37 180s at most already feels quite high. Keep in mind it’s first to 7 sets to win, compared to first to 6 sets yesterday.

If we compare it with the finals of the previous years, we see:

2025: 10 sets, 25 180s (Littler vs van Gerwen)

2024: 11 sets, 36 180s (Littler vs Humphries)

2023: 11 sets, 37 180s (Smith vs van Gerwen)

2022: 12 sets, 41 180s (Smith vs Wright)

2021: 10 sets, 23 180s (Anderson vs Price, covid year)

I can keep it going but in 2020 it didn’t hit either. 

We can conclude that this bet only went over the total of 37.5 once in the past years. With the recent stats of the semi-finals and the previous finals, I’m confident in taking the under 37.5 180s @ 1.81

Record: 13-12
Net Units: +0.22 Units ✅

Explanation: For starters, The Buccaneers are at home. You’ll always take that whenever you can get it. 

Panthers have been hot yes, but Carolina’s offense has been one of the league’s least efficient at turning plays into points. By 2025 efficiency metrics, Carolina sits near the bottom in EPA per play (about -0.05). I argue that matters in a divisional game where the spread is tight and you’re basically asking who can produce two or three scoring drives without self harming themselves.

If Baker Mayfield can stay protected in the pocket, he’s dangerous. And we already know he’s dangerous on the run. He’s not Lamar, but he’s so hard to knock down.</td></tr>

Alright, you either loved or hated my last write up. I’m a storyteller with my POTDs and it will stay like that. I find entertainment in writing these and love to throw some amusement towards y’all.

The <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> is Arkansas to win outright against the Volunteers. Oh man, I love me some John Calipari. He puts his players in the right position to succeed and stand out for the NBA scouts. And I’m sure his players are fired up after he stood up against the weird NCAA/NBA transfer situation going on. These are the types of games John has to win to keep his recruiting alive, I believe in him fully. 

Arkansas comes into this with a 8-0 record at home this season with two wins against ranked opponents (Texas Tech and Louisville). They have also played stiff competition all year with quality losses to Duke, Houston and Michigan State. They will be more prepared and mentally tougher than Tennessee in this matchup. I’ve been watching a lot of Arkansas basketball and they have two absolute studs on their team. Brazile and Acuff Jr have been a deadly duo heading into conference play and the leadership they provide will only intensify as the season progresses. Not much stats on this one as these two teams matchup pretty evenly. I just believe Arkansas is the better coached and more mature team coming into this coin flip game. And I always side with the home momentum in these types of matchups. BOL</td></tr>

Write up: first career 5unit bomb. JSN has hit this prop in 13/16 and expect him to show up on the big stage as Seahawks look to grab the 1 seed and bye. 49ers defense has huge holes in the secondary - they’ve won some shootouts lately but since the bye they’ve given up 24 to the titans, 27 to the colts and 38 to the bears. JSN has an insane 44% of the teams receiving yards and put up 138 against the niners last time they played. Weather is ok, some rain but not much wind and mid 50s. 

Last but not least, 49ers CB Deommodore Lenoir was asked about JSN this week and said “I hope he’s ready, man to man coverage, me and him. That’s what I want.” This is the same corner who earlier this year said on a livestream: 

“Njigba, he be crying all day. That’s all he do is cry … crybaby … I’m not worried about JSN.”

Football - Saudi Professional League  
Al Ittihad vs Al Taawon BTTS &amp; Over 2.5 @2.11

I&#x27;m going for a riskier <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> but I think there is some serious value here.   
So first of all their last H2H was 2-1 but that was February 2025 so take it with a grain of salt.  
Recent form in the last 5 games in terms of goal difference for Al Ittihad is 17-1 and 11-3 for Al Taawon respectively and this is where the value comes in. Al Ittihad&#x27;s numbers are pumped by 2 friendly games versus bad teams. They did play a 1-0 vs Nasaf Qarshi but that was an AFC Champion&#x27;s League game and they shot 19 times while Nasaf shot 16 times so there was plenty of attacking even though the shots were not converted.  
Al Taawoun achieved these defensive numbers vs mostly mid/lower table teams but they did score vs Qadsiah and NEOM who are both good teams and they are on a pretty good run. If we take a look at their whole season in the Saudi League, Al Ittihad have 22-16 goal difference while Al Taawoun have 27-13 in 11 games. This paints a completely different picture.

I think the odds overvalue the defensive aspect of the teams&#x27; recent games, especially for Al Ittihad. They are good defensively but I expect both teams to push and score goals. Al Ittihad want to climb back up the table where they feel they belong and I expect them to score first but Al Taawon is fighting to keep their 3rd place. I think both teams&#x27; offensive power can overwhelm the defenses.

This is a higher risk <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> anyway, so take that into account.

Keep in my mind I&#x27;m a random nobody from reddit, so tail with caution. BOL</td></tr>

EPL is back <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> and we&#x27;ve got the game of the week here as 20th (last) place Wolves host 18th place West Ham. Let&#x27;s be honest and get out there that both of these teams stink. Wolves are historically bad, as they may be looking at the fewest points ever by an EPL team. West Ham have been spotty, but I think they are a better team than their record states and have shown signs of life. 

Bowen is the best attacking player for West Ham, the game goes through him. He has 6 of the club&#x27;s 20 goals this season (30%) and has been in great form lately, scoring in 3 of his last 5 matches. He also has 8 SOTs in his last 6 matches, only failing to land an SOT in one of these games against Man City. I love the odds we&#x27;re getting for Bowen here. 

Lets talk about Wolves. They are winless this season, going 0-3-16 so far. They lost at home to Burnley (19th place team), at home to Forest (17th place team) and at home to Leeds (16th place team) just to name a few notable results. They are on track to earn 6 total points this season at the halfway point, which would be firmly the worst EPL season ever, with the current honor of that award is held by Derby County with 11 points. Their stats back up their record, attacking wise they have the fewest SOTs (53) fewest goals scored (10 - the 2nd fewest is 18), fewest shots, fewest goals/shot, we could go on. Defensively, they&#x27;ve conceded the 2nd most goals (36) and 3rd most SOTs (90).

West Ham are not a great team and do not have the best defensive record themselves, but they really need a win here to start to work out of the relegation zone. This is a team they need to beat, and I suspect Bowen will take it on himself to make that happen. This <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> is more about fading the Wolves than anything, but I do think West Ham are a much better team.

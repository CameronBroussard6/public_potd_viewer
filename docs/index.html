**Match:** Iatcenko vs Garland

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Iatcenko ML @ 2,14



*First things first. There have been some comments under my last pick that I didn&#x27;t post Sakkari <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> which I answered to, but can only be seen from my profile. Then I figured it&#x27;s the same with Sakkari <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> itself. I&#x27;ll post couple of links (images) from my profile to prove I did send it. Think it&#x27;s the issue with this profile being new. I checked this sub for a while, but decided to post from New Year and made a new profile for that. Hope this and all the following picks get published on time.*

Odds opened at evens for Iatcenko and are going up. The reason I guess is her left quadriceps/thigh was heavily taped in yesterday match against Aiava. She asked for a MTO at 6-7 2-1 for leg problems, but it didn&#x27;t seem to bother her too much later as she went on to turn the match around and win 6-7 6-3 6-3. It was her R1 match after two impressive wins in Q against Wei and Shibahara. She is a young Russian with a complete game who had a breakthrough 2025. and will try to establish herself on Tour in 2026. I really like her in a matchup against Garland who is one of my favorite fades in WTA. Classic brainless ballbasher who reaches highest highs and lowest lows in same match. Iatcenko has a pretty consistent gamestyle, placing heavy balls deep into court, moving opponents and will make Garland hit on the run. It&#x27;s a gamble since Iatcenko condition is not fully known, but given I consider her a favorite here I just can&#x27;t miss her at these odds. H2H is 1-0 for Garland, 6-2 6-1 in 2024., but a lot changed since.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Man City Over 2.5 Team Corners First half @ 1.66**

**Game: Man City VS Brighton - 2:30 PM EST**

City are going to look to try and shut this game down as early as they can after back-to-back dropped points in a title race, they need to find a way to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> up the pace. They conceded a last-minute equalizer on the weekend and have now lost 2 of their starting CBs which mean the best way they&#x27;re going to keep the ball out of the net is by keeping it in Brighton&#x27;s half. They did this in the Chelsea game and ended the first half with 5, and I&#x27;m expecting a similar start here.

Write up: A Mid-Major shootout in coming - Model has this as the highest confident Edge % and EV % for the day. Will add some personal information in this write-up as well.

• ⁠Model has this game going 185+ total points

• Model projects that both team totals go above the over, and a potential for overtime

• EV better betting 100$ = 11-12$ for this play

• This game is going to be GREAT - if you are a basketball fan, and don&#x27;t keep up with mid-majors often, this is a must see game - Both teams are very athletic and both teams love to move at fast pace, especially SLU - VCU is averaging around 80 some PPG, while SLU is averaging around 90 PPG - However SLU does indeed have a good defense, but VCU at home, is VCU at home, they should come out firing - SLU overs have been a hit all season, with VCU overs are hitting at 80%+ - I expect Djokovic to slow down just a bit tomorrow due to Avila on the other side, which I actually think that helps the over because it should lead to more shots from outside the arc - Hill for VCU has been on a tear and I expect him to keep that up tomorrow - Do not feel like I need to talk much about SLU&#x27;s offense, boy have they been on FIRE all year - ranking top 5 in the NCAA in PPG - Two of the A10&#x27;s best battling it out for bragging rights - One of these two teams will get an automatic bid to the tournament, the other will have to perform really well in the A10 tournament - They know this, they know how important this matchup is - I expect a shootout here, so give me the Over 169.5 for a unit.

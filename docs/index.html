Bet is pending…

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: 🏀 Tennessee -6.5 (-110).

Game starts at 7pm EST. Bet 2.5U

Writeup: Going back to college hoops for this one, and we’re taking the Tennessee Volunteers to cover the spread against Syracuse. Tennessee is currently 7-1 and the #13 team in the nation. They recently finished 2-1 in the Players Era tournament with a very impressive win over #3 Houston. Their senior guard Ja’Kobi Gillespie leads the Volunteers with 18.5 PPG along with star freshman Nate Ament having 18 PPG. With their offense averaging 86 PPG, it’s even more impressive that their defense is even better than their offense, conceding only 65.5 PPG.

On the other side, we have the Syracuse Orange at 4-3 this season, and recently lost all of their games in the Players Era tourney. Their top scorer Donnie Freeman is out for this game due to injury for an offense that was already inconsistent. They have also struggled keeping up pace of play against better opponents, as the Players Era tournament clearly showed. 

Both teams are playing with a chip on their shoulder, but the better team should come out on top and do so in a decisive manner with a least a 7 point victory. 

Remember to only bet what you can afford to lose, and BOL!</td></tr>

**Plays will always be shared as 1 unit for fair record purposes**

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Sonmez vs Jimenez Kasintseva - Sonmez ML @ 1.57**

A lot of money is going into Sonmez with these odds opening at a higher price, but it&#x27;s still worth taking her to win. She&#x27;s a really nice player who had a fantastic 2024 season before dropping her form a bit in 2025. Kasintseva is a decent opponent but still needs to improve a lot of things in her game, and Sonmez has the advantage on this surface. If we look at these players&#x27; careers, we can see that most of the tournament success has come on hard courts for Sonmez, while Kasintseva won the majority of her titles on clay. Sonmez also had a great upset win against Eva Lys recently at the Billie Jean King Cup on this surface (Indoor Hard).

I usually don&#x27;t like to go with handicaps to increase the odds, and the majority of my sports betting plays are focused on extracting value from the ML in tennis.

Good luck! I&#x27;ll be posting daily when I spot good looks and especially at the start of the next tennis season!</td></tr>

**Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Enzo Fernandez 1+ SOT (+140) ✅️

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s Event:** English Premier League | Fulham vs. Man City (11:30AM PST)

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Harry Wilson 1+ SOT (+105) 1 unit to win 1.65 units

**Write Up:** Enzo comes through for us in the 31st minute! Our guy cashed us for the 4th time, all at plus money! Palmer did not start, as expected, and Enzo slotted into the #10 role which was perfect for our play. Gotta love a weekend sweep! 

Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t post my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> for yesterday (Santi Castro 2+ SOT), as I was waiting for Bologna lineups and didn&#x27;t catch them until 30 minutes before kick off. So we are back to mid-week EPL action after a day off as Fulham host Man City. Fulham play really tough at home, going 4-1-1, having only dropped points to Arsenal and Man U. If City want to make a title run again this year, these away matches against mid-table teams are must win games. I expect a close match here, but really can&#x27;t read the goals.

As I was finishing my research here, I actually changed to a different <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> than my initial <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> of a City player. City seems a bit tired, they are struggling to rotate players for mid-week matches, and are conceding goals/possession more than typical - especially mid-week. 

Harry Wilson should get another start at right winger here, after a goal on two shots against Tottenham over the weekend. If you watched that match, you saw why I&#x27;m on Wilson - he&#x27;s a guy who can shoot from anywhere with his left foot. Seriously, go watch his goal if you haven&#x27;t seen it, I know the keeper was out of position, but it doesn&#x27;t make the finish any less impressive. Wilson has only had 3 SOTs in his last 5 matches, but he&#x27;s taken an average of 3 shots per match. This includes 4 against Arsenal at home and, honestly, it was unlucky that none of those hit the target. He also had 2 SOTs in this fixture at the end of last season in May (against a fairly similar City team that I expect to see tomorrow). Wilson also scored 3 goals for Wales during the international break 2 weeks back. The man is in form and I like him to take a few shots <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> and land at least one on target. 

BOL and have a great Tuesday!</td></tr>

Tuesday’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> - Chicago Blackhawks +1.5 puck line -108 vs Vegas Golden Knights (1.08u to win 1u)

Vegas does not deserve to be this heavy of a favorite. I like the Blackhawks ML also, but the odds are too high for this thread. The Knights are 6-4-4 at home this season and it seems as though Carter Hart will be making his first start of the season after serving his suspension. 

Chicago got a big win over Anaheim on Sunday and they have a respectable team for the first time in a while. Their season goal differential is actually better than the Knights. Simply put, these teams aren’t that far off from each other, but the betting lines make this seem like a long shot.</td></tr>

I&#x27;m thrilled to see midweek Premier League games again; I truly missed that sense of pressure on a random Tuesday or Wednesday. Bournemouth started the season out so so well, but they&#x27;ve entered a 4-game slump and will look to get back on track tomorrow. Last home game they got 10 SOT and 9 corners (and drew), expecting less this round but considering they need a win even more… let&#x27;s back it.

Premier league

West ham Vs Liverpool 

Both teams to score and over 2.5 goals

(1.83) 3 units ✖️

Just a very disappointing West ham performance, 9 goals in their last 3 games but never really looked like scoring here, Paquetta with the most ridiculous red card I&#x27;ve ever seen just killing any chance of them scoring late on as we fall a goal short with Liverpool winning 2-0

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>:
 
Premier League 

Newcastle United Vs Tottenham Hotspur 

Newcastle win and over 1.5 goals 

(1.90) 3 units

Two teams in completely contrasting forms here. Newcastle also have an exceptional home form with *&quot;6 home wins in a row, scoring at least 2 goals in all those wins** only losing at home narrowly to Arsenal before that. Not only just a great home form at the moment but long term it&#x27;s been a very hard place to go for the past few years for teams.

This is also the middle of the very congested schedule for both sides, this is Tottenhams 4th game in 9 days, Newcastles 4th game in days 10 so a crucial extra recovery day for Newcastle also an edge for them.

Defensively Tottenham have been awful the past few weeks, **they&#x27;ve conceded a ridiculous 13 goals in their last 4 games**
Vicario in goal in particular has really struggled but the whole defence as a unit has been very unorganized.


Newcastle are without Pope in goal, however Ramsdale is a more than suitable replacement, pipe wasn&#x27;t playing particularly well anyway, other than that they have no significant injury concerns, Tottenham have definitely been missing Madison in particular in midfield, and Solanke up top also.

I think Newcastle have just far too much for Tottenham here, in particular they are just a much better midfield and they should win the key battles there and Voltemade and Barnes are both in excellent form in attack.

**Last:** (CBB) Florida -6.5 (1u) - L

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** No. 13 Tennessee (-6.5) at Syracuse 

**Start Time:** 7:00 PM ET

**Odds:** -110 (DraftKings)

**Units:** 1U

**Reasoning:** Sometimes, there’s nothing deadlier than a team playing with its back against the wall. Other times, that team is the 2025 Syracuse men’s basketball team.

The Orange (4-3) accepted an invite to last week’s Player’s Era Festival with one thing in mind: an opportunity to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> up a crucial non-conference Quad 1 victory. With matchups lined up against Iowa State (7th in NET ranking), Kansas (17th) and Houston (18th), the opportunity was there for the taking. However, what started with promise—a 78-74 overtime defeat to the Cougars—quickly ended in disaster with 11 and 31-point losses to the Jayhawks and Cyclones respectively. 

And while No. 13 Tennessee will provide Syracuse with one last chance on Tuesday night, don’t hold your breath.

The Vols (7-1) enter this matchup on the heels of a disappointing 81-76 loss to Kansas last Wednesday. It’s a defeat that will have the team kicking itself, as Tennessee led by 12 with 14 minutes to go before watching the wheels completely fall off. So while the Orange will be out looking for respect, the Vols will be looking for something to take out their frustrations on. 

Offensively, Tennessee comes in ranked 32nd in offensive efficiency (1.186), 50th in shooting (48.8%), 52nd in scoring (85.9 PPG) and 114th in three-point shooting (35.4%). While Syracuse’s defensive numbers might look respectable at first—20th in opponent shooting (37.8%), 27th in scoring defense (65.3 PPGA), 30th in defensive efficiency (0.908) and 99th in opponent three-point shooting (30.7%)—a closer look will reveal a chink in its armor. In three games against top-ranked opponents during last week’s aforementioned tournament, the team saw those numbers drop to 81.3 points per game allowed on 46.4% shooting (39.7% from the perimeter). Look for Maryland-transfer Ja’Kobi Gillespie (18.5 PPG) to take advantage of that.

The mismatch should continue on the other end of the floor as well. 

Through eight games, the Vols rank 12th in opponent shooting (36.8%), 27th in defensive efficiency (0.903), 29th in scoring defense (65.4 PPGA) and 51st in opponent three-point shooting (28.7%). It all adds up to what should be a very long night for an Orange offense that only ranks 114th in shooting (46.2%), 171st in offensive efficiency (1.041), 177th in scoring (74.9 PPG) and 290th in three-point shooting (29.3%). That includes scoring just 66.0 points per game on 37.9% shooting over their last three showings. And did we mentioned that the team will be without its leading scorer in forward Donnie Freeman (17.8 PPG? Yikes. 

A strong advantage on the glass will be another X factor in the matchup. 

Tennessee comes in ranked 10th in total rebounds (43.6 per game), 10th in offensive rebounds (13.0), 20th in opponent rebounds (30.0) and 199th in opponent offensive rebounds (9.4). Conversely, Syracuse ranks 152nd in total rebounding (36.3), 223rd in offensive rebounds (8.6), 293rd in opponent rebounds (38.7) and 304th in opponent offensive rebounds (10.9). 

Trust the Vols to make the Orange their punching bag.

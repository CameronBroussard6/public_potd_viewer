**Last Pick:**   Tyler Allgeier u19.5 Rushing Yards (-112 on DK) 1u to win 0.89u ❌

Very bad <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> I apologize. Allgeier got put to work almost as much as Bijan, Colts failed to get a sizeable lead at any point. I failed to catch that Deforest Buckner was out leading to a weaker defensive line and pass rush.

**Todays Event**: 🏈 NFL Monday Football Eagles @ Packers 7:15 PM CST🏈

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Todays pick</mark>**: Josh Jacobs O68.5 Rushing (-112 on DK) 1u to win 0.89u

**Writeup:** Eagles heading into Green bay on a chilly Monday night. Potential for a snow game and weather around or below freezing, and high winds which favor the run over passing. Packers will be looking to come off of fraud watch after the embarrassment that was last week, and give payback for the two losses of last season. Being slight underdogs, Eagles are looking to keep up their NFC Dominance and upset the packers at their own home.

Josh Jacobs has been averaging just under this line with 66.8 yards rushing. Calf problems a few weeks back had him unhappily limited in carries. However he seems to be coming back to form getting 17 carries for 87 rushing yards last week against the Panthers. Jacobs has been averaging 3.8 YPC with just over 17 carries a game. 

The running scheme is a heavy part of the Packers offense, which may be increased with the absence of Tucker Kraft. With other receivers like Watson still being limited (though im sure he&#x27;ll be getting more play this game), and Wicks/Golden/Williams being questionable.

Eagles have the 19th rated rushing defense allowing 4.12 YPC and around 120 rushing yards per game. Eagles defense will have gaps that Jacobs is bound to find and exploit. If the Packers do get the lead, you can guarantee a high amount of touches in the second half

BOL to anyone tailing!

Ive been betting and tailing NFL picks for a good while now and i have gotten a feel for it so imma put my skills to the test.

This is why i would be slightly more cautious with this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> as NBA and F1 are more of my strongsuit but imma try NFL for once since personally ive been doing well the last few weeks

Hurts average is slightly higher than the line here but obviously they dace the packers defense which is one of the best in the league, Hurts went well below this last szn against the packers going only 131.

I strongly believe that they will be using saquon a lot for this matchup so thats where i see value here.

Just a simple and striaght to the point write up <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> as always bet responsibly and well within bankroll limits and BOL</td></tr>

Last Pick: Houston Rockets -3.0 vs Milwaukee Bucks @ 1.91. 3U. ✅

That was a fun game, and the Rockets ultimately had enough quality to outperform when it mattered and ultimately won by 7. The Ayton <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> before that lost because the Lakers were down 25 in the 3^(rd), and the coach pulled all the starters.

 

Next <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **LA Lakers -7.0 vs Charlotte Hornets @ 1.91**. 3U play.

The Hornets are 1-5 ATS in their last 6, also losing 5 of those 6 games. With Ball and Miller injured, Miles Bridges Questionable, and various other injuries, they are a very thin squad. The Lakers are coming off an unexpected demolition by a second-string Hawks team. JJ is going to expect his team to bounce back in a big way, and Luka and Ayton should both have big games here. AR is also upgraded to Questionable, so there is a decent chance he starts here as well. The quality between these team is simply too much, and the Lakers need to bounce back after their pathetic display while Hornets have little to play for. I will back the Lakers to get their mojo back here.</td></tr>

Last Pick: Daniil Glinka ML vs Darwin Blanch (-143, 1 unit): Loss

Tennis | Drummondville Challenger | 1:30 PM EST (estimated) 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Antoine Ghibaudo vs Clement Chidekh | **Ghibaudo ML at -122 (DraftKings). 1 unit.**

Write-up: Glinka closed at -159 on BetRivers, though odds varied quite a bit on books. Unfortunately, Blanch was simply better player in that match. There was some drama in the second set where a critical point won by Glinka was replayed due to an issue with the balls, and he went up a minibreak at the start of the tiebreak, but it&#x27;s hard to say he deserved to win that one. Definitely not a good <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, but I&#x27;m still happy with my overall form (8-2 L10 and getting close to break-even). 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>, I&#x27;m going with Antoine Ghibaudo to defeat Clement Chidekh in Drummondville. Ghibaudo, who relies on a big serve + 1 combination, is always at his best on fast hard courts, and he&#x27;s been showing that throughout this indoor season. He made one of his best runs of the year a couple weeks ago in Sioux Falls, defeating Martin Damm in the semifinals; in Knoxville last week, I didn&#x27;t think he played badly despite a lopsided loss to eventual champion Mitchell Krueger. Ghibaudo has consistently gotten off to a good start in tournaments recently, having won his first match in his last 10 events played. 

Clement Chidekh has always been known as a talented player, but he hasn&#x27;t necessarily lived up to his potential this year. After a solid start to the year that saw him narrowly miss out on qualifying for the Australian Open with a wild loss to Hady Habib, his performance at this level has been inconsistent at best. Most recently, he played ITFs in Glasgow and Montreal and threw in a couple of rough losses to James Story and Duncan Chan.

Overall, I feel that Ghibaudo comes into this tournament with a lot more momentum on his side. Chidekh has a good backhand and solid baseline game, but Ghibaudo has the bigger serve, and has spent months playing this NA hard-court swing. I feel that he comes into this tournament with momentum on his side, and should be a bigger favorite in this all-French matchup.

**Writeup:**

* NOVAQ have been quite the suprise team the last couple months looking increasingly good and having some big performances and upsetting some solid tier two teams, they are on a 3 match winstreak and have been playing tons of games recently coming in. Led by star player tasman but overall a really strong fire power roster with no real weak links on the roster
* Venom have been very inconsistent for a long time now, much higher ranked team but struggle heavily with  losing to worse teams and some inconsistency amongst their players. Led by star AWPer flayy, this team has had a relatively strong season overall and despite some disappointing results in the back half of the year should be relatively happy with the season they have put together

**Veto:**

* NOVAQ ban Overpass, VENOM ban Inferno
* **NOVAQ <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> dust 2**

**Dust 2 Stats:**

* NOVAQ are 78% winrate on 18 maps of Dust 2, it is their most played map and highest winrate by a large margin
* Venom are 25% winrate on 16 maps of Dust 2, it is their most played map as well but lowest winrate by far with their next lowest being Mirage at 43%. This map is often picked as a punish <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> against Venom and they have struggled on it for a while now.
* Venom are 2-5 in the last month on Dust 2, they are mostly getting carried by their 64% winrate on pistol rounds leading to much closer maps then they have played in the past. Venom are 12-21 in 2025 on Dust 2. Venom are 2-10 in their last 12 maps of Dust 2 they have played
* Novaq are 8-3 in the last month on Dust 2, they are on a 3 map winstreak of absolute domination beating FORZE Reload 13-3/13-4 and SPARTA 13-5 all in the last 3 days. They have won 7 of their last 9 maps on Dust 2 and 5 of the last 6
* One thing I love about NOVAQ on Dust 2, they are 61.2% winrate on T side, the weaker side normally for most teams</td></tr>

Last POTD: 🏈 Ravens ML + Derrick Henry 70+ alt rushing yards (-105). 💰

Writeup: Thought this was absolutely chalked until Henry got used predominately on a 2nd half drive and went from 33 to 72 yards. Barely scraped by on this one, glad to finally get 2 in a row again and hit +30u!

Game starts at 8:15pm EST. Bet 3.25u

Writeup: Keeping this one simple. Now with Christian Watson back, Jordan Love can once again show off how much he loves throwing to these guys, especially with starting TE Tucker Kraft now out for the year. The Eagles passing defense is on the bottom end of yards allowed, and one of the worst in explosive plays allowed through the air. On top of this, one of the Eagles&#x27;s top CBs, Jaire Alexander, will be out this game. I expect for this to be a close game or even have the Eagles as the underdog in the lead, so expect a lot of passing from Love in this one to his top guys. The Packers reminded us just how good Love is with these 2 guys against the Panthers last week, and I expect for us to see it again. WR1s and WR2s have been absolutely cooking this Eagles pass defense all season, and both receivers here can each respectively hit their O/U on receiving yards as well as their longest reception O/U, but I think 25+ yards for each of them is a great number.

Remember to only bet what you can afford to lose, and BOL!</td></tr>

Event: Eagles @ Packers (7:15pm central)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: standard two leg 6.5 point teaser 

(Eagles +8/under 52) (-120) (1U) 

-everything is bet to win unit amount-

Write up: 

Let’s start with the eagles +8 side of the teaser first. The packers just lost Tucker kraft to an already banged up receiver group and things aren’t going to get any easier against an elite pass defense in Philly (3rd in completion percentage allowed). The eagles are coming off a bye and have had two weeks to prepare for this mnf juggernaut game. This offense was trending in the right direction before the bye, Hurts has completed 71.1% of his passes for 1068 yards with 10 touchdowns and one <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> over the last four games. Meanwhile, Barkley finally broke out with 150 rushing yards in Week 8. They are also number in EPA per play since week 7, exploding over those two weeks before the bye. In their nfc wild card matchup against the packers, the eagles got the best of Jordan love as he went 20/33 for just 212 yards and 3 picks. Philadelphia’s pass rush is ramping up as well, scoring seven sacks in the past two games (after only nine in the opening six outings), and it just added depth with edge Jaelan Phillips at the trade deadline. Brandon graham has also come out of retirement to help bolster this defensive unit even more. I expect Philly to come correct and at least stay within a touchdown with this also being a lower scoring contest which we will get to right now

Now for the under 52… With Kraft sidelined for the season, Jayden Reed placed on injured reserve, and rookie receiver Matthew Golden nursing a shoulder issue, Green Bay’s aerial attack faces significant limitations.
Still, the Packers boast a formidable pass defense, currently ranked eighth in the NFL for defensive dropback success rate. At Lambeau Field, they’ve been especially stingy, surrendering just 16.3 points per game. Even in last week’s surprising defeat to the Panthers, the defense held its ground.
Given the circumstances, both squads will likely rely heavily on their ground games to move the ball come Monday night. That strategy becomes even more crucial with temperatures forecasted to hover near freezing in Green Bay.
Neither offense is known for its pace. The Packers rank 26th in seconds per play, while the Eagles sit even lower at 30th. This deliberate tempo, combined with a run-heavy approach, should keep the clock ticking and favor a lower-scoring outcome — making the Under an appealing play.

I’m currently finishing up my senior year at the university of Alabama, balancing school and getting these potds in for y’all is something I take pride in so if you would like to leave a tip I am leaving a link to my Venmo, they are greatly appreciated!

__POTD Record:__ 50-24-1 (+57.91u)

__Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:__ [✅Jacoby Brissett o34.5 pass attempts (-125), 2.5u](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/s/ugLGSH1jDH)

__Event:__ NFL: Eagles @ Packers 8:15pm EST

__POTD:__ Christian Watson o38.5 rec yards (-115), 2.4u to win 2.09u

__Write Up:__ The (5-2-1) Green Bay Packers 2024 season began &amp; ended with losses to the Philadelphia Eagles, starting with their game Brazil &amp; then in the playoffs in Philadelphia. On Monday night, the Packers hope to get payback against a (6-2) Philadelphia squad. The Eagles also are looking for some revenge. Over the offseason, the Packers were the team that proposed the rule to ban the rush push play that is essentially a cheat code to get an automatic few yards. The rule barely passed, &amp; the Eagles are back running it again to run it as much as they please. The Eagles are coming off a bye week, when the week before they beat the Giants 38-20 at home in a game where Giants rookie RB Cam Skattebo snapped his leg in half halting the Giants offense. Speaking of injuries, Packers just lost their rising star TE Tucker Kraft to a torn ACL. __Kraft had a 21% Target Share (2nd most of NFL TE’s), &amp; led the Packers in receiving yards with 489 yards.__ Also they have a banged up receiving core with rookie Matthew Golden leaving last game with a shoulder injury &amp; missing the last 2 practices. His production has dipped in recent weeks, with only 50 yards over his past three games. Dontayvion Wicks is listed as questionable with a calf injury having missed the last 2 games. Jayden Reed is already on IR. Who benefits the most from all these injuries? Christian Watson.

The Packers healthy WR1 is Romeo Doubs. Romeo Doubs has been targeted 22.1% of his routes, with a current career high 1.88 yards per route run. The Eagles are 3rd in catch rate allowed to outside receivers (57.1%) &amp; fifth in TD rate (2.7%) to those receivers. This mostly due to their elite CB Quinyon Mitchell who has been shutting down WR1’s &amp; outside WR all season. __Mitchell has forced a tight window (less than 1 yard of separation) on 39.6% of throws his way, 3rd best in NFL among CB’s targeted 30+ times. He ranks 3rd in the NFL in NFL Next Gen Stats Composite score (90).__ Mitchell is going to lock Doubs down on the outside. WR Christian Watson is a Swiss Army knife that is utilized in multiple positions all over the field. Head Coach Matt LaFleur said last week: “Christian Watson is a rare breed. What he brings with his size &amp; speed gives us so much flexibility on offense because you can plug &amp; play him anywhere.” Watson tore his ACL in the Packers last regular season game last season. He came back 2 weeks ago at the perfect time with the WR room littered with injuries. Watson picked up right where he left off, hitting on some big catches leading to him to hit over on his receiving yard totals in his 2 games back. __Watson is coming off a 2 receptions for 58 yard game where he had a 52 yard reception. In the previous game he went 4/85 with a 33 yard reception.__ Packers QB Jordan Love has an arm &amp; he likes to use it. Specifically when Watson is on the field. __Watson has had 56+ receiving yards in 6 of his last 8 healthy games dating back to last season, with longest receptions of 33+ yards in 6/8, &amp; in 3 of those games he had receptions for 52+ yards.__ Watson is known for catching bombs, &amp; he did it all last season. __In 2024 he finished 2nd in Yards Per Reception at 21.4 Yards Per Route. 2 games into 2025 he is now averaging 23.8 YPR, but with those targets, Watson has been #2 on the team with a 36% share of air yards, which he has leveraged into 143 yards receiving. Since the beginning of the 2024 season, Watson leads the NFL in most yards per target (min. 60 targets) with 12.5 yards.__ Watson will play a ton of snaps as he was on the field for 78.9% of the dropbacks on Sunday. __Watson averages 70.2 receiving yards per game across 14 career games above a 70% route share.__ Now he faces an Eagles defense that has been giving up bombs all season. 

The Eagles secondary gives up big chunk plays through the air. __The Eagles have allowed the 2nd-highest target share to opposing outside WRs this year (45.8%) &amp; the 6th most receiving yards per game on throws traveling 20+ yards downfield.__ They will also be without recently acquired CB Jaire Alexander. __The Eagles have given up five 40+ yard passes this season, tied for 6th most in the NFL. While also giving up about three 20+ yard passes per game. Philidelphia allows the 3rd most Avg Depth of Target (aDOT 9.06).__ They give up bombs. Take a look how WR’s have fared vs the Eagles starting with the most recent (not including last game when Giants only had 14 passes), including their longest receptions: 

Addison: 9/128 34 yd rec, JJ 5/79 40 yd rec

Robinson: 6/84 35 yd rec, Humphrey: 4/55 34 yd rec

Sutton: 8/99 34 yd rec, Franklin: 3/35 20 yd rec

Egbuka: 4/101 77 yd rec, Irving: 5/102 72 yd rec

Puka: 8/112 20 yd rec, Adams: 3/56 44 yd rec

This scheme matchup is set up well for Watson too. __The Eagles run Man coverage 30% of their plays, 9th most in the league.__ Injured Tucker Kraft was GB&#x27;s man beater by a large margin. __In the last 5 weeks, Romeo Doubs vs man coverage has only 0.32 Yards Per Route Run. Since Watson returned he has averaged 2.7 YPRR. Against Man coverage, he flourishes with a team best 3.71 YPRR.__ The Packers are going to be able to drive on the Eagles too.__Opponents have converted a league high 53.5% of their 3rd downs against the Eagles over their past 3 games. The Packers have converted 12% more 3rd downs than their opponents, 3rd in the league.__ They also have struggled in the run game with star RB Josh Jacobs being limited with a calf issue. He has played fewer than 60% of the snaps in each of the past 3 games. DL Jalen Carter has been a problem for opposing offenses. With Carter on the field, the Eagles are allowing 3.7 yards per carry with 0.95 yards before contact per rush to RB’s, &amp; only 1 rushing TD. Packers will need to move the ball through the air. Especially vs a Philadelphia offense that has been elite lately. __24% of Eagles offensive plays have gained 10+ yards over there last 4 games (3rd most). Philadelphia has converted a league high 85% (17 of 20) of its red zone trips into TD’s &amp; is a perfect 12/12 on goal to go trips into TD’s.__ As a team that loves to run the ball, they face a Packers defense are coming off allowing 141 yards &amp; 2 TD’s to Rico Dowdle on Sunday. __Since their Week 5 bye, Green Bay has just a 53.7% success rate against rushing plays (26th) after a 67.4% rate prior (2nd). That’s going to be a problem vs an Eagles offense that runs on 47.6% of their plays (3rd most).__ Eagles are going to be able to march downfield.

Packers are going to throw it a ton. Eagles give up a ton of long passes. Watson is the king of the deep ball &amp; may hit this on 1 play.

__Christian Watson o38.5 rec yards__

Last Five Predictions (Old - New): ❌✅ ✅❌ ✅

Net Units: +18.77

Yesterday&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Erling Haaland to score vs Liverpool 3u @ $1.72 ✅

Really happy with this one. Haaland missed a pen, but still scored within half an hour. Some added bonuses are the other bets I mentioned all getting up too. 
- Haaland to score and 2+ shots on target 
- Haaland to score and City to win/draw

Nice to have it covered within 30 minutes.

On top of that, I added a comment that if Wirtz starts then Doku could have a big game... Wirtz started and Doku was clear MOTM, scoring a goal in what was probably his best game for City. The was world class in this game. 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:  Esbjerg to win and u3.5 total goals v Middelfart. 4u @ $2.5

Not many games <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, but I like betting on this league. 

Mid-table Esbjerg host bottom of the table Middlefart.

Milldefart obviously has an elite name, but that&#x27;s where it ends.... They&#x27;re having a shocking season and sit last on the table; Losing The last 5.

Their away form has been terrible all season, drawing twice and losing their other five away from home. 

Having said that though, they haven&#x27;t been getting smashed. They&#x27;ve conceded 12 in their seven away games.... Which isn&#x27;t great but considering they haven&#x27;t won any of those games, it&#x27;s about as good as possible. 

In those games, they&#x27;ve only had two games go over the 3.5 goal barrier. One a crazy 2-2 draw where they pulled two goals from nothing, the other being a 4-0 loss. 

Esbjerg have been good at home with a 4-2-2 record after eight games. Again though, the games haven&#x27;t been incredibly goal heavy with eleven goals scored and eleven again. 

If you want to play it safer, Esbjerg to win outright is good odds too at $1.61.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: Bunting ML vs Woodhouse 

Sport: Darts, Grand Slam

Reasoning: Bunting’s higher scoring average and steadier checkout make him better suited to handle the short format pressure. Woodhouse can be streaky, but Bunting’s consistency across scoring phases should see him through.

- [ ] <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>: Djere -2.5  handicap at 1.83

- [ ] Reasoning: Recently Djere has not been himself, losing to players he should be beating. Last time in France he comfortably lost in straight sets to Droguet and he wasn’t playing well. However I watched his match against spizziri in his last match and I could see his old form coming back. Djere only lost this match because he was mentally drained after failing to finish the match with 2 match points. On any other day he would have won that match. This is why this time around I think he comfortably beats Blanchet. Now when you look at recent form Blanchet has lost 2-0 in the last 3 matches. His hard court form is pretty good but Djere will like this match up because I believe the fast indoor style of tennis will allow him to dominate especially against an out of form Blanchet.

Hope anyone who tailed this wins stress free and good luck!!

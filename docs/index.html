Last POTD: **Langreo v Deportivo Fabril: Deportivo Fabril ML @1.86❌**

Todays <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: **Brighton v Bournemouth: Brighton o1.5 team goals &amp; o7.5 match corners @1.95**

For this slip, Brighton to score twice and over 7.5 corners fits the way both of these teams play. Brighton are not crazy explosive, but they are steady. They average around 1.6 goals a game and against a defence like Bournemouth, that’s enough to expect at least two. Bournemouth concede a lot, around 2.8 goals per game recently, and they have not kept a clean sheet. That alone gives Brighton a really good chance to hit two goals, even if the game itself is not a total goal fest.

Brighton are also strong defensively, so they usually control games better than their opponents. That means more time on the ball, more attacks, more pressure, and that naturally creates corners. Bournemouth also help this bet because of how they play. They attack a lot, take many shots, and their games are messy. That leads to blocks, deflections, saves, and clearances, which all turn into corners. In their recent games, Bournemouth have been involved in matches with over nine corners every time, so over 7.5 is actually a pretty low line for how their matches go.

Even if the total goals stay moderate, like 2 to 1 or 2 to 0, this bet still works. Brighton can get their two goals by being patient and using Bournemouth’s weak defence, and the corner count can climb just from both teams playing open, shooting often, and forcing defensive actions. Brighton pushing for goals and Bournemouth trying to respond is the perfect recipe for a high corner count.

So the idea is simple. Bournemouth concede alot of away goals, Brighton are good enough to score twice, and the way both teams attack and defend makes corners almost guaranteed. Two Brighton goals and at least eight corners fits the stats, the styles, and the recent form really well.

Best of Luck!</td></tr>

Mannarino has had some deep runs at the Aussie Open but he&#x27;s in the twilight of his career and has had some shocking showings his last 6 matches. Rinky has had an impressive prep for the Open and whilst the opponents he&#x27;s beaten havent been great, he showed flashes of brilliance against Perricard and Fokina. 

I question Mannarino&#x27;s prep and form for this with only 3 hours of court time this year, getting demolished in both showings.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Goztepe Vs Rizespor - **Goztepe ML @ 1.94 (Melbet)**

**Write Up:** Goztepe return home full of confidence, built on strong defensive organisation and taking their chances when it matters. Rizespor come into this match with mixed form, capable of good performances, but often let down by defensive mistakes. Goztepe’s recent games show a team that’s comfortable staying in control. Back-to-back clean-sheet wins against Samsunspor and Gaziantep highlight their discipline, patience, and ability to see games out. 

At home, Goztepe tend to play in a controlled and measured way rather than pushing too hard. Their 0-0 draw with Kocaelispor and narrow 2-1 loss to Trabzonspor were both tight games for long periods, showing how well they limit space and force opponents into low-quality chances. Over their last five matches, Goztepe have conceded just four goals, which is impressive. While they may not score in big numbers, they are efficient going forward, especially when the game stays structured.

Rizespor’s recent form has been up and down. Their 3-0 home win over Eyupspor showed what they can do when things go their way, but heavy losses to Fenerbahce and narrow defeats to Besiktas and Kayserispor highlighted ongoing defensive problems.

Away from home, goals have been harder to find. The 1-1 draw at Konyaspor was solid, but they struggled to control the game for long periods. Over their last five matches, Rizespor have conceded seven goals, often after losing their shape. That inconsistency makes them vulnerable against teams that manage the tempo well.

Goztepe look well placed to get a win here, backed by their strong defensive record and Rizespor’s inconsistent attacking output away from home. Goztepe’s ability to keep games controlled suits this matchup perfectly. Rizespor have also struggled for results recently and remain shaky at the back, failing to keep a clean sheet in their last five matches while conceding 11 goals. With that in mind, the home side should have enough quality to secure a solid victory.

**New Event:** NCAAF–Miami vs Indiana

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:**  Miami Team Rushing Yards Under 109.5@ 1.90 (3 units)

Indiana has the #1 rush defense in the country holding opponents to an average of 26 rush attempts per game and an average of 77 yards per game. Miami’s rush offense is 48^(th) averaging 37 rush attempts per game and 150 yards per game. Every single one of Indiana’s opponents this season has significantly reduced their rushing attempts and have had no choice but to opt for a more dynamic passing offense to try and catch up on the scoreboard.

Just to illustrate let me list the names of Indiana’s opponents, the final score, rushing attempts and rushing yards against Indiana’s defense. You may recognize some of these names. Keep in mind that Indiana won all these games.

Name / Score / Rush Attempts / Rushing Yards

Oregon / 56-22 / 26 / 93

Alabama / 38-3 / 18 / 23

Ohio State / 13-10 / 26 / 58

Maryland / 55-10 / 17 / 37

UCLA / 56-6 / 25 / 88

Michigan St / 38-13 / 24 / 74

Oregon / 30-20 / 30 / 81

Iowa / 20-15 / 31 / 92

Illinois / 63-10 / 20 / 2

...enough you get the point

Old Dominion did put up 218 yards rushing against Indiana in the 1^(st) game of the season and since then only Penn State went over 100 as well.

Indiana has held 12 of their 14 opponents this season to 93 yards or less this season. Miami is a run heavy offense, but they will most likely be playing from behind at some point and will be forced to abandon the run. Regardless, I doubt they will have much success on the ground against Indiana.</td></tr>

*Last 5:* ❌❌✅✅✅

**CFP - Indiana @ Miami, 7:30 PM ET, ESPN**

***Indiana 1H +3.5 / 1H Total u30.5 (-140) 2u***

The College Football National Championship brings us two juggernauts on the defensive end of the ball, as Miami hosts Indiana for all the marbles. **I’m taking Indiana to cover +3.5 &amp; the total in the first half to stay low.**

The easy focus here is what both these schools have modelled their foundations on: setting the tone defensively. *Both teams decided to play a bit of shotgun football last week*, but I expect both teams use that tape to clean things up this week.

These are two of the best first half D units in all of college football. **Miami rank 3rd at 4.8 points against, meanwhile Indiana are 5th just shy of a touchdown at 6.6 points against.** On paper, there’s a touch of risk: *Indiana are “fast starters” statistically, ranking 6th in the NCAA with 20+ PPG in first half scoring*, but they will be in a hostile title atmosphere which might negate some of that flow.

This is why I’m actually giving Indiana a field goal rather than playing the money line for insurance purposes. Despite being one of college footballs fastest starters, **Indiana have actually gone under this first half total in 5 of their last 7 games**. They score, but they suffocate. 

Lining up with this: Miami have been one of the slower starters in all of college football, ranking **84th in first quarter scoring, &amp; 55th in first half scoring**. In fact, they have **scored a total of three points in the first quarter of their 3 playoff games this season. That’s an average of ONE point per game**. CFL shit.

As I mentioned before, Miami much like Indiana went over the first half total contrary to their body of work last week. **PRIOR TO last week, Miami were under this first half total in EVERY OTHER GAME THIS SEASON.**

They do this by **possessing the ball at a college best rate 58% per game, (62% during this college football playoff)**. Being the “home” team, they may use this stability they’ve found controlling the ball over the last few weeks to try and stagnate Indiana’s offensive unit.

**Indiana rank 2nd in all of college football giving up only 13.6 first downs per game this season, Miami cracked the top 20 themselves with a respectable 17 per game**. Again - nothing to give by either defensive unit. I can see a lot of punts, a few field goals, and an emphasis on extended drives, both teams will value their early possessions and you might see both these teams take the points

**I’m betting against what both teams showed off offensively last week, and leaning into what both teams are built to do on the biggest stage**

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Kaoru Mitoma to Score or Give Assist (+135) 1 unit to win 1.35 units

**Write Up:** I guess Villa was bound to lay a goose egg at some point, really bad showing by them all around. Couldn&#x27;t find Watkins or any other passes near the box, and Everton played a mean defense. Well played to Everton, on to the next for us. 

Brighton host Bournemouth here in a battle of the mid-lower table. Expecting a shootout here as both teams need points and tend to participate in high scoring matches. Bournemouth have been a poor defensive team this season. They concede the 2nd most goals in the EPL, behind only West Ham, the 3rd most xG, and the 4th most SOTs. Their games are also the highest scoring in the EPL. This is especially true on the road, their last 8 away matches they have conceded 3-2-4-4-3-4-3-3. They have conceded over 3 goals in 7 of their last 8 away matches, which bodes well for our home team here. 

Mitoma has been dealing with injuries most of this season, having only participated in roughly half of Brighton&#x27;s EPL matches. He is now fully fit though and has come back to the starting lineup. That said, he is coming back into form and scored his 2nd goal of the season in their last match against Man City. His first goal, coincidentally, was in the reverse fixture at Bournemouth earlier in the season. Over the last 3 seasons, he has scored 4 goals against Bournemouth in 4 games. He was also Brighton&#x27;s joint top scorer last season. Since his minutes have been limited and the sample size this year is small, this play is more about my opinion that Mitoma is the best player on the Brighton team, when healthy, and Bournemouth are one of the worst defensive teams in the league.

Reasoning: Como are 6th with a +12 goal difference and average 1.5 points per away game, while Lazio at home only average 1.6 points and have scored just 15 in 10, this is not a dominant home side. Away, Como concede 0.9 goals per game, Lazio home matches average 2.4 total goals, and both teams’ recent form trends sit comfortably below 3.5 goals. Therefore, Como have been more reliable away than Lazio have been at home, and the numbers say this game naturally stays tight

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Hapoel Beer Sheva ML @1.70 (2u) 

**Write-Up:**

Luck was not on our side yesterday, with the way the game was going Barcelona should have gotten an easy win, with even 2 invalidated goals, but it is what it is, let&#x27;s hope luck is with us this time.

Hapoel Beer Sheva come into this match in a very strong position. They sit 2nd in the league with a record of 13W, 3D, and 2L, but that’s only because Beitar Jerusalém (1st) have played one extra match. With a win here, Beer Sheva reclaim 1st place, which adds extra motivation to an already important matchup.

Form strongly favors the visitors. Beer Sheva are unbeaten in their last five matches in all competitions (4W, 1D), while Hapoel Tel Aviv (5th) have been inconsistent over the same stretch (2W, 1D, 2L). Despite Tel Aviv’s solid home record this season (8W, 1D in the league), context matters: they’ve struggled badly when facing top opposition.

Looking at Tel Aviv’s home defeats in all competitions this season, all of them came against teams in the top of the table: Maccabi Tel Aviv (3rd) twice and Beitar Jerusalem (1st). Going back to last season, the last time they lost at home before that was a heavy 1–5 defeat to Hapoel Beer Sheva. Against top-five teams this season, Tel Aviv have only managed one win: a 3–2 victory over Beitar Jerusalem that was heavily influenced by a late red card.

The head-to-head history is also very telling. Beer Sheva have won 4 of the last 6 meetings, and in Tel Aviv specifically, they’ve won 3 of the last 5. The last two visits saw Beer Sheva dominate, winning 5–1 and 4–0.

Away from home, Beer Sheva have proven they can handle big games. This season they’ve beaten Beitar Jerusalem (0–1) and Maccabi Haifa (0–1) away, dominating both matches statistically with higher xG, more shots, more shots on target, and more big chances. Even in away games where they dropped points, performance wasn’t the issue, luck and a red card played a major role.

So even though Tel Aviv have a very strong home record this season, considering their struggles against top teams and Beer Sheva’s head-to-head dominance, I’m backing Beer Sheva to win this game and reclaim 1st place in the league.

ESTRELA VS ESTORIL

Date: 19 JANUARY 2026 at 21:15

BET ON: Both teams to score- Yes

Odd: 1.73



\- For BTTS – Yes, there are compelling tactical and motivational reasons suggesting both teams will score. Estrela’s coach José Faria has publicly framed the match as one of “importance máxima” and a chance to end their winless patch, stressing that his side are confident and see positive momentum as key, even if they’ve struggled recently — he expects Estoril to come with high motivation and a different stimulus, which means Estrela will not sit back but try to take the game to them. Estrela’s recent games show they are aggressive in transition and score after the break but are also prone to conceding once the game opens up, reflecting a tactical willingness to commit players forward that weakens them defensively. Four of their last five league games have finished with over 2.5 goals, underlining this attacking-but-vulnerable profile. Many Portuguese sources confirm coach Faria’s intent to push the team forward rather than park the bus against a motivated Estoril.

\- On the other side, Estoril’s Ian Cathro has insisted his team will always play to win and “não compra o empate” (doesn’t play for a draw), even in tough away fixtures, highlighting confidence and an attacking mindset. He regularly emphasizes rigor and concentration but also the need to play their style — which is proactive and forward-looking — and has acknowledged that results haven’t matched their ambition but the approach remains the same. With Xeka out injured, Estoril’s midfield balance is more open, often leading to gaps that invite transitions — exactly the kind Estrela thrives on.

\- Combine all this with Estrela’s attacking identity under Madeira’s 4-2-3-1/4-4-2 hybrid and Estoril’s desire to impose their game and score away, and you get a match where both teams have tactical incentive and motivation to score, while neither has shown defensive solidity recently. All signs point to goals at both ends.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Novak Djokovic 🇷🇸 -8.5 games handicap vs Pedro Martinez 🇪🇸 5 units to win 4.2U @1.83 (Bet365)

The spread is quite large but I expect a beating of Martinez in this match from Djokovic. The Spaniard started the season with a title in Bengaluru but didn’t face a single player ranked in the top 230 so it won’t mean much other than give a slight bit of confidence heading into the season. The world No. 71 had a pretty bad year in 2025, especially on hard courts going 4-10 on outdoors and performed considerably worse as the season went on leading to some big losses culminating in a 4 and 1 loss to Giron in Athens. It’s no wonder really considering his lack of weapons on hard courts - with a subpar serve and conservative gamestyle he doesn’t have the game to take it to win free points on faster courts and instead has to rely on opponent’s mistakes. Unfortunately for him, most of the top players are simply too good baseliners nowadays with the exception of a couple of error-prone players (looking at you Rune who went 0-2 against the Spaniard) and therefore struggles to stay competitive against these top ranked guys. Outside of clay courts, top 15 opponents have covered this spread in all six grand slam matches against the Spaniard. Last year, Martinez lost 1,4,1 against Zverev here and I expect a similar result here. I mean, even No. 435 Riedi covered the handicap against him at the US open for crying out loud.

Enter the GOAT of tennis Djokovic for one of his last chances at winning a 25th grand slam at his favourite tournament, having won it a whopping 10 times. He has nothing to prove nowadays but he’s still as hungry as ever saying he was here to take the title from Sinner and Alcaraz in his press conference. Despite playing a very limited schedule last year he’s still the world No. 4 and was undoubtedly the third best player last year, reaching the semis of each slam. I couldn’t really think of a better match up to get his season running than Martinez, he should concede few free points on return, win quite a few on serve and come out on top of most rallies to put him in confidence for the rest of the tournament. Basically, Pedro’s style of play comes mostly from waiting for the opponent’s error but is up against the most patient player on tour who should redirect the Spaniard’s pace to overwhelm him even on a bad day. It’s a hellish match-up on paper and expect a comfortable win for the Serb who won’t want to hang around in an opening match to conserve his slightly-diminished fitness levels for the later rounds.

<tr><td class='post'>POTD Record 23-22 (+0.36u)
January Record 8-9 (-1.66u)

Sunday’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> - ✅ Patriots -3 -118 (1.18u to win 1u)

Monday’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> - Stan Wawrinka ML -127 (1.27u to win 1u)

Stan is playing in his final Australian Open this year and he will have the full backing of the crowd. Realistically for him, a win in round 1 would be a successful tournament and I believe he knows that. He should leave it all out there against Djere.

Djere had a tough 2025 with injuries, which could negate some of the concerns of stamina with Wawrinka. Wawrinka has a H2H record of 2-1 in this matchup.

With all these factors, I’ll take the veteran one last time.


Good Luck!</td></tr>

Write up: THAT’S 10 IN A ROW! PATRIOTS KEEP US ALIVE!!! - Model has this as the highest confident Edge % and EV % for the day. Will add some personal information in this write-up as well.

• ⁠Model has Indiana 1H ML at 58%

• Model projects Indiana 1H -4.5 at 54%

• EV better betting 100$ = 12-13$ for this play

• College Football National Championship. I want to start off by saying, I was stuck between Indiana’s 1H line and Indiana -7.5 Full Game - Gut told me to role with the 1H so here we are - Indiana averages 20 points in the 1H this year which is top 10 in college football while only allowing around 6 points in the 1H - Miami averages about 14 points in the 1H, which isn’t the best, but is still pretty good - considering how good Indiana’s defense has been, this line drops - The stats of how good Indiana’s defense is in the 1H, compared with Miami’s mediocre 1H offensive side, gives a small edge towards Indiana in this one. Indiana’s run game is one of, if not the best in the nation - Miami is susceptible to big plays on defense, while Indiana in ranked 3rd in 20+ yard rushes - Indiana should be able to control the tempo with their run game, limiting Miami possessions throughout the 1H - Indiana has been pretty dominant in their 1H’s and they seem to catch opponents off guard early - Indiana will come out with an awesome game plan, and I see them being damn near perfect in the 1H - Hoosiers cover -4.5 for us in a low scoring 1H

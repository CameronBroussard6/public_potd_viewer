**Record:**  0-0 (First *recorded* play)

**Net Units:**  0U

**Event:**  Buffalo Bills @ Houston Texans 8:15PM ET

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:**  Woody Marks o80 Rush + Rec Yards, 2.4u to win 2u

**Write Up:**  I know the first thing that everyone will run to comment is &quot;Woody has only hit this line in 3 of his 10 games this season. HOWEVER, he has only gotten true starting reps for about 6 of these games, 4 of which have been at **home**. He hit this line in 3 of the 4 home games, with the only miss to an **ELITE** Broncos defense.  
  
Now Woody gets the Bills, who despite posting a 7-3 record, are **struggling** against the run. They rank **31st in YPG to RBs**, allowing an average of **121 YPG**. When on the road, this goes up to **133.5 YPG** on the ground alone.

These defensive struggles on the road paired with Woody Mark&#x27;s increased volume should pair nicely this evening. With Davis Mills and the Houston Defense keeping the Texans in close games, Woody should be able to hit the line easily.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s Event**: Soccer/Football - Brasileirão Série A/Brazilian First Division - Bahia vs Fortaleza (4 PM ET) &amp; Ceará vs Internacional (7:30 PM ET).

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>**: Bahia vs Fortaleza: Both teams to score; Ceará vs Internacional: Ceará to win or draw @ 2.29

**Writeup:** 

Bahia vs Fortaleza: Bahia is a strong and very aggressive team especially playing at home, they scored at least one goal per match playing in their stadium in this season&#x27;s league. Fortaleza  has scored in all its last five games, all of them against better teams, including Flamengo. While Bahia needs to win to get closer to a Libertadores group stage place, Fortaleza fights for its life to avoid a very likely relegation, as they&#x27;ve been doing since Palermo started coaching the team, with a fragile defense, but very aggressive attack, so I expect this to be a very open and fluid game.

Ceará vs Internacional: Léo Condé is doing a great job at Ceará, with a very organized team, they ruled out the possibility of relegation, now fighting for a Sul-americana spot (South American second tier competition, like Europa League). Ceará lost none of their last three games, with 2 wins against Fluminense and Corinthians, which have way better squads. Internacional faces an institutional crisis, with only two wins in their last 12 games, now they&#x27;re just two points away from the relegation zone with five matches to go, they will try to win this because their relegation rivals are now winning matches, but I expect a very hard match to them, especially due to their own bad mentality and form, so I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if, as the game progresses, Internacional gets satisfied with a draw and starts wasting time.</td></tr>

**🏀 Joel Embiid 15P + Tyrese Maxey 6A -125** vs the Milwaukee Bucks

Going back to old faithful. These low-number Thursday slates haven&#x27;t been too kind and anytime I can put Embiid 15P in a lay I will.

Never going to say no to lock in a great SGP.

**Embiid:**

\- Not much to say here. 20p+ in last 5 all at 20-25 minutes. Expecting a similar workload here.  
\- 27p in 30 minutes in the only game vs the Bucks last season.  
\- Ranked in the bottom 10 in FG% in 2 of Embiid&#x27;s 3 favorite zones: Restricted Area &amp; Mid Range  
\- Expect Embiid to have a couple runs of 2-3 buckets that&#x27;ll get us to 15.

**Maxey:**

\- Asking for 6 assist from Maxey should be simple with Embiid  
\- Cleared line in L8/10, averaging 6.8 in L5  
\- Bucks 20th in allowing Assists to PGs  
\- 35 to 40 minutes a game still  
\- Rest play: he hits his highest assist numbers on second legs of B2Bs likely due to exhaustion

Event: NFL TNF Bills @ Texans 8:15EST

Tonight&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: 2 leg parlay (+186 on DK); 2 Units to win 3.72  
\- Woody Marks Under 65.5 Rush Yards  
\- Jayden Higgins 25+ receiving yards

Write Up:   
Leg 1: Woody Marks has emerged as the Texans RB1 as of late, leading the backfield playing 80% of snaps in week 10 and 66% in week 11. Yet, his numbers don&#x27;t indicate that will necessarily continue, or should continue. Both Marks and Chubb have 99 carries on the season. Marks is averaging 3.5 yards per carry next to Chubb&#x27;s 4.2 yards per carry. It could very well be that DeMeco Ryans was riding the hot hand while in route to two consecutive victories. The split time with Chubb is likely to revert closer to a 60/40 split, and in a game they are likely to be trailing, I don&#x27;t see Marks carrying the ball more than 12-13 times. It is also worth noting Marks only eclipsed his line of 65.5 yards one time this season, week 4 in a blowout win against the Titans where he carried the ball 17 times and finished with 69 ground yards.

Leg 2: Yes, we have Davis Mills back out there for the Texans tonight. In his previous two starts he has targeted Jayden Higgins 7 times each game. In those games Higgins has played on average 59% of snaps for the Texans, second behind Nico Collins. This translated to 42 receiving yards in week 10 and 55 in week 11. With the Texans scripted to play from behind tonight Mills shouldn&#x27;t be airing it out any less.</td></tr>

Given the major injury news in the NFL, the strongest play on the board for Thursday, November 20, 2025, is below. I

🏆 The <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>

Sport: NFL (Thursday Night Football)

Matchup: Buffalo Bills at Houston Texans

The <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Under 43.5 Total Points (-110)

The Rationale:

Major Injury Impact: The biggest news of the day is that Texans QB C.J. Stroud is out (concussion). Backup Davis Mills gets the start. The drop-off from Stroud to Mills is significant, drastically lowering Houston&#x27;s offensive ceiling.

Defensive Matchup: The Bills&#x27; defense has been solid, and they should be able to stack the box to stop the run and force Mills into uncomfortable third-and-long situations. Conversely, the Texans have a top-ranked defense that can slow down Josh Allen enough to keep the game from turning into a pure shootout.

Game Script: With a backup QB, Houston will likely try to shorten the game by running the ball (look for RB Woody Marks to get volume), which keeps the clock moving. Experts project a grittier, lower-scoring 20–16 or 24–13 type of game.





Good Luck and let&#x27;s eat !!!</td></tr>

Tip off is 4:00pm PST. <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> the 4-0 Cornhuskers are facing the 3-1 Lobos in this in-season NCAA Hall of Fame Classic tournament game. 

Rienk Mast is one of the more exciting college vets to watch this season. The Dutch big man has been lighting it up by shooting 53.3% from 3. It&#x27;s another case of a center who masquerades as a point guard. 

The Lobos do not guard well against teams that have a winning record. They allowed UC Riverside shoot over 50% from the 3 point line. Meanwhile Mast seems to thrive when facing top teams. He put up 26, in the most recent game, vs the now 2-2 Oklahoma Sooners.

Since there is a lot on the line for this match - namely the tournament and their perfect 4-0 record) I expect to see the Dutchman going off quickly.

He hit this number in the previous game against the spurs with a hobbled JJJ still playing. The Kings defense is some of the worst in the league and their front court doesn&#x27;t move mountains either.

He has been averaging almost 40 mins per game in his last 5, while averaging 22 shot attempts. Throw in the fact that he’s been getting to the free throw line over 10 times per game in his last 4 games.

Bet 1 unit to win .7 units

Why: Bills should win this game but it may be close. Texans have a good defensive presence but they&#x27;re missing CJ shroud this game. I&#x27;m hoping the Bills take advantage of scoring opportunities and walk away with the win. This game will absolutely be a dog fight.

The Magic are doing surprisingly well right now. They&#x27;ve won 4 out of their last 5 and they&#x27;re getting contributions from Desmond bane, Wagner, and a few key pieces off the bench. The clippers on the other hand are shorthanded. They&#x27;re struggling to create an offense outside of James Harden. My gut tells me to take Magic ML (and not the teased spread) - but this is my &#x27;lesser&#x27; confidence <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> of the two, so I teased it to +4.5 but you absolutely don&#x27;t have to.

Myles Turner has only had two 20+ pt games all season.. If Embiid can shoot the ball just halfway decent tonight, I think this will be a pretty easy win. GL!</td></tr>

Event: NBA Sacramento Kings @ Memphis Grizzlies

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Sacramento Kings ML 2U @ 2.20

Pivoting over to the NBA to a scene I&#x27;m more familiar with and taking the Kings over the Grizzlies. We have 2 of the worst teams in the league going head to head, and a line which I don&#x27;t quite understand, but see tremendous value in. Both teams have lost 5 straight so not much to go from there. Kings have Sabonis as probably for the game as well as possibly having Keegan Murray back from a thumb injury. On the other hand, Grizzlies are going to be very short handed. No Small, Clarke, Jerome and importantly Morant who are all sidelined due to injury as well as possibly Jaren Jackson Jr who is currently listed as doubtful for the game as well due to an ankle sprain. Going from that alone you get rookie Cedric Coward being the top player currently active for the Grizzlies for the game. As well as he has been playing, I don&#x27;t see how he can take the Grizzlies over the Kings. On that note as well, the Kings have also been horrendous, but the amount of firepower and quality of players on their roster is night and day. While their offense is nothing short of disastrous at the moment the difference in talent should carry them over a very short handed memphis team.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: NBA 76ers v Magic 

1U Embiid O17.5 points @ $1.87, Sportsbet (Aus) 

Write-Up: People hate betting on Embiid, but this year he’s been solid money. Cleared his points line 5/6 and his 1st quarter points line 4/6. He’s still reliable, but you just adjust to him playing 23-25 minutes a game. Not asking for 30 points! 

He’s gone 20, 25, 20, 20, 29 since his terrible season opener, going for 114 points in 120 minutes in those 5 games. So barring an injury/fall that limits him to sub 17 minutes, he should get this at more or less a point a minute rate. 

I think maybe he’s rusty early as he’s missed the last few games so I’ve gone away from the 1Q bet and think as the game develops he can blow off some cobwebs. 

On the match-up, Giannis is out. So he’ll have Portis &amp; Turner largely to deal with. Don’t mind that at all</td></tr>

The spread is set to a bit higher limit than I would like, but it should still be doable.

Panathinaikos has it warm-cold since the beginning of the season, with injuries of Yurtseven, Lessort, and Holmes it is expected, but it looks like coach Ataman adjusted and found his mojo again.

4 straight wins, 2 of those in Euroleague and both in away games against Real Madrid and Paris are a good sign that Pao is back. Currently, they are rotating 8 players, all of whom are really good and experienced EL players.

I watched Dubai in the ABA league the other day against FMP, and I wasn&#x27;t impressed. They still need a few months at least to get things in order. When Musa is not playing - injured, it is unclear who is the top player. Not sure if they play, but questionably absent are also Kabengele and Avramovic - the two best players against Zalgiris in their last home win.

They also have some great players, but they are not quite there just yet.</td></tr>

Beal, Kawhi and Derrick Jones are all OUT here and Harden has gone under this line in 4/6 starts this season WITHOUT Beal and Kawhi.

Now Harden faces the Magic, who allow the 3rd LEAST total assists and the 6th LEAST assists to opposing PGs.

Without Kawhi, Beal and Jones we have seen Harden see a huge increase in points and FGA and a decrease in playmaking and assists, I expect that to stay the same here especially against a defense that allows the 3rd MOST points to PGs and ranks 7th WORST defensively versus PnR Ball Handlers.

Harden get’s a combined 60% of his assists from the RA and ATB 3’s, where the Magic rank 2nd BEST and 10th BEST defensively.

So basically both of these young players are pretty decent whipper snappers but when it comes down to it I believe Fellin is the better player on Hard courts with much more experience. I think he wins in 2 sets honestly and not to mention his name rhymes with Felon..so I have to go with the dog on this 1 guys lol.

**PSG (W) v Bayern Munich (W) (20.00 GMT)**

Bayern is a pretty decent team and only lost to Barcelona so far this season. PSG also have had to face some difficult opponents so far: Wolfsburg, Real Madrid &amp; Manchester United. But the thing is, Bayern is an opponent that we can scale at that same level of difficulty as those three teams and I don&#x27;t see PSG getting a result here either and even if they do manage to get a draw, we still cover it with this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>.

There&#x27;s also only been 3 games so far in Bayern&#x27;s season where there were less then 3 goals. And we only need 2.

NBA | Clippers vs Magic | 🏀  

Mathurin feasted yet again and has now cleared his points line every game this season, what a stud. 5-1 run

Clippers is a top matchup for guards to get their assists allowing MOST assists in the NBA to opposing PG’s. Paolo Banchero is still out for the Magic, which has led to Suggs taking a bigger facilitator role for this offense and has now gone over in 2/2 games without him so far this season with 6 &amp; 8 assists on 12 &amp; 11 potentials. In the last two games, Suggs is leading the team in Assists avg (8.0) and potentials (11.0) aswell as assists pts created (22.0), with that his minutes has increased aswell from his earlier minute limit logging 28 and 32 minutes avg 30.1 mpg compared to 21.4 mpg early on the season.

As I mentioned gets a top tier matchup to continue with his role of setting guys up, got good options in both Wagner and Bane to get the buckets against a recently poor defense without Kawhi &amp; DJJ.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s match: Milwaukee Bucks vs Philadelphia 76ers (NBA)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Sixers ML (-125, Draftkings)

Two <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>&#x27;s ago we backed the Nuggets vs the Clippers in an oddly priced line where the Nuggets were playable on just the ML alone against a terrible Clippers team who were on a 5 game loss streak and 1-9 ATS. That was mainly because they were on a b2b and on the road but it still seemed weird because the Nuggets were just the far better team in better form winning their last 5 in a row fully healthy vs a Clippers team without Kawhi. The Nuggets ended up winning by 14 which admittedly was a bit sweaty until the third quarter where they just took off.

Tonight I see similar value in this Bucks vs Sixers game, the Bucks will be without Giannis and when he is off the floor the Bucks are statistically one of the worst teams in the NBA. The Sixers will be on the second leg of a b2b and will be the away team but will most likely get fresh legs from Paul George who sat Wednesdays game out. They could potentially also get Joel Embiid back but I am not as confident as I am in him suiting up as I am Paul George who was listed as out for rest. Embiid has been practicing with the team so there definitely is a possibility he could be good to go tomorrow but I am still taking this bet assuming he won&#x27;t play.

Texans don’t have a consistent run game and mills has been throwing the ball well and feeding Colins as well as Shultz.

**NBA | Spurs @ Hawks 8:00pm EDT**

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Kelden Johnson Rebounds O 6.5 (+101), 5 units

**Write Up:** Spurs vs. Hawks have the highest rebound differential on the slate (SAS 4th highest at +5.6 and ATL 6th lowest at -4.2), so we should see more rebounds go the way of San Antonio. Additionally, Keldon Johnson has covered his rebound line in 4 out of the last 5 games, so I think the books are a little off on him. He also has cleared 6 rebounds in 6 out of his last 7 games, continuing to get more action since the beginning of the season. One of those games at 6+ was against Houston Rockets, who allow the fewest rebounds to their opponents in the NBA. Johnson is averaging 6.2 reb over the season, but his stats early season were terrible. Wemby is out (RIP), Castle is out. I think that this line at plus money is solid value.

Time to get a little sick with the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> here as these are two very bad teams. Both come in at 2-2 on the year and both have atrocious KenPom numbers. Central Michigan&#x27;s 2-2 is more attractive as it has come all against DI opposition whereas Northern Kentucky has yet to get on the board for a win against anything other than DII competition. Against their two legitimate teams Northern Kentucky shot poorly and also allowed a high FG% against them. N. Kentucky sits at 218th in FG% allowed at 44.14%. Northern Kentucky hasn&#x27;t really looked competitive yet this season and I don&#x27;t see that starting with a road game as underdogs.

Going back to Franz here as the matchup looks favorable for him to bounce back from. Last game he put up 18 pts on 7/17 shooting but that was against Draymond Green and the Warriors switching defense which really restricted his looks especially from deep. He also only attempted 4 free throws last game when he averages just over 7 with elite scoring at the line.  

The Clippers don’t have perimeter stoppers with Kawhi and Derrick Jones both sidelined so Wagner’s volume should up tick here. 

Banchero (Magics leading scorer) also remains out for this match up. Expecting Franz to bounce back giving the circumstances.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>⭐️:🏈Bills -5.5 (-120) \[Bet365\]

Start Time &amp; TV: 8:15pm EST (Amazon)

Units: 3 Units

Reasoning: Going with the Buffalo Bills (7-3) over the Houston Texans (5-5) in this Thursday Night Football contest. The Bills are coming off an explosive offensive performance in their win over the Buccaneers where they put up 44 points. Josh Allen completely turned it around from his previous outing against the Dolphins and he ran for three touchdowns and threw for three touchdowns as well. When the Bills win, they typically win by at least a touchdown with 6 out of 7 of their wins coming by at least 7 points so I like them to cover this spread of -5.5 as they are playing the Texans who will be without CJ Stroud who is out with a concussion. The Texans are coming off a win against the leagues worst Tennessee Titans where they struggled to find any offensive rhythm and could not establish the run but they squeaked by with a walk off game winning field goal. I dont think this Texans offense led by Davis Mills will be able to keep up with this high powered Josh Allen led offense and the Texans get alot of talk about their strong defense but the Bills actually rank as the leagues highest pass defense only allowing 185 passing yards per game. I think the Bills will be able to establish the run game early with James Cook as they also have the leagues best rated run games as they average over 147 yards on the ground per contest and with Gabe Davis back in the lineup for Bills I think that opens up the pass game more for the Bills.

Prediction: 31-20 Bills

**Todays Event**: 🏈 NFL Thursday Night Football Bills @ Texans 7:15 PM CST🏈

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Todays pick</mark>**: Woody Marks 15+ Receiving yards (+126 on DK) 1u to win 1.26 U

**Writeup:** Marks takes the RB1 position this week over Nick Chubb as the face Buffalo at home.  He has really been hammering his role as a dual threat up and coming rookie despite his receptions varying from game to game. He&#x27;s played 80% of the offensive snaps last week and have been climbing since week 4. Marks averages 19 receiving yards with 1.6 receptions per game.  He averages 12.2 Yards/Reception with 12.1 average YAC and his line sits at 1.5 receptions for this game, at very decent odds (-156) for the over which he&#x27;s bound to clear. The Bills tend to give half that at 6.0 YAC, which would still allow decent yardage to Marks.

 While I&#x27;m sure Marks will have his time to shine rushing the ball, he will get his share of receptions. Woody Marks averages 34.8 rushing yards he averages 3.5 yards per carry, (2.3 yards average after contact) which is still low. His line sits as 15.5 rush attempts. Now the Bills come up with the 31st ranked rushing defense in the league giving up an average of 153 rushing yards a game, a glaring hole filled with injuries. It would be a bigger concern if Texans didn&#x27;t have one of if not the worst O-line in the NFL currently. Last week Marks still only managed 44 yards in 18 carries against a pretty bad Titans defense.

 Bills are favored to win with a spread of 6.  The Bills have been looking much healthier recently and showing that they&#x27;re contenders after some ugly losses to the Dolphins and Falcons. While still going against a tough opponent like the #1 defense Texans, the Bills could still easily get an early lead, causing the Texans to reduce their run game in favor of the passing. If Allen looks anything like he did against the Bucs, this will be cemented. One thing to note is that running backs get around 23% of the total receptions against the Bills this year. With their ranked second passing defense, it&#x27;s easy to see why.  Bills give up just under 4 receptions on average per game to running backs at 3.89, on an average of 4.9 targets. Chubb has been taking less of a dual threat role with the Texans, leading to Woody getting more targets.

Davis Millis has been averaging just under 39 pass attempts per game not counting the blowout vs Baltimore where he was put in at garbage time. He is expected to pass more when playing in more competitive games which he has been. There will be no difference in competition in this Thursday night game as there has been with the Titans, Jags, and Broncos.

All it will take is one or two good passes for Marks to hit the mark. I&#x27;m expecting another break out game for our Rookie!

The Hawks and Spurs are both missing key players, and as Fox ramps back up from injury, this game is the perfect set up for him to go off in Wemby’s absence. The Grizz game he had a terrible first half but still got over his points line with a strong second half. His usage is going to be through the roof, and on most possessions he will either be driving or passing to an open man. He is averaging over 6 apg this season, and without Wemby that number is higher. The Hawks also give up a large number of board to PGs, and with Fox being the #1 option I can see him getting to 5+ with some uncontested boards. Put all this together, a fast-paced, close, high-scoring game, with Fox being the clear #1 option, and I expect he’ll get over this line.

Event: New Mexico vs Nebraska (6pm central)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Nebraska -7 (-125) (1U)

-everything is bet to win unit amount-

Write up: 

Nebraska -7 (-120) is a line that doesn’t capture the full gap between these two teams (yes I bought to -7 sue me yet again) The Huskers are averaging 89 points per game with a +22 scoring margin, while New Mexico sits at 75 points per game and a margin of just +11.5. Nebraska’s offense is built on both efficiency and volume: they rank inside the top 20 nationally in effective field goal percentage (59.4%) compared to New Mexico’s 50.2%, and they generate about three more field goal attempts per game. Add in the fact that Nebraska is shooting threes at a clip roughly 12% higher than the Lobos, and you’ve got a team that stretches defenses and consistently creates separation.

Tempo and possessions matter here too. Nebraska averages 74 possessions per game, while New Mexico is closer to 70, meaning the Huskers play faster without sacrificing efficiency. That extra pace, combined with superior shooting, translates into more scoring opportunities. On the glass, Nebraska pulls down 38.8 rebounds per game compared to New Mexico’s 36.0, with a stronger offensive rebounding rate (30.8% vs. 27.6%). Those second‑chance looks are a direct product of Nebraska’s size advantage — they can throw multiple 6’10+ bodies and even a 7‑footer at the rim, while New Mexico’s frontcourt depth doesn’t match that level of length or physicality.
Ball security is another separator. 

Nebraska’s turnover rate sits at just 10.9%, one of the lowest in the country, while New Mexico turns it over at 14%. That’s the difference between a veteran team and one still finding its footing. Nebraska’s roster is loaded with experience — Rienk Mast (6’10”), Sam Hoiberg, and other upperclassmen who’ve been through Big Ten wars — and it shows in late‑game composure. Their comeback win over Oklahoma (a team that has some real offensive talent) was a perfect example: they stayed poised, turned defense into offense, and closed strong. New Mexico, on the other hand, is under a new coach and starting two freshman guards, which is a tough ask against Nebraska’s length on the perimeter and disciplined defense.

Sharing the ball is another area where Nebraska shines. They average 20.8 assists per game, compared to just 12.8 for New Mexico. That’s not just a stat — it reflects how Nebraska’s offense functions. They move the ball, find the open man, and generate high‑quality looks possession after possession. New Mexico’s offense is more stagnant, relying on individual creation, which is harder to sustain against a structured defense with size and veteran savvy.

Defensively, Nebraska is imposing. They’re holding opponents to 41% shooting overall and under 30% from three. Nebraska’s size and length let them contest shots at the rim and close out on shooters, while their rebounding edge ensures opponents rarely get second chances. Combine that with their turnover discipline, and you get a team that controls both ends of the floor.

When you put it all together — efficiency, pace, rebounding, turnovers, assists, veteran presence, defensive reliability, and a clear size advantage — Nebraska is simply the more polished and complete team. The market hanging -7 feels short when my power ratings make this closer to -9 Nebraska’s statistical profile screams separation, and against a youthful Lobos squad still adjusting under a new coach, the Huskers should cover comfortably. Let’s get back on track, as always, cheers 🍻

Update: this line has moved from 6.5 from when I wrote it originally to now 8.5. If yall can get in at -8 I still like it as I believe Nebraska wins by 10+ or wait til possible buy back but just wanted to let yall know what was good</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Bayern Munich over 0.5 goals + FC Barcelona moneyline (-135) - 5u



**Write-up:** Similar to yesterday, I really like the odds I get with the Bayern Munich <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> and I really like Barcelona in their matchup, as well. 

Bayern have scored 6 from their 3 Champions League games and PSG have let in 8 over their 3 games. PSG have looked horrible in the Champions League this season losing all 3 matches so far. They have been against good opponents but that’s what you expect in the Champions League. Bayern on the other hand, have looked really good in the Champions League after their first defeat to Barcelona. They are also coming off a really good 3-2 win against reigning champions Arsenal. Not much of a doubt in my mind that Bayern will find the back of the net at least once in this match.

Barcelona have looked spectacular this season in domestic play and International. They sit top of the table in Spain with a near perfect 10W-0D-1L. They have scored 51 goals in those games and given up only 2! In the Champions League, Barca will go 2 points ahead of league leaders Lyon with a win tomorrow and are the only Champions League team without a loss or draw yet. Chelsea have been decent in the Champions League this season beating Paris FC and St. Polten, but showed signs of weakness in their 1-1 draw against FC Twente. Also, these teams met in the semi-final of this competition last year and Barcelona won both legs 4-1 for an aggregate scoreline of 8-2. I think this game will go similarly and Barcelona will take the 3 points and become league leaders in the Champions League.

I think Barcelona is the best team in the Champions League and I think they will show why tomorrow. I really like adding the Bayern <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> on as well, just for that boosted payout as long as they bag at least 1 goal. If Bayern score tomorrow, you’re essentially getting the Barcelona moneyline <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> at -135 and I’ll take that for sure.

I use Bovada for my picks, if you’re using something like Draftkings or Fanduel, you will definitely get worse odds on the Bayern <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> but that’s why I like the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> so much for my book.

Last Pick: Denmark vs Scotland BTTS (-125) ✅

Fixture: Petersborough United vs Stockport County | England League One | 12:00pm PST Time

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Stockport County vs Petersborough BTTS (-163)

Reasoning: League leaders Stockport County make their way to bottom of the table Peterborough United. As Peterborough is bottom of the table, a turn around for the better came around when new manager Luke Williams took charge. Since this, Petersborough has won 3 out of 3 matches under new management. The home side won their last fixture 5-0 against Wimbledon  &amp; a 2-1 victory against Cardiff in the EFL Trophy.


On the other hand, Stockport has four wins in their last five matches netting a total of 8 goals. On their last league one match they suffered a 3-0 home defeat to Luton Town. The visitors are without a clean sheet in their last six matches, a run going back to 2008. On the bright side, Stockport has the best away record in League One. With this being said, I can see a huge bounce back from their recent loss. 

Concerningly for Peterborough regardless of their positive run, they have accumulated only seven points this season at home. The second lowest amount of points in the league, only one above Port Vale’s 6 points at home. Additionally, Petersborough only has one clean sheet at home this season. 

I can see this match easily resulting in both teams to score. Two teams fighting for two different things, avoiding regulation and promotion. With that being said, Petersboroughs impressive form and Stockports solid form this season will result in a head to head match with a lot of attacking opportunities for both sides.

Ps. If you want better odds, add the (+110) odds for Stockport County ML. I myself have a bet on this but wanted my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> to be the safest option.

*Side note: I love Nico Collins tomorrow - I love Schultz tomorrow - that being said, the reason I am going with Allen and not those guys is because I think it will be a close game and I trust Allen more than I trust Mills. The former MVP has + odds to throw 2 TD&#x27;s in a primetime game - give me the + odds. What do you guys think, I am always curious to hear your thoughts.*

Other than that game, PSG hit this in tough matchups vs Real and Man United and are in need of points. Bayern have covered this line in 3/3 CL games, they allowed a goal as heavy favourites vs Juventus, and hit btts + over 2.5 in more even games such as vs Arsenal, Wolfsburg.

Write Up:  
 

I actually like the John Collins over 13.5 tonight. He’s been super steady all season nothing crazy, but he lives in that mid-teens range almost every game. The books basically set the line at his “bare minimum” effort. Even on his slower nights he’s still around 12–14, so you’re never really dead.


And the way he scores is what makes the line look good. He’s not out there chucking threes or relying on tough jumpers. Most of his buckets come from the paint cuts, rolls, putbacks the easy stuff that doesn’t really get taken away no matter who they’re playing. It’s matchup-proof scoring.


As long as he gets his usual 28–32 minutes, he should naturally land somewhere in that 14–18 range. He doesn’t need a heater to get there. It’s one of those props where you don’t have to sweat every single shot.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **Nico Collins Over 74.5 Receiving Yards (-111) 1U**

**TNF (Bills @ Texans) 8:15pm EST**

Nico Collins is the clearest advantage on the board because Mills has leaned on him heavily the past two and a half games. **Collins averages 12.5 targets and 114 yards in the last two games with Mills. Buffalo’s defense also consistently bleeds production to WR1s, allowing \~90 yards per game to the position and giving up 75+ yards in 60% of their matchups**. When you combine Mills’ tendency to lock onto a single read with Buffalo’s willingness to concede intermediate and deep outside shots, Nico becomes the focal point of Houston’s entire passing offense. The matchup, the volume, and the filters all point in the same direction, making his yardage over the most appealing line I see in this game.

Event: TNF Bills @ Texans 6:15MST

Write up:  This Thursday&#x27;s matchup has every making for a low scoring affair. There haven&#x27;t been a lot of bright spots for the Bills offense this season outside of Josh Allen willing his team down the field. Even then, his lack of weapons have even made the 2024 MVP show his fair share of struggles throughout the length of the season. This week will not be any easier for them coming off a short week, on the road and against one of the toughest defensive units in the league. This year the Bills have hit the under in 3/4 games and have averaged 24 points in those matchups.

The Texans are also a majorly struggling offense and nothing is expected to change against Buffalo. With CJ Stroud already ruled out for the game, Houston will be relying on the backup once again Davis Mills for their offensive production. The biggest weakness the Bills defense exposes to their opponents is their ability to stop the run but Houston hasn&#x27;t been able to run the ball well all season and ranks bottom 10 in every major category. This season the Texans are 3-6-1 vs. the under and have hit the over in only 1/5 of their home games this season. The Texans defense only averages a total of 16 points per game and have a total combined average of 38 points this season. 

My prediction for this game is Bills 20 Texans 16.

(PLEASE NOTE THIS IS EARLY — 08:10am UK / 3:10am EST)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>PICK</mark>: SYDNEY SIXERS W TO WIN @ 1.74 (2U)❌

WRITE UP:

Nice result last time out with a comfortable Thunder win, it was never a sweat as cricket so often is, which was nice! 

Since all of us sickos enjoyed the lane switch up, and the buzz of waking up to wins. Since the usual world of football (soccer) and rugby is quiet, I thought I’d look again at the evil beast that is cricket. At the end of the day, good value is good value. 

This one stands out more than people might expect. On paper, this looks like a tight matchup, but digging into form and bowler to batter matchups, the edge leans clearly toward the Sixers.

First off, the Sixers have been the stronger side in recent meetings, taking the majority of the last several head-to-heads. Add to that the influence of big-game players who has been consistently impactful with both bat and ball, and you’ve got a team that shows up when it matters. Bowling-wise, the Sixers also hold the advantage and their bowling attack generally trend more reliable than what the Stars have produced so far. Case and point being their ability to bowl out the thunder in the last match for only 118 runs.

Meanwhile, the Stars are heavily reliant on their star player Meg Lanning and her having a standout performance. And history shows that when a side needs one player to go big just to stay competitive, it’s always a red flag in a T20 matchup.

This is a spot where the Sixers should simply do the job. Better balance, more firepower, better recent form, home advantage and a stronger profile across the field. Confident backing them here and staking 2 units .

BOL to those tailing see you on the other side and remember to gamble responsibly!

__Event:__ NFL: Bills @ Texans 8:15pm EST

__POTD:__ Nico Collins o5.5 receptions (-120), 3.6u to win 3u

__Write Up:__ The Buffalo Bills (7-3) are traveling to Houston to take on the Houston Texans (5-5) in an AFC showdown on Thursday Night Football. Fresh off a 44 point performance in a home win vs the Bucs last week, the Bills are looking to catch up to the Patriots in the AFC East as they are 1.5 games back. The Texans are coming into this game having won 3 of their last 4 games, after starting the season 2-4. Texans starting QB CJ Stroud will now miss his 3rd straight game with a concussion. Backup QB Davis Mills has filled in for Stroud, &amp; he’s surprisingly done really well. 

Mills stepped in for Stroud &amp; led the Texans to 2 straight wins vs inter divisional opponents. In the past Mills has been the typical game-managing backup QB, but Texans Offensive Coordinator &amp; Playcaller Nick Caley is letting Mills air it out. __Mills has thrown the ball 41+ times &amp; had 274+ yards &amp; 1+ passing TD in both of his starts.__ Caley is in his first year with the Texans, having coached on offense in the past for both Bill Belichick &amp; Sean McVay. He uses a lot of schemes from both coaches, with a blend of power running mixed with play-action, RPO’s, &amp; quick passes. But the biggest strategy he has brought to this offense has been playing to the strengths of their personnel, just like he did with Sean McVay on the Rams. McVay’s offense created superstar WR’s over the years, with Cooper Kupp &amp; Puka Nacua getting pretty much 75 targets a game. The Texans coaches said a few weeks ago that they want to get Collins the ball more. They designed a game plan to make Collins the heart of the offense. Then when backup QB Mills came in, they told him to just get the ball to Nico, &amp; he did. In the 3 games Mills has played, he has targeted star WR Nico Collins an insane amount. __Nico has seen an increase of almost 10% 1st read share with Mills at QB. Collins has an incredible 36 targets over the last 3 games. He’s seen a target share of 28.2%. He’s had 7+ receptions in each of the past 3 weeks. Collins has had 10+ targets in 4 straight games. His targets over those games: 10, 15, 11, &amp; 10. Without CJ Stroud this year Collins has 3 straight games of 75+ receiving yards (75, 136, 92). With CJ Stroud he&#x27;s only had 2 games over with 75+ yards.__ Collins has been used a ton more in the slot lately, leading to a higher volume of targets &amp; much better production. __In the last 2 games, he&#x27;s been targeted 7 times from the slot, that’s more than he had in his first 7 games combined.__ In the past 2 weeks with Mills, Nico has been his go to target in critical situations. He’s found a way to sling the ball in Nico’s direction pretty much every time. Nico has also been a red zone target monster this season. __Collins is 6th in the NFL in red zone targets this year (14).__ Now he’ll face a Bills team that has been particularly weak to opposing offense’s WR1’s. __Buffalo has allowed an average of 6 receptions (4th most in NFL) &amp; 86.9 yards per game (most in NFL) to WR1’s this season.__ To keep up with this high powered Bills offense, the Texans are going to have to find ways to get it into their best playmakers hands. Mills is going to continue to target him a ton.

On the other side we have one of the best offenses in the NFL. Led by reigning NFL MVP Josh Allen, the Bills come into this one averaging 29.2 points per game (4th in the NFL). They average 6.2 yards per play (2nd in the NFL). With the Bills favored by 6 points, the Texans are going to have to air it out to keep up. Mills has thrown it 41+ times in both starts &amp; that was in games he won. In a game that they are expected to trail, he’s going to sling it. And the beneficiary of that is Nico. Nico is going to put up numbers, but I feel more comfortable with the reception line than yards.

__Nico Collins o5.5 receptions__

Sport: Tennis Tournament: Colina Challenger Time: 11:00AM EST 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Laura Pigossi ML +142 1u

Analysis: the funny thing is I actually faded Pigossi last match with two positions. Now after watching her match vs Vergara Rivera, I feel confident to back her at this price vs Jeanjean.

We really got to see a glimpse of 2021 Pigossi in her 6-1/6-1 domination of AVR. She was *blasting* her forehand and painting lines I could swear I watched 20+ winners. Only landing a rusty 42% of first serves but they were solid serves winning 83%. Probably the craziest stat of the match is AVR was able to land a *very* high 74% of first serves… the only problem for her was Locked In Laura on the other side of the net sending back *72%* of those FS’s as her own point. It was a returning masterclass as she also won 73% of second serves on return. I think Pigossi is really gonna try to make a run here in the Colina altitude.

Pigossi and Jeanjean have actually met 4 times already. JJ won all 3 of the hard court encounters while Pigossi was able to beat her on clay (same surface as <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>’s meeting) @ Buenos Aires 3 years ago.

Jeanjean is *not* impressive. Shes at best a top 75 player but at 30 years old she’s likely to plateau at the T100 mark. One things for sure tomorrow, she should *not* be a -185 favourite in this spot tomorrow. I’m not convinced she’s back. She was playing consistent tournaments until the USO (Aug,25 R1 loss to Hon {semi-lol}) and then two weeks later São Paulo (another R1 loss to Tjen{valid}). Then two weeks later shes all the way in China losing *yet another* round one. This time to Lepchenko {big lol}. She demotes herself to entering a challenger while she’s in China to only get one win (vs Inglis who was a lucky loser LOL) and then bounced in R2. She tries one more in China and it’s a big one; Guanzhou. *Take a guess what happened*… yup, ANOTHER R1 loss to Seidel (valid).
To summarize Jeanjean across the last 3 months: 
6 tournaments 
2 Wins 4 losses
*all played on hard court*
Now she’s made a successful first match transition to clay in Colina beating Riera who’s been decent recently. 
Still, ALL things considered, nothing warrants Leolia Jeanjean being a -185 favourite over Pigossi in this spot. 
Pigossi is playable all the way up until +110.
Tell me who you know confidently put a 8 win streak and 9-1 overall record on the line with a +142 ML? Thats why they NVS🌟 I’ll see you all at the cashier in 16 hours.

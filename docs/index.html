⚽ Brighton V Crystal Palace / AZ v Ajax

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: **Brighton DC + AZ to score** ⌛

Odds: 1.51

Units: [3U to win 1.53U]

**Write-Up:** 
Hello ladies and gentlemen.

Brighton only lost 1 match out of 12 at home this season and they weren&#x27;t even that bad stats wise, playing against poor and declining Palace side.
as for the other fixture AZ never or almost never fails to score a goal at home.

**Only** bet what you can afford to lose, good luck to everyone.

Football | Japan 100 Yr Vision League | Kawasaki Frontale vs Kashiwa Reysol | in \~3hrs

Parlay : Tagger ML + Kashiwa Reysol DC @ 2.28 (0.5u)

Writeup: Leg 1 - Siding with Tagger. Tactically, she&#x27;s a bad match up for Sangakew, who doesn&#x27;t have the power to break through Tagger&#x27;s defense or the serve to keep her at bay. While backing a player who had a decently long week in Dubai is risky, i think Sangakew simply doesn&#x27;t have the weapons to punish any potential fatigue. Just hoping she doesnt withdraw.

Leg 2 - Nothing much to say here. Just supporting my favorite team in Japan. Going slightly conservative since this cup really doesnt mean much &amp; most top teams will try to experiment here, so these matches are going to penalties (basically, the league stage matches also need to have a result, so we have the normal flow of FT &gt; ET &gt; Pens for every match, till we get a result)

We made it to the big game and we have two teams that I don’t suspect many teams anticipated being here. I’m on the Seahawks side here and could see them winning the 7+. Even though they’ve obviously made the SB, I haven’t been very impressed in their wins in the playoffs. This Seahawks team is different than the beat up o-line of the chargers and the inept offenses of the Texans and Broncos.

Rhamondre has been above this line in all 3 of their playoffs games this year, but it’s going to be tough to get there on Sunday. He got 25 carries in the AFC Championship game due a lot to the weather. His rush attempts line is around 15 and he will be going against the number 1 defense in the league in yard per carry to the RB position

Good Luck!</td></tr>

**Game/League/Time:** League of Legends (LOL) | LEC 2026 Versus Season | 10:45 AM EST./12:15 AM EST.

* If anyone needs help finding the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> or a place to bet esports can always reach out!
* These two lines both seem too high given the circumstances/the matchups they are in. League model putting this at 76% chance of hitting at +140 money, meaning it is incredible value/ROI play

***Baus U 2.5 Kills Map 1 (-182)*** (Teams: Vitality vs. Los Ratones)

* Baus is averaging 1.1 kills per map as top laner despite having a 50% winrate, 10th/10 top laners in the league. Baus is averaging a horrendous, -1037 XP at 15 min, and a -933 gold differential at 15 min, by far the worst metrics in the league, on top of this, teams will ban his sion every game, so he is left picking stuff he isn&#x27;t nearly as comfortable on. So far this split he has a 1/10 hitrate in maps, with a 0/5 hitrate in losses averaging 0.8 kills per map loss. Vitality are -154 favorites and I think this is a bad matchup for the rats as much as I am rooting for them. I think this line is a near guarantee in map losses, and a &lt;75% chance in map wins. Baus actually played a great lane <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, got his gragas, arguably his second best champ outside of sion which he will never get,
* For my money, **Naak Nako (Vitality top) has been the best top laner of the tournament** so far to my eye test. Naak Nako is averaging **the best GD/15, XP/15 and 3rd best CSD/15, all categories Baus is last it.** Also they should ban Sion + Gragas as Baus has looked significantly worse off of these two and has had two very strong gragas games and force him back on the things he struggles on. Naak Nako leads the LEC for top laners in solo kills with 6, this is a disaster matchup can&#x27;t stress it enough
* Lifetime Baus has a 1/27 hitrate in map losses, this is gonna be his hardest lane yet imo, I think <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> SK showed what NOT to do against Ratones, by picking a tank top laner and not punsihing Baus, expecting this to change tomorrow and Naak Nako and Vitality to play heavily thru top, if Ratones will win, it will be because of Nemesis/Crownie as most of their wins have been, think Vitality will stomp Ratones

***Wunder U 4.5 Kills Map 1 (-182)*** (Teams: SK Gaming vs. Shifters)

* The model didn&#x27;t see the vision on this line at first until I fed it more data, this is why stats without context arent&#x27; always good. Wunder is leading all top laners in kills at 3.5 kills per map, and has had the second best laning stats in the LEC, despite this, a 4.5 kill line for any top laner is absolute insanity which I will break down a bit more below. As for Wunder though, his kill average is driven way up by two double digit kill games, with 10 kills on Kennen and 11 kills on Rumble. Despite this inflated line, Wunder is averaging just 3.5 kills per map this split, this is the highest, with only 3/12 top laners in the LEC averaging &lt; 3 kills per map
* Wunder took 2025 off, but for extra data, can go back to 2024, Wunder averaged 1.9 kills in 45 maps played, with a 40% winrate overall. During this time, Wunder had a 0/27 hitrate in map losses, and a 1/18 hitrate in map wins. Giving him a combined 1/45 hitrate in 2024, and a 0/7 hitrate in map losses this split and 2/3 hitrate in wins. Combined 3/55 hitrate last 2 years, and 0/34 in map losses
* For top lane kill averages, in the 4 major regions for league, there are 44 top laners, only 1/44 top laners is averaging 4.5 kills (Kiin, with a 100% winrate), only 1 other is averaging 4 kills, 42/44 top laners are averaging &lt;4 kills, 34/44 top laners are averaging kills, on top of this, a portion of top lane meta right now is tanks, if any tank is locked in, this line is a near guaranteed under off the bat, no matter win or loss. Ksante is a tank with a bit more kill threat, rumble is a kill threat, then Sion is third who is another tank meaning 2/3 of the most played top laners are tanks, in total so far in LEC, tanks have made up \~42% of top laners picked this split so far
* SK are eliminated from playoffs, Shifters are technically still in all tho the road is hard. I favor them in this matchup, think bot matchup in particular is very favorable</td></tr>

**Write Up:** Love the look of this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. Real Madrid really don&#x27;t enjoy playing at the Mestalla, having **won just one out of their last three games** there. Not only that, but they&#x27;re **missing so many key players** for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>&#x27;s matchup. **Vinicius, Rodrygo and Bellingham are all out.** Madrid keep playing very stiff, uncreative football, **needing a 100th minute penalty to bail them out against Rayo.** Valencia aren&#x27;t exactly a powerhouse, but they have enough quality about them to shut out the guests <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.

Valencia&#x27;s LaLiga form is nothing to write home about, but they&#x27;ve seen an uptick in the recent results with **two wins in their last three outings.** I think everything points towards a draw here, but just in case Real Madrid pull off some weird 90th minute VAR assisted magic, I&#x27;m going with the +0.5, +1.0 AH.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s pick</mark> (five units) Patriots team total rushing yards over 108.5 (-120 on Bet365)

They’ve hit this 4 out of their last five regular season games, over against the Chargers and Broncos, and 105 vs the Texans. For those eight games, they are averaging 154 rushing yards per game. Vrabel wants to control the clock. Stevenson and Maye have showed this playoff that they can be relied on to run, so why not take one of their player props? Henderson has the home run potential as he may be the fastest player on the field (hit over 22 mph on multiple runs this year). I can see the Seahawks stuffing the box against the Patriots. Henderson has been a non-factor in the playoffs, making him an intriguing play for the Super Bowl (especially if he gets good yards on his first few touches). Seahawks allow 92 yards a game against the run, which ranks very high in the league. I’m just betting that the game stays close enough that Vrabel calls a few extra run plays and they can get those 17 extra yards.</td></tr>

Time: 9:00 AM EST

​<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Tundra -1.5 Maps @ 2.07 odds (5u)

​Write Up:

The mid lane match-up here is a mismatch. Heroic is fielding a 16-year-old rookie, TaiLung, who looked fine against a lower-tier team, but <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> he has to lane against bzm, one of the best midlaners in the world. In a high-pressure elimination series, Tundra’s veteran squad is going to target the rookie, pressure him early, and force him to crumble.

On top of the skill gap, Tundra has a massive tactical advantage. While Heroic was scrapping for their lives against Rekonix and showing all their strategies, Tundra was resting and watching their games. They already beat Heroic comfortably in the Group Stage earlier this week, proving that Tundra&#x27;s disciplined, suffocating playstyle is the perfect counter to Heroic&#x27;s chaotic brawling.

We are backing the more disciplined team to handle business again. Tundra 2-0.

SILKEBORG VS VIBORG

Date: 08 FEBRUARY 2026 at 14:00

BET ON: Over / Under team- VIBORG Over +1.50

Odd: 1.93



\- Ahead of the derby, both coaches have signalled an attacking approach rather than caution, which points toward a match with space and scoring opportunities. Silkeborg coach Kent Nielsen has openly highlighted the team’s many “offensive essences” in his pre-match press build-up, naming several attacking profiles and making it clear that Silkeborg intend to play proactively at home despite their defensive issues this season. With Silkeborg needing points to stay clear of the relegation battle, a passive setup is unlikely. From Viborg’s side, motivation is just as strong: they sit only two points from the Top 6 and face a brutal upcoming schedule, making this a game where they must push for a win. Tactically, the matchup favors Viborg scoring multiple times. Silkeborg’s possession-based 4-3-3/4-2-3-1 under Nielsen involves high full-backs and aggressive positioning between the lines, a structure that has repeatedly left space in transition. Viborg are well suited to exploit this, sitting compact before attacking vertically through quick combinations and wide overloads into the channels behind Silkeborg’s advanced defenders. With Silkeborg unlikely to abandon their proactive style and Viborg confident after a strong winter and positive test matches, the tactical and motivational setup strongly supports Viborg scoring two or more goals, making Over 1.50 goals a compelling angle.

 big with a five unit play, and we am going with Brondby to win.

Brondby have 5 wins, 1 draw and 3 losses so far this season and Randers are 2W 2D 5L. This is the first game of the season and I think brondby is going to come out with a win. Before season ended before christmas, Randers lost 3, won 1 where the other team had a red card and a draw.

Its not proud to bet on the rivals, but they have outclassed everybody in this window and expecting big movements from them as they have quality players now.</td></tr>

Writeup : Liquid and Tundra are both favourites to win their games. Liquid has played against Gamerlegion a lot of times and has never conceded any map; their record has been 3-0 against GL in recent tournaments. I don&#x27;t see them losing any map tomorrow. They also already played during the group stage, and it was a 26-minute stomp. Heroic on the other hand, is a very inconsistent and unpredictable team, but they barely won against a tier 3 SEA team. I don&#x27;t see Tundra losing against Heroic.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Roberto Carballes Baena vs Mees Rottgering | **Carballes Baena ML at -185 (DK). 1 unit.**

Write-up: Seems like parlaying heavy favorites was not a popular move, but it ended up working out fairly well. Bublik got an easy 6-0, 6-3 win to start, and later in the day Gojo finished things off after moving from -364 to -453 pre-match. 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>, I&#x27;m fading the 18-year-old local talent Mees Rottgering in a situation where I see him being overmatched. Rottgering did really well to get past Kyrian Jacquet after being bageled in the first set, but his performance rating came in at just 6.31/10. Roberto Carballes Baena may not be a natural hard-court player, but he does have experience in all conditions, and he already scored a nice win over Pablo Carreño Busta with a 7.16/10. Another factor to consider is that Jacquet was a much bigger favorite than RCB is here, even though I don&#x27;t see a huge level gap between them. Even if Rottgering has a strong serve and overall game for his age, he still doesn&#x27;t feel fully developed as a player, and I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s going to cut it against someone like RCB. These courts are indoors, but they don&#x27;t play lightning-fast, and that works to the benefit of the more consistent Spaniard.</td></tr>

**CET 12:15 Football Eredivisie**

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>: Utrecht vs **Feyenoord -1 handicap** at **4,2** odds

Explanation: I want to start first by saying that we lose if Feyenoord wins with only one goal. So there is no push/void here. The second point is the odds being really weird here. Feyenoord have a huge motivation to win this game, sure it’s an away game. They are aiming for second place on the table, which gives direct Champions League placement. Utrecht on the other hand, seems to sit safe from relegation so far. The thing is that Feyenoord won the last two away games vs Utrecht and this handicap hit. Another weird thing here is the fact that the odds are so high for Feyenoord just to win at 2,17 (time of writing). That’s just ridiculous in my opinion. Either they know something which we don’t or they completely misplaced the odds. I’m thinking the latter and I’ll gladly take those 4,2 odds with a handicap on. 



Not much to say besides Feyenoord being the stronger team here and having the potential to completely outplay their opponents in this league. The exceptions are of course PSV and Ajax, who usually finish on the top every year. Handicap results here are quite common just like in the Portuguese league, where a gap between the top and the rest seems to remain.



I’m trying to keep track of the results in all the top leagues. I had way too many games to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> from Sunday, and honestly almost got a headache from trying to choose one. My goal is to have something around the 3x odds barrier or higher. This one qualified well and we will **always aim for** **long term** gains. I will try to post another <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> in the coming days. Seems like a good week is coming, with lots of league football to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> from. Good luck everyone.

<tr><td class='post'>**POTD Record:**  109 – 74 - 12

**Previous:**  Hearts Draw-no-bet &amp; Albacete vs Barcelona Over 2.5 total cards - LOSS

**New Event:**  The Superbowl – Seattle vs New England

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:**  Kenneth Walker III Over 20.5 Receiving Yards @ 1.95 (5 units)

**Warning:** I am 4-5-1 (W/L/D) in my last 10.  Worst streak ever in 195 picks here on <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>.  Everything is fine, except when I post it.  So do not tail me blindly, do your research and please bet responsibly.

“If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it”.  This is the same prop bet with the same yardage line and even the same odds that we won with in the divisional playoff game against the Rams where walker had 49 receiving yards.  Charbonnet is still out for the Seahawks and Walker has been the beneficiary of this extra load not only with more rushes, but he has become the go to checkdown receiver which easily got us over this line and will do so again. 

The Patriots pose a different challenge as their run defense is pretty damn good.  So good in fact that clashing with the Seahawks own defense may result in a lackluster defensive boring game where yards are hard to come by while punts abound.  Well, that seems to be what everyone is thinking so chances are we will probably see something else.

In either case, Walker eats.  No point repeating all the stats leading up to the first <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, since nothing has changed other than the opponent.  But if anyone wants to see them, here is the link to the original WINNING <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> post.  [First Ken Walker Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/comments/1qm1kn8/comment/o1k3bmf/?context=3&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)

Here are a few more:

* Patriots defense regularly gives up yards to running backs in the flat because they have successfully contained them limiting yards after the catch.
* Since week 16, Seahawks’ running backs averaging 54 receiving yards per game.
* The Seahawks rank #2 in running back target teams in the NFL ahead of the Detroit Lions and just behind the Atlanta Falcons.
* Sam Darnold has been targeting his RB’s on early downs to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> up short yardage, and allow more discretion on 2^(nd) and 3^(rd) downs to target downfield receivers. This may hold especially true with the Patriot’s defensive that will most definitely be pressuring Darnold all day.</td></tr>

Sweden are facing France <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, the same France that let Italy score 4 goals on them. The same Italy that Sweden just beat 6-1.

SB LX New England Patriots vs Seattle Seahawks 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: 1Q u7.5 (-115)

Write Up: Super Bowls tend to start slow. Super Bowls tend to start even slower when it is between two QBs unfamiliar with big game environments. Seattle and New England’s strengths lie within their defensive units. Expect this facet of the game to prevail early while both teams get a feel for each other before scheming kill shots. #Pray4Punts

Last Pick: Lens ML @ 1.68 ✅

Last Pick Write Up: That red card freaked me out a bit, but we got that win. Now I’ve got to hold that 2:1 W/L ratio!

Now for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>..

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Inter win &amp; Real Madrid to score @1.66

Write Up:

Is the superbowl tomorrow? Anyways.. we are doing soccer.

Six wins in a row. Now for tomorrow.

Sassuolo (11th place) hosts Inter (top of the league). Inter do well away, with 9W0D2L, while Sassuolo is mid at home with 4W2D5L - so the top team is meeting a meh one, and should deliver a win.

Real Madrid have been delivering some annoying draws away, but they almost alway score and should pop at least one goal here to get us better odds.

BOL!

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Semenyo To Score or Assist (+145) 1 unit to win 1.45 units

**Write Up:** Running this play back as we&#x27;re taking Semenyo to score or assist in the match of the weekend. Liverpool and City, two giants of the EPL, are set to square off at Anfield after the reverse fixture in Manchester went 3-0 in favor of City. 

Semenyo has scored in his last 2 EPL matches and 4/5 in all comps. He has really hit his stride since joining City and has had great link up play with Haaland. I&#x27;m again buying down the juice of just ATGS, even though I think that to be the most likely cash, because I think he may wind up in a position to provide an assist to Haaland. Semenyo also scored 2 goals at Anfield earlier in the season while he was still with Bournemouth, so he knows how to beat this Liverpool defense on the road. 

BOL and happy Sunday!</td></tr>

5 Points separate these teams in the table, Western Sydney are starting to drop behind the rest of the pack and dropping points at home will see that continue to stretch. Considering the lack of ability to keep a clean sheet in both sides I see an end to end result here.

**Last 9 games:**

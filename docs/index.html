Last Pick: Louisville @ Tennessee Under 158.5 (-110) (1U) ✅

Event: Oilers vs Bruins  (NHL) (6pm central)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Over 6.5 (+100) (1U) 

Write up:
Both teams come into this non conference matchup on absolute fire. Theo bruins have won 4 out of their last 5 and have scored at least 4 goals in every win. Their lone loss was a 6-2 defeat in Minnesota. The Oilers have won 3 out of their last 5 posting at least 4 goals in 1 of those theee and 6 in the other two. In their two losses they allowed 4 goals in both. In their last 10 games they both rank 3rd and 4th in goals for and although Boston has allowed the 11th best goals they are expected to allow the 3rd worst mark in hockey. This is likely because they have allowed the second most shots on goal over their last 10 in the league. Both teams are also top 5 in shooting percentage over their last 10 and both are also top 5 in high danger shots for, while the bruins have allowed the 3rd most high danger shots over that same span. The bruins are 19-15 to the over and the oilers are 19-14 to the over but both have cashed this line in 3 out of their last 5. This will also be the oilers 4th game in 6 nights and they could have some tired legs. I think at even money this over is a great bet. As always, cheers 🍻

<tr><td class='post'>NBA <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> 14-11

Last Pick: **Josh Giddey over 7.5 Assists,** ends up with 11 Assists plenty of opportunities to have more as well.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **Kawhi Leonard under 24.5 Points**

This one is more of a gut-based read than a numbers-driven play, but the setup is worth talking through. Injury-wise, Oklahoma City Thunder are missing both Jaylin Williams and Isaiah Hartenstein, which likely pushes them into smaller lineups. With Chet Holmgren not being a traditional center, that opens up concerns about interior presence and theoretically gives Kawhi Leonard space to operate, especially if he looks to attack downhill.

However, the other side of the matchup introduces real resistance. James Harden being out simplifies Oklahoma City’s defensive priorities, allowing Luguentz Dort to lock in on Kawhi as the primary assignment, with help and doubles likely coming behind it. If Leonard is operating mostly at small forward, OKC ranks **top two in the league at defending SFs**, and they have the depth of perimeter defenders to rotate bodies at him all night.

Game script also matters. The spread sitting around **-18.5** raises legitimate blowout risk. Even if Kawhi starts well, reduced fourth-quarter minutes become a concern if the game gets out of hand early.

Looking at recent performances, Leonard’s biggest scoring nights have tended to come against fast-paced or structurally compromised defenses. He’s had success against teams like the Miami Heat and New Orleans Pelicans, and he’s also scored well against slower teams like the Portland Trail Blazers, Phoenix Suns, and Dallas Mavericks. But context matters in each case. Dallas and Phoenix were severely depleted in the frontcourt, and Portland lacked their usual perimeter stopper, which softened the defensive matchups Leonard faced.

To be clear, Kawhi is a championship-level scorer and absolutely capable of attacking a team missing size. That upside is real. But when you combine elite perimeter defense, likely doubles, a heavy spread, and blowout risk, **24.5 points feels a touch inflated** for this specific environment.

It’s not a hard fade, but relative to other spots on the board, this one feels more fragile than the number suggests.</td></tr>

Write-Up: Shakhtar is one of the best teams in the tournament (2nd right now) and they are facing a Croatian team who has had mixed results. Shakhtar doesn’t have any other games that I can tell, so they can go full power here, and they have been performing well. When fully fit, they have one of the better squads in the tournament.

With Shakhtar playing at home, I don’t see them doing anything but winning this one, however I’m not confident they will win by any more than 1 which is why I’m taking the ML here.

Start time: 8:00 PM Eastern Standard Time on ESPN+

Missouri Valley conference play BA-BAY!

Racers come into this home matchup 8-3 holding fourth place in the Mountain Valley Conference. They are coming off of a victory at home against a GOOD Akron team 115-100, and their previous three games were a victory at home against Bellarmine, Morehead State, George Washington.

The Drizzy Drake Bulldogs are 6-5 this season currently in seventh place in the Mountain Valley Conference. They are coming off of a home loss to North Dakota State. 

The difference: The Racers average 91 PPG on nearly 50% shooting from the field. Drake ain’t got those horses. Averaging 80 PPG on 47% shooting the Bulldogs are gonna get ran outta the gym. Let’s race past em!!

Write Up: With Connor Bedard out until the new year, the blackhawks look to regress heavily on offense. The Canadiens look to ride a solid start to the season and play defensively sound hockey that should perform even better against a Blackhawks roster missing their most essential and dynamic player. Factor in the home-ice advantage for the Canadiens, and the Blackhawks are going to have a tough time matching their game.</td></tr>

**Last Pick**: Manchester City Moneyline + Goal Range: 2-4 vs. Brentford 2u ✅

Shocking that people in the replies genuinely thought City wouldn&#x27;t win at home against a bad Brentford team but hey, their loss. Solid win yet again.

**Event**: Italy Super Cup: Napoli vs. AC Milan 11:00am PST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>**: AC Milan Draw no Bet (-120) 2u

**Write up**:

Milan have been superb this season, only losing 1 of their last 15 games in all competitions (being their elimination from the Coppa Italia). Milan are 4-3-1 away from home this season, with the loss also being the Coppa game. With it looking likely that Inter take the Serie A this season, Milan will be looking for a way to get some form of silverware this season. They are the best team away from home in Serie A this season, only conceding 5 goals in their 7 away matches. I do see Milan winning this game but given it is a cup game AND it is away from home, there is a chance Napoli drag it past regular time. Like the DnB for this safety.

On the other hand we have a Napoli side that have been plagued with injuries this season. Missing two of their starting midfielders (de Bruyne and Anguissa) the crazy start they had to the season has not continued. Although they are **7**\-3-0 at home across all competitions, their only real challenge was Inter (that game was played with both injured midfielders fit at the time). Napoli have lost their last 2 games and look like a shell of the team that started off the season so incredibly. They average about 1.73 goals per match at home, and although I do feel like Milan advance, Napoli&#x27;s home form worries me a bit for the regular time result.

Also, earlier this season AC Milan beat Napoli 2-1 (with Napoli being fully healthy at the time). Milan were up 2-0 before a brutal red card and conceded penalty giving Napoli their 1 goal of the game.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Crystal Palace TT Goals Over 2.5  (+100) 1 unit to win 1 unit

**Write Up:** These cup game rosters have been extra unpredictable this year. Haaland never saw the pitch so he voided, and the Man City ML leg won so we technically cashed, just with lower odds. A win is a win though! (I&#x27;ve recorded this as a win om my record and reduced the avg odds accordingly to the leg that won).

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> we&#x27;ve got a European Conference League Match where EPL side Crystal Palace host Finnish side KuPS. I&#x27;m going to be honest, I had to look this club up. They are the 1st place Finnish league team from last season. They&#x27;ve had an okay start to Conference League, going 1-3-1. These Scandinavian clubs are tough to place, since their league takes place spring-fall and they&#x27;re technically off season. Are they rested and play well? Are they rusty? Anyways, I really don&#x27;t see them being a match for Palace <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.

Rather than trying to predict lineups again, I&#x27;m going with a total goals play as I think regardless of who plays for Palace, they will score a lot of goals here. They&#x27;re due for a bounce back game after a tough loss to Man City over the weekend and I am expecting them to let off some steam on this Finnish team. Palace are 3-0-2 thus far in Conference League and will need to do better to secure their position in the bext round. In their last 3 matches, they&#x27;ve score 3-1-3 goals, their dud being away against 1st place Strasborg. I like Palace at home here to score 3-4 goals.

Rayo have covered in 5/5 games in the Conference League, best corner generating team in La Liga. Rayo have to win to guarantee their spot in the top 8 in the league phase. Drita might be good in the top 24, but they can try to get something here as a win might put them in the top 8, whereas a draw pretty much secures top 24, so incentive is there for both sides. Drita played some pretty weak sides in the league phase, so they covered in just 2/5 games vs Shkendija (12 total, 10 allowed) and AZ (10 total, 6 allowed). Drita allow a lot of corners when travelling, they allowed 6 to Shelbourne, 7 and 9 to Differdange, 18 to FCSB, 6 to Copenhagen. I&#x27;m taking the total for both instead of just Rayo because if Rayo score, Drita can also get some corners as they did vs AZ.</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>**POTD Record:**  101 – 63 - 10

**Previous:**  EFL Cup - Man City -1 Asian Handicap vs Brentford – WINNING!

**New Event:**  UEFA Conference League – Crystal Palace vs KuPS &amp; Sparta Praha vs Aberdeen

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:**  Crystal Palace -1 (1.35) &amp; Sparta Praha -1 (1.3) Asian Handicap @ 1.73 (Usual 3 units)

For background informational purposes, this will be the last phase matchday of the UEFA Conference League comprised of 36 teams of which the top 8 will automatically move on to the Round of 16, while teams in 9^(th) through 24^(th) places will go to playoffs to determine which additional 8 teams will make the Round of 16. 

**LEG 1:** Crystal Palace -1 vs KuPS 

Palace sit 9^(th) in the table.  One spot right outside the top 8 qualification spots and will be at home hosting 25^(th) placed KuPS which also sits 1 spot outside a chance to go to playoffs.  So both teams have something to play for.  However, KuPS have played 5 games so far against teams currently sitting in 16^(th), 18^(th), 19^(th) 27^(th), and 31^(st) places.  They have yet to face a top side in this tournament and Crystal Palace, currently 5^(th) in the top Premier League, will be an opponent far outside their normal rivals. 

I see no issues for Palace to provide a spanking to KuPs by multiple goals at home and make it to the top 8.  Should they only win by 1, it’s a push.

**LEG 2:** Sparta Praha -1vs Aberdeen

Similar story to Leg 1. Sparta are 6^(th) and in a 5 way tie with 10 points to make the top 8.  They are home and hosting 33^(rd) place Aberdeen who are eliminated from the competition.  Sparta have to win as they do not know what the outcomes of the other matches may be.  There are 3 points separating 20 teams at the moment and the simulcast should be crazy with last minute dramatics in all the matches.  Nevertheless, Aberdeen have been terrible thus far and will most likely not have much fight left if any. 

Again, I see no issues for Sparta to secure their place in the top 8 playing at home against an already defeated Aberdeen.  Should they only win by 1, it’s a push as well.</td></tr>

Breidablik Asian Handicap +2 @ 1.84 (1u)

Write Up : Just been in a rut of losses but i guess this is the way betting goes &amp; i gotta keep trying to get back to winning. 

Looking at the Conference league <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. 2 teams here <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, who cant be more opposite in terms of situation in this competition. Strasbourg is on top of the table, and have qualified to the next round while the visitors need a win to atleast have hopes of qualifying to the next round.

Stasbourg are in pretty bad form, having won just once in their last four games. That win was against Aberdeen by 1:0. Looking at their matches, they usually dont win by huge margins, especially in Europe.

Breidablik, meanwhile, are only playing Conference League games since their domestic season is over. But, they are doing a decent job at the moment, winning four points in the last two games vs Shamrock Rovers and Samsunspor. Also, they only lost once by more than two goals in five Conference League games this season.

Considering Strasbourg already secured the 1/8 Finals and may probably look to rest key players to focus on the domestic league (where they are struggling), i think the team from Iceland may surprise us (hopefully in a good way). Going with the +2 Asian Handicap, where a loss of 2 will atleast give a refund

*Note : As you can see the stats, Ive been on a 2 game losing streak, so do be careful before tailing me*

Write-up: The betting Gods have given me a break with a sweat-free play. Vegas called and told me they were bankrupt after that. On a real note though I’m happy to have given something back to those who have been tailing and supporting amidst the dire form, fingers crossed we kick on now. Vakifbank unsurprisingly won in straights but they were each contested enough to reach 146 points (23-25, 24-26, 23-25). Aras really should’ve won a set but masterfully choked especially in those first two.

I feel like these picks are getting more obscure by the day and you know what, I’m personally absolutely loving it. The Israeli Women Premier league is back for the first time since 2022 🔥. I’ve been eagerly anticipating its return just like we surely all have. We’re eight matches into the season with the home team Nazareth sitting in 9th spot (out of 11) and Hadera in second. The sample size may not be massive but there are still some nice trends that have started to develop. After a start to the season that saw the hosts lose 5 in a row they’ve started to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> up form with two wins and three competitive sets against top of the league Ashdod. They have nevertheless cleared the line in their last 7 matches including the 5/5 they have played at home this season. Hadera meanwhile have been off to a flier with 7 wins of 8 (only losing to Ashdod). They have covered the over in 5/5 away matches played this season and their last 5 total matches. BOL !

I was expecting a higher total in this game between two 11 win teams and I think we will get it. Even without Davonte, I expect this offense to be moving the ball, especially with their RB duo.

As far as Seattle goes, they’ll have to pass due to the Rams excellent run defense and their running game hasn’t been that great as of late. That could open up more opportunities for points and the Rams defense can be beat through the air, which you saw last week with Amon Ra and Jameson Williams.

For Thursday Night Football, we have a potential NFC Championship preview in the Rams vs Seahawks. These are two of the best three teams in the sport and will likely determine the winner of the division. These teams have absolute superstars on both sides of the ball and should be a really exciting game. However, we do have some injuries to mention. The Rams will be without their top endzone threat in Davante Adams, and the Seahawks will be without their starting left tackle in Charles Cross.

Over the last few weeks, the Rams have been running a ton of 13 personnel, meaning 3 tight ends on the field. Starting tight end Tyler Higbee has been out for a while now, so tight ends like Parkinson have been getting a ton more playing time. Since November 9th, even with Davante Adams getting so many of the redzone looks, Parksinson has scored 6 touchdowns in 6 games, with only one of those games not having a score. On top of this, while the Seahawks defense has been one of the best in the league, they are quietly one of the worst defenses against the tight end position.

Now with Davante Adams out, Parkinson should see even more action in this game, and especially in the redzone. He should score in this one.

I know i&#x27;ve done this exact <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> in the past this season but it&#x27;s looking too good to pass up.  A divisional game where two teams with good defenses have to win to get control of the bloodbath that is the NFC West and to keep 1 seed hopes alive. 

**Writeup:** Lets start with the obvious. Jason Myers has been one of if not the best kicking performers this season. He&#x27;s averaging 10.9 kicking points a game and is on route to break the regular season points scoring record, being just 33 points behind LaDainian Tomlinson&#x27;s 186 point record. Now the forecast is looking like it will be a very windy game, but they&#x27;re looking to be Headwinds/Tailwinds, the former of which would help Myers. He will be utilized this game.

As mentioned earlier, this is a divisional game between two teams with solid defenses, and pretty stellar offenses. While being good, the Seahawks haven&#x27;t always been consistent in the red zone, not helped by the fact that Rams have one of the best red zone defenses in the league. Their third down conversion rate is sitting pretty low at just under 38%

 The lines for this game are very slim with the Seahawks being favored at -1.5. From what it&#x27;s looking like, Field Goals will be the difference. No doubt these teams will take every opportunity they can to get points. Two field goals and two extra points (which Seahawks are expected to score twice as their game line is at 2.5 touchdowns). 

Bless a good Thursday night game and Best of Luck to everyone tailing!</td></tr>

Short , sweet and simple . CP -1.5 is solid. Palace’s chance creation at home is clear big xG edge, higher tempo, and far more depth even with rotation. KuPS struggle badly away in Europe (low possession, low shots, under 1.0 xG avg) and don’t have the attacking tools to chase if they concede. Once Palace go ahead, this opens up clear path to cover -1.5 .</td></tr>

Odds: -122 on FanDuel
Wager: 1.5 Units

Record: 6-5
Net Units: + 0.5✅

⚽️AC Milan vs Napoli, 12/18/2525 Thur, 2 pm Eastern Time

Explanation: AC Milan can qualify on Thursday vs Napoli because they have been more reliable and they have a cleaner path to controlling the match—even on neutral ground in the Supercoppa Italiana semi-final. Napoli is coming off a disappointing 1–0 loss at Udinese, while Milan is coming off a 2–2 draw vs Sassuolo, but the bigger picture is that Milan’s league profile is extremely steady: through 15 Serie A matches they’re 9W–5D–1L with 24 scored, 13 conceded (32 points), and their underlying shot/chance balance is strong (+6.4 on shots and +0.43 on shot-differential per match per FBref), which usually translates into fewer “bad” game states.  

The expected-goals data supports that Milan is creating at an elite level: Milan is at 24.76 xG on the season (2nd in Serie A) with 16.85 xGA, while Napoli sits below them in xG creation, implying Milan’s attack is producing more repeatable chances and isn’t as dependent on finishing spikes. 

Also, the teams have already played this season with Milan winning 2–1, and Milan has tended to be more solid in big games, so if this turns into a tight, tactical game where one sequence decides it, Milan’s proven ability to manage their opponents gives them a very real chance to qualify.</td></tr>

Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Lions at Rams NFL 16:25pm (EST) **Stafford + Goff over 525 yards passing (-137) 5U** ✅

Easy cash as Stafford and Goff combine for over 700+ yards through the air. For anyone who, as suggested, laddered (550/575/600/625/650/675/700)– you did very very well.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** NFL Rams at Seahawks TNF 8:15pm (EST) **Puka + JSN over 175 receiving (-156) 3U**

Puka and JSN are by far and away the two most dominant WR in the NFL. They lead the league in receiving yards/game (JSN: 110, Puka: 105). The next closest is London at 90. That combines for 215+ yards/game receiving.

They lead all WR in Big Plays – receptions of 20+ (JSN: 25, Puka:23). Again the next highest is J. Williams at 19. They own the lion’s share of targets and air yards on the rams and seahawks and Devante Adams is in all likelihood gonna miss this one. SEA allow the third fewest RB rush yards (73/game) while RAMS allow 6^(th) fewest (77/game). Last time these two teams met this line hit: Puka went 7/75 (despite Stafford throwing for only 130 yards) while JSN went 9/105 (despite 4 interceptions from Darnold). Last two weeks, Puka hit (181) and nearly hit (167 yards) this line all by himself. Latest forecast (though its Seattle so things can change) shows rain ending by 3pm.  

Its gonna be a fierce game with huge playoff implications. Rams squeaked by 21-19 largely due to Darnold INT’s. Expecting a close game again. My bet is whoever is trailing in late third/early fourth will tilt toward pass, pushing either JSN or Puka over 100-110+ if they’re not already there. Then, all the other guy needs for this to hit is 65-75 yards. In Draftkings, you can find this bet under Receiving --&gt; Combined Receiving Yards --&gt; **Puka Nacua + Jaxon Smith-Njigba 175+ Yards**. If you want better odds you can go O 189.5 (-112) or ladder to 200+ (+114)

Event: TNF Rams @ Seahawks 6:15MST

Write Up: With the most recent weather forecast moving into Seattle, my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> for this game was a tough decision. With a chance of rain and heavy winds up to 20MPH, my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> has shifted from JSN receiving yards to Kyren Williams rushing for the over.

During their week 11 matchup against Seattle, Williams rushed 12 times for 91 yards and proved to be a very effective piece in the offense in that game. Over their last 3 games, Los Angeles has ranked 3rd in the league for rushing yards with 186.7, while ranking 4th on the season in away games with 142.7.

Kyren Williams has hit this rushing number in 11/14 games this season and has 70+ yards in 3 straight. Even though his snap share with Blake Corum has almost been cut to an even 50/50, Williams has continued to perform well during his opportunities and his numbers have not reflected on the snap count.

Although Seattle has shown to be one of the best run defending teams in the league, I trust Sean McVay will effectively scheme his offense to be successful on the ground when passing will be somewhat limited with Davante Adams banged up and the weather being what it is.

__Event:__ NFL: Rams @ Seahawks 8:15pm EST

__POTD:__ Rashid Shaheed o34.5 receiving yards (-110), 3.3u to win 3u

__Write Up:__ I can confidently say one has watched Rashid Shaheed since he joined the NFL more than I have. I’m the Commish of a 14 year fantasy football league that gives points for kick/punt return yards (shoutout FDS). As one of the best returners in the league, I have heavily followed &amp; studied Rashid Shaheed since he came into the league in 2022. He’s been on my roster every year &amp; has been one of the most valuable players in the league. Despite him starting my fantasy lineup in the playoffs this week, this is isn’t a biased play. I actually preferred Colby Parkinson ATTD (+230) as my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> but <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> rules won’t allow plays over +200 odds. A tear is brought to my eye that after these years, 97 <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> writeups, Shaheed finally has made his way here, the beautiful butterfly can finally spread his wings for the world to see. Great player, great recent results, great game script. Shaheed was traded from the Saints to the Seahawks last month, &amp; boy do they have a big game vs the Rams this week.

The (11-3) Seattle Seahawks host the (11-3) LA Rams at Lumen Field on Thursday Night Football in a huge intra-divisional matchup. These 2 teams are currently tied &amp; battling for the top spot in the NFC West. Both teams enter this game 8-1 straight up &amp; 7-2 against the spread over their last 9 games. This is their 2 matchup in a little over a month, with the Rams winning at home 21-19. But that final score doesn’t show how dominant Seattle was driving the ball downfield. The Seahawks out-gained the Rams by 165 yards &amp; had a 26-12 first down differential. The issue was Seahawks QB Sam Darnold threw 4 interceptions &amp; their was horrible playcalling the red zone as Seattle only scored a TD on 1 trip of their 4 chances. That was the Seahawks only loss in their last 9 games. __As for the Rams they have been rocking &amp; rolling since then, with 40+ points &amp; 500+ yards in back to back games. They have been on fire at the end of the regular season the past few years with an elite December record going 17-3 ATS, including 2-0 ATS this year. The Rams are also dominating on the road, having gone 11-2 ATS in their last 13 games &amp; 17-5 ATS overall since December 1, 2024.__ The reason I’m adding this to a Seattle WR’s prop write-up, is opposing offenses have to sling it in order to keep up with the Rams high powered offense. But Seattle has been great lately as well. __Seattle has won its last 4 home games by an average margin of 14.5 points per game.__ We have 2 QB’s that are playing at a high level &amp; sling it. This has resulted in both of their leading WR’s pending the league in receiving yards, with Seahawks Jaxon Smith-Njigba &amp; Rams Puka Nacua ranking 1st &amp; 2nd in the NFL this season. The last December or later matchup between the NFL’s top 2 WR’s was Week 16, 2021, when Rams Cooper Kupp (now on Seahawks) defeated Justin Jefferson’s Vikings. JSN has been an elite weapon for Darnold, but the addition of Shaheed has open up even more opportunities for him.

Seahawks QB Sam Darnold has been airing it out all season long. He is also averaging 245.2 pass yards per game (6th) &amp; he’s top 5 in passer rating (102). He’s got one of the biggest set of balls in the NFL &amp; will sling it deep (as evident of his 4 INT’s vs Rams last month). __Darnold has average 8.8 yards per pass attempt (most in the NFL), ranks 1st in Pass Success % (among QB’s with 300+ snaps), he ranks 1st in both passes 50+ yards (7) &amp; 40+ yards (11), 4th in passes 20+ yards (50), &amp; 5th in passes 30+ yards (19).__
Most of those yards came to JSN, with the Seahawks lacking a #2 WR. That changed on November 4th when the Seahawks traded a 4th &amp; 5th draft <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> for vertical weapon Rashid Shaheed. Shaheed was quiet after the trade. He didn’t crack a 10% target share in any of his first 4 games. While the Seahawks were easing him into a new offense &amp; playbook, Shaheed having limited action was also because the Seahawks didn’t need to throw the ball. In his first 4 games, the Seahawks saw 3 easy wins against the Cardinals, Titans, &amp; Vikings. Darnold completed just 10, 16, &amp; 14 passes in those games. But then he emerged two weeks ago &amp; Shaheed has finally established himself in this offense. __He’s seen 5+ targets &amp; 65+ receiving yards in back to back weeks. His numbers from Week 10-13 compared to 14-15: Target Share: 8.3% -&gt; 18.2%. Targets Per Route: 0.12 -&gt; 0.23. Yards Per Game: 9.3 -&gt; 70.5. Yards Per Route: 0.47 -&gt; 2.71. Last week he had a 23.8% first read rate (10 total targets).__ He’s become an important part of this offense. Darnold went to him multiple times on the game-winning drive, giving Shaheed a 21% target share. Shaheed had the 3rd highest PFF offensive rating (74.8). His snap count rose to 68% &amp; he ran a route on 86.5% of the Seahawks&#x27; dropbacks. Now he faces a Rams defense that has been a funnel to outside receivers. __The Rams allow 4th most receiving yards per game on the 9th highest yards per route run to outside WR’s. Shaheed has ran 74% of his routes out wide.__ The Rams CB duo of Emmanuel Forbes &amp; Cobie Durant ranks outside the top 50 in yards per coverage snap. They just gave up 20 rec 298 yards Jamo Williams &amp; Amon-Ra St. Brown. The week before they gave up 16 rec 200 yards on 16 rec to Michael Wilson &amp; Trey McBride. The Rams also have been dominant vs the run this season. __The Rams are allowing 3.8 YPC to RB’s (3rd). They’ve allowed a league low 3 rushes for 20+ yards this season, a league low rushing 5 TD’s, &amp; the longest rush they have allowed this season is just 29 yards, the only team under 30 yards.__  They just held the best RB tandem in the league on the Lions to 70 yards on 20 carries, forcing Goff to air it out for 338 yards. They game before that they held the Seahawks RB’s to 29 yards on 10 carries. Seahawks will have to move the ball through the air as well.

The forecast is showing rain &amp; some wind which normally would be scary for a receiving prop. This will be Sam Darnold&#x27;s 4th rain game as a QB in Seattle. In his 3 rain games at Lumen he has went 50-77 (65% completion), 606 yards, 6 TD, 0 INT, 115.7 Passer Rating. 2 of those were blowouts where they ran the ball the entire 2nd halves. Still expect him to sling it this game. __The Seahawks are first in the NFL in differential of 20+ yard plays vs their opponents (+21). They are Seahawks average 28.9 points per game (5th). While the Rams are allowing opposing offenses to run 64.5 plays per game, (3rd most) &amp; passing on 56.8% of plays (7th most). Opponents pass 61.38% vs Seahawks (3rd most).__ All signs point to a ton of opportunities for Shaheed. He’s a big play machine &amp; has hit this line in 30/42 games in his career where he was healthy &amp; had a catch.

Rashid Shaheats this game.

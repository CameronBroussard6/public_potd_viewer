Incredibly free play. Love to see it. Onto the next.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: Green Bay Packers vs Chicago Bears/ Bears ML (+110) 3u

Write up: We’re riding with the Bears here. I personally find it hard to believe Love is gonna march into Chicago and steal this game after not playing a full game in about a month. Obviously the Bears don’t have much to show for themselves in recent memory but you can sort of feel a culture being restored there. That place is gonna be rowdy as ever especially against the Packers. I really don’t expect the Packers offense to come out strong given what’s transpired the last month. And given the fact the Bears have the best turnover differential the outcome of this game is truly up to Chicago. So all things considered, why will Chicago win this game? 1. Green Bay will be out of rhythm, 2. Turnover battle, 3. Home field advantage/new chapter in Chicago. Best of luck guys, let me know if you’re tailing and have a great saturday!</td></tr>

THE EVENT : NFL | 4:30pm EST | Rams @ Panthers

THE <mark style='background:#fff59d'>PICK</mark> : Los Angeles Rams Alt Spread -9.5 (-125) [2.5U to win 2U]

Just about no one is giving the Panthers a chance in this one, &amp; I’m with the masses there - where the value lies is in the spread. The line currently sits at 10.5, so for not much more juice I’ve bought the extra point at -9.5 to leave it as simple as a win by double digits. As of this writing, 62% of the public is on the Panthers to cover - accounting for 51% of the handle. I’ll fade that all day. 

The Panthers did beat the Rams during the regular season, but that was a Rams squad that wasn’t at full strength in a letdown spot after having not lost in over a month (this was a stretch with dominant wins over playoff teams like Jacksonville, San Francisco &amp; a nail biter over Seattle). With reinforcements back by the names of Davante Adams &amp; Tyler Higbee to accompany Puka Nacua, MVP candidate in Matthew Stafford at QB and one of the best coaches in the league in Sean McVay - you know the Rams are going to come out with the intention to make a statement. These are different stakes &amp; there will be no looking past these Panthers after last time - it’s going to be pedal through the floor. To be frank, the Rams are simply much more talented &amp; have been here before, with championship pedigree up &amp; down the roster.

Meanwhile, Carolina is here on the technicality that their entire division stinks, &amp; they happened to stink the least. Having a losing record yet getting to host a playoff game is laughable. While the franchise is definitely trending in the right direction long term under Dave Canales, and they are at home, the time is now for the Rams. Gimme LA to roll through Carolina onto the divisional round. 

But of course, what do I know?</td></tr>

**Event**: African Cup of Nations - 19:00 GMT+0

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>**: Ivory Coast to Qualify @1.75

**Write Up**: Ivory Coast are my picks to win this tournament as a whole so as it goes, I&#x27;m going to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> them to qualify to the next round. They are the defending champions, have played the best football this tournament and probably have the most well rounded squad. They are a young, dynamic team with ability going both ways. It should be enough to see of Egypt. Egypt haven&#x27;t played all too well this competition. And despite their forward line, I think they are outclassed in the middle of the field by the Ivorians. Egypt have largely underperfomed in the past 15 or so years and they&#x27;re in a slight bit of a transition period and are weaker now than usual.

**Additional Thoughts**: Short write up with very little facts or arguements. It&#x27;s just I feel that Ivory Coast are the better side, nothing else. I wouldn&#x27;t blame you at all for ignoring it. But it&#x27;s a bit of fun to maybe have someone to cheer for in the tournament if you don&#x27;t already. Heartbreaking end to the game yesterday. We deserved a win there and my soul left me with that Hudson-Odoi goal. Hopefully we can put our two push streak to an end with a win <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.</td></tr>

Write-Up:

Coming off a MVP season i expect Stafford to be cooking in this game. Line has hit 4 of last 5 going 281/368/457/259. -10.5 line suggest a bad game script for passing, however i expect a much closer game. Panthers also beat LA in Week 13 31-28

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s Event: WTA 500 Brisbane | J. Pegula vs. M. Kostyuk | 12:00 AM EST (SOON!!  Only 3 hrs from now)**

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Total Games OVER 21.5 @ 1.77 (-130)**

Recap:  Well the match didn&#x27;t unfold *exactly* as planned, but it did start off competitve like I predicted and Kostyuk fought hard and ended up giving Andreeva more than she could handle.  Fortunately though, she hung in just long enough to get us our win. 💰💲
___
Back to the same logic for Kostyuk&#x27;s next match versus Jessica Pegula.  Their last meeting in China last October went 3 sets with Pegula finally pulling away in the 3rd with a 6-1 win, but this is an even more competitive version of Kostyuk that Jess will be facing <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. 

Both of these ladies have been shown to be resilient and willing to wiggle into long rallies which usually leads to more games.   Pegula has strong baseline consistency and Kostyuk has the ability to extend points and win breaks.  Although Pegula is slightly favored, I again predict that Kostyuk will start strong and steal at least a set (if not win the match outright, but choosing a side here is incredibly difficult).  Even when she finds herself behind, Pegula is definitely not one to concede anything, and both are both confident enough to create long, drawn-out points.  The close line (Pegula -135) is also a strong indicator that this may be a close match.  I see this one going back and forth quite a bit, so OVER 21.5 total games is once again the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>.  BOL!</td></tr>

Saturday’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> - Panthers +16.5 AND Bears Packers u52.5 -108 (1.08u to win 1u)

Starting the LA vs CAR, this is a weird game. The Rams lost last time after a bunch of turnover from Stafford. I don’t really see that happening tomorrow, but that’s a huge spread for a home playoff team that has already beaten this team. The Rams of course have the ability to put up points, but I think Carolina might surprise some people again here and be able to put up enough to cover 16.5

Moving to the night game, there is going to be a lot of wind tomorrow at Soldier Field. Both of these teams know each other well and would like to get their ground game going. Their last game here at Solider Field needed OT to get to 38. Teasing this up to 52.5 feels like too many points with the conditions and the team’s playstyles.

Good Luck!</td></tr>

Time: 2:30AM EST

 

Reasoning:

Like Rublev here again, he&#x27;s clearly in his groove and when he is he can compete with anyone. Musetti is a top 10 player who&#x27;s better on clay. He has a 1HBH and is a great mover, but think he won&#x27;t match up well against Rublev&#x27;s power. His results so far have been beating Coleman Wong who&#x27;s done well to reach the QFs of this tournament, and had a battle against Etcheverry.

I think he&#x27;ll have a hard time breaking Rublev this match, and will try to invoke unforced errors from Rublev.

This isn&#x27;t a lock, but I think its good value at even odds. I&#x27;d give Rublev \~70% chance to win.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Taylor Fritz vs Hubert Hurkacz | **Hurkacz +0.5 games at -110 (BET365). 1 unit.**

Write-up: Easy win for Bublik, although Shang held on a little better in the second set. 

Interesting United Cup tie here between the USA and Poland, two of the most successful teams in the history of this event. Both teams have done well to get to this stage, but Team USA has struggled a bit more thanks to inconsistent performances from Taylor Fritz and Coco Gauff. Fritz played more matches than almost anyone on tour in 2025, but he unfortunately didn&#x27;t get to enjoy a relaxing offseason, as he revealed that he&#x27;s currently battling some &quot;pretty serious tendinitis&quot; in his knee, and his main goal in the offseason was to rehab it. In three matches here at the United Cup, Fritz hasn&#x27;t looked great, losing to clay-courter Sebastian Baez and a resurgent Stefanos Tsitsipas but scoring a narrow victory over Spanish grinder Jaume Munar. He didn&#x27;t look terrible in the most recent match against Tsitsipas, but struggled immensely on return, generating just two break points. While Hubert Hurkacz also has some fitness concerns given that this is his first event back from a long injury layoff, he hasn&#x27;t exactly showed it so far, with the highlight being a massive win over ATP #3 Alexander Zverev in his first match back. Hurkacz always plays well here in Australia, as the lively conditions boost his already incredible serve, and it&#x27;s tough to see Fritz breaking him much. Hubi also has an aggressive enough baseline game to take over rallies if Fritz falls into a pattern of pushing off the backhand wing. If this match goes long, I trust Hurkacz&#x27;s fitness more right now, and I feel that he should be a slight favorite here. I chose the +0.5 games handicap because I prefer these odds, but Hurkacz ML at around +100 is also a totally reasonable option. Just note that they aren&#x27;t exactly the same bet (as +0.5 games could cash even if Hurkacz loses, or the other way around).</td></tr>

**Event:** A-League Men, Melbourne Victory v Sydney Wanderers, starts in 6 hours and 4 minutes

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Sydney Wanderers 0.0 Asian Handicap, +175, 1 unit

**Write Up:** Using the same logic here and fading a team that seems to be the strong favourite on paper, yet their ML odds are suspiciously high. Just from my experience, these kind of matchups often have slip-ups, especially in the UK and the Australian leagues, so I&#x27;m looking forward to this one.

Hear me out. Yes, Melbourne Victory arrive into this match on 4 wins in a row and 6th on the league table. Yes, Sydney are basically the complete opposite with 3 losses in a row (4L 1D in the last 5 league matches) and are dead last. But this is a rivalry and all logic seems to fly out of the window in those, especially in the Australian league that&#x27;s full of upsets.

The H2H proves my earlier point. Looking at direct meetings, Western Sydney still match up well historically. In 34 previous league meetings between these two clubs, Victory have 16 wins to Wanderers’ 12, with **six draws**, showing this fixture’s competitive nature. Victory’s average of almost *2 goals per match* *against Western Sydney* is balanced by the fact that **Wanderers have secured draws in over 40% of H2H meetings** and I believe they&#x27;re capable of even more <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Both teams have been involved in **matches with over 1.5 goals fairly frequently**, but draws and narrow margins remain common in A-League rivalry fixtures. All things considered, I&#x27;m taking the 0.0 AH here (also known as DNB, but with better odds on some books), just in case a draw does occur. If Melbourne weren&#x27;t playing at home, I wouldn&#x27;t even bother taking the DNB and would go straight to the Sydney Wanderers ML. If you want to take the BTTS and the over 2.5 goals route, I don&#x27;t mind those either. BOL, let&#x27;s get an early one out of the way and enjoy the weekend ☘️🫡

Melbourne Victory vs Western Sydney @ 2.5

Melbourne Victory vs Western Sydney Wanderers should deliver plenty of action. Victory are aggressive going forward at home but often concede chances, while the Wanderers attack with speed and intensity. Neither side is comfortable sitting back, which usually leads to an open game. With both teams capable of scoring multiple goals and defensive mistakes likely, this matchup strongly points toward over 3.5 goals.</td></tr>

Wild Card hosts that missed the playoffs the year before are 14-30 ATS (32%). The Rams have the 2nd best odds to win the Super Bowl. Over the last 10 years, each Super Bowl winner had 11+ regular season wins, averaged at least a +4.5 ppg game margin, had at least 365 yards/game, &amp; allowed no more than 130 rush yards/game. The Rams are one of just 2 teams that fit that criteria this year. The Rams enter the playoffs as the league&#x27;s highest scoring offense &amp; have the 2nd highest point differential (+172). Carolina is 23rd in point differential (-69), &amp; the only team in the postseason this year with a negative scoring margin. Only 3 teams have had a worse point differential &amp; made playoffs in NFL history. Panthers coach Dave Canales limped into the playoffs this year for the first time in his head coaching career with a 8-9 record, having lost 3 of his last 4 games. He’ll now face Sean McVay who is one of the rare coaches with a winning career playoff record (8-5) &amp; a Super Bowl ring. The Rams are #1 in EPA/Play (0.13) &amp; points per drive (2.8), #1 in down conversion rate (78.8%), &amp; #1 yards per play (6.2). Panthers defense allows a 74.9% conversion rate (26th), 2.3 points per drive (25th), &amp; are 20th in DEF EPA (-0.03). 

They played earlier this season with the Panthers upsetting the Rams. Carolina had a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> 6, a deflected INT in their own end zone, &amp; a strip sack with the Rams in game tying FG position. Those 3 plays resulted in a -16.1 EPA for the Rams, the most significant turnover swing for the Panthers in a game this season &amp; the worst for the Rams this season. Carolina had the ball for 35:16 of the clock, their largest time of possession this season. The Rams averaged 7.4 yards per play (4th highest). The Rams only faced 5 third downs all game, had 1 penalty, &amp; scored a TD on 4 of 5 possessions w/o a turnover. They had a 76% rushing success rate, averaging 0.53 EPA/rush, highest in the NFL. They averaged 3.05 yards before contact. Kyren injured his ankle &amp; left in the 1st half &amp; with just 13 carries &amp; still had 72 rushing yards. __Kyren has 70+ rushing yards in 8 of his last 10 games, averaging 78 ypg. The last 7 games that he had 13+ carries he rushed 72+ yards in every game, averaging 83.3 yards in those games.__ He hasn’t had fewer than 12 carries all season. The Rams have the best run blocking OL in the NFL. They avg 2.0 yards before contact (best in the NFL) &amp; a 13.2% run stuff rate (5th), allowing the fewest sacks. Carolina has allowed the 7th most ybc this season at 2.36 &amp; have given up 157.3 rushing yards in their last 3 games, 4th most. The Panthers rank 27th in Rush EPA (-0.025) &amp; have allowed the 6th most rushing TD’s (20). Since the Panthers upset vs the Rams they have averaged just 16 ppg in the last 4. The Rams averaged 36.8 ppg in their last 5. Opposing RB’s are averaging 29.8 carries a game vs the Panthers in their last 5 games (minus the Saints). Books have his rush attempts at 14.5. He’s over in 6/6 games this season with at least 14+ carries. The opposing lead RB has cleared their rushing line in 9/10 games vs CAR: Irving 62.5 -&gt; 85, Charbs 38.5 -&gt; 110, Bucky 63.5 -&gt; 71, Kyren 64.5 -&gt; 72, CMC 68.5 -&gt; 89, Bijan 74.5 -&gt; 104, Kamara 37.5 -&gt; 83.

Williams has been one of the best RBs at Zone concept runs. He averages 5.19 yards per carry, with a 63.7% success rate (1st). He ranks #1 in rate of man gap run rate, on 48% of his rushing attempts. Against man gap runs Carolina is allowing 5.8 ypc (30th) &amp; 2.9 ybc (31st). Kyren is the #1 RB in the NFL in Run Success rate at 50.1%. Also McVay loves to feed Kyren come playoff time. He has even said publicly he has given Blake Corum the RB2 work this season to keep Kyren healthy for the playoffs. In last year’s playoffs, Kyren averaged 17.5 carries for 91 yards. In their elimination loss to the eventual Super Bowl Champion Eagles, Kyren ran for 106 yards on 19 carries, averaging 5.6 yards per carry. The Eagles last season had the 2nd best EPA run defense in the NFL (-0.194). He’ll have plenty of chances too as the Rams average 63.9 plays per game, 7th most. They rank 6th in tempo running a play every 28.9 seconds.

There’s a 75% chance of rains with 15 mph winds &amp; gusts up to 40 mph. Having had 3 TO’s last game vs Carolina McVay is going to want to play it safe &amp; run the ball. The Rams rank #1 in offensive efficiency with the lowest offensive variance in the NFL, while having the #2 toughest schedule. 13 of their 17 games came were against teams with 8+ wins. Against non division playoff teams, Carolina is 2-5 with an avg score of 28-14. They scored 16 points or fewer in all but 1 of those games. All 5 losses came by double digits. Meanwhile, the Rams already have 8 wins by 14+ points. The Panthers offense are 26th in the NFL in EPA per play (-0.025) &amp; average the 6th fewest yards per play (5.0). They rank just 24th in in red zone TD scoring rate (53.33%). The Rams defense is the 3rd best allowing a TD on just 46.15% of red zone attempts. Carolina ranks 30th in pass block win rate. Since Week 14, the Rams ranked 2nd in pressure rate &amp; the Panthers have allowed the 5th highest pressure rate. That’s bad news for Bryce Young who will be starting in his 1st playoff game. QB’s making their 1st playoff start vs QBs who have playoff experience are 20-40 SU &amp; 20-39-1 ATS since 2002. The Rams are also the most disciplined team in the NFL. The Rams have had the fewest penalties in the league every year since 2020. This year they have just 75, lowest in NFL. But they have benefited from opposing teams getting called 121 penalties, 5th most. That net of +46 penalties is the most in the NFL. Clete Blakeman has been chosen as the head official. Blakeman’s crew ranks #1 calling 3rd down defensive penalties &amp; awarding automatic 1st downs. The Panthers surrender automatic 1st downs on 40% of 3rd downs. The Rams rank 30th at just 17%. The Rams rank 7th as beneficiaries of automatic 1st downs. In games Blakeman’s crew has officiated, playoff home teams are just 4-9 ATS. The Panthers were penalized a record 12 times by Blakeman in their Super Bowl 50 loss to the DEN. Carolina is just 1-6 SU / 2-5 ATS with Blakeman since, including 0-2 SU/ATS as home dogs.

Rams win. Panthers stinks. Kyren eats.

Last 5 &gt; WLWLW // Profit: €2,161.00

Hamburg are not bad, they just suck away from home this season. On the road HSV are last in the bundesliga with a 0-2-5 record. They barely score when traveling and concede alot (3:16). Away from home they are now on a 4 game losing streak.

Freiburg on the other hand are 3-3-1 at home and have a 14:9 goal diff. In their last 5 home games they are 2-3-0 in the Bundesliga and even 10 homes unbeaten in all competitions.

On the H2H side Freiburg hold the upper hand, although not recent, they are 5-4-1 in their last 10 meetings.</td></tr>

Write up: I mean… Indiana man, they are rolling… - NFL PLAYOFF TIME! - Model has this as the highest confident Edge % and EV % for the day. Will add some personal information in this write-up as well.

• ⁠Model has Williams throwing 2+ at 57% 

• Model projects 55% of the over hitting &amp; 57% over his passing yards 

• EV better betting 100$ = 8-11$ for this play

• Caleb Williams, the Bears vs Packers, what a first rounder we got here - In William’s last 5 games, this line has hit - he has over 1.5 TDS - Both matchups against Green Bay this year, he has thrown for 2 TDS on the dot - The last 4 home games of the season, he has also thrown 2+ - Packers have allowed 25 passing TDS this year, and I think this game will involve a lot of passing for either team to have a chance at the W - Packers secondary isn’t the best and I think the Bears will exploit that, giving Williams the opportunity to break out longer passes - With William’s form as of late, getting him a 2+ passing TD’s at + odds, is great value - Caleb Williams O1.5 Passing TDS is the play here

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Chelsea -1.5 (-110) 1.1 units to win 1 unit

**Write Up:** Sorry guys, we got very unlucky with lineups and they threw our guy on in the 88th minute. Going to avoid player props for these cup games for a bit.

Another FA cup match <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> as Premier Lesgue side Chelsea will travel to take on Championship (2nd tier) division Charlton. Charlton are currently 19th place in the Championship, not too far from the relegation zone. Their matches tend to be low scoring as they do not concede a ton of goals. They also dont score many, averaging exactly 1 per game. 

Chelsea will likely trot out a mostly 2nd team here to start, but they run a very deep sqaud. That 2nd team should be plenty to control this game. Many of their 2nd team have been playing in Champion&#x27;s League matches, gotten sub time in the EPL, and played in the EFL cup matches late last year. This will also be their first game under their new manager, and many of these players are fighting for 1st team time. I expect them to show out. If all else fails, Chelsea will sub on their big names at halftime to secure the win. 

BOL and have a great weekend!</td></tr>

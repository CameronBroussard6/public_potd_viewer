**Write Up:** Please be aware that recently are unreal. Like yesterday, 2nd half UNDER is more favorable to me than full court nowadays. <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s game dropped 3 pts since opening and Heat is not my preferred team running such module。

Please please this is only a demonstration.....

This <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> is from my sportsbook model that I found 2 weeks ago. It shows home team and away team are going to play a physical game instead of shooting party. After go through all information I could find from social media that&#x27;s why I made such <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> and I have 100% in it otherwise I won&#x27;t post.

Lol, please ignore above what I said as my entry was deleted/not recorded due to no reason provided. If you are in the game and you believe everything with scripts, you will know what I am saying. If the stats or commone sense works, why sportsbook still have to pay huge for generating these numbers. Only thing you have to do is to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> one side and see if you are same as books. Demonstration is still on the way and I believe win rate is around 65-70%.

* Union Berlin have scored in 10/11 league games
* Frankfurt have scored in 13/14 league games
* Frankfurt have conceded exactly three goals in 6/7 games across all comps

What can we say about Eintracht Frankfurt at the moment? I mean when you concede so many goals, can it really be fixed by just changing the manager? Union Berlin aren’t exactly doing amazing themselves with no wins since the winter break, but their games have been harder with Dortmund and Hoffenheim in the last two. 

Albert Riera will only have had a couple of training sessions with the team since the last game, so there is only so much he can do in that time. Both teams kinda need to win this to stay in contention for a Europa spot. I think we will get a very competitive game between two teams that are struggling a bit to control their games, it should lead to a very open game with plenty of chances.  

*Before failing to score against Dortmund last home game, this bet had won in each of their previous five at home, while Frankfurt had seen this bet win in 10 of their last 14 away.*</td></tr>

Event: NBA 

Picks: Jaden Mcdaniels 15 pts, Pascal Siakam 20 pts

Odds: +109 (via hardrock)

Explanation:

Mcdaniels-First off, he has hit this line in his last four games, but more than that he’s been consistent over the last month or so, hitting this like in 9/12 games (three game streak in which he averaged 8.3 points). Also, the Timber Wolves are playing the Pelicans tonight, a team which allows the third most points in the league averaging 121 allowed per game. 
Confidence: 75%

Siakam-Siakam has hit this like 16/17 times. Didn’t play last game I believe so his minutes might be a little limited but overall, I like this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>.
Confidence: 85%

Been a long time follower of the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> thread and R/sportsbook in general but I’m exited to post my first picks ever.

**NBA | IND @ MIL | 8:00 PM ET**

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Pascal Siakam Over 4.5 Assists — Bovada +130 (2u)

Textbook line-in-transition spot. Sharp books (Bet365, DraftKings, Bookmakereu) still have Siakam&#x27;s assists at 3.5 juiced heavily to the over (-141 to -166). Meanwhile Bovada, Caesars, and ESPN Bet have moved to 4.5 with plus money. When the market is split like this, the higher line at plus money is usually where the edge is.

Siakam&#x27;s averaging 4.6 assists over his last 8 games, clearing 4.5 in 5 of 8 (63%). My projection has him at 4.5. He&#x27;s Indiana&#x27;s secondary playmaker alongside Nembhard, and Milwaukee gives up assists to forwards. Getting +130 on what the sharp market prices as a coin flip is the value.

And <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> I have another solid <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> lined up which really like.

**Write Up:**

Union Berlin is facing Eintracht Frankfurt at home and this match just screams one thing: GOALS

Let&#x27;s look at the home vs away stats.

3.10 goals per game for Union Berlin at home and 5.00(!!) goals per game for Eintracht Frankfurt away from home. If that alone doesn&#x27;t convince you, there is more.

Union Berlin scores 1.5 goals per game at home and have scored in 7/10 games at home.

Eintracht Frankfurt scores 2.30 goals per game away from home and have scored in 9/10 away games.

Union Berlin concedes 1.60 goals per game at home and have kept a clean sheet in 2/10 home games.

Eintracht Frankfurt concedes 2.70 goals per game in their away games and have kept a clean sheet in 0/10 games away from home.

These numbers are insanity. Normally I am not getting that excited because of the H2H for example but the reverse fixture this season ended in a 4-3 win in favor of Union Berlin.

xG for Union Berlin at home sits at 1.35 whilst this is 1.28 xG for Eintracht Frankfurt.

xGA for Union Berlin at home sits at 1.35 as well and for Eintracht Frankfurt away this number sits at 1.60.

This is lower than the goals itself but is still very positive for the BTTS &amp; o2.5 goals.

Albert Riera will be in charge of his first game for Eintracht Frankfurt, which may shake things up.

At NK Celje in Slovenia he has managed an impressive 14-5-1 with 52 goals scored and 18 conceded.

Which is an average of 3.50 goals per game. Here is the good part. Away from home his team went 7-2-1 with 30 scored and 13 against. An average of 4.30 goals per game.

I am looking forward to seeing goals tonight. Let this be the start of something great!

ROI: -100%

NBA | Heat vs Celtics | 7:30 PM ET

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **Bam Adebayo OVER 18.5 Points** (-125)
Units: 1.25u

Write-Up:
This sets up as a strong usage spot for Adebayo. Miami is thin on reliable half-court scoring, and in competitive matchups against Boston the offense typically runs through Bam as a primary option. Boston’s defensive scheme prioritizes staying home on perimeter shooters and switching actions, which funnels touches into the mid-post and paint, areas where Bam consistently gets his volume.

In recent form he’s been clearing this number regularly and playing secure minutes in competitive scripts. With Miami likely needing interior scoring to keep pace, the projected shot volume and role support a number closer to the low-20s. At 18.5, there’s still value on his scoring line given matchup and usage.</td></tr>

Bet is pending…

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: 🏀 Northern Iowa ML + Saint John’s +15.5 (-128).

Games start at 8pm EST. Bet 2u

Writeup: So I was playing around with the alternate spread scroll wheel on DK, maxed out the spread for St. John’s at -990, and somehow I managed to get these odds on a parlay. Thought I would share with the class!

As silly and dumb as this is, I think there there is some real merit to this bet. Let’s start with Northern Iowa. They come into this match with a borderline top 20 defense, and is the best defense in the country at preventing the three-pointer. They go up against a Bradley offense, just inside the top 150, with their only real bright spot being the three-point shot, which, as I just mentioned, will be highly limited by Northern Iowa. I will also give a slight nod to the Bradley defense against the Northern Iowa offense, but not nearly to the same degree. This should simply be a low scoring affair where the better team comes out on top. Give me Northern Iowa straight up.

Now let’s move on to the ridiculousness of St. John’s +15.5. I have this being pretty even on both sides of the ball, but as I have stated before when we have faded UConn’s spread, St. John’s has an opposite style pace of play with much more consistency and momentum coming into this game. This contest may come down to free throws and I will always take the more consistent team in that department. St. John’s may win by one or two points, but given that UConn has covered their spread much more effectively in their last two games, I’ll take St. John’s with a hilarious +15.5 cushion. 

Remember to only bet what you can’t afford to lose, and BOL! </td></tr>

Man, what a bad luck. First 10 mins, we had just gone past 10 points, that&#x27;s when finally they started their engines and scoring started going up but it was too late by the end. Lost by 4 points 😒

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** (NCAAB) Northern Iowa - Bradley (Over 130.5)

**Start Time:** 01:00 AM (GMT)

**Odds:** \-120

**Units:** 4U

**Reasoning:** First of all, I&#x27;m going 4U because I wanna get my money back, so take it into accont. All bets I write here I am confident of (never mind the record 🤪).

This is one of those sneaky-good spots where both teams are way better offensively than the number suggests. Bradley isn’t afraid to score, they’re comfortable pushing into the high 60s or 70s, they attack the paint, get to the line, and don’t panic if the pace ticks up. Northern Iowa is disciplined, efficient, and can absolutely fill it up when the game matters, smart shot selection, good spacing, and they’ll cash in from deep if you give them clean looks.

Now add the number: 130.5 is tiny. No fireworks required. Both teams play grown-man basketball, they finish possessions, and when it’s tight late, the fouls start flying, free throws turn this into easy money. This isn’t a “hope they run” bet, it’s a trust the offenses + trust the math bet. Solid teams, low bar, tons of ways to win. Over 130.5 is built to cash and get my god damn money back plus some extra 😤</td></tr>

Match: Roda v ADO Den Haag &amp; Union Berlin v Eintracht Frankfurt

Time: 20:00 CET &amp; 20:30 CET

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Both teams to score @ ADO &amp; Over 1.5 Goals @Frankfurt (1.92)

Reasoning: 

Back with another double <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> after yesterday’s win. 

Roda games are consistently open with goals at both ends, and ADO score regularly but recently have rarely been keeping any clean sheets — BTTS is the most reliable angle here. BTTS has hit in 9 last matches of Roda so let’s make it 10. ADO is in terrible form and I don’t think they can keep Roda from scoring, but given their quality and need for points again they should get on the scoresheet too.

Union–Frankfurt tends to be competitive and open, with both sides creating chances; over 1.5 goals clears in most scenarios. First match between these two this season saw 7 goals as Union won 3-4 in Frankfurt. I see this being another goal fest as Frankfurt desperately needs to score and regain their form.

Hello ladies and gentlemen.

I think Forest have improved recently, and Leeds will be without Stach which will probably affect their defensive shape and overall coherence, so I expect a Forest goal here. and regarding the other fixture I think over 1.5 is pretty safe to the point I don&#x27;t even need to justify it.

Zvezda is on a 5-game winning streak, and 3 of those came in away games. With this win, they are going to have a good chance for a top 6 and direct 1/4 in the playoffs. The top 10 place is almost secured, but not quite.

Maccabi has a 5-game loss streak in away games. Maybe it doesn&#x27;t play a big role, but they were a home team in Belgrade before moving back to Tel Aviv, and they have a really good relationship with Belgrade teams (as does Izrael with Serbia in general), and I don&#x27;t expect a big fight from them here, a nice friendly training game, with a comfortable 12-15 points win of Zvezda team.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s Event:** La Liga - Celta Vigo vs Osasuna 

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Celta Vigo to WIN, odds 1.95 (bet365), 100€ to win 195€


**Reasoning:**
Back again with a solid La Liga spot that I think is being priced closer to a coin flip than it should be. Celta at home is a completely different team compared to their away form, and this matchup sets up well for them from both a tactical and statistical standpoint.

Celta is a possession-based side that creates the majority of their chances through sustained pressure and wide overloads, which plays directly into Osasuna’s biggest weakness, defending for long stretches away from home. Osasuna are far more comfortable when they can sit deep and counter selectively, but their away performances often show cracks once they’re forced to absorb pressure for 90 minutes.

At Balaídos, Celta consistently post stronger underlying numbers: higher shot volume, better xG creation, and more control of territory. Even when results don’t always reflect it, they tend to win the process, which is exactly what I want when backing a moneyline favorite rather than chasing handicaps or goal lines.
Osasuna’s road form has been shaky, and they struggle to create consistently when not dictating the tempo. If they fall behind here, they don’t have the attacking depth to easily chase the game, while Celta are comfortable managing narrow leads.
At odds of 1.95, the implied probability is just over 51%, but I rate Celta closer to 58–60% to win this matchup at home. That gap is enough for me to see value on the straight ML rather than complicating things with extra conditions.

**Final Thoughts:**
Not a lock, not flashy, but a disciplined home ML where the matchup, venue, and game script favor the hosts more often than the odds suggest. Keeping it simple and letting Celta do the work.
Good luck 🤝</td></tr>

What a game. Down by 10, then Luka got injured, but the boys eventually found a way to win and cover the spread.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Boston -5.5 v Miami

Write-up: The #3 team in the east facing up against the #8 team in the same conference. Both teams have depth and love to grind it all out on the court. You can probably call this a rivalry due to how many times they met in the playoffs. However, this year? Against a rival? Ohhh i do love some Boston here. 

The Celtics have been playing great basketball without Tatum. Jaylen Brown is playing out of his mind and one thing’s for sure, no one can’t stop him from getting his buckets. The Celtics are on a 4-win streak. 

However, let’s stop all that eye test and go to our reliable stats.

On the last 5 games, Boston ranks 2nd in Net Adjusted Efficiency (NAE). This is like NBA’s version of EPA. While, Miami ranks 16th.

At home, Boston has been unstoppable ranking 3rd in NAE. 

On the road, Miami has been decent since they are ranked 9th in NAE.

No significant injuries as of this moment for both teams.  

Best of luck, boys! Hoping we can continue the streak!!!

Last pick: Alperen Şengün (HOU) Over 10.5 Rebounds❌

Lesson:  Beware of your opponent’s matchup at that position they be more and out rebound the main prop player

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Jaylen Brown (BOS) OVER 6.5 Rebounds(-135)

Reasoning: 🕵️ Detective clues: Evidence 1: same news we heard before, The &quot;Tatum Vacuum&quot; Effect. With Jayson Tatum (Achilles) officially ruled out the Celtics lose their lead rebounder (8.3 RPG). Historically, Brown averages 8.1 rebounds in games without Tatum, a massive jump from his seasonal average

Evidence 2: The &quot;Heat Funnel&quot; Strategy. Miami allows the 2nd most rebounds in the league to the Small Forward/Power Forward positions. They play a &quot;shrink the floor&quot; defense that leaves the perimeter open for crashing wings like Brown.

Evidence 3: Recent Forensic History. Brown is 4-for-4 in clearing his rebounding line against Miami over the last two seasons, including a 9-rebound performance just two months ago

Scenario Playbook

Scenario A (The Ideal): Boston’s defense forces Miami into contested mid-range jumpers (their specialty). Brown crashes from the arc and secures 4 boards by halftime, coasting to 9 or 10 by the final whistle.

Scenario B (The Grind): James Capers calls a tight game, slowing the pace. The total points stay low, but because the game is close, Brown plays 38+ minutes, eventually hitting 8 boards through sheer volume and effort.

Scenario C (The Outside Influences): Ref Pat Fraher is assigned. He allows a fast-paced game (235.1 PPG avg) More possessions = more missed shots = more rebound opportunities.

Scenario D (The White Flag 🏳️): Boston blows Miami out by 25 points in the 3rd quarter. Brown sits the entire 4th. Scenario Proof: Even in blowouts, Brown has historically secured 6-7 rebounds by the 3rd quarter. Without Tatum, he is the #1 priority on the glass.

Scenario E (Cold Night): Both teams shoot 55% from the field (highly unlikely for Miami on the road). Fewer misses mean fewer chances. This is the only &quot;red flag&quot; for this prop

Scenario Proof: Brown has cleared 7.5 rebounds in 70% of his last 10 games against Miami , and that was with Tatum taking 8 boards away from him.</td></tr>

: Persib vs Malut United. Under 2.5 @1.83 (starts in less than 3hours) ✅
-
Persib has kept 4 clean sheets in the last 5 games, conceding 1 goals during this period. Overall this season, their defence has kept a clean sheet on 11 occasions. At home they only conced 0.11 goal per game. And their last 5 home games ended with 2 goals or less. 

Malut United has seen more goals recently in their away games and they do conced 0.89 goals per game but it’s still not that high 

I think this game will end up tight, as I Even thought about the U1.5.. but Who knows..

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** STVV Draw no bet (1 unit) @ 1.83

**Write Up**: Anderlecht totally broke down, not much to say... an owngoal and two red cards.

We&#x27;re backing STVV (Sint Truiden) with draw no bet <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. They have an absolute stellar season, being second in the Belgian league. They&#x27;re normally a mid table team, but to the surprise of everyone, they&#x27;re a title contender. They&#x27;ve won 5 out of their last 7 matches. 

On the other hand we have Westerlo. They&#x27;re a few points above the relegation zone. In their last 7 matches, they&#x27;ve won 2 times, drew 2 and lost 2.

With the draw no bet we&#x27;re protected against a draw.

NBA: Pacers @ Bucks 8:00 PM EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **Ryan Rollins u2.5 threes** (-177); 3 units to win 1.69 units

Write Up:  
In games without Giannis and with Kevin Porter this season, Rollins has gone under this line 7/9 times. Over these 9 games he has a total of 50 3PAs for an average of around 5.5 3PA/game.  
The Pacers have a lot of notoriously pesky perimeter defenders in McConnell, Nembhard, and Nesmith. I expect one of these 3 to almost always be marking Rollins. This, in combination with their weak interior defense (newly acquired Zubac will not play), probably is the reason for guards to make threes over the Pacers. Here are some guards who I think are comparable to Rollins&#x27; three point shooting ability and their 3 point numbers against the Pacers:

NAW: 3/7, 5/10  
Coby White: 1/5  
SGA: 1/4  
Payton Pritchard: 1/5  
Anfernee Simons: 1/4  
Derrick White: 1/4  
Tyrese Maxey: 1/4

With the exception of NAW, everyone else struggled.

Here are reasons why you might not want to take this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>.  
In Rollins&#x27; two games against the Pacers this season, he went 2/4 and 2/5. These are under the line, but he shot efficiently from three.  
I am not sure of KPJ&#x27;s status for the game. He is not listed on the injury report at the time of this write-up, but he is coming off an injury and might have a minutes restriction. I&#x27;m not completely sure of this but it would be safe to assume so because this is only his second game back. The less minutes KPJ plays the more the ball is going to be in Rollins&#x27; hands which definitely would not be good for this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>.</td></tr>

NBA | Celtics vs Heat | 🏀  

Started good &amp; had the perfect matchup to go over, only starter that didn’t reach double digit attempts but shooting 25% probably does that to you. Felt great about this one but it was Embiid show, overall a bad read.

Good spot for JB here in a high pace matchup against the Heat, a spot I’ve targeted multiple times because of the pace. More opportunities &amp; more possessions leads to more rebound chances which is very welcome.

JB is over in 2/2 against the Heat this season with 9 &amp; 7 rebounds avg 13 rebound chances, with 12+ rebound chances he’s over in 18/21 games.

86% hit rate in his L15 games aswell.

Heat play with the fastest pace in the league and as a result allowed 2nd most rebounds in the league.

Addition of Vucevic doesn’t scare me too much, he’ll share the workload with Queta and the weak side rebounds will be there, expecting JB to be active.

**5 IN A ROW.** We are officially on fire. River Plate took care of business and now we’re looking to extend the heater. I usually stick to the Argentinian league (where we&#x27;ve been crushing it), but this matchup in Saudi Arabia caught my eye and I want to keep the momentum going.

* **Al-Ettifaq:** They are a solid mid-to-top table team. They have high-quality international playerd like **Wijnaldum, Moussa Dembélé, and Marek Rodák**. Compared to the local squads, their individual talent ceiling is much higher.
* **Damac:** They are currently struggling near the relegation zone. They lack the depth and the firepower to keep up with Ettifaq’s frontline. 
* **The Play:** Since I’m stepping out of my main market (Argentina), I’m playing it safe with **1 Unit**. The quality gap is there, and Ettifaq should be able to dismantle a struggling Damac at home. Let’s hunt for that 6th green in a row.

I need to make up for that last brick. I&#x27;m giving 2 picks a try and main play is u140.5 in Breeze vs Hive, then combining with Laces ML puts this in plus money. Laces (7-2) are in first place and should be able to handle the Lunar Owls (2-7). That spread is -7.5 and Laces won the first matchup 84-72.

Last time Breeze and Hive played the final score was 73-62. Breeze (5-4) come in the better side and are -6.5 point favorites against Hive (2-7). Breeze have allowed the lowest opponent FG% at 42.65% and the Hive have the worst FG% at 44.97%. Both teams would need to have really good shooting performances for the over to be the better play and Breeze are a solid defensive side. Offensively they don&#x27;t rush shots and if they get a lead and game manage at the end, I like the under play in this one. BOL</td></tr>

Last Pick: Chicago State @ Central Connecticut State — Full Game Under 138.5

Result: ❌ LOSS (145 points)

Review: This under ultimately failed because several efficiency-based factors aligned at once, rather than the game breaking structurally. CCSU shot well above their baseline (55% from the field, 36% from three), which immediately lifted the scoring floor and reduced the game’s ability to compress downward. At the same time, Chicago State avoided the type of full offensive collapse that typically anchors these matchups, reaching 67 points instead of landing in the low-to-mid 50s.

Free throws also played a meaningful role, with both teams converting at a high rate and adding points without using much clock. Chicago State generated an unusual number of easy points off turnovers, further supplementing their scoring without needing sustained half-court efficiency. The pace never spiraled out of control, but when strong shooting, foul scoring, and opponent cooperation all show up together, the margin for error disappears — and that combination is what ultimately broke the under.

College Basketball | NCAA Men’s Bradley Braves @ Northern Iowa Panthers | Friday, February 6, 2026 | 8:00 pm

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Full Game Under 131.5

Odds: -110 (DraftKings)

Write-Up:

This is one of the cleaner under setups on the board because it’s built around pace control, not hoping one team simply can’t score. Northern Iowa plays slow by default and sticks to that identity regardless of opponent or game state. Even when shots don’t fall, they don’t turn misses into chaos — possessions reset, the clock keeps moving, and the game stays compact.

Bradley fits that style well. They’re not an explosive offense and don’t have a reliable second gear when efficiency dips. If Bradley struggles to score, the game doesn’t “fix itself” by adding possessions or fouls — it just grinds. In a total sitting in the low 130s, that matters, because it removes the late-game paths that usually push games over.

For this game to clear 131.5, a lot has to go right at the same time: both teams would need to shoot efficiently, maintain that efficiency without slowing down, and create extra points late through fouls. That’s a tough combination to hit in this matchup. More often than not, when things go wrong offensively here, the game compresses instead of spiraling — which is exactly the profile you want when backing a full-game under.

Best of luck! Here’s to bouncing back!

Nardi is 2-4 against lefties in his last 6 matches and 14-21 career which kind of gives Damm and edge here and has the perfect game suited to Indoors and is well acclimatised to the conditions

Write up: Model has this as the highest confident percentages and hit rate for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Will add some personal information in this write-up as well.

• ⁠Model has UCONN ML at 53%

• Model has VCU ML at 61%

•Looking into VCU vs Dayton first, the biggest thing I noticed is that in Dayton&#x27;s last game vs St. Bonaventure, they were outscored in the paint, and outrebounded in that game - That being said, VCU is bigger and more athletic than St. Bonaventure - I expect the Rams to win this game through their big man, Djokovic - Dayton is 1-4 in their L5 and VCU is 11-2 this year at home and 8-2 in their L10 - Dayton has not been impressive this year, especially in their last game, at home, against Bonaventure where they only shot a whooping 41% from the field, and a big part of that was because they went ice cold in the 2H - VCU is the better team here, playing at home, and I expect Djokovic to lead the way tonight. 

• UConn is one of the best teams in the country - they are well coached - and have to many good players - they are currently undefeated in the Big East, only have 1 loss on their record, and I see them staying undefeated in conference play tonight - UConn is averaging just under 79PPG this season, while holding opponents to just 64PPG - The big stat that sticks out to me is that UConn is right under 50% shooting % from the field - When I watch UConn play this year, they look like a team that can compete for a national championship - when I watch St. John&#x27;s, I do not think they are there yet - They have been playing their best ball as of recent, but the Big East is not as good as it normally is - The value is with UConn ML here but, as I stated in the comment section, this is a classic Big East game, and can see a close matchup down the stretch.

* Knight is averaging the most kills of any mid laner in any of the 4 major leagues currently and it isn&#x27;t even close, with Knight at 5.8 kills per game with the next highest being CallMe at 4.4, this isn&#x27;t just a small sample size thing as Knight showed this last season as well averaging the most kills in the LPL again in all of 2025 at 5.2 kills per game, again by far the most in the league
* Shanks is averaging the 5th most kills at 3.8 kills per game, he had a really slow start to the split in terms of kills but has been picking up his numbers recently, off the back of a couple of big Orianna performances
* On one hand, I will stand by that this LPL roster is the most talented LPL roster put forward in the last 5 years in terms of raw talent for BLG, the pieces haven&#x27;t looked great and they have undoubtably been shaky throughout the season, however AL haven&#x27;t been as good as I expected, their drafts have really taken a hit as has their mid/late game macro. BLG have looked slightly better recently and I still don&#x27;t think they have hit their peak at all yet, and are getting closer by the weak
* BLG have the entire lingering incident of Bin rage quitting the team, but he came back and they have won back to back clean 2-0s against IG/WBG. Last time they faced off BLG hand checked them throughout game 2 and game 3, went completely different then how I expected. BLG are currently the favorites to win this map and see almost no world Knight misses a h2h against Shanks in a map win.
* Knight is 25-17 against Shanks h2h in his career, in the L3 years, Knight is 19/19 hitrate against Shanks in the h2h matchup in map wins meaning he has never missed this line when his team wins the map, but also has beaten Shanks 3 times when losing the map in the h2h, as well as putting up significantly higher kill averages overall. Knight has averaged 4.94 kills per game against Shanks in the L3 years h2h, while Shanks is averaging 3.42 kills against Knight in the same period despite similar identical h2h records in that period)</td></tr>

Forget KenPom, UConn (22-1) ranks even higher with Bart Torvik, where the Huskies are second in adjusted defensive efficiency and third in effective field goal percentage defense - and that&#x27;s for all of NCAA, not just the Big East. UConn also ranks sixth in 3-point percentage defense. Plus, opponents are only hitting 40.4 percent of close two-pointers (shots within the restricted area). This is a UConn defense that grabs you by the throat and squeezes the shooting life out of you. In its last outing, UConn held Xavier to 36 percent en route to a 32-point win. All that to say this: UConn is tops in the Big East, allowing 63.8 points per game - good for ninth in all the land.

And yes, St. John&#x27;s *is* an impressive 10-2 at home. But they can be got, especially by a UConn team that hasn&#x27;t lost on the road. St. John&#x27;s first home defeat came in its second game of the season, when the Johnnies (17-5) tried to get into a track meet with Alabama. St. John&#x27;s lost, 103-96, despite making 49 percent from the field and attempting 40 free throws. We&#x27;ll chalk that up to a system loss early in the season. But the second home loss came on Jan. 3, with a 77-71 defeat at the hands of sub-.500 Providence, when the Friars were getting 14.5 points. In that game, St. John&#x27;s was held to 28 percent shooting - 22 percent from beyond the arc - and missed 13 of their 37 free throws. There is the blueprint for beating St. John&#x27;s. Mind you, Providence&#x27;s KenPom defensive rating is 190 spots below UConn, which is currently holding conference opponents to a league-best 39.5 percent shooting and 28.5 from beyond the arc. If St. John&#x27;s isn&#x27;t shooting well, I suspect they&#x27;ll revert to bully ball and try to earn free points at the charity stripe.

Meanwhile, St. John&#x27;s recent shooting has been bipolar in general. Over their last five contests, they&#x27;ve hit over 50 percent twice (56, 51) and exactly 35 percent twice, including their previous outing - a 68-56 win over DePaul on Tuesday. To be fair, St. John&#x27;s might&#x27;ve been looking ahead to UConn, and they *did* cover, but I think the Huskies pose a unique challenge. St. John&#x27;s is third in the Big East in rebounding, just ahead of UConn. On the other hand, the Huskies might negate that advantage with their first-place ranking in opponent rebounding.

As for offense, UConn is *the* best shooting team in the Big East at 48.8 percent. KenPom has their offensive efficiency ranked No. 25 in the NCAA (St. John&#x27;s is 26). Interestingly, UConn&#x27;s adjusted tempo ranks quite low (310). Basically, they find the best shot each time down the court in a controlled, methodical way. To wit, UConn ranks 12th in NCAA in assists, and 23rd in assist-to-turnover ratio. When they hit their shots *AND* play suffocating defense, the result is the 10th best scoring margin in the nation at +15.7 points per game. For context, Duke leads with +20.5. I just don&#x27;t see how St. John&#x27;s plays within a possession. And did I mention they shoot incredibly well? UConn is making 65 percent of their shots in the paint, and they&#x27;re getting nearly 10 percent of their shot attempts from dunks.

Devil&#x27;s advocate: UConn does foul teams. They&#x27;re second-worst in the Big East in opponent attempts, although St. John&#x27;s isn&#x27;t exactly crushing it from the free-throw line. St. John&#x27;s *is* really good at forcing turnovers. The Red Storm rank second in the Big East in turnover margin (UConn is middle of the pack). Oh, and the Huskies have been awful against the number, going 8-15 ATS. If you want the records, UConn is 5-7 ATS in Big East play, 3-3 on the road in conference, and 4-3 on the road all season. But this is basically a bet that they will win by one measly basket in a hostile environment. On the other hand, St. John&#x27;s is 5-7 ATS at home, including 2-3 ATS in conference home games. So if bully ball doesn&#x27;t result in easy points, and St. John&#x27;s isn&#x27;t turning the Huskies over, what else is left?

There&#x27;s another consideration. Revenge. St. John&#x27;s swept UConn last year, including a 14-point loss the last time these teams played on this court. Don&#x27;t think Solo Ball and Alex Karaban have forgotten. My thesis: St. John&#x27;s will struggle to shoot and try to bully its way to points or simply outrun UConn. But I think St. John&#x27;s shoots sub-40 percent, while UConn plays its steady, methodical offense. Despite their spread woes this season, the Huskies have covered two in a row. Let&#x27;s make it three.

Good luck and Godspeed!

Chaves vs Penafiel, Over 2.5 goals @ 2.1

Chaves host Penafiel in a competitive Segunda Liga clash where both sides need points. Chaves at home usually play attacking football and have scored regularly in recent matches. Penafiel also arrive in good scoring form and often leave space at the back. Recent meetings have produced open chances and defensive mistakes. With both teams pushing forward, this fixture has strong potential to finish with over 2.5 goals. Expect goals here.</td></tr>

&gt;We are backing Sweden again on Friday after a brutally bad beat to lose the -3.5 bet on Thursday. Hopefully you grabbed the -1.5 at FD for some easy money. Anyway, Sweden are underdogs in this one against Great Britain. Despite the loss to Estonia, Sweden has looked like the strongest team at the event so far. Isabella in particular has been the strongest player out there. On the other side, Mouat has really struggled, particularly in their last game. This matchup is very close so I&#x27;m taking the value we&#x27;ve got with the underdog on the moneyline.</td></tr>

Time: 9:00 AM EST

​<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Heroic -1.5 Maps @ 1.93 odds (3u) ✅

​Write Up:

I know, Heroic has been frustrating to watch in the Group Stage. They’ve been throwing leads and making games harder than they need to be. But this is the play-ins now. It’s a BO3, not a random BO1, and the skill gap here is just massive.

Rekonix is a fun Indonesian stack (Jikroy,  inYourdreaM and Fbz), but they are completely outclassed here. They are riding a losing streak and have struggled to take maps off actual Tier 1 teams. They just don&#x27;t have the macro to punish Heroic for 2 straight games.

Heroic played Rekonix in the Group Stage yesterday, and it was a massacre. Heroic stomped them 23-7 in just 24 minutes. They ran over them in the laning phase, took every objective, and didn&#x27;t give Rekonix a single inch of the map.

Heroic is ranked #9 in the world for a reason. They need a clean confidence booster, and a BO3 against a Tier 2 squad is exactly where they lock in.

Sometimes you don&#x27;t overthink it. You just bet on them to do it again the next day.

​BOL.

Last Pick: Borna Gojo ML vs Tristan Boyer (-152, 1 unit): Win

Tennis | Davis Cup World Group I (Kazakstan vs Monaco) + Cleveland Challenger | Times TBD

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Alexander Bublik vs Hugo Nys | **Bublik to win 2-0 at -500.**

Borna Gojo vs Quinn Vandecasteele | **Gojo ML at -364.**

**Combined odds: -192 (DK). 1 unit.**

Write-up: Gojo closed at -312, and while he faced a break point early in the first set, it was smooth sailing after that. 

Reasoning for the first leg is pretty simple: Hugo Nys is a solid doubles player, but he hasn&#x27;t stepped foot on the singles court in over a year. In fact, he hasn&#x27;t been a full-time singles player since 2020, with his only singles appearances since then consisting of two as an alternate into ATP qualifying (this can sometimes happen when no singles players are available on site), two as a wildcard into his home Monte-Carlo tournament, and two Davis Cup appearances due to a lack of options for Monaco beyond Valentin Vacherot. In the 3 Monte-Carlo appearances, he faced Munar, Ruusuvuori, and Rinderknech, had higher odds than this in all of those matches (even though I think this is an even tougher matchup), and lost all of them 2-0. He did actually score one win over Morrocco&#x27;s Yassine Dlimi at the 2024 Davis Cup; however, Dlimi is an ITF-level player, and Nys was still priced as a significant underdog. Bublik obviously has a massive advantage in this matchup, and the only concerns would be him not taking things seriously or Nys somehow servebotting his way to a set on indoor hard. In terms of Bublik&#x27;s motivation, I feel like he&#x27;s become a new player in that regard lately, and he&#x27;ll be playing in front of a home crowd in Astana, one of his primary training bases. In addition, the surface being used (GreenSet Comfort) isn&#x27;t known for being particularly fast, and it&#x27;s hard to see Nys consistently holding serve, especially as he&#x27;s far from the biggest server on the doubles tour. I expect Bublik to serve well and take control of this from the start. 

For the second leg of this play, I&#x27;m going with Gojo again, this time to defeat Quinn Vandecasteele in the quarterfinals. As I mentioned in my last write-up, I think this could be a week where Gojo wins the title, and I don&#x27;t see Vandecasteele being able to stop him. Quinn has had a long week, playing four matches back-to-back (6.68/10, 6.45, 6.61, 6.82), and I don&#x27;t see him at the same level as Boyer. If you want evidence, he was a +175 dog against Cassone in R32; Boyer faced off against Cassone a couple weeks ago and was favored. As a result, I don&#x27;t think these odds should be so close to where Gojo closed against Boyer. Vandecasteele is a solid grinder, but I don&#x27;t think he has the weapons to keep up with Gojo on these fast courts.</td></tr>

**Units:** 1 Units

**Explanation:**

Dalla Valle has been on a good run in this tournament already winning 4 matches and only throwing one set to a really well playing Bertola, who was just in a final last week. I see multiple reasons for Dalla to win this match

1) He is leading their H2H with a 1-0, winning their last match 2-0

2) He has played 4 good matches already and qualified to this tournament, while Romano got a wild card. I see him in better shape and form right now.

3) He is ranked better and got more experience than the young Romano, who is only 20 years old.

I see a good value in this bet and good luck!

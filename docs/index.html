**Event:** NBA: 76ers vs Bulls (8:00PM EST)

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Joel Embiid - o17.5 Points (-108 on Draftkings)

*Embiid is the Sixers’ half-court hub—elbow touches, delay action, deep seals—with Nick Nurse stacking empty-side PnRs and Horns to get him the mid-post face-ups he lives on. Chicago under Billy Donovan toggles drop/ICE with Nikola Vučević at the level or below it, which yields those free-throw-line and mid-paint windows and invites early seals on the roll—exactly where Embiid’s diet sits.*

*Joel isn’t listed on the Sixers’ injury report after sitting Sunday for knee-management; Paul George remains out, while rookie Jared McCain is set to debut—i.e., usage consolidates back to Maxey/Embiid. On the Bulls’ side, Coby White is out, Zach Collins (wrist) is out, and Ayo Dosunmu is on the report—Chicago’s perimeter pressure and big-man depth are thinner than usual.*

*The Bulls are bottom-tier in opponent points in the paint so far, and when Vučević has to protect the rim without Collins as a relief big, whistles pile up and the short-roll lanes stay available. Add a game total hovering in the high-230s, and the possession volume supports a clean 18+ outcome even without monster minutes.*

*Even on modest ramps, Embiid’s per-minute scoring pops—e.g., 20 points in \~20 minutes in his last short-stint outing—so it only takes a couple of deep seals, a face-up foul draw, and one elbow isolation to clear 18. With Chicago’s scheme conceding those mid-paint touches and Philly likely to spam Nurse’s empty-side actions to force Vučević in space, Embiid has multiple paths—FT parade, roll-seal, or face-up jumpers.*

*Bulls have allowed the 6th most points to bigs on the season, while Embiid has covered this line in 16 of his last 17 games against them. Even on a minutes restriction (which is trending beyond the 20 minute mark with 23 and 25 minute performances), he&#x27;s covered in the last 3 with an average of 23 points a game.*

*With a softer matchup, a tight spread of (+/-1.5), and the highest game total of the night (239.5), expect Embiid to get his slice of the pie.*</td></tr>

**Previous :**  Brugge -1 Asian Handicap &amp; Ole Miss -6 – WINNING

**Recap :**  Some issues with the initial writeup on Halloween night. Shout-out to those degens that pointed out the mistakes that were quickly corrected. Bet won, it was a group effort!

**New Event :**  UCL – Liverpool vs Real Madrid &amp; PSG vs Bayern

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:**  Dream Parlay – Real Madrid +1 &amp; Bayern +1 @ 1.68 (Usual 3 units)

Can&#x27;t believe I am doing this but it&#x27;s difficult not to. Either Real or Bayern on their own are good bets to win, as Double Chance or Draw no Bet, but getting a goal to spare and at over 1.5 combined odds, I just have to jump in.

**Leg 1**: Liverpool vs Real Madrid +1 Asian Handicap

Real Madrid have only allowed 1 goal in their 3 matches. They travel to Liverpool in high spirits and good form. Both teams have a few injuries but the big name that will be absent is newly signed striker Isak for Liverpool. Regardless, Real Madrid is just a better side at this point and we are siding with them to not lose to Liverpool by more than one goal.

**Leg 2**: PSG vs Bayern Munchen+1 Asian Handicap

Current Champions League trophy holders PSG, host Bayern. Considered to be in the best overall form at the moment and one of the few favored to claim this year&#x27;s trophy, Bayern are playing exceptional football. It&#x27;s hard to ignore their form and how they have simply been crushing opponents recently.

Worth noting is that PSG and Bayern squared off in July in New York for the FIFA Club World cup where PSG won 2-0. Since that loss, Bayern have won 18 in a row across all competitions, most matches by multiple goals.

Did I miss something folks?  Let me know in the comments.  Let&#x27;s win together.</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>**POTD Record 39-36-1**

Well, fuck that Bucks game went exactly like the worst-case scenario I called out.  
I was genuinely pissed when the Pacers went on that 11–0 run in the fourth and tied it late. I’ll admit, part of me wanted them to just lose outright. Then Giannis hits that turnaround jumper with two defenders in his face. Not his usual sprint-to-the-rim, whistle-drawing chaos, but a cold, patient, “I’m still that guy” midrange dagger. Holy shit. MVP-level moment.

So yeah, back to the drawing board. And I already know this next one is gonna make people cringe. But that’s usually where the good plays live. Deep in the mud.

**Pelicans -1.5.**

I’m making this bet early, and it’s mostly built on a theory: Zion plays. LaMelo sits. It’s not just a hope, it actually makes sense if you zoom out.

The Pelicans are 0–6, and every loss has looked worse than the last. They just wrapped up a brutal road trip where they lost every game and they head to Dallas tomorrow for a back-to-back. That makes this home game the perfect get-right spot.

They have to win this one. There’s no incentive to tank as they essentially traded their first-round <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> (ATL gets higher <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> of MILvsNO...) for the rookie, Queen, so losing helps them in absolutely no way. That’s key. This team isn’t built to play the “oops, maybe next year&quot; card. They’re fighting for relevance, and this is as winnable as it gets.

Charlotte’s schedule actually lines up perfectly for this angle. The Hornets don’t play again until Friday, which gives them zero reason to rush LaMelo Ball back from his ankle injury. He already missed the Utah game, and with Brandon Miller also sidelined, they’ll likely lean on the side of caution especially against an 0–6 team that looks dead on paper.

New Orleans, on the other hand, can’t afford to coast. They’re the definition of desperate. They average just 107.7 points per game (30th in the NBA) while allowing 125.8 (dead last). Yeah, ugly.

The stats are all screaming “stay away,” which is exactly why I’m leaning in. Charlotte is 3–4, scoring 121.6 points a night (8th in the NBA), grabbing 45.7 rebounds per game, and shooting better from deep and the line than the Pelicans. New Orleans is 0–6, just 107.7 PPG, giving up 125.8, and getting crushed on the glass (7rb margin per game).

It’s brutal. But here’s the thing, most of those Pelicans games were on the road, and they actually haven’t been outclassed talent-wise. Zion’s averaging 22.8 points per game, and Jordan Poole (18), Trey Murphy III (15), and Jeremiah Fears (14) give them scoring balance . It’s just been a matter of putting it together.

Charlotte’s got Miles Bridges (21ppg) carrying them offensively while LaMelo’s ankle limits his mobility. Without Brandon Miller spacing the floor, the Hornets’ offense gets predictable fast.

The Pelicans have the motivation edge. Full stop. They’re coming home after six losses, and they know they’ve got Dallas waiting tomorrow. You can’t go 0–7 and expect to show up in Texas with any confidence. Charlotte, meanwhile, has nothing urgent to play for tonight. Even if LaMelo’s close to ready, it makes zero sense to force him into a one-off against a desperate team before a three-day break. That’s why I’m getting in early. If Zion is confirmed in and LaMelo out, this line moves fast maybe from -1.5 to -3.5 or worse (i&#x27;d still bet it at that number too).

Look, I know this is gross. You’re betting on a winless team that’s been getting smoked nightly. But it’s a classic buy-low spot. New Orleans is better than their record. They’ve been awful on defense, sure, but they’ve also faced multiple top-10 offenses. Charlotte’s banged up, still figuring out their identity without Miller, and likely down their star guard. Ugly. Gross. And hopefully right.

PS: Bulls -1.5 tomorrow, because I just like the way this team is playing, and even with me being higher on Philly the first few weeks of the season than I was before it started, I think bulls win this at home.</td></tr>

Event: UEFA Champions League
2-Leg Parlay @ +219 (3.19)

(I know it’s over +200 but it’s worth it)

Leg 1: Arsenal to Win (-360)
📍 Slavia Prague vs Arsenal – 12:45 PM EST
Arsenal enter this matchup in dominant form, having won 7 of their last 8 across all competitions and keeping 6 clean sheets in that span. Slavia Prague may be solid domestically but lack the quality and tempo to contain Arsenal’s attacking trio of Saka, Ødegaard, and Martinelli. Expect Arsenal’s high press and precision passing to dictate play from start to finish.

Leg 2: Bayern Munich to Win (+150)
📍 PSG vs Bayern Munich – 3:00 PM EST
Bayern are a machine right now 15 straight wins, 54 goals scored, and only 8 conceded. Harry Kane is in unstoppable form (22 goals in 15 games), and the team’s balance under Tuchel is elite. Bayern’s midfield control and clinical edge give them the upper hand against a PSG side that struggles against top-tier European competition.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Cibona Zagreb ML (-110 Draftkings) vs. KB Bashkimi - FIBA Europe Cup

Last game of the group, 3-0 Cibona vs. 0-3 Bashkimi. They played less than a month ago and Cibona won by 14 and outplayed them in every way, Rebounds 41-34, Assist 23-15, Blocks 6-0. Bashkimi plays in Kosovo and the teams they play are mid, Cibona plays in a competitive league in Croatia. A big factor here was a h2h they both had in the group, Team called Reggiana, Cibona beat them 75-73, Bashkimi lost 100-65. I see too much value in this line not to take. If you are going off recent form Cibona did play their bench for majority of the game against Dubrovnik in their league so I think that also shows their are trying to be at their best in this Cup.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Don&#x27;t have time for a massive writeup <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> but there following things are true. 

- J League is significantly better than the A League 
- Australian teams don&#x27;t travel too well in Asian competition 
-  Melbourne City needed some late goals to beat Thai side, Buriram United at home.
-  Melbourne City lost both other Champions League games against Japanese opposition
-  The away game that City played in Japan was a late 1-0 loss where they basically defended for 90 minutes 
-  Machida are way more game ready than Melbourne City. The J League is 35 games in, and the A League is 3
-  Machida are undefeated in their Champions League games 
-  Out of all the games Machida have played this season (around 40), only two of them have cleared the o4.5 goal threshold

Last Pick: Antoine Ghibaudo ML vs Saba Purtseladze (-185, 1 unit) 

Tennis | Knoxville Challenger | 2:30 PM EST (estimated)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Oliver Tarvet vs Andre Ilagan | **Ilagan +1.5 sets at -120. 1 unit.** 

Write-up: Thought that might end up being my first non-CLV play in a while, but some late odds movement pushed Ghibaudo to around -250. He ended up winning the match pretty easily, facing just one break point. 

Interesting match here between Oliver Tarvet and Andre Ilagan. Tarvet has proven himself against top-level competition in college tennis (and at Wimbledon), so it makes some sense that the market has been giving him a lot of respect since returning to the pro tour this fall. However, Ollie honestly hasn&#x27;t been crushing it recently if you look at the raw results, and he comes off a really rough 6-1, 6-0 loss to Mats Rosenkranz in Charlottesville  (5.51 performance rating). He has quite a nice counterpunching game that he backs up with a solid serve, yet I don&#x27;t necessarily feel that he&#x27;s a master of indoor hard court just yet (he plays college tennis at UCSD, meaning that most of his tennis in the spring was outdoors). 

Meanwhile, Ilagan, who also played college tennis at Hawaii, isn&#x27;t as well known as Tarvet and doesn&#x27;t have quite the same ceiling. However, Ilagan has quietly been piling up some impressive results lately, taking sets off other top college guys like Jódar and Damm. One thing I want to highlight is that both players faced Iñaki Montes De La Torre last week in Charlottesville. Tarvet was a smaller favorite against Iñaki than he is here, and Ilagan was also favored by the market in that matchup, implying that the odds here should be a bit closer (in terms of results, both players found themselves in tough three-set battles, though Tarvet barely came out victorious). Is it a matchup problem? Maybe, but there&#x27;s no clear evidence for that. Ilagan has a nice lefty grinding game, and I don&#x27;t see him giving Tarvet tons of free points here. As I mentioned, Tarvet just got crushed by a different lefty, albeit one with a very different game to Ilagan, and it&#x27;s hard to avoid taking a hit to your confidence when you win just 11 points in an entire match. Overall, Ilagan should be coming into this match with plenty of confidence that he can take a set. I will say that I honestly prefer the ML as a market (I think that Tarvet&#x27;s form is quite questionable - there&#x27;s a chance he comes in strong and wins 2-0, but he could easily play another bad match and lose outright). If you can get that at 3.50 or above I would go for it (can&#x27;t take it here due to odds restrictions). For that reason, my official play is the set handicap, which I still think is worth a unit.

PROFIT/LOSS = +13.67

PREVIOUS BET = PSG to score over 2

RESULT = My previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> was really poor, PSG just didn&#x27;t have it and only scored one. Took a short break from posting after that <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> to try and build some momentum and after a few really successful days I&#x27;m back. 

TODAYS BET 

EVENT/S = Real Madrid VS Liverpool and Arsenal VS Slavia Praha

PARLAY BET =  Kylian Mbappe to have 2+ Shots on target and Slavia Praha Second half Goals UNDER 1 (No goals second half for Slavia Praha) @2.00

UNITS = 3U to Profit 3U

SUMMARY = Mbappe has been smashing this market all season long. He has played 17 games including internationals and only missed this market twice. Once when he scored but Real Madrid got shut out against Atletico Madrid and another time where he just had an off game but still managed 5 shots. So 2 very possible games are the only thing stopping this from being a perfect record. Coming into this game Real Madrid are in great form winning every game apart from the previously mentioned loss to Atletico Madrid and Mbappe has actually grabbed a goal in every game apart from 2. Liverpool on the other hand have had a really rough time lately. They have lost 6 out of their last 8 games and looked really poor. They did win their last match out against Aston Villa which was a decent result but even Villa weren&#x27;t completely shut out of the game, they had some decent runs of play and Liverpool still showed weakness which against Real Madrid should result in chances.

Arsenal have conceded 3 goals all season. 1 goal against Haaland in the first half, 1 goal against Newcastle in the first half and 1 world class free kick against Liverpool in the second half. They have been an extremely strong defensive side all season. Slavia play in the Czechia league so it&#x27;s really hard to judge their attacking talent so all we have to go off of against top teams is their 3-0 loss to Inter Milan. They had 3 shots all game and had an XG of 0.11. I don&#x27;t even see them getting a shot on target against Arsenal. Even if Arsenal rest some key players the style of play will still deny Slavia much of the ball and it should result in a convincing win for Arsenal. I feel this market is a lot safer compared to an Arsenal Win or Arsenal to score x amount of goals which is why I am not going for that.</td></tr>

Event: EFL Championship ⚽️

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Coventry City U6.5 corners vs Sheffield United 4U @ 1.80 (Bet365)

Write-up: Pretty big shock in the grand scheme of things as West Ham came away 3-1 winners to Newcastle for Nuno’s first win as manager. Despite the internal issues + fan protests the Hammers fully deserved that win looking a lot stronger than the Magpies throughout even when going 1-0 down. A corner-heavy first half saw Newcastle leading the count 5-4 before the game ended on 7-6 for West Ham for a sweat-free finish.

Coventry are sitting at the top of the Championship with one loss recorded all season. Under Lampard they’ve been playing some very attacking football and though it’s early days could be looking at a first stint in the Prem since the 2001 season after years of financial troubles and hanging in the lower divisions. Meanwhile this season has been a nightmare for Sheffield United, finding themselves in 22nd spot. Having been so close to being promoted last year (3rd spot and made the finals of the playoffs) losing their first 6 matches of the season was unexpected and they’ve hired Chris Wilder (again !) to change their fortunes. The Sky Blues have averaged 5.8 corners at home over their last 20 whilst the Blades have only conceded 3.5 per away match in the same time period. Adjusting for pressure from Coventry and taking into account more recent data gives an expected 4.8 corners for the home team.

That gives this play an estimated 78% chance of winning. I would take the probability down a notch slightly more considering how offensive they’ve been looking but Sheffield really are corner suppressors. They’ve conceded even below 5.5 in 18 of their last 20 (+ 9/10) whilst Coventry have covered in 7/10 so I still very much like the value. BOL !

PSG vs Bayern Munich

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> : Bayern to Win or Draw @1.64 for 5u

Bayern are in the best form of any team in Europe right now while PSG have big injury problems and a weak recent record against them. Bayern have won all 15 matches to start this season, which is the first time any team in Europe&#x27;s top five leagues has ever done this, and they have scored 54 goals while only letting in 8, showing they are unstoppable right now. Harry Kane has been incredible with 22 goals in just 15 games this season including 5 goals in 3 Champions League matches, making him one of the most dangerous strikers in the world. 

Bayern lost the last meeting with PSG at the Club World Cup in July, Bayern were the better team in the first half and conceded both goals only in the second half after Jamal Musiala suffered a very bad injury just before halftime, which completely destroyed the team’s morale and rhythm. Bayern have beaten PSG in the last 4 UCL games and PSG has failed to score in any of those fixtures, showing they know how to beat the French champions. PSG are missing important players for this match, with Desiré Doué ruled out for weeks with a thigh injury and Ousmane Dembélé not expected to start the game even though he just returned to training, which weakens their attack badly. Bayern is coming in this match after beating Bayer Leverkusen 3-0 while resting most of their best players, proving how strong their squad is.

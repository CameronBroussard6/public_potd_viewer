**Last Pick: N/A**

**NBA** | **Wizards @ Pistons** / **7:00 ET**

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** 🔥 Bub Carrington O4.5 AST 🔥

**Write Up:**  

With the team coming into this game a bit shorthanded after recent trades, there are clearly more opportunities opening up for the younger players, and Bub Carrington is one of the biggest beneficiaries. In games where McCollum and Middleton have been out, Carrington has seen a significant bump in minutes, logging 40, 39, 32, and 25 minutes, and he recorded 6+ assists in every single one of those games. 

Now with AJ Johnson also gone due to trade, Carrington should continue to see plenty of minutes at guard, regardless of game script. Even if this game turns into a blowout, it wouldn’t be surprising to see him stay on the floor, as teams often lean on younger players in those situations. He will have a lot of potentials, it’s just going to be on if his teammates are going to be able to put the ball in the hoop. But given the minutes trend, past production without key ball-handlers, and his growing role in the offense, I think there’s a strong chance he clears his assist line again tonight.

**Wager**: 1.15u to win 1u

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> Key Data/Summary:** This is the classic case of: when a weak offense meets a structured/disciplined defense. Maine has a bottom-10 offensive efficiency nationally, a very low assist rate, poor rim efficiency, and low free throw rate (this limits late variance). Vermont defensive profile shows strong half-court containment, paint denial that drive premier shooting, and low opponent free throw attempts. Their defense also does not show the tendency to &quot;soften&quot; with a late lead. The game is project as a below average tempo, and with possession counts limited, we see fewer paths to reaching 60+ points. Bad offense + low tempo + low foul environment + # priced a fair bit above my model projection (median outcome) of 54 points.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: MVG -1.5 v Bunting 

Competition: Darts PL

Sport: Darts 

Odds: 10/11

Reasoning: Based on their last two meetings this year, MVG has edged Bunting 6–4, beating him in both the Bahrain Darts Masters (which MVG won) and the Saudi Arabia Masters (where MVG reached the final).

This shapes up as a tight match. The Premier League selection controversy around Bunting adds variance: it could sharpen him into his A-game or weigh on him with extra pressure. That uncertainty is why this stays a 1-unit play rather than anything heavier.

Darts are coming back with another Premier League season, and we will be having matches every week for the next 16 weeks. 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> I am going to back &quot;Mighty Mike&quot; against &quot;The Bullet&quot;. Reason is simple, van Gerwen is a superior player, he leads their H2H 24-6, and there are many voices saying that Bunting shouldn&#x27;t have been nominated for Premier League in the first place, because there are better players around (Danny Noppert for example), adding additional pressure for Bunting that he needs to perform - but when you look at his resume, he is more likely than not to crumble under all this pressure. I do believe he is the worst player in the Premier League this season, much like last year, when he finished dead last.

**Upcoming match:** Telstar vs Go Ahead Eagles (20:00 CET)

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** BTTS &amp; o2.5 goals

**Unit stake:** 3U

**Odds:** 1.90

**To win:** 2.70U

**Recap + overview(?):**

Another push. Lyon just about managed to score a VERY lucky goal in the final minute of the game to give us a push. Luck is luck, I’ll take it after many unlucky last minute losers.

3/5 push/void in the L5 is bizarre. I am attracting them. Time to go for one that can’t be a push. Time to see some green!

**Write Up:**

I’ll keep this simple and very straightforward.

Telstar in the cup this year won 0-5, 1-4 and 1-3.

Go Ahead their cup games ended 1-1 and 2-2. Winning both on penalties.

In the league Telstar average 3.64 goals in their home games, scoring 1.55 on average themselves and conceding 2.09 on average. 82% of their home games saw both teams score.

They’ve failed to score in 18% of their home games and had a clean sheet in 0% of their home games.

Go Ahead in those same categories average 3.45 goals in their away games, scoring 1.45 and conceding 2.00 on average. 73% of their away games saw both teams score.

They’ve failed to score in 18% of their away games and had a clean sheet 9% of their away games.

H2H these teams played each other earlier this year. That game ended 4-2 in favor of Telstar.

xG at home is 1.49 for Telstar whilst this is  1.22 for Go Ahead in away games

Their xGA is 1.51 for Telstar and 1.81 for Go Ahead in their home and away games respectively.

I expect goals in this match and love to see it play out like their earlier game this season did.

Show me some green!

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: **West Virginia +5.5 (-108 DraftKings) 1U**

Event: CBB | West Virginia @ Cincinnati (7 p.m. EST) | 🏀

*Recap: USC Upstate led at the break, and we got there with 143. Should&#x27;ve been a lot higher, but UNCA scored just four points over the last 3:49 of regulation despite leading. Combined, these two managed nine points over the final four minutes. Gross. Onward!*

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s reasoning:** I *really* wanted to find something in the NBA tonight, but with all the trade dust still settling, it&#x27;s hard to dial in on a player prop or team trend. I *do* like the Raptors at -9, but not enough to put a unit on it. I will probably look at the Association again next week. Instead, let&#x27;s stay in the college ranks for a Big 12 slowdown between molasses and a glacier.  West Virginia (14-8) travels to Cincinnati (11-11) for a game of defense with occasional points scored. Look, I&#x27;m gonna forget that West Virginia already has a straight up win earlier this season - 62-60 on Jan. 6. Cincinnati is 9-13 against the spread this season. And when you play as slow as these teams do, every possession, every point comes at a premium. I don&#x27;t see Cincy pulling away. KenPom puts West Virginia&#x27;s adjusted pace at 361. Both teams have a defensive efficiency in the Top 35. Oh, and Bart Torvik has this game going 63-59 to Cincinnati.

I don&#x27;t trust Cincinnati to lay two full possessions to a team with a better conference record, even if they *are* at home. Speaking of, Cincy is 7-7 ATS at home and haven&#x27;t covered as favorites in three of their last five games. In fact, Cincinnati has failed to score 70 points in four straight games. When you&#x27;re talking about two possessions, it gets amplified with an offense that&#x27;s stuck in the mud. Meanwhile, WVU is 4-3 ATS when catching points, but they&#x27;re 4-1 ATS against Big 12 mid-tier teams (Kansas State, Arizona State, Colorado, and Cincinnati). I don&#x27;t like relying on WVU&#x27;s defensive intensity against the elites, but I like it here. West Virginia&#x27;s leading scorer, senior Honor Huff, had 24 points and eight rebounds (both season highs) against the Bearcats on Jan. 6. The last four times he&#x27;s cleared 20 points, WVU is a perfect 4-0 ATS. Let&#x27;s hope for a good scoring game from him. For what it&#x27;s worth, Cincinnati&#x27;s Moustapha Thiam is listed as questionable with a foot injury. If he doesn&#x27;t go, I love this line even more. The Bearcats want to operate inside, but they won&#x27;t have Thiam&#x27;s 10.8 points (third on the team), 6 rebounds, and 1.6 blocks.

Look. Both teams are 2-3 ATS over their last five, so something&#x27;s gotta give. I believe it&#x27;ll break for the Mountaineers, who at least have a winning record over their last 10 games, unlike Cincinnati. This is definitely more of a gut play than deep statistical analysis. I see that Cincy&#x27;s offense has been cold recently, and have no faith they can pull away. At home, it&#x27;s a coin toss if they cover which is... not ideal for the Bearcats. And West Virginia seems to cover just fine against teams of Cincy&#x27;s ilk. I&#x27;ll take the glacier to cover. And if this line goes to 6.5, I&#x27;ll double down.

Good luck and Godspeed!

Game: NHL- Predators at Capitals (6:00PM CST)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Jonathan Marchessault over 0.5 pts +120 (theScore Bet)

Going with a risky, but imo undervalued, one <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. So it&#x27;s not a secret that Marchy is starting to fall off from his Vegas days, but he&#x27;s still a solid contributor as a linemate with the Preds star Filip Forsberg on both EV and PP. His offensive metrics still rank in the top third in both xGF/60 and actual GF/60, so the opportunities are there.

The Capitals have solid goaltending, ranked 10th in SV%, but their defense is leaky, allowing 10th most shots and 6th most High Danger Chances. Their penalty kill also ranks in the bottom third, so there are several factors working in Marchessault&#x27;s favor. I&#x27;m willing to take the solid plus-odds for the risk.</td></tr>

Over 2 Asian Line in both matches @ 1.93 (0.5u)

Writeup: 

Leg 1 - Both teams have scored in seven of Go Ahead Eagles’ last eight away games and four or more goals have been notched in half of these. Telstar’s last match was a 4-1 defeat, with both teams finding the net in six of their last eight games, with four or more goals being scored in six of them. So, while this looks like a BTTS, im going for a safer over 2 Asian line, since Ive been having bad luck with btts for some time now

Leg 2 - Salford have won their last four away games, but they have only kept one clean sheet on the road in their last 12 League Two away days. Accrington Stanley have come up short against members of the top four recently, losing to Bromley and MK Dons at home, but they are in good scoring form and should contribute to a high-scoring affair at Crown Ground.

They have really shocked a lot of people. I&#x27;ve always been high on the Hornets and pretty big on Miller, and now he is finding his groove. He just won player of the week or month in the east... can&#x27;t remember. He plays extremely similarly to KD, and will be matched up against him tonight. Hornets have become dangerous, with one of the best defenses in the league and an offense that always seems to find a way to get hot during a game. They carry a lot of momentum into this game on a 7-game win streak. With all the starters playing, they are 11 and 3 since Jan 5, and 7 and 1 on the road. Hornets are also coming in on two days of rest. Rockets are ranked 28th in points allowed in the paint over their last 10 games. A lot of these Hornets are taking around 40% of their shots down there, while both teams rank highly in rebounds. Should be a battle and a back-and-forth game.

Reasoning: 

Back with another double <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> after yesterday’s win. 

This Coupe de France tie has strong statistical support for goals at both ends. Strasbourg have seen both teams score in the majority of their recent matches, netting and conceding regularly in their last fixtures. Monaco’s defence has also been relatively leaky away from home, having kept just one clean sheet in their last eight away games, while both sides have contributed to goals in many of their recent meetings.

As for Fenerbahce, they need the three points and are facing a much weaker second league side which they battered 5-0 last season in the cup. I don’t see this going any other way than a Fenerbahce win.

Write-Up:

This line feels short given the matchup. Memphis continues to be priced at a premium based on brand name, but they’ve been wildly inconsistent possession to possession. UAB is the more disciplined team, especially in the half court, and they rebound at a higher rate which limits Memphis’ transition opportunities.

At home, UAB’s efficiency and shot selection give them the edge in a game that projects closer to a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>’em than a true Memphis advantage. With the spread sitting at -2, I’m backing the more stable profile to win outright.</td></tr>

Anderlecht just fired their head coach. They lost the last 2 of their 3 matches and drew against the bottom team of the league. Why would we bet on them? First of all, I expect a reaction from the players. A coach getting fired most likely gets an answer. They will have to play with fire and passion in front of their home crowd.

The opponent is Antwerp. They fired their coach at the end of november last year. They have been putting up good results since. But their honeymoon phase is coming to an end. They lost against Charleroi and Dender (bottom team). Antwerp won their last match with 0-4, convincingly. But they did play against 10 men for 80 minutes.

We’re getting plus money on a Süper Lig giant against a second-tier opponent, which is rare and worth attention.

**Reasoning:**

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Beşiktaş ML (+105 / 2.05) vs Kocaelispor
**Sport:** Football - Turkish Cup

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Beşiktaş ML

**Odds:** 2.05 (Bet365)

**Confidence:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (4/5)

**Stake:** 100€ (1unit) (depending on bankroll)

Beşiktaş ML here is a classic case of the market overcorrecting due to “cup upset” narratives and expected rotation. Even with squad rotation, Beşiktaş’s depth, quality, and experience remain significantly higher than Kocaelispor’s. A rotated Süper Lig side still carries more individual talent and tactical flexibility than a full-strength second-division team.

Kocaelispor are well-organized and strong at home, but they rely heavily on defensive structure and limited attacking patterns. That’s a tough profile to maintain over 90 minutes against a team that can control possession and create chances through multiple channels. If Beşiktaş score first, the game script heavily favors them, as Kocaelispor are not built to chase matches.

From a numbers perspective, odds of 2.05 imply under a 49% win probability. I rate Beşiktaş closer to 60–65% to win this matchup outright, even factoring in rotation and away conditions. That discrepancy makes this a value play rather than just a “big-name club” bet.

I’m deliberately avoiding handicaps or goal markets here and sticking with the straight moneyline to keep variance lower while still taking advantage of the mispriced odds.

Final thought:
Not risk-free — it’s still a cup match — but at these odds, backing the superior team straight up is the disciplined play. The value lies in the price, not the badge.

Good luck if tailing 🤝</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Lakers -2.5 v 76ers

I’ve been on a roll right now. I should’ve started posting a week ago. 

For tomorrow’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, my money is on the purple and gold due to several things.

From my perspective: 

They’re at home, Austin is back, and regardless of how bad the teams they were up against, they showed how dominant they can be and I believe they’ll continue to showcase it against one of the best teams in the east. 

The chemistry is at an all-time high right now, so the boys want to keep it going as they make a push for 

For stats: 

On the last 5 games, the Lakers ranked 8th, while the 76ers ranked 18th in net adjusted efficiency.

At home, the lakers are ranked 8th in net adjusted efficiency.

On the road, the 76ers are ranked 21st in net adjusted efficiency.

The line is at -3.5 right now, but I want to kinda play it safe. 

Best of luck! Hoping we continue the streak.

On the other hand, Antwerp is coming off a great performance and it remains to be seen whether its performance can last. Today, the &quot;first half&quot; is played between two teams that have the cup as a priority, with the purpose of entering the equation of the match.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **Royce O&#x27;Neale u3.5 assists** (-147); 2 units to win 1.36 units

Write Up:  
First, the Suns and Warriors have played three times already this season. In all three games, Royce has gone under. To me this really isn&#x27;t that surprising. I always thought of him as more of a play finisher. However, looking into the stats, he disproves this somewhat. He averages over 40 passes a game and around 4.5 potential assists a game. Those are pretty high numbers especially for a three-and-D specialist like him.  
Even then, I believe in the Warriors defense. Most of their team roster is smaller (and versatile). Thanks to this, they run people off the three point line pretty well; their length, hustle, and IQ also help a lot. A lot of Royce&#x27;s assists come from the three, so if the Warriors do what they usually do, I expect the people receiving his passes to put the ball on the ground and do something of the dribble.</td></tr>

Somehow this one stuck when looking at todays games, the ideas are that Fener needs a win, and Fener has a good defense. I gave up on total points under since analysts predict another run and gun from Paris, and that they can&#x27;t repeat the terrible % they had in the last game. I think they can if Fener defense forces them, and they have the best defense in the league.

Still took the safer spread option for here, since the big picture is that Fener is in great form and they need a win to keep up with a top of the table, and Paris needs nothing here.

I also played some interesting combo ML + alt total under, though I am not a big fan of that.

NBA | 76ers v Lakers | 🏀  

Brunson cashes with ease, even gets 7 as he ends with 9. Wish he got that last one but I’ll take 5.5 and 7+, hope some took it too.

Oubre has been cooking lately and especially in games without Paul George who’s suspended for a long time. I know my Lakers and I know that we have a hard time guarding the wings, Oubre should get some good looks from three here and has been hot from the 3 point line lately with 4, 3 &amp; 3 threes in his L3.

With 16+ minutes and no Paul George, he’s over in 14/18 games this season.

With Embiid active and no Paul George he’s over in 8/9 games &amp; 8 straight this season.

Embiid is questionable for this game, but I still like this one even if he sits. Just had 15 on 4/12 shooting without Embiid against GSW and is getting great volume in games without PG regardless. Doubt Embiid wants to miss this game tho, players rarely do (Lakers bias) 

Oubre gets a top tier matchup aswell as Lakers have allowed the MOST points to his position this season. Dropped 20 points against the Lakers in his most recent meeting (last season) where he had 18 FGA without Embiid.

Great spot for Oubre, love his 15.5 PA aswell if you have that available. Time to feast big dawg</td></tr>

He went over that line for 3 games in a row now ever since Jack Hughes has been out of the lineup and with him still not available tonight, I expect another big game for Dougie. 

New Jersey shoots **a lot** when they play against the Islanders. In their 3 games against each other this season, the Devils have averaged **37 shots on goal**. Dougie had 7 shots in the last game between them. 

So by looking at the last 3 games without Jack and the fact that he went over that line easily in 2 out of his last 3 games against New York makes me confident he will go over again tonight!

Last Pick: South Alabama @ Appalachian State — Full Game Under 129.5

Result: ✅ WIN (Final total: 122)

Review: The game stayed under 129.5 because it played exactly to a mutual pace-suppression script rather than relying on missed shots alone. Both teams operated almost entirely in the half court, with limited fast-break opportunities and no sustained transition pressure. Shooting efficiency was modest on both sides, but more importantly, neither team generated easy points in the paint or at the line to inflate scoring late. The absence of foul escalation and the lack of urgency-driven tempo kept possessions long and scoring capped throughout. This was a clean structural under that won because the game never sped up.

College Basketball | NCAA Men’s Chicago State Cougars @ Central Connecticut State Blue Devils Wednesday, February 5, 2026 | 7:00 pm

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Full Game Under 138.5

Odds: -108 (DraftKings)

Write-Up:

This matchup sets up well for an under because the scoring ceiling is naturally capped by Chicago State’s offensive profile. Chicago State has struggled all season to generate efficient offense, especially on the road, and those issues are not pace-related — they stem from shot quality, finishing, and an inability to create easy points. When that type of offense travels, it tends to stay limited regardless of how the game unfolds.

CCSU doesn’t need to dominate or play slow for this under to stay intact. They typically operate in a controlled offensive structure and don’t push tempo aggressively when holding a lead. That matters here, because even if CCSU scores at a reasonable clip, Chicago State’s lack of scoring reliability keeps the overall total from inflating quickly. This is the type of game where one team doing “just enough” is still sufficient for the under.

The risk is clear and worth acknowledging: this under depends on Chicago State remaining inefficient. If CCSU has an unusually strong shooting night or Chicago State overperforms offensively, the margin narrows. Still, with the total sitting at 138.5, the market is pricing in more consistent offense than this matchup typically produces. Structurally, this game favors an outcome where the weaker offense sets the tone, not the other way around.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: Under 6.5 Goals (-135) 2.7u To Profit 2u

Write-Up: Jet Greaves gets a shutout and it ends 4-0, sweat free! Onto the next one, The Florida Panthers are coming to Tampa to play the Lightning. In net for the Panthers is Daniil Tarisov, he is having a good season for the 18 games he has been in net for them. Tarisov has a .904 save percentage and a 2.61 goals against average. For the Lightning, we have Alexander “The Great” Vasilevsky, he is a monster every season and this one is no different. This season, Vasilevsky has a save percentage of .918 and just a 2.14 goals against average which is insane. On the offensive side of things, the Lightning are strong ranking 2nd in the league in goals, but they are only 16th in shots on goal. On top of that, they are facing a Panthers goalie who’s been on fire and has a good save percentage. On the other side of offense, panthers aren’t really anything to be in awe of, ranking just 19th in goals. Both teams are great at limiting the shots which is going to be a key component. The Panthers defense is very good, with them ranking 5th in least shots allowed on their goalie, despite them not actually being in the opponents offensive zone as much as last year, so being that good at limiting shots is impressive. The Lightning are also great at limiting shots on goal, ranking 7th in least shots allowed on their goalie. With both goalies having high save percentage’s and both teams being elite at limiting shots on goal, there won’t be many opportunities to score, and these great goalies will be able to stop a big chunk of those shots that do get on net.

**Write Up:** Italy is by far the favorite to win the Gold Medal. It&#x27;s their first game at this Olympics and will be looking to come out strong especially playing in front of the home fans. They are playing South Korea who lost yesterday to Sweden 10-3. They started off strong against Sweden going 2-1 up before falling back. A little bit of controversy happened when they called the game early because they were told it was mathematically impossible to win with 2 ends left which was not true. It&#x27;s common to admit defeat early in Curling but normally it will only happen if it&#x27;s going into the last end or it&#x27;s mathematically impossible to win.   
  
Anyways Italy should win this one Handily but the Handicap of -7.5 is too much for my liking. I like the over in this one. Italy should have a couple of 3-4 point ends and South Korea might even score a point or two.

BOL anyone who&#x27;s tailing Looking Forward To a Great Olympics 


Edit: Terrible Bad Beat. Italy 8-4 South Korea going into the final end and South Korea Concede with 2 stones left to go so no points go up on the board and it finishes 8-4. Sorry about this one lads. And Congrats to anyone who got Italy -3.5</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Borna Gojo vs Tristan Boyer | **Gojo ML at -152 (DK). 1 unit.**

Write-up: Friend closed at around -220, so I feel okay about that loss. On to the next one.

Borna Gojo is a talented player who stands at nearly 2m tall and possesses a powerful game reminiscent of Marin Cilic. Injuries and inconsistency have been major themes in his career, but when he&#x27;s timing the ball well, it can be extremely hard to stop him. In the first round here in Cleveland, he scored a dominant 6-0, 6-0 win over the 17-year-old Jack Kennedy (7.64 performance rating). It was clear that Kennedy was overmatched, but I didn&#x27;t feel that he gave the match away with unforced errors; rather, Gojo was able to take control from the start, earning free points on serve and taking a strong court position in rallies. 

On the other hand, Tristan Boyer only earned a 6.64 rating for his 4 &amp; 4 win over Garrett Johns. I will say that I think the rating slightly underrates his performance, as his forehand was doing a lot of damage, and he showed some good resilience to not get broken back at 4-3 in the second set. Boyer has the serve and physical attributes to succeed on fast courts, but actually developed his game on South American clay. The result is that he has developed a one-two punch game with a heavy forehand, but doesn&#x27;t approach the net as much as he maybe should. However, once you&#x27;re able to target Boyer&#x27;s backhand, things start to fall apart. Johns isn&#x27;t a bad player, but he doesn&#x27;t have the weapons for these conditions, and found himself constantly on defense in their match. In comparison, Gojo has the weaponry to dictate, and his serve into the Boyer backhand should score pretty often. Boyer&#x27;s topspin also tends to fall in the strike zone of taller players, and he actually holds an 0-7 record against players 6&#x27;2&quot; or taller in the last 52 weeks. Overall, I see Gojo having the advantage in the serve and backhand departments, and I think Boyer will need to make a lot of first serves and clip a lot of lines if he wants to win this. Gojo won&#x27;t win with a double bagel this time, but he should be able to move on here.</td></tr>

The Czech team looked completely outclassed against Canada and Chabicovsky was particularly weak. Sweden is another very strong experienced team that will put a lot of pressure on the young Czech team. The bigger advantage for Sweden is actually with the women; Isabella was the best player on the ice in the opening draw and she should easily outshoot Zelingrova with draws and hits. Sweden are coming off a 10-3 win over a Korean team that I have ranked higher than the Czechs. Sweden won 10-4 in the only career head-to-head match between these teams. Should be another easy win for Sweden.

**Write up:** <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s pick</mark> is BANJORA who is resuming for its second preparation and second race start. On debut was slowly away but mustered to sit 4th/5th, and showed great grit to wear down the leader BENEVAC, who has since won and run in much tougher races.      
     
Since that run BANJORA has trialled on two occasions. Firstly finishing 2nd after showing great gate speed and leading the field, and was applied absolutely no pressure. The second he again began brilliantly and sat 4 wide round the turn, finishing full of running without being tested at all. This improved ability to ping the gates implies maturity and development, and bodes well for us in the race since drawing barrier 4. The likely leader is one gate inside us, so I imagine us sitting just outside and in plenty of clear air.     
     
BANJORA is also yet to see a firm deck, but with the trials coming on ground that was borderline soft/good, I have no doubt we’ll handle it fine, and there’s even the potential of an improved showing on such a track.     
      
I think we’re a clear standout here, and the only horse we’re gonna have to get past is JUST AWESOME, which I’m fairly confident we’ll be able to do. GL!</td></tr>

Game/League/Time: Counterstrike 2 (CS2) | Nodwin Clutch Series #4 | 7:00 AM EST.

**Nuclear TigeRES:**

* Ended 2025 on a crazy run of form really solidifying themselves as a top tier two team after rising from relatively out of nowhere in the middle of the year. 2026 so far has been relatively the same, they have a 14-7 record in overall matches to start out the year, they are 33-20 in maps played overall at a \~62% win rate
* They were a playoff invite to Nodwin so they did not have to get thru group stage, they have played two playoff games to make it to semi finals, they beat UNiTY 2-0 (13-8/13-2), and upset 9INE <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> in a dominant 2-0 (13-7/13-9) as 2.20 underdogs
* Roster is built well overall, solid IGLing from Senka, strategically they have some really cool strats for a tier two team, they have clear star players/strong fire power at the top with z1k4/flouzer the Russian duo, and m1quse/ayuki as more supportive players
* TigeRES are currently at #42 in the world rn, they desperately want to keep stacking wins and gaining VRS points to try to crack the top 30, every win counts a ton and losses would hurt significantly adding even more incentive

**illwill:**

* illwill roster really seemed like a thrown together PUG team but has actually been performing better and more consistently as they get more reps in tier two, a weird mixture of russian IGL nEMANHA, french rifler hAdji, Romanian&#x27;s adamS and 7kick who randomly became an AWPer and has actually been doing a great job at it, and ukrainian fostar
* illwill have a very strong record this year at 15-5 overall, they have been farming lower tier  teams/tournaments relative to TigeRES, beating some tier 3/low tier two teams while Nuclear TigeRES is mostly in the mid-high tier two, but still a very strong record none the less. They have a 31-15 record in maps this year so far. They won a forfeit in RO16, and beat Betclic 2-0 in quarter finals (13-8/13-3)

**Projected Veto:**

* Nuclear TigeRES are the higher seed, they have side choice, 90-95% will <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> to choose second, they had side choice in the R016 against UNiTY and chose to veto 2nd as well
* illwill ban Ancient, Nuclear TigeRES ban Overpass
* illwill <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> Mirage, **Nuclear TigeRES <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> Inferno**

**Inferno Stats:**

* Nuclear TigeRES are 84% winrate on 19 maps of Inferno in the L3 months overall. It is their third highest played map in the pool, and their highest win rate currently. They are on a 4 map winstreak on Inferno.
* This TigeRES core was 15-3 on Inferno in 2025, averaged 54% winrate on CT side, and 66% on T side
* illwill are 33% winrate on 9 maps of Inferno in the L3 months overall. This is their only map with a &lt;50% winrate in the map pool at the moment, and by far their most uncomfortable.
* TigeRES have some extremely impressive Inferno wins against quality teams to start 2026, they are 5-2 this year so far, beating Nemesis 13-5, EYEBALLERS 13-6, and VP 13-10, they also had a very close lose to Gentle Mates 19-15, who might be the best Inferno team in all of tier two, very strong stuff
* illwill have very mixed results on Inferno, blown out by Tricked/FNC, close losses to BASEMENT BOYS/UNiTY, wins over Bet-M and Ursa, and in the last week have two relatively bad losses to 1WIN/FAVBET 13-7 each (both are very strong Inferno teams). They also had a win vs. ECSTATIC on Inferno 13-8 a week ago who are decently strong, but they also won both pistols</td></tr>

Tonight NIP plays possibly the worst team in the LPL. I don’t see this series being close, with NIP closing these games out rather easily. 

JDG I believe are a top 3 team and TES are no pushovers, but JDG has already beaten them once this year and I see them doing it again. I don’t trust them to take the series 2-0 but I don’t see them losing overall.

Fenerbahce need a win here as they sit on 3 points from 2 games in the cup so far. While Erzurumspor are doing great in their league, they got beat pretty hard (1-3) by Kocaelispor in this exact cup, showing they still struggle with the top tier sides. Although Fenerbahce can choose to rotate some here, they still have good depth that should be enough for some goals in this one.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Juventus DNB@1.88 (Coolbet) | **Stake: 3.5u**

**Write Up:** 

* Atalanta have won 1 of their last 21 home games against Juventus…
* Spalletti have only lost 2 of 20 games since taking over Juventus 

After a bad start to the season under Ivan Juric, Atalanta changed the coach and it got better for a long time, but now things have slowed down. Atalanta beat Parma 4-0 last home game, but also in the last five, they drew against Pisa who are in the relegation zone, lost both Champions League games that they were also favourites in and were massively lucky to get away with a 0-0 draw against Como on Sunday. 

Juventus has much the same story as Atalanta, as they also have gotten a whole lot better after sacking their manager. I will say that they are somewhat reliant on Kenan Yildiz to score and create chances, he is pretty clearly their best player at the moment and there is maybe some concern that he will not play this game. 

I don’t expect fireworks from this game, but for my money I believe Juventus has enough about them to see this game through in normal time with a 1-0 win.  </td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: ⛳️ Si Woo Kim top 20 finish including ties (+105)

Tournament starts at 9:20am EST, finishes Sunday evening. Bet 2u

Writeup: First thing to note here is the price of the bet has been moving like crazy since Monday. I got this originally at +125, and has since moved anywhere from +105 to -130. Do a little shopping around to try to get the best value.

I’ll also note that Kim has anywhere from the 3rd-5th best odds to win this entire event, and yet he is still listed as a plus money play in some books just to make top 20. Let’s capitalize on this.

The Waste Management Open is known for its fairly easier greens, making tee-to-green and strokes gained metrics very important if you want to come out on top in this tournament. Kim is currently 5th overall in tee-to-green metrics over the last 5 events this season, and is 4th in strokes gained. He is also leading in strokes gained specifically in his approach shots. Recently, Kim came tied for 2nd at the Farmers Insurance Open and tied for 6th at the American Express. In this tournament specially, he placed tied for 21st in 2025 and tied for 12th in 2024. I expect the winning score to be around -18, and with Kim having a Greens In Regulation of 75%, along with his fantastic ball striking with his iron play, I expect him to have a lot of birdie opportunities to keep climbing up the leaderboards. Kim has been a bit varied in his putting, but has recently earned 1.2 strokes gained from his putting over the last 5 events. 

I will be willing to say Kim will have some of the most birdie opportunities this entire tournament, the question will be if he can convert. Even if he is average in his conversion rate, his iron game and metrics in this area have been so good that he should be able to finish in the top 20 by the end of Sunday. A plus money play makes it even better.

Remember to only bet what you can afford to lose, and BOL!</td></tr>

​<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Tundra ML @ 1.76 (5u)

​Write Up:

We’re taking Tundra ML again.

Xtreme Gaming loves to play slow. They want to drag games out, farm up Ame, and stall until they hit their timings. The problem is that Tundra doesn&#x27;t let you do that. Tundra plays a suffocating, objective based style that chokes out the map early. They don&#x27;t just kill you, they take away your map so you can&#x27;t drag out the game.

Tundra also defeated XG back in the last BLAST slam using this exact same style. XG might be able to drag games out against other teams, but Tundra is too disciplined to let them get comfortable. XG is good, but Tundra is just a bad matchup for them play style wise.

**Confidence: 90%**

**Details: Al-Okhdood (Akhdoud) vs Al-Hilal - Saudi Pro League - 12:30 PM EST**

**---**

**The last 2 have just been stinky, let&#x27;s get back to normal. We&#x27;ve got 1st vs 15th in the SPL <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.**

**---**

**Al Hilal have played Al-Okhdood twice this season and have covered this line both times, achieving 7 and 11 corners in those games. Over 4 in both first quarters.**

**---**

The Saudi Pro League hasn&#x27;t failed us so far considering we&#x27;ve only touched the 2 best teams being Al Hilal and AL Nassr. The title race between these sides just brews heavy sided stats that fall in our favour.

Al Nassr have closed the gap over these past weeks, With Hilal now drawing 3 straight games anything less than 3 points tomorrow is confirmed capitulation. Al Hilal dominate the ball and give their opponents little to feed off out of possession. Considering Goal difference has been overlapped, 1 goal wont dwindle corner chances tmr.

**---**

* **Al Hilal** Average 6.7 Corners per game in the SPL
* In Al Hilal&#x27;s last 8 away games they&#x27;ve covered this line 7/8 with an average of 8.25 Corners Per Away game.
* In Al Hilal&#x27;s last 10 games they&#x27;ve covered this line 7/10.

**---**

* **Al Okhdood** are joint second for most corners conceded in the SPL at 6.2 Per game.
* Al Okhdood are coming off 3 straight games conceding over 7 corners ( 7, 12, 10 corners) 
* Al Okhdood have played 7 games against the top 6 this season and this line has covered in 5/7 with an average of 7.7 Corners conceded PG
* Again, they have conceded Over 6.5 corners in both matchups against Al Hilal this season

**Match:** [Blanchet U.](https://www.flashscore.dk/spiller/blanchet-ugo/pSmNT7D2/) vs [Fils A.](https://www.flashscore.dk/spiller/arthur-fils/IoIhUqIN/)

**Bet:** [Blanchet U.](https://www.flashscore.dk/spiller/blanchet-ugo/pSmNT7D2/) with handicap 4,5 games at odds 1.66

**Units:** 1 Units

**Explanation:**

Ugo Blanchet has really played well recently and won some big matches. He is playing against Fils who have not played a lot this year and have been out for some months. The match is being played on indoor hardcourt and should support a close match. In fact Fils has only played 1 match against Royer, which was a close 3 set match and the latest match before that was back in October.

I believe Ugo&#x27;s great shape and matches indoors support him and Fils is in my opinion favored too big in this match up. Fils is the better player overall but as his current form is questionable, we need to play Ugo with +4,5 games.

I see a good value in this bet and good luck!

### ⚽ <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: River Plate Reserve ML @ 1.62 (-161) - 3 Units


We are on a **4-win heater**. After comfortably hitting the Racing <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> yesterday, we’re staying in the Reserve League (Proyección) because the books still haven&#x27;t adjusted to the massive gap between these squads.

* **River Plate (Home):** &quot;La Maquinita&quot; is a powerhouse. Their academy is world-class, and at home, they play with a level of intensity and technical superiority that mid-table teams just can&#x27;t handle. They are coming in with great rhythm.

* **The Fade (Talleres):** Talleres’ reserve side is in a complete freefall. They’ve managed to win only 1 of their last 10 matches, losing 6 of them. But here is the kicker: **they haven’t won an away game in 7 months.** * **The Play:** I’m bumping this up to 3 units. River is superior in every single department, and Talleres’ psychological barrier when playing away from home is too big to ignore. 1.62 is a gift for a mismatch of this caliber.


BOL!!!

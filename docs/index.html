Event NCAA Football
Ohio State @ Michigan  12pm Eastern
<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> Ohio State -9.5  (-110) 5 Units

Guys I know Joe is taking a break but I’m here to fill in. Ohio State isn’t losing this game again. Michigan’s offense is far too one dimensional and even if it wasn’t, the Buckeyes defense under Matt Patricia is different than anything we’ve ever seen in college football. If you all aren’t familiar Matt Patricia is the man behind the New England patriots sensational mid 2000’s Super Bowl domination. The buckeyes are running the New England patriots defense and there’s not a kid playing quarterback in the nation who can understand what he’s seeing pre or post snap. Bryce Underwood is special and I won’t take that from him but he’s too young and inexperienced to have any idea what he’s seeing from this defensive scheme that confused the best NFL quarterbacks and offensive coordinators of the recent NFL generation. Michigan is without Justice Haynes and he is arguably the best running back in college behind Jeremiah Love (not here to argue, hes top 5 in college) this makes life even more difficult on Underwood. Matt Patricia and this buckeyes defense is going to stifle Michigan <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. On offense I see another large advantage. The Buckeyes have been without Jeremiah Smith and Carnell Tate which are arguably the top 2 receivers in college right now behind no one. They will be back <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Last year’s game was funky because Ryan Day and Chip Kelly tried to muscle the trenches and beat Michigan at their strength to prove a point against Michigan which was terrible coaching, no doubt. I don’t see it happening again. Columbus Ohio lives and breathes this rivalry and that national title might not matter to anyone there if Ryan Day doesn’t let his guns fly <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Brian Hartline is the OC now who was formerly the WR’s coach, and the best in the business at it. Just take a look at what OSU receivers are doing in the big leagues right now. Brian Hartline is going to let this ball fly <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> and I don’t think any team in the nation can stop this passing attack. Julian Sayin is on pace to have the highest completion percentage in NCAA history, hes an extremely accurate passer with a lightning fast release and the ball just is not touching the ground in these games they’re playing. The buckeyes have been on cruise control all year keeping their snap counts down, holding their ace cards tight to the chest for the part of the season that starts <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. You will see plays that nobody has on film yet. They are playing a smart game this year looking to ramp everything up beginning with this game onward to the playoffs. It’s the biggest rivalry in sports <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. And Ryan Day might not be able to go back to Columbus tonight if him and Hartline don’t air this ball out. And I like the odds of that happening. It’s the non brainer <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> for the day, no doubt. Take the OSU Buckeyes to win by 10 and I’m personally laddering it up. Ryan Day is not going to stop scoring once they’re up. There is bad blood here with Michigan’s flag plant debacle last year.Good luck 🙏</td></tr>

**NBA | Pistons @ Heat**

This is one of the perfect matchups where I do not have to worry about a blowout. Heat is a fast-paced attacking team; they are playing at 105.89 pace in their last 10 games(top of the league). So there will be many opportunities for a rebound. They are again among the 5th in rank to give up defensive rebounds.   
Jalen, on the other hand, is the rebounder of Pistons. His average rebound this season is 11.8 RPG. In his last 9 games against Bam Adebayo, he has hit this prop 7/9 times when given 29+ minutes. GL 🍀.

NBA | Pistons vs Heat | 🏀  

8 in the first half and cashes immediately in the 3rd quarter we love those, cashes all bumps too. We move

Cade has been amazing this season and has set himself up to be in MVP conversation so far imo, most recently coming from a tripple double performance against the Magic dropping 11 assists where he also had 13 rebounds. My read here is to attack the assists at 9.5, but with the double double being at better odds with rebound upside I much rather take the Dbl dbl as we have to see his 10 points being a guarantee atp.

Facing my favourite matchup for assists and rebounds this season Miami Heat, who’s still ranked #1 in pace this season which is the reason we get a 239 total in this one. 

This is the same matchup Cade got his career high in assists against last season where he had 18 assists and in his latest game against the Heat he dropped 11 assists with 17 potentials, had a TD in both of these games (11 &amp; 12 rebounds aswell).

Has had a Dbl Dbl in 69% of games this season &amp; is over in 8/L10 games where he’s avg 9.2 APG (15.9 potentials) &amp; 7.1 RPG (10 chances per game).

Heat has allowed 6th most assists to PG’s this season.

Cade’s usage will be sky high per usual and I’m expecting Davion Mitchell to make Cade pass it a bit more than usual as he’s a great defender. Not a better matchup for assists than against fast pace teams like Heat, seeing good volume aswell with big upside in both departments.</td></tr>

Odds are TOO good here for both players and i am suprised they are even offered especially in stkae where you dont get as much freedom when going for alternate props

Draymond green has cashed the last 5 games by getting at least 6 asts in each of those 5 games. He also got 6 asts the last time they faced the pelicans. Pelicans also rank 6th in most pts allowed, so expect a lot of oppurtunities for draymond to be the facilitator he is

Saddiq Bey in the last 3 games has gotten AT LEAST 10 REBOUNDS with grabbing at most 14 rebs. He has also cashed this EVERY GAME where he has played over 25 minutes and with trey murphy now questionable he is sure to get 35+ mins and would still get around 30 if he does play

I am 50/50 on calling this a power play but didn&#x27;t feel like doing it back to back but nonetheless INSANELY good odds here

**Write up:**

We are going with a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> that sees two teams tremendously well in form <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. What happens when two teams in form meet eachother? Goals. Goals happen. So that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re betting on <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.

These two teams do not want to end their winning streak. Here&#x27;s an interesting fact for you: Since the departure of Erik ten Hag, Leverkusen has only lost to Bayern Munich and PSG. Topping this streak off with a win against Manchester City last Tuesday sees them as a slight favorite for the bookies. But don&#x27;t rule out Dortmund too quickly! They tore Villareal apart after a red card early in the second half: 4-0. Both teams are showing they can score against solid opponents. Let&#x27;s look at last weekend&#x27;s matches for both teams: Leverkusen beat Wolfsburg 3-1 &amp; Dortmund saw goals galore in a 3-3 draw against Stuttgart.

If we look at some stats for both teams this season it&#x27;s looking like it is going to be a goalfest:

Leverkusen have seen a total of 42 goals in 11 matches this season, that&#x27;s an average of 3.82 goals per match. Meanwhile Dortmund have seen a total of 29 goals in 11 matches, with the average there being 2.64. Slightly less, but their attacking force has contributed 1.73 goals to that average.

Leverkusen have scored in every single match but one so far, and you guessed it: the one match they failed to score was against Bayern Munich. Dortmund have scored in EVERY match so far.

Soccer | Liga MX | 10:10pm EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Tigres ML and Under 3.5 goals (+126 on FD) 1U to win 1.27U

Write Up: Liga MX is something I see none of on this thread but much like others find more success in challenger tournaments in tennis or women’s sports, I find the lines for these games are usually a lot less sharp than for more watched events.

Now it’ll be important to set up some of the context for this league to understand this game specifically. At the start of the season 18 teams compete for the top 10 spots in the league after 17 matchdays after which the top 6 are automatically qualified for a two leg knockout style tournament to decide the champion. Teams 7-10 look to qualify into this same tournament via playoffs. The winner of team 7 vs 8 is qualified into the tournament bracket while the loser plays the winner of team 9 vs 10 to decide that final ticket into the tournament bracket. 

Stay with me. 

This year 7th place Tijuana qualified into the tournament by winning that 7 vs 8 game and were set to play 2nd place Tigres in the reverse leg of this fixture. In that game, +200 underdogs Tijuana pulled off a 3-0 upset in front of their home fans. 

Now importantly, in the event of a draw there is no extra time in this format. The team with the higher position in the table automatically goes through to the next round. So, should Tigres find a way to tie this game 3-3 on aggregate (3-0 in this game) they’ll advance automatically. 

All this to say Tigres will come in highly motivated. Add to this that the previous H2H in this fixture was 7-1-2 AND the home fans at the “Volcano” as their home stadium is nicknamed and Tigres ML should be no sweat. 

But, do not expect a Tijuana side with 17 year old breakout sensation Gilberto Mora in the midfield to make things easy. I expect them to come out into this game mostly with the intent to control the game defend their 3 goal advantage to the death. After all they have conceded a formidable 2 goals in their last 5 games.

This one will be a real battle but I’m predicting Tigres come out on top with less than 4 goals in the game.</td></tr>

With that win in the books, I’m shifting focus to the Bundesliga <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. There are too many back-to-back NBA spots on the board, and I’m generally not keen on betting NBA weekends anyway, so this is a good time to change codes.

Bayern Munich vs. St. Pauli  
**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Bayern Munich -2.5 (Asian Handicap)** @ 1.91 (-110) | 1 Unit

I originally leaned toward Manchester City over 2.5 team goals, but since that play is already on the POD list, I pivoted to another spot I liked just as much. This is a classic bounce-back setup for Bayern after their unbeaten streak was snapped. They’ll be fully motivated to respond at home.

St. Pauli is the ideal opponent for a statement performance — they struggle to score and struggle even more to defend. At the Allianz Arena, that usually means trouble. With Bayern looking to reassert themselves, I expect a sharp, aggressive start and a multi-goal margin.

**History:** Been off for a while, but we back. Gonna be trying my luck at a $400-$10000 challenge (my unit size is $400), aiming for five straight wins to get to that magic $10k mark. Switching it up a bit this time - I&#x27;m a massive Pels fan (tough life trust me), and I know this team inside out, so for this run I’m only betting on Pelicans games. Hopefully we nail the five wins straight off the bat, but either way I’m grinding until we hit that $10k.

**Wager:** $400 (Day 1)

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** New Orleans Pelicans v Golden State Warriors | Derik Queen O 16.5 Points + Assists @ 1.83

Keeping it nice and simple for the first play. This line feels ridiculously low to me. Over his last five games, DQ is averaging 17.6 points and 6.2 assists, combined for 23.8 PA. His minutes dipped a bit in the last two games with Zion returning (17 and 23 minutes), but after watching last game we look so much better with DQ and Zion on the court that I expect his minutes to be trending back toward his usual 30 minute mark.

Watching the last game, we were WAY WAY better with him on the floor. With him and Zion on the court together the offence looks so much better its honestly insane. With Zion back and ramping up to normal minutes, I’m expecting the Pels to keep them out there together as much as possible, and Zion’s gravity alone should generate a bunch of easy looks for DQ inside. I’m adding the assists because we’ve basically started using DQ in a Jokic type role, and if we shoot even half-decent from 3, I wouldn’t be shocked if he racks up 6+ assists off dribble handoffs alone.

The matchup with the Warriors also feels great.  Pels have been playing much better recently, should honestly be 2–0 in the last two if we could close out games, but regardless we&#x27;ve averaged 120.4 ppg last 5 games and scoring has flowed much easier. Expecting this one to be the same. This one should stay close, and with the Warriors lacking any real big interior threat, I expect DQ to bully his way inside for most of the night, bro is 260 pounds.

Todays Event: Bournemouth at Sunderland / Leeds at Man City (EPL) @10:00am EST 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Todays Pick</mark>: Sunderland or Draw + Man City to Win (-105)  

Write Up: Simple read here. Sunderland is good at home. Last potd was backing them at home vs dogshit Wolverhampton. Bournemouth is a better squad but their away form this season has been poor. They have one win from six away games this season and Sunderland have not lost at home. Also worth noting I will like this play even more if Semenyo doesn’t not play for Bournemouth. He has been their best player. 

Man City is also at home. Coming off a midweek game where multiple starters were rested and they lost 2-0 to Leverkusen. City also lost last week at St. James. Now they travel back to England where Pep and the boys host Leeds. City have won five straight home games. Only losing their home opener to Spurs months ago. While Leeds only have one win away from home and it was to Wolves who I have been fading all season. 

Like this spot. Sunderland doesn’t lose at home. Coming off a loss with home fans turning up expecting a result. Man City has lost two games in 7 days. They have also been stellar at home. Seems simple enough. Hope both can bounce back. BOL.</td></tr>

NBA Toronto Raptors @ Charlotte Hornets | 6:00PM EST / GMT -5 (17 hours from time of comment)

Moussa Diabate 🫎 OVER 7.5 reb (-129 DK) 1u

________________

Write Up: This kid is trending upwards, get in on him while the lines are low like this. Yesterday he had 8 boards in only 18 minutes, compared to the starting center Kalkbrenner, who put up only 5 boards in 29 minutes. 

Moussa will start to get more minutes as his plus/minus led the team with +29 in 18 minutes (Kalkbrenner was -22 in his 29 minutes!)

If the Hornets want to compete on a nightly basis they need to give the Moussa more minutes. Even if he only plays 18 minutes he has a good chance of hitting this line. 

I’ll probably ladder him at 9+ and 10+ as well. BOL!</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>⭐️:🏈Oklahoma ML/Alabama ML (-128) \[Caesars\]

Start Time &amp; TV: 3:30 &amp; 7:30pm EST (ABC)

Units: 4 Units

Reasoning: For this rivalry Saturday we will be going with a two legger with the Crimson Tide and the Sooners. The Oklahoma Sooners are coming off three consecutive ranked wins in a row defeating Missouri, Tennessee and Alabama and they are facing a LSU squad that just barely squeaked by Western Kentucky in a buy game 13-10. The Tigers will be playing without starting quarterback Garrett Nussmeier who is dealing with an abdominal injury and they are going with Micheal Van Buren under center and their offensive has been extremely ineffective with him taking snaps so I like going with the Sooners in a win-and-in scenario for the college football playoffs at home in this one. LSU is 0-4 against currently ranked squads and are 0-3 on the road in conference play so all signs point to the Sooners running away with this one in Norman. I also like Alabama in the Iron Bowl as the Tigers have played very poorly in conference play this year with a 1-6 conference in the SEC with their only win being against the bottom feeder of the conference Arkansas and I think the difference maker in this game with be the pass game on both sides of the ball for the Tide. Ty Simpson has been balling under center for the Tide averaging over 290 passing yards per game, a touchdown to interception ratio of 22-4 and averaging over 8 yards per attempt through the air. Alabamas pass defense has also been outstanding this year allowing less than 150 passing yards per game with the 4th rated pass defense in the FBS while also allowing less than 17 points per game. On the other hand this Auburn Tigers pass defense has been gashed in the passing game ranking 100 out of 136 schools in pass defense so I think Ty Simpson will have another Heisman caliber game in this one. Im honestly suprised the Alabama moneyline odds arent steeper than what they are so I think we are getting good value with this parlay here.

Prediction: 27-17 Oklahoma, 30-24 Bama

Last pick:🏈Texas A&amp;M ML💩A nightmare second half from the Aggies there.

**Maka U 7.5 Headshots Map 1 (-208)** 

* Maka is the AWPer of 3DMAX, his team comes into the 2nd stage to take on fnatic, they are -160 favorites and since 3DMAX are the higher seed, very likely to start on CT side (**in stage 1, the higher seeded team started on CT side in 19/20 games)**. 
* Fnatic ban Nuke/Inferno, 3DMAX ban Mirage/Train and likely Ancient, leaving Dust 2 or Overpass as the potential map with Ancient as a lingering possibility.
* Maka has worse stats on all 3 maps then his regular KPR average dropping significantly on 2/3 of the maps while his Dust 2 is relatively at average. His headshot percentage also drops on all three maps some significantly by 4+%. 
* Maka has an 84.2% under hitrate on projected maps on this line which is very high for an AWPer, even though Maka is definitely a better rifler then most AWPers are.

**W0nderful U 6.5 Headshots (-200)** 

* W0nderful is the AWPer of NAVI, his team is also coming in off a long break to take on FlyQuest, they are -260 favorites and they are the higher seed meaning they are also very likely to start on CT side
* FLY ban Nuke/Ancient, NAVI ban Overpass, Inferno, and likely Dust 2 FLY will <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> Mirage or Train
* W0nderful has average/slightly above average stats on the two maps combined (better on Train, worse on Mirage) However his headshot percentage drops significantly going from 32.9% in the L3 months on all maps to 27.3% on projected ones. At this headshot % it would take him roughly 25 kills to hit this line
* W0nderful has an 82.1% under hit rate on the projected maps in 2025, with a near perfect hit rate in the L3 months on the projected maps

**Conclusion:**

* Model estimates a 75.6% chance of both plays hitting while this play is priced at +122 odds with an over 30% edge. Love both lines a ton</td></tr>

Sport: English Premier League - Fulham vs. Tottenham @ 3:00pm EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Fulham Tie No Bet = +125 (5 units)

Write Up: For this I asked myself one simple question, is Tottenham a bounce back team? My answer is no. Despite the fact this is a home game for the Spurs, they’ve been battered these last two games to Arsenal and PSG. The international break (where some Spurs players had to travel), Arsenal and PSG games were all within the last 10 days, I don’t think the Spurs have the resiliency. Furthermore, according to FotMob app, the Spurs will be missing Romero (red card), Maddison, Solanke, Kulusevski and Bissouma. As for Fulham, they’re a team who takes few risks and look incredibly frustrating to play. They’ve had time to fully rest up and prepare. Chances are this ends in a draw, but I Iike these odds. 

As always, I’ll update based on lineup announcement.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: 4 units on Alabama -6 (-105)

Excited to finally be able to contribute and share my insights as this will be my first <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> in this thread. I try to keep my rationales very straight-forward and to the point and don&#x27;t try to over-analyze stats or trends. 

For example, I was all over the dogs on the NFL slate (packers ML bc it felt like a game lions would struggle in without Ben Johnson, cowboys moneyline bc their offense has been clicking and they&#x27;re playing with new purpose after the unfortunate tragedy two weeks prior, bengals spread bc Burrow return and the Ravens struggling on offense esp since Lamar came back from injury, and Bears ML since the eagles offense has also been sputtering, and this was the first true test all season for Ben Johnson&#x27;s bears). Overall, went 4-0 in this slate and excited to keep my foot on the gas pedal moving forward. Simply put, in conjunction with my model, I use the eye test as well as my gut feeling to play what I believe is the most-valuable <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> on the slate. Alabama enters the game with a stronger record and a higher ranking. I anticipate Auburn to have difficulty sustaining drives, and Alabama&#x27;s offense, led by Ty Simpson, to show consistency throughout the game that will allow them to keep Auburn at bay. Auburn has had an inconsistent season and I anticipate them to lose by a touchdown tomorrow. I was skimming through the thread and did see that I am going against the one of the top cappers which was unintentional on my part, but cheers to a great game, and please remember to gamble responsibly and to only wager what you can afford to lose.

Tennis | Temuco Challenger | 9:00 AM EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Federico Agustin Gomez vs Alafia Ayeni | **Over 20.5 games at -110 (FD). 1 unit.**

Write-up: Mejia closed at +134, and played a great match after a tough start. The crowd was behind him the whole match, and he seemed extremely pumped up after getting it done in straights. **That play brought me to 10 wins in a row, my best streak ever!** Still, make sure to tail responsibly, as no play is guaranteed to hit. 

Interesting match here between Fede Gomez and Alafia Ayeni in Temuco, a rare hard-court event on the SA calendar. Ayeni has made an incredible run here in Temuco, beating clay-courters Nicolas Kicker and Juan Manuel Cerundolo as a big underdog. What I think has played in Ayeni&#x27;s favor  is that he actually came into this event with pretty fresh legs, which is a massive advantage at this point in the season. He also plays with a serve-and-volley style that&#x27;s almost entirely unseen in the modern game, and those two things have combined to make him a really tough opponent to deal with. 

Fede Gomez, meanwhile, is a player that has the potential to be an all-courter, but still structures his season primarily around clay courts. A possible reason for this is that Gomez has struggled (and continues to struggle) with various different injuries, and clay courts tend to be lower-impact on the body. Gomez has been decent in his first three matches, but he is coming off a three-set battle with Facundo Diaz Acosta in the third round, and also made it deep in Guayaquil last week. Another thing I want to highlight is the serve and return performance of each player, as Tennis Insights tracked each of their second and third round matches. Ayeni recieved an 8.0 and 6.9 serve rating in his matches, while Gomez&#x27;s return rating came in at 4.0 and 6.5 (shot quality is scaled so that the average player&#x27;s return rating is not lower than their serve rating). If Ayeni is able to consistently hold serve, it&#x27;s possible for him to cover this without winning a set, which is one reason I went for this over the set spread.

Even if Ayeni likely won&#x27;t be able to sustain his success in future tournaments, that doesn&#x27;t make his first two matches a fluke. The circumstances simply make it easier for him to do well, and the odds here are quite tempting. Gomez was priced around these odds in R2 against a mid-tier ITF player in Daniel Nunez, and I don&#x27;t believe Ayeni should be close to Nunez in odds given the caliber of his recent wins. Sure, the market didn&#x27;t adjust its priors that much after the Kicker match, but the Cerundolo result feels like a turning point, and these odds have already started to drop. Gomez is happy to trade heavy groundstokes from the baseline on slow hard courts, but Ayeni should be primed to take him out of his element. Gomez&#x27;s overall level is obviously higher, and I expect him to work things out as the match goes on. However, it&#x27;s hard to see Ayeni making this easy with so much motivation and momentum on his side. Regardless, the margins are thin enough on this play that I would only take this up to around -120, and would only take o21.5 at +100 or better.

Barcelona has Over 1.5 goals in their last 16 matches out of 21. Under 1.5 goals are against big teams like Chelsea, PSG. So, It has more probability that Barcelona will score more than 2 goals in their home match <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.

Congratulations are in order!!!

**Now to the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>:**

More than 20 years after being relegated to the lower division from the Premier League, Coventry are securing their promotion back to the top flight in spectacular style. They are simply destroying everyone in their path. They have not only won 10 of their last 11 matches, but sit at the top of the table 10 points clear of second place Stoke, and with a +30 goal differential. Coventry play at home and host 16^(th) place Charlton with a -3 goal differential.

Not sure what to add here other than at home Coventry have the best record in the league with 6 wins and also have the best goal differential with +16.  This is simply a huge mismatch. Coventry have not lost at home all season and although their star striker Brandon Thomas-Asante will be sidelined with a thigh injury, Charlton do not offer much of a threat regardless.

There is little doubt that Coventry can easily pull off a win at home against Charlton. A -1 asian handicap gets us a push should they only win by 1 goal.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Manchester City -2 Asian Handicap | 2 units

Write Up:

We kicked things off nicely yesterday with ADO Den Haag winning 0-3 at VVV Venlo, comfortably cashing the -1 Asian Handicap. A strong start to open the record.

For Saturday I’m going with Manchester City -2 on the Asian Handicap. City at home has been as reliable as it gets. They’ve won their last 5 out of 6home games in all competitions by at least two goals, and they’ve looked dominant doing it. Against Leverkusen we saw plenty of rotation and rested players, something I don’t expect at all against Leeds with Premier League points on the line.

Leeds, on the other hand, have struggled badly away from home. In their last five matches they average only 0.8 goals, and they’ve lost every away game this season except their visit to Wolves, who sit at the bottom of the table with 2 points after 12 played. They also got blown out 5-0 at Arsenal, showing how vulnerable they are defensively against top opposition.

City should come out with full focus, full strength, and enough firepower to win this comfortably. Haaland, Foden, Cherki, Doku, Savinho, Reijnders are all big threats to the defence of Leeds. Also Haaland can get is 100th premier league goal which I think is a record for quickest if he gets at least one goal against Leeds, which is extra motivation for him. A 3-0 or 4-1 type of scoreline is very realistic as I just don’t see Leeds keeping it close, and the -2 line gives us a push if it lands exactly on two goals.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:  **Penn State -13.5 (-120) 1.2U**

Write-Up:

These past 2 weeks have been refreshing, when watching this Penn State team play. They are finally getting the job done, especially in the games they are supposed. Now they get a match up against a Rutgers team that has clearly been struggling this season. They should be able to continue with this momentum and completely roll Rutgers.

The main proponent of Penn State&#x27;s success has been the re-emergence of the running game. They have 2 stud RBs in Kaytron Allen and Nick Singleton. This duo has over 200 rushing yards combined in their last 2 games. Rutgers is currently ranked as the 129th of 136 teams against the run. This will be the exact area that Penn State will look to exploit. I&#x27;m expecting another 200+ yard performance on the ground where the Nittany Lions are able to completely control the game clock.

The cherry on top is what Terry Smith has done in his little time as interim head coach. He has been a breath of fresh air, especially as Penn State needs to finish out this season strong. After the firing of James Franklin, they just about lost every single recruit from the 2026/2027 classes. Including 5-star RB, Kemon Spell. Finishing the season on a high note will give incoming recruits hope for the program moving forward.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Nick Woltemade 2+ SOT (+245) 1 unit to win 2.45 units

**Write Up:** Malen came through for us in 27&#x27;, ending the first half with 2 goals and 3 SOT. Game played out much as expected and we wound up with a great sweat free holiday win! 

We&#x27;re back after a day off and headed to Everton as they host the Newcastle Magpies for a middle-of-the-table match. We are backing Newcastle&#x27;s 6&#x27;6&quot; tall center forward to get 2 or more shots on target. I waffled a while over ATGS for worse odds, or even O1 SOT (push at 1 SOT), but I ended up going with my gut and the better odds of 2+ SOT. I actually think ATGS (while I like it) is the riskier <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> even though the odds are lower, as Pickford is a tough keeper to beat. 

My love for the lanky German (I do not think this is an official nickname, but I heard an announcer call him that during a match one time and it stuck with me), is no secret. He&#x27;s a true center forwards&#x27; center forward. He&#x27;s usually the tallest player on the pitch, always chases the long ball, and tries to head every cross. He&#x27;s coming off of a 2+ SOT match against Man City and 3 goals in two games during the international break. He got most of the mid week UCL match off this week so I expect him to be fresh and play most of the match <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. The man is on fire and I expect that to continue here. 

The other reason I like this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> is that Everton does not handle big center forwards well. Comparing Woltemade to some similar style strikers against Everton - last match at United Zirkzee had 3 shots (2 SOT), Haaland had 5 shots (4 SOT, 2 goals), Matetta had 3 shots (2 SOT). They just don&#x27;t have the height to deal with tall strikers and our lanky German has 2&quot;+ height on all three of those guys.

It was the perfect start with Feyenoord getting ahead on 12 mins, it was an even game to be fair to Celtic, they got level with their first shot on target, a ball to the back post and the keeper should have closed this down, a horrible night for him

He then completely gifts the Celtic goal to go 2-1 up, to slow to get the pass out and it went straight to the Celtic forward to score into an empty net.

Teams very rarely come from 2-1 down, that individual error cost us for sure.

Celtics first win away in Europe since 2021, first win in the Netherlands in 24 years, and all with an interm manager, just never seen it happening.

Manchester City Vs Leeds United 

**Manchester City win and over 2.5 goals**

(1.66) 3 units 

These odds are just a bit short for me, hence the 3 units, I am personally adding in over 0.5 first half goals to bring it up to 1.80 , I am aware only aloud 2 legs on here.

Manchester City will look to bounce back after back to back defeats, the away loss to Newcastle is nothing to concern me, they played well and Newcastle is a very difficult place to go they&#x27;ve been consistently good at home.

During the week in the Champions League, Pep shockingly made 10 chances to the usual starting 11, and that cost them, a bizarre decision to rotate in the Champions League when he has such a favourable fixture Vs Leeds at the weekend.

There strongest 11 come into this game rested and it&#x27;s a very favourable fixture for them, before losing to Leverkusen they had **won their last 7 home games in a row** scoring at least 2 goals in all of them and **scoring at least 3 goals in 5 out of 7of those matches**

Leeds away data and underlying numbers make poor reading for them. **They have lost their last 3 away games in a row** 3-1, 3-0 and losing 2-0 to Burnley who have one of the worst attacking outputs in the league.
They also suffered a heavy 5-0 away loss to Arsenal in the season.

Leeds are also without key midfield pairing Longstaff and Stack, who have both played almost every game this season, this will really hurt them in the key area of the pitch, now more likely to lose key battles in midfield will give City even more goal scoring opertunites.

**If you want to boost the odds on this feel free to add Haaland anytime goalscorer at 1.44** , I would be beyond shocked if he didn&#x27;t get at least one, I am also putting .5 units on him to score 2 or more at 3.25 

**Haaland has scored 2 or more goals in 10 matches in all competitions this season, an outrageous stat!**

Last Pick: Michigan State ML (-130) (2U)✅

[MSU write up](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/s/yDIx0GgnVr)

MSU is a top 5 team in the nation, argue with a wall, like I said that defense combined with the shots starting to fall is no good for any one of their opponents! That win brings us to a 4-1 record for our 2 unit hammer plays 😤

Event: Auburn vs Alabama “Iron bowl” (NCAAF) (6:30pm central)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Auburn +5.5 (-110) (1U)

-everything is bet to win unit amount-

Write up: 

Auburn +5.5 is the right side in the Iron Bowl because the matchup, the history, and the motivation all point in their favor. Alabama’s offense has been far too one‑dimensional this season, leaning heavily on the passing game because the rushing attack has been ineffective. The Tide average just around 123 rushing yards per game and only 3.7 yards per carry, numbers that rank near the bottom of the SEC and expose their inability to control the line of scrimmage. That weakness plays directly into Auburn’s strength, as the Tigers boast one of the nation’s most formidable rush defenses, allowing under 95 yards per game and holding opponents to just 2.7 yards per carry. When Alabama is forced into predictable passing downs, Auburn’s defensive front can attack with pressure, which has been the formula for keeping games close against elite opponents all year.

The matchup against Oklahoma at home certainly reinforces these ideas. I believe OU plays very similar to Auburn and the tape is out on how to beat bama!

History reinforces the value of the points. Alabama has won four straight in the series, but no team has ever won five in a row, and the last three meetings at Jordan–Hare have all been decided by three points or fewer, including Auburn’s 48–45 win in 2019. Rivalry dynamics consistently compress margins, and catching more than a field goal at home is a gift in this spot. Auburn enters at 5–6, needing a win to secure bowl eligibility, while Alabama must win to keep its playoff hopes alive. That double incentive guarantees maximum intensity from the Tigers, who would love nothing more than to end their rival’s season while extending their own.

Auburn has also proven resilient all year, as none of their six losses have been by more than seven points, which makes catching +5.5 even more valuable. Betting trends add another layer: Alabama is just 2–5 ATS in its last seven SEC road games, while Auburn has covered in three of the last four Iron Bowls played at Jordan–Hare. With the spread sitting at 5.5 and the total around 46.5, oddsmakers are signaling a lower‑scoring, possession‑driven game — the exact environment where a home dog thrives.

Put it all together: Alabama’s run game inefficiency, Auburn’s elite rush defense, the rivalry’s historical tightness, Auburn’s motivation for bowl eligibility, and their track record of keeping games within one score. The matchup, the number, and the context all align. The bet of the day is Auburn +5.5, and it’s backed by stats, history, and market logic. As always, cheers 🍻</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'><mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>: Tottenham @ 2.25 (CircusNL) 

Last pick: Yokahama F Marinos DNB @2.20

Profit: +€1022.50

I know... Tottenham been shite at home, but Fulham are too. Away from home Fulham are tied last with Wolves, being 1-0-4 on their away trips. And Tottenham, well they are 1-2-3 at home but this can be explained. 

When looking at Spurs their opponents at home, they were United (D), Chelsea (L), Villa (L), Wolves (D), Bournemouth (L), Burnley (W). So against all teams which are above Spurs in the ladder, Tottenham lost. And the 2 draws could be considered good against United and somewhat unlucky against Wolves.

On the H2H side Tottenham are 11-5-2 against Fulham.

With Tottenham having a very bad home record and them being on a losing streak, this is the perfect game to gain momentum back with all the pressure on Spurs to get a good result in front of their fans.</td></tr>

Indykpol AZS Olsztyn - Trefl Gdańsk 🏐 Poland Plus Liga

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Total Points Over (177.5) @ 1.55

First of all, it&#x27;s important to note that neither team is in a position to pull off a big victory. Olsztyn started the season with a tie-break loss to JSW, followed by a tie-break victory in Bełchatów (Skra), and a decisive 3-1 away win at Barkom on November 3rd. Trefl Gdańsk has added strength to their squad with strong summer signings (Piotr Nowakowski, Joseph Worsley, Tobias Brand, Damian Schulz, etc.). They beat Barkom 3-2 in the league opener, 3-0 against Ślepsk in Week 3, and lost 1-3 away to Resovia in Week 2. Total points of AZS Olsztyn in 3 matches in 2025/26: 2-3 against JSW (23-25, 25-19, 25-17, 18-25, 11-15) = 203; 3-2 against Skra (21-25, 25-18, 17-25, 25-19, 18-16) = 209; 3-1 against Barkom (21-25, 25-19, 27-25, 25-23) = 190. Trefl Gdańsk in 3 matches in 2025/26: 3-2 against Barkom (19-25, 25-20, 20-25, 25-19, 15-8) = 201; Resovia 2-3 (25-19, 23-25, 23-25, 25-23, 13-15) = 216; Ślepsk 3-0 (22-25, 23-25, 23-25) = 143. In the Barkom-Olsztyn match, Barkom made 32 unforced errors, Olsztyn 23; errors like these are a good sign for us to extend sets. I expect the match to go at least four sets, and I expect Trefl to not give up easily.</td></tr>

Last Pick: Jay Clarke ML vs Stefan Kozlov (-142, 1 unit): Win

Tennis | Helsinki Challenger | 10:30 AM EST (estimated)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Otto Virtanen vs Emil Ruusuvuori | **Virtanen ML at -137 (DK). 1 unit. **

Write-up: Clarke closed at -177, and ended up getting the win in an up-and-down three-set battle. 

This should be a fun all-Finnish encounter in Helsinki, but it&#x27;s also one where I believe one player holds a distinct advantage. Both of these players have risen from the ashes recently (Virtanen from an injury, Ruusuvuori from a mental health break). For that reason, the market has started to like them more and more, and you can see this in their falling odds against the same tier of player from the beginning of their comebacks to now. This makes it a bit tough to do odds analysis, since the magnitude of each player&#x27;s rise is hard to quantify, and it&#x27;s easy to make errors comparing prices from different tournaments. However, Virtanen&#x27;s comeback has been especially impressive to me, as he made it through a decent draw in Roanne to capture the title in just his fourth tournament back. This is a great time of the season for Virtanen to make an impact, as indoor hard courts have consistently been his favorite surface throughout his career. His huge serve + 1 combination and generally aggressive game allow him to blow past opponents on the surface; in fact, 5 of Otto&#x27;s 8 Challenger titles have come indoors. I will note that Helsinki plays a bit slower than most indoor hard courts, but the lack of wind and natural conditions are still beneficial for someone with a low-margin game. In his first round of this tournament, the market pushed Otto from -300 to -455 against Gauthier Onclin, showing the confidence it has in him in these conditions. He also went on to take the match in straight sets (7.18 performance rating). 

Meanwhile, Ruusuvuori got a solid first-round win as a sizable favorite over Lukas Neumayer, who tends to prefer clay courts (7.05 performance rating). There&#x27;s no doubt that Emil enjoys these conditions as well, even if his game relies more on movement and clean ballstriking and less on power compared to Otto&#x27;s. However, I can&#x27;t quite say that he&#x27;s had a breakthrough performance yet. A lot of people will rate the performance he put in against Mpetshi Perricard in Brussels highly, but it was kind of a lottery match in a way that a lot of GMP&#x27;s matches tend to be. At the end of the day, I do think Virtanen&#x27;s weapons should do more damage, and it&#x27;s hard not to feel that he comes into this tournament with a bit more momentum. This isn&#x27;t in 2-unit territory for me, but I would probably take it down to -145 or so.

<tr><td class='post'>Record: 46-33. (+0.71 tracking from 3 picks ago)

Last Pick: Under 2.5 goals. Preston v Swansea

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: Crystal Palace vs AZ. Under 3.5 goals. 

Sport: Football, Europa Conference  

Reasoning: Both teams have struggled for offensive output in the Conference League, with Palace averaging just 1.5 total goals per game across their two matches and AZ at 2.5, largely inflated by a single 4-0 defeat. AZ’s poor European away record, scoring only 0.5 goals for on average, suggests a cautious, low-scoring encounter.

Recent <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>: Tom Ford to WIN vs Daniel Wells -178 for 2.7u to win 1.51u

Recap: what an absolute SHITTER!! Tom Ford was genuinely a stronger player and “casually” put together 3 frames before he was beat 6-3. Idk what was up his ass but Daniel Wells honestly played solid and best Ford with no real resistance. WE MOVE ON

Event: Snooker International Championship @ 630AM est

UNDERDOG ALERT
<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Zak Surety to WIN vs Stephen Macguire @ +130 for 1.7u to win 2.21u on FD

Yeah, this one’s got a bit of upset potential written all over it. Surety’s been quietly putting together some really tidy stuff lately…that semi…final run at the World Open, his Crucible debut, and his recent victory over 6-3 victory over Neil Robertson… in the match <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> Surety won all his frame with DECIDING BREAKS. This shows he’s striking the ball sweetly and building confidence frame by frame. He’s knocking in tons more centuries than before, looks calm under pressure, and has won every deciding frame he’s played this season. That tells you he’s not just potting well but he’s holding his nerve when it really matters.

Maguire’s always dangerous, but he’s still a bit hit-and-miss right now. To put a little psychological aspect, coming from a non-professional, HE SHAVED HIS FUCKING HEAD MID TOURNAMENT….Sure, he lifted the Championship League earlier this year, but in the longer format knockouts he hasn’t quite looked settled. In his match <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> vs Jiang Jun, if he was presented with every opportunity under the sun by Jun he wouldn’t have won. His cue changes and patchy form can open the door, and if Zak gets in early and finds his rhythm, he could easily dictate the pace. With the form he’s carrying, the heavier scoring, and that bit of confidence swagger, Surety’s got every chance to nick this one. 

Fade if you’d like, since I believe I’m 1-3 with snooker picks but I believe this is the one I get back on track.

LOW unit bet since he’s an underdog but 1.7U to win to win 2.2U seems like a solid look with lower risk.

As always BOL and believe everything you see</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Stuttgart vs Feyenoord Both Teams To Score at 1.60 odds. 2u bet. 

Write up: (BTTS is Both Teams To Score) Heading to the MHPArena for Stuttgart vs Feyenoord I&#x27;m liking the look of the BTTS. Both teams are off to a rough start in Europe with Stuttgart sitting 29th and Feyenoord in 25th. Taking a look back at Feyenoord and their recent away games in Europe 12 out of 14 games have seen BTTS and with Stuttgart yet to blank at home this season I think the BTTS could be right on for us. Feyenoord are also in good scoring form, they&#x27;ve scored 18 goals in their last five games, Stuttgart have scored 8 in five. I expect to see goals here with both teams finding the back of the net, Stuttgart and Feyenoord are also playing well in their domestic leagues, both clubs could do with a win here in Europe so they&#x27;ll be right up for it.</td></tr>

NCAAB | Wright St. vs California | 10:00pm EST 

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** California vs Wright St. **Total O152.5** (-115) 1U

Write Up: California are coming off of a 27 point thrashing where they put up 87 points to kick their season off. On that same note, Wright St. are also having a hot start to their season coming off of a whooping 49 point win over Franklin. With a 1-0 record putting up 86 points in their last game I do not expect that to stop. Wright St. on the road last season, albeit having an abysmal record, put up an average of 73.6pts a game. Cal last season put up an average of 80.47 points at home. While at home last season Cal let up an average of 75.9PPG to their opponents. I expect this to be a high scoring game with Cal coming out on top by a decent margin. BOL</td></tr>

**Last Pick:**   Jacoby Brissett 250+ passing yards (-103 on DK) 1U to win .97U ✅

**Todays Event**: 🏈 NFL Thursday Night Football Raiders @ Broncos 7:15pm CST 🏈

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Todays pick</mark>**: Troy Franklin Any Time TD Scorer (+170 on DK) 1u to win 1.7u

**Writeup:** Going a little riskier <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Franklin is top five in red zone targets throughout the league, and gets the most end zone targets on his team. He has high usage for bigger plays and is trusted to get the job done. This can be seen as he shares nearly 20% of his teams targets.  Franklin has been averaging 4.1 receptions and 7.1 targets, of which around 20% of his overall targets have been within the redzone

Raiders are ranked 17th in red zone defense and 23rd in overall scoring defense. With the Broncos projected to score around 27 points, with 3 touchdowns. More so, Raiders give up the 10th most passing td&#x27;s to the slot, Guess who&#x27;s the main star for being the broncos slot WR? Two other teams on the top 5 passing td&#x27;s to the slot also include the Cowboys and Giants, who Franklin scored against twice and once respectively. With a favorable matchup into the Raiders defense, there&#x27;ll be more than a few chances for Franklin to be the one to bring one of em in.

Broncos are coming off a game against the Texans who have one of if not the best defenses in the league. Going into an Thursday night divisional game, I&#x27;m sure the Broncos will try to get the ball rolling real quick leading to some early TDs.

BOL to anyone tailing!

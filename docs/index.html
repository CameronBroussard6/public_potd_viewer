__Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:__ [__*Pending:*__ Ivica Zubac o10.5 rebounds (-110), 3.3u] 

__Event:__ NBA: Hawks @ Heat 7:30 EST

__POTD:__ Dyson Daniels over o13.5 rebounds/assists (-110), 3.3u to win 3u

__Write Up:__ Dyson Daniels has averaged 6.6 rebounds per game over his last we games. He has 6+ boards in ALL of his last 10 games at home vs the Eastern Conference. He’s over in 8/10 games without Kristaps Porzingis averaging 7.7 per game. He’s had double digit chances in every single one of those games &amp; when he plays 30+ mins in them he’s over in 8/9 games. He had 9 rebounds earlier this year vs them even with KP playing &amp; having 8 rebounds. The Heat allow the MOST Rebounds to guards this year. Allowing 7.23 to PG’s (Most) &amp; 7.33 to SG’s. Their recent numbers have been just as bad, allowing 15.31 rebounds to PG/SG’s in their last 15 games. Last year when he faced the Heat he averaged 8.5 rebounds, in 4 games he put up 10, 8, 5, &amp; 11. Miami has averaged 116+ points in 4 straight games scoring. They are 2nd in points per game this season (120.0). They average the most points per game in the league at home this year (122.2). They rank #1 in Pace, with an average of 108 possessions per game. In their last 3 they’ve average 111.9, most in the league. Vs an Atlanta team that ranks 4th at 105.8. There should be plenty of rebound chances for Daniels, especially since the Hawks best rebounder Onyeka Okongwu has been ruled out which is huge for Daniels’ rebound total. Okongwu lost a few teeth during Wednesday’s win over the Celtics, as he took a Jaylen Brown elbow to the mouth. After undergoing dental surgery the following day, the Hawks’ center is looking at an extended absence as he recovers. Christian Koloko moved into the starting lineup. Without Okongwu in the lineup, Daniels has gone 4/4 over his rebound total &amp; has had had 13+ rebound chances in all 4 games without Okongwu. Which is HUGE as Daniels is over this line in 15/20 with 13+ chances. The Hawks traded guard Vit Krejci  to the Blaxers for an injured Duop Reath &amp; 2 second rounders. Krejci averaged 2.2 3-pointers made per game on 42.3% shooting, which ranks top 20 in the NBA. This results in more playing time for Daniels. Offensively he’s been off this season but he’s one of the best defenders in the leagues. He averaged a league leading 3 steals per game last year. He pressures opposing ball handlers &amp; has a phenomenal natural instincts jumping passing lanes. He creates chaos in the perimeter. This will be key in an intradivisional matchup vs a Miami team that ranks in the bottom 10 in rebounding rate at home (49.2%). 

Dyson Daniels over __ rebounds __(*Waiting for line to release, taking over regardless*)__

Tip off is 4:30PM PST. The Lakers are still in NYC and this time playing the spiralling Nets. Continuing with the Luka block system. In the last 4 games Luka has not registered a single block and his record for this season is 4 games without a block. So if it does not happen <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> it will be his biggest block drought this season.

Should this not hit I will double my units and play the same prop on Thursday.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Enzo Fernandez 1 + SOT (+125) 1 unit to win 1.25 units

**Write Up:** Hopefully a few of you guys took Brobbey on 365, as the play hit with sub on play on. Unfortunately officially it is a loss, and we are still in major fade zone guys.

But we&#x27;re back with a play that has done us well many times before. I love this play for all of the same reasons I normally do. Arsenal host Chelsea in the 2nd leg of the Carabao Cup semifinals. Arsenal are up 3-2 on aggregate, meaning they essentially start this game with a 1-0 lead, which is huge for Arsenal and their stingy defense. This will change the dynamic slightly, as Chelsea will need to play more aggressively and try to make up that one goal difference. While I do not believe Arsenal will park the bus with only a 1 goal lead, they will be content giving Chelsea some possession and playing more defensively than normal. 

Enzo has had 1 SOT in both matches he has played vs Arsenal this year - the first leg of this match at home a few weeks ago and in the EPL at home back in November. I can see Palmer getting a rest here after playing the full 90 over the weekend, which may pull Enzo forward into the #10 role. Even if not, I still see him playing far forward and box crashing as usual.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Albacete Balompie +1.5, +2.0 Asian Handicap, +125, 4 units

**Write Up:** You know the drill, we&#x27;re fading Barcelona because I simply don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re beating Albacete by 3 or more goals <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. **Albacete stunned Real Madrid** in the previous round and have since seen a big uptick in form, notching up **4 wins in a row.** Yes, they&#x27;re a second division side, but clearly they play some good football and are capable of an upset (or at least not getting blown out).

Barcelona are clearly **deprioritizing the cup** and they looked unconvincing in the previous round, **needing a sweaty 96th minute goal to barely overcome the second tier Racing Santander by 2-0** (after almost conceding from a previous attack). The Guadalajara game in an even earlier round followed much of the same script, with Barca needing two late goals for a measly 2-0 win. Besides that, they also have some **key absences** and are going to be slightly **fatigued** following their packed schedule.

Based on the fact the Barca team is run into the ground, has some key absences, and will likely be rotated for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>&#x27;s match, I expect Albacete to cover the AH. BTTS Yes is also another angle if you&#x27;d want to take that. Make no mistake, Barca are the heavy favorites here and are most likely going to progress, I just can&#x27;t see them dismantling their opponent. Feeling pretty confident in this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> and a Barcelona fade deserves 4 units. BOL and let&#x27;s enjoy some cup magic together ☘️🫡</td></tr>

SDSU should be able to blow out Wyoming. They are the better team on every part of the court beyond defensive rebounding. SDSU is also playing some of the best ball in the country relative to any other team’s average play.

ARSENAL VS CHELSEA

Date: 03 FEBRUARY 2026 at 21:00

BET ON: Over / Under Team corners- CHELSEA Over +3.50

Odd: 1.83



\- Chelsea’s pursuit of Over 3.50 corners is supported by both tactical setup and contextual game incentives in this crucial cup tie. Trailing 3–2 on aggregate forces Liam Rosenior to adopt proactive attacking intent from kickoff — he’s openly acknowledged the difficulty of overturning Arsenal’s lead, but insists his side will go “as deep as we can” and bring intensity and urgency to the Emirates. With one goal needed just to level the tie and two to lead outright, Chelsea are highly likely to press high, push full-backs up and attack in waves down the wings, naturally generating corners as they attempt to stretch Arsenal’s defense. Many of Rosenior’s recent games under this framework have seen multiple corners, and his side’s willingness to play on the front foot even when behind bodes well for over corner output.

\- On the injury front, Chelsea’s offensive unit — including dynamic wide players like Garnacho and Neto — remain available and motivated to exploit transitions, while Arsenal’s slight defensive rotation due to knocks and squad demands may blunt their ability to defend wide pressure as robustly as usual. Opposed to that, Arteta’s Arsenal are expected to cautiously manage the game, controlling possession and avoiding excessive risk as they protect their aggregate advantage — a setup that often concedes territory to opponents and results in defensive blocks and repeated attacks from wide areas. In sum, Chelsea’s need to attack from the start, Rosenior’s encouraging attacking intent and tactical emphasis on width and high positions, plus the likelihood of Arsenal sitting deeper with less aggressive pressing, create conditions highly conducive to Chelsea winning four or more corners.</td></tr>

Soccer | Argentina Liga Profesional | 21:15 (GMT-3) - Tuesday, Feb 3rd

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Independiente Rivadavia ML @ 1.90 - 2U

Write Up: We are on a 2-win streak. After that clean 3-1 from Gimnasia, we’re finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.

Note on Timing: For those in the US/Europe, this match kicks off late Tuesday night in Argentina (21:15 local time), but it shows up as Wednesday GMT. Don’t get confused.

We’re heading to Mendoza. Independiente Rivadavia has been doing things right lately. They’ve built a solid identity at home, playing with a high-pressure style that usually suffocates visitors. They’re not world-beaters, but they are disciplined and tough to crack in front of their fans.

On the other hand, Sarmiento is a frequent inhabitant of the bottom of the table. Their away record is consistently poor, often traveling just to park the bus and hope for a 0-0. Given Independiente&#x27;s current form and home advantage, 1.90 is a very solid price. I don&#x27;t expect a blowout, but the home side should have more than enough to take the 3 points. 2 units to get us back into positive territory.

Tuesday’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> - Pistons -4.5 -115 (1.15u to win 1u)

A lot of people seem to be going towards the Nuggets here on the road with Jokic back in play. However, I’m still skeptical that we will get a full dose of Jokic, especially with this being the first game of a back to back (they play the Knicks on Wednesday). 

A week ago, these teams played each other and Detroit won on the road by 2 points despite shooting 6-31 from three. Their best 3 point shooter Duncan Robinson shot 0-8 from 3 in that game and he historically shoots much better at home. 

The combo of the Pistons being at home, not having to deal with a back to back, and having just beat this (albeit minus Joker) gives me confidence they can cover that number.

**Write Up:** I was heavily invested in CLEVOR TREVER last start and on face value I thought he was quite disappointing, getting rolled at $1.85 after seemingly having every chance. That “disappointing” run has been turned on its head with the winner, ASAKURA, looking like one out of the box with an almost 3 length romp in its next start over some quality city gallopers. To frank the form even further, the 3rd place getter LOUD CHARLIE has come out a won a metro maiden by a lengthy, so the run was definitely not disappointing.     
      
We get a great set up here drawing barrier 4, and there’s a bit of natural pace engaged, so we should be one or two pairs back on the outside. A mid prep trial over 900m has kept us ticking along and it was a nice piece of work under no pressure. The step up to 1300m also is a plus, as I think this horse is a more gradual type than a sit sprinter.     
      
The second favourite BEAST FIGHTER has drawn barrier 1 however I think that’s absolutely awful for this horse. In both its trials it’s completely bombed the start, and from barrier 1 that just spells disaster. Being barrier 1, it’ll be loaded first and I’m prepared to completely pen his chances. ZEPHYR ZONG was a good run in town, but I reckon we could have the perch on it, and I trust our form a lot more.

Reason: Good value on this game, when Walsall is usually around 2x money to win a game. Here it was around 2,75 odds at the time of writing for a straight up win. I do feel like this value is good, since Bristol Rovers are not in the same quality level here. It&#x27;s basically a team battling from relegation vs a team fighting for promotion to League One. Walsall have been out of form, and therefore the higher odds. On the side note, they should be capable of winning this game or even having a two goal lead here. I do like the half time odds though. That means the second half won&#x27;t have any matter for us. Our aim is always long term here and I will continue to look for high odds. But anything can happen in football and good luck everyone.

‎**Odds** : +102 (1XBET)

‎**Units** : 1U to win 1.02U

‎**Writeup** :

‎let&#x27;s talk Constantine vs Mostaganem real quick , this one&#x27;s screaming under 2.5 goals to me, and here&#x27;s why I&#x27;m pretty confident putting some units on it. First off, look at their head-to-head lately. These two don&#x27;t exactly light up the scoreboard when they meet. Recent games have been super low-scoring:


‎One ended 2-0 . Then straight 0-0 draws in both directions like 0-0 at Constantine and another 0-0. **Average goals in their direct matches? Around 0.67 to maybe 1-1.5 per game across the last few**. Basically, they&#x27;ve played out a bunch of cagey, low-event football. Draws and clean sheets are the norm, not fireworks.


‎On top of that, check the recent form for both sides. Constantine&#x27;s been solid at home but not banging in goals their last bunch of games have a ton of unders, like **5 out of 6 or more staying under 2.5**. They keep things tight defensively, especially against teams that aren&#x27;t flying.


‎Mostaganem? They&#x27;re struggling big time bottom half of the table, poor away record ***(0 wins in their last 8 road games or close to it)***, and they&#x27;ve been involved in low-goal slogs too. Their attack is blunt on the road, they don&#x27;t create much, and they concede without conceding a ton either. **Lots of 0-0s, 1-0s, 1-1s in their recent meetings**.

‎For Al Khalidiya Head-to-head is straight up domination for them. **They&#x27;ve played 13 times recently, and Al Khalidiya has won 9 of them, with Al Hala scraping just 1 win and a few draws**. More importantly, in those matches, **Khalidiya averages 2.3-2.6 goals per game against them** that&#x27;s not fluke stuff. They&#x27;ve dropped bags like 6-2 in one recent one, and even in tighter games, they usually find 2+. Check the scores: ***plenty of 2-0s, 3-0s, 4-0s from Khalidiya in past meetings***. Al Hala just can&#x27;t handle them their defense leaks when facing this side. Khalidiya racks up the shots and finishes, while Al Hala parks it but still gets picked apart.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Jay Dylan Hara Friend vs Raphael Perot | **Friend ML at -140 (FD). 1 unit.** 

Write-up: Ended up being a solid <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, though I wish I had just gone with Mannarino 2-0. 

Here, we have a matchup where I don’t think the opening line makes a lot of sense. Jay Friend is one of the top college players in the country, but he also established himself on the pro tour last year with a title run from qualifying at the Fairfield Challenger. He had a solid outing at the ITF Winston-Salem a couple weeks, eventually losing to Mitsui in the third round, but he’s also been playing well in college duals, defeating World. No 488 Edward Winter in straight sets. 

In comparison, Perot was also a college player who graduated from Texas A&amp;M a couple years ago and has plenty of experience in American hard courts. However, I don’t see him in the same tier of ability as Friend, and he has started the season with three losses in winnable matches against Smith, Rottgering, and Dostanic. Looking at how these players have been priced, Friend was a -175 favorite against Mitsui, but Keegan Smith was actually around the same price against Perot, and a very slight dog against Mitsui. These odds don’t quite match up, and I think Friend should be a bigger favorite in this one. Perot is a solid grinder, but Friend has the serve and attacking game to take over this matchup on indoor courts.</td></tr>

We’re fading Team Liquid here. I know Liquid is the better team on paper, but have you seen them lately? They looked absolutely lost in the Fissure and ESL Birmingham qualifiers a couple of weeks ago. They seem shaky rn and definitely not in top form.

On the other side, we’ve got this new look OG squad. With the SEA boys like Yopaj and Natsumi, they play that hyper-aggressive, chaotic style that is perfect for a Best of 1. In a BO1 group stage match, I’ll take the unpredictable, aggressive underdog over a slumping favorite every time. Liquid tends to start tournaments slow, and if OG runs at them early, this could be over fast.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Barcelona Over 6.5 Corners @ 1.61**

**Confidence: 90%**

**Details: Albacete VS Barcelona - Spain Copa del Rey -3:00 PM EST**

**---**

**Lower than I&#x27;d like but Honestly just surprised there is any value at all on this line considering the difference in quality between these sides + previous rounds.**

**---**

Albacete are a league lower than Barcelona (Laliga 2) and will look to replicate the same gameplan that saw them knock out Real Madrid in the Round of 16. Fortunately for us that gameplan saw Real Madrid get 11 corners total and I expect Barca to cover us.

* **Barcelona** are ranked **#1/20 in La Liga for corners awarded with an average of 7.1 per game,** now facing lower opposition I expect average at the least
* Last Cup round Barcelona faced the best team in the La Liga 2 and still managed to put up **10 corners in the game. The round before they managed 9 corners against Guadalajara**
* **Albacete** in La Liga 2 are **ranked 4th highest for corners conceded per game at 5.2 corners per game.**
* Albacete miraculously managed to knock out Real Madrid in the previous round and **Madrid still manage to put up 11 corners against them**

**---**

**Expecting Barcelona to avoid falling under the same hand as Real Madrid and go for the kill early, Albacete will have the confidence in their structure and won&#x27;t mind conceding corners considering 11 did nothing to save Madrid.**

**Special thank you for the coffee and beers, cant express how much they help keep these coming!**

<tr><td class='post'>AC Milan @ 2.43 - €500.00 (Unibet) // Serie A Football

Last 5 &gt; LWWLW // Profit: €4,198.04

Staying in Serie A, mybad for the loss… should’ve never trusted Roma at all. I want to blacklist Serie A from all my future bets if this loses, but I am confident in <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>’s.

In <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>’s matchup we have a Bologna side who are in bad form, in their last 10 games they have been 1-3-6. At home they are 0-1-4 in their last 5. Milan is on the other end, they are 2nd in the Serie A as away team and currently still unbeaten (6-5-0). In their last 5 their form was WWDWD. 

Milan have a decent H2H (5-3-2) against Bologna, but it pops up more at the stadium of their opponents. At Bologna, Milan are 13-5-1 as a traveling team, with the only loss the most recent one. In the managerial H2H Allegri is 7-1-1 against Vincenzo.

Also to note, Bologna are missing their main GK due to red card. For Milan Pulisic and Saelemaekers are out, I reckon some good long shots from Rabiot should do it.</td></tr>

**Last:** (CBB) Kansas +4.5 (1.5u) - Pending

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** (CBB) Indiana ML at USC

**Start Time:** 10:00 PM ET (Peacock)

**Odds:** +105 (Caesars)

**Units:** 1.5U

**Reasoning:** Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in.

It’s a Godfather quote that jumps top of mind when it comes to betting on Indiana basketball. That’s because after appearing all but dead in the water following a four-game skid, the team has responded by winning each of its next three contests. That includes an impressive 72-67 victory over then-No. 12 Purdue last Tuesday night. 

Still, I can understand the hesitancy to trust a Hoosiers (14-7) squad that is just 2-6 against Quad 1 opponents. 

While the shortcomings against quality opponents is most definitely concerning, a closer look at the matchup against USC provides quite a bit of optimism. Through 22 games, the Trojans (16-6) rank just 130th in offensive efficiency (1.078) and 97th in defensive efficiency (1.017). Now consider this: in 12 games against opponents ranked outside of the Top 100 in offensive efficiency, the Indiana defense concedes an average of 62.8 points on a  porous 37.4% shooting (26.6% from beyond the arc). Furthermore, the unit held 11 of those opponents to 42% shooting or less while limiting all but three to 33% or less from the perimeter. Not to mention, the Hoosiers were 11-1 in those contests, with each win coming by eight or more points and all but one by 17+. 

The same improvement can be seen on the other end of the floor.

While the Indiana offense has been pretty good overall—37th in offensive efficiency (1.156), 57th in scoring (81.5 PPG), 68th in field-goal percentage (47.0%) and 85th in three-point shooting (35.7%)—the unit takes it to another level against poor competition. In 12 games against opponents who rank outside of the Top 75 in defensive efficiency, the Hoosiers have averaged 88.8 points on a blistering 51.1% shooting from the field (39.2% from beyond the arc). While Lamar Wilkerson (19.4 PPG) and Tucker DeVries (14.3 PPG) should once again pace the team, its been the recent play of junior Nick Dorn (9.7 PPG) that has been played a major role in Indiana’s recent run of success—20.2 points per game over his last four games. They should have no issue penetrating a USC defense that hasn’t held an opponent under 69 points since Dec. 14. 

Turnovers should prove to be the difference in this one.

On the year, neither team has made a habit of forcing opponents into mistakes, with the Trojans ranking 135th in turnovers forced (12.3 per game), 180th in turnovers forced per possession (16.5%) and 240th in steals (6.0) while the Hoosiers enter ranked 239th in turnovers forced (11.0), 243rd in turnovers forced per possession (15.7%) and 312th in steals (5.4). However, while Indiana has done a great job playing clean basketball on the offensive end—56th in turnovers per possession (14.7%), 57th in opponent steals (5.7) and 58th in turnovers (10.4)—the same can’t be said about USC, which ranks 200th in turnovers per possession (17.0%), 265th in opponent steals (7.2), 268th in turnovers (12.7). If the Hoosiers can take advantage here, that could very well be the X factor.

Keep the points, trust Indiana to win this one outright.

Trabzonspor vs Fethiyespor, over 3.5 goals @ 2

Trabzonspor are Turkey’s top-flight side with attacking quality capable of producing multiple goals, especially at home, and they’ve shown they can score freely in cup competition. Fethiyespor have also been involved in matches with multiple goals recently, particularly away from home. Historical goal averages in the cup and recent attacking performances from both teams suggest this fixture has the potential to be open and high-scoring, making Over 3.5 goals a possibility worth considering.</td></tr>

Yesterday’s Pick: (NFL) Tua Tagovailoa 1+ passing touchdowns + (NBA) LaMelo Ball o35.5 PRA’s (-150) ❌

***<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: (NBA) Josh Giddey o0.5 3PM + (NHL) Logan Thompson o18.5 saves (-200) (ALT PROPS)***

Reasoning: Josh Giddey averages 1.5 3PM per game this season. He has hit at least one 3pter in each of his 4 games so far this year. Last year, he hit a 3 in 82% of his games. He faces the NY Knicks who are allowing 15.3 3PM per game this season (8th most in NBA) and 2.5 3PM to point guards this season (10th most in league). As for goalie Logan Thompson, he faces the NY Islanders, who average 30.2 shots per game (7th most in NHL). Thompson went over 18.5 saves in 83% of games last year. Thompson faces these Islanders recently on October 11th and finished well over this line with 34 saves. With that being said, let’s bounce back from yesterday, locking in Giddey and Thompson and fade the New York Knickerbockers and New York Islanders tonight…

👇

Take Josh Giddey over 1+ 3PM + Logan Thompson over 19+ saves</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>**Record: (0-1) (-1.0u)**

**Streak** : ✖️

**Last Pick** : ✖️Tua T**agovailoa Under 0.5 Interceptions, 1u**

**Event:** MLB: Los Angeles Dodgers vs Toronto Blue Jays | World Series Game 6 | 8pm ET

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> : Toronto Blue Jays Moneyline (+120) 2u to win 2.4u**

**Write Up:** Even though everything was leaning towards Tua coming from last nights game untouched, of course in the 4th with 5 minutes to go, Mr. Turndaballova proved me wrong once again (shame on me).

That being said even though it would bring me great joy to see Ohtani with another ring, I just don&#x27;t see how they overcome Toronto, especially with how things are going right now. With odds at 2.20 there&#x27;s a precedent that the Dodgers are expected to win this game at least, but honestly I think this is way mispriced, especially when you take things into account like home field-advantage, their momentum, and bullpen lineups. Even though Yamamoto who came off a historic Game 2 performance will be the starting pitcher, I also think this will be a very lone battle for Yamamoto. Currently Toronto has lots of momentum, one days rest, and home field advantage. Only four players in world series are batting above .300 and all four of those players happen to be on the Blue Jays. They do one thing very well, which is simply getting on base. The only four players on the Dodgers who are batting above .250 are Kike, Teoscar, Shohei, and Will Smith. There is a clear contrast when it comes to BA, and I don&#x27;t think the Dodgers being on the road in a series where their opponent is confident, rested and comfortable will help them any better.

Even with all those positives, it would be dumb to not acknowledge that what I think is one of the Dodgers safety nets for tonight&#x27;s game, Yamamoto. Given that he just came of playing a historic complete game a few days ago, I find it very unlikely that he will play the full game twice within a week. It is Game 6 in the World Series, so I guess anything goes, but I think this is important to mention because even though he and Shohei have been absolutely dominant this postseason, even though in Game 4 Shohei managed to only allow one run against a dominant hitting team in six innings, when he exited the game, Toronto added another 5 runs upon his exit. Which is also what I think will happen <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> as well. It also doesn&#x27;t make it more favorably when you include the fact that the Blue Jays have an OBP of .330 at home. The Dodgers production this whole year has been downright elite, even in the postseason. But in this series their firepower has been suppressed a lot, and you can even notice it in their swings when they try to chase the ball late. Which almost plays into Kevin Gausman&#x27;s nasty splitter, that has a whiff rate of almost 40%. Like I said, my heart is telling me I hope the Dodgers prevail at least one more game, as this postseason has been pretty entertaining. Also I think the odds for this game are over done as I have seen some books bring the Blue Jays down from +130 to +117. Nonetheless, everything at least in my opinion points to the Blue Jays coming out on top, and taking the World Series home in Game 6.

<tr><td class='post'>**POTD Record 37-34-1**

Holy shit were the gambling gods on our side yesterday. I made this bet prior to the news about Giannis not playing. Not only did he not play in the game, but my main thesis for the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> was centered around how dominant he has looked so far. With out him in the lineup, the Bucks still looked fucking great. RYAN ROLLINS!!!!! I liked watching him so far this season (scored 25 the game prior), but in no way shape or form did I think he was capable of the game he had last night. 32pts &amp; 8 assists and 5-7 from three. Who would have thought Milwaukee would be better at the point guard position this year with him over Dame…. I liked the bucks a lot going into the season, but after seeing the depth they have in last nights game, I completely changed their ceiling .

Anyways, back at it again <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, and lets see if the gambling gods are still on our side. Love todays play.

**76ers -1**

Okay, I know I faded 76ers a few nights back against Charlotte and ended up covering by .5 points. I will say I got very fucking lucky in covering that game, and the main perspective around that play was my skepticism that these 76er guards could sustain the upside they had against boston in game 1 of the season. Since that game, I have totally changed my mind. These Philly guards are legit, and their last matchup with Boston was not a fluke IMO. The 76ers are a perfect 4-0 this season, and 3-1 ATS (only loss was the Charlotte game), while Boston just smoked my Cavs a few nights back and are currently riding a 2 game win streak. 

Like i mentioned above Maxey and Edgecombe are fucking dangerous, and already lite up Boston this season, and I expect them to do the same tonight. Philly also has Embiid playing tonight, and even though I compared him to old Shaq a few posts back (WAS JOKING), I do expect him to have a good game, even if he only plays 20ish mins (avg 21 so far this season). Yes, Embiid is nowhere near what he was when he was winning MVPs, however he is still averaging 16-5-3 in limited mins. He had a god awful game against Boston in their last matchup, and I expect him to make up for that tonight in Philly. 

Boston on the other hand, has played in form the last few games, and even with their 2 losses this season they kept both games close. I expect Boston to continue to try to get their shooting up to par, and jacking them up, and like I mentioned in the cavs vs boston post, that always is concerning. Boston is 24th in the league in 3pt % so far this season, and with the shooters they have I do not expect it to stay that way all season. 

These two teams are #1 &amp; #2 in the league so far in points, so I expect it to be a shoot out, and a close game down the stretch, with Philly pulling away in the final few minutes with their home crowd helping them get to the finish line. 

PS: Denver -4.5 I really like also. Haven&#x27;t bet on it yet, but feel like I will. The reason I didn&#x27;t make this my play <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> is due to how Denver has failed to cover a game vs Portland in their last 3 trips and this Portland team is not going to be good this season, however early on they have looked competitive.</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>Record: 1-1


Event: Islanders vs. Capitals, 7:00 pm EST


<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Alex Ovechkin under 3.5 shots on goal


Odds: -140 Fanduel


Reasoning: Ovechkin has been under this line in all ten games this season. And, his opponent tonight, the Islanders, are fifth best in the league in shots allowed to left wing players (5.9/game) -- meaning all left wingers on the opposing team combined.</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>Record 2-0 

Last Pick: AJ Green +2 Threes Made/Alexandre Sarr +12 Points ✅ 

Recap:AJ Green did what AJ Green does and that’s make threes. Sarr started the game off sluggish but exploded in the 4th quarter to push us into back to back wins and a 2-0 start on <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>. 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: Mikal Bridges +3 Assists/Shaedon Sharpe Under 2.5 Threes made (+132 DraftKings) Knicks vs Bulls / Denver vs Portland 

Reasoning: Mikal takes on a Bulls team without Colby White, leaving some weakness at the wings. I expect a lot of cuts to the basket facilitated by an initial pass to Bridges. He’s averaging almost 7 assists a game so 3 is a pretty safe bet. Shaedon Sharpe is shooting under 25% from the 3 line. The only reason this line exists is because he’s taking 8-10 attempts per game and only making 2. He’s performed his worst after a solid day-2 days rest. The team comes off a rest and takes on Denver who limits 3’s by opposing teams. Expect a lot of shots, and let’s hope for a lot of misses to extend this win streak!</td></tr>

Last 10: 💰✖️✖️💰💰💰✖️💰💰💰

Last POTD: 🏈 Jaylen Waddle over 63.5 receiving yards (-112) 💰

Writeup: Waddle should’ve had 120 yards tonight but hey I’m not complaining. Had to sweat it out a bit into the 2nd half but pretty easy cash overall.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: ⚾️ Blue Jays ML (+128). 

Game starts at 8pm EST. Bet 2u

Writeup: The series ends tonight - the Blue Jays are about to win the World Series. It is impossible to overstate the Blue Jays&#x27; tenacity in winning consecutive games following their defeat in the 18-inning marathon in Game 3. Toronto will exact revenge on Yamamoto because they are a far more formidable opponent for the Dodgers than anyone anticipated. After Game 3, the Blue Jays&#x27; bats have fired up, scoring 12 runs to the Dodgers&#x27; 3. In a crucial game against Gausman, the top of the Dodgers&#x27; lineup had trouble, which is concerning for a team who is on the brink of defeat as the away team. I&#x27;ll <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> the squad that can swing the bat better and is the hotter team right now, especially in what I think will be a low-scoring game.

This line has already moved down in favor of the Blue Jays, and with them being -235 favorites to win the World Series, I don’t think that line indicates a Game 7. Do we really think the Dodgers are going down at home in Game 7 with Ohtani and others likely pitching? Yeah I don’t think so. If that were the case, the odds would be much closer - the Blue Jays win it all tonight.

Remember to only bet what you can afford, and BOL!</td></tr>

**Previous :** Man City -1 &amp; PSG -1 - LOSS

**Recap:**  This time Man City gets the job done but PSG could not beat a much weaker side.  Brutal stretch of losses.

**New Event:**  Getafe vs Girona &amp; Louisiana Tech vs Sam Houston State

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:**  Getafe DNB (Draw no bet) &amp; Louisiana Tech - 6.5 (alt line) @ 1.83 (Usual 3 units)

**Full disclosure:**  Went 16-4-1 between September 1 and October 14, and 2-5 since then.  I’m tired of losing these chalky bets that should be paying off as they usually have in the past.  Manchester City, PSG, Atalanta, all top class teams playing against far inferior opponents in matches where they dominated the game, yet failed to put the ball in the net for us.  Unfortunately Football (soccer) is one of those sports where this tends to happen more often than not due to the low scoring nature of the game.  Even after opting for lower odds in favor of a higher probability of a better result, a single goal can and does make all the difference.  All I can do is keep trying as long term results are what matters.

**Leg 1**:  La Liga - Getafe DNB vs Girona

This is a match of two teams heading in opposite directions.  Getafe have only 1 loss at home this season and at the hands of league leaders Real Madrid by the minimal score of 1-0 in a match where Getafe had 2 red cards.  That was less than 2 weeks ago.  Last week they collected an impressive away win vs 9^(th) place Athletic Club and now sit in 10^(th) place in the La Liga table.  Once again Getafe are displaying the defensive prowess that has kept them in the 1^(st) division of Spanish football for several years.  They seldom lose by more than 1 goal and have a -2 goal differential in the table.

Girona on the other hand, are in 20^(th) place, dead last, in La Liga with a -13 goal differential.  Their only win this season has come against 18^(th) place Valencia in early October.  Since then, they lost to 2^(nd) place Barcelona (as expected) and drew 3-3 vs 19^(th) placed Real Oviedo. 

No question Girona are the worst team in the league.  Getafe at home should have no problem winning this match, or at worst get draw in which case it’s a “push” for us.

**Leg 2**:  NCAAF – Louisiana Tech -6.5 (alt Spread)

Sam Houston are awful on both sides of the ball and their results back it up.  Their average loss is by -21.9 points, they cannot run or pass the ball, defense can’t stop anything or rush the QB, and they rank at the bottom of the FBS in explosive plays allowed. 

Louisiana Tech are at home on a Friday night and are the far better football team overall.  The spread is 16.5 in their favor and I am teasing this line by 10 points for extra cushion down to 6.5.  All they need to do is win by 1 TD, not much to ask for against one of the worst teams in the country.</td></tr>

Next <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **Mikal Bridges Over 3.5 Reb** (-120 on Bet 365) Bet 3.5u to Win 2.92u

Bridges is currently averaging 6.8 RPG early in this season nearly double last season’s average and well above this low line.

He’s grabbed at least 4 rebs in every game this season (100% hit rate) last game against bucks he grabbed an insane 11 boards.

Bridges is benefiting from his role in defensive switches and perimeter defense which translates to more board chances.

The Bulls starting SF is Matas Buzelis who averaged only 3.5 RPG last season. While he’s developing as a rim protector, **he’s not a rebounding anchor on the perimeter, leaving gaps when wings like Mikal Bridges attack the glass.** 

Bulls defensive rebounding percentile and wing rebounding vulnerability create a clear structural advantage for Bridges to exceed 3.5 rebs tonight. So I&#x27;m backing the over with confidence here.

The Celtics come to Philly on Halloween to face their Eastern Conference rival in the first day of NBA Cup play. With a crazy looking court and costumes in the crowd, I think players will be pumped to step up and shine. And that includes Kelly Oubre. 

Oubre has hit 2+ 3&#x27;s each game this season, including three 3&#x27;s in the insane come-from-behind win on Tuesday against the Wizards. Sure, Oubre struggled from behind the arc in the 2024-25 season (shot 29.3%), but he was also dealing with multiple injuries. He seems to have turned it around this year, with his 45.0% three point shooting percentage on the season helping propel the sixers to a perfect 4-0 record. I&#x27;ll be riding with him, and hoping he delivers a treat on Halloween.

EVENTS: Dortmund (Bundesliga) take on an out of form Augsburg who have won 1 from 4 homes games so far conceding the most goals out of any other side when at home. Dortmund are the much better side here. 

Erzurum BB haven&#x27;t lost a game so far from the 11 games they have played. Hatayaspor haven&#x27;t won a game out of the 11 so I&#x27;m confident Erzurum can win the game let alone not lose. Especially considering Hatayaspor concede 3 goals per game on average. 

Coventry City - wow what a side this year. I wanted to tip this team alone as my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> with the ML but Wrexham have that Hollywood buzz about them that can rile them up at home. Coventry are yet to lose so far and will want to keep that run going. I don&#x27;t see Wrexham being that team to beat them however, a draw isn&#x27;t off the cards here. Coventry average 3 goals per game while Wrexham average 1. Take into account Coventry have not conceded 2 in the same game since there opening away game vs Derby (they won 5-3), I am confident in Coventry at least scoring 1. I can&#x27;t see Wrexham scoring 2.</td></tr>

Trae is out, and KP will have to shoulder more of the scoring responsibility. He’ll also see more of the ball and could rack up a few assists. I like this bet because the Pacers are undersized and I just cant see a way for them to stop KPs post game or his offensive rebounding (and easy put backs). Also with Jalen Johnson driving to the basket, KP should still get some good looks from 3 and he is never shy to shoot. He’s over this line in the last 3 games, and I expect him to do so again.

Denver @ Portland 10PM Eastern Time 

Deni’s PRA lines this season through the first 5 games:

G1: 20/7/1 vs Wolves (28) 

G2: 26/5/6 vs Warriors (37)

G3: 23/7/5 vs Clippers (35)

G4: 25/4/4 vs Lakers (34)

G5: 19/9/5 vs Jazz (33)

His lone miss was in the opener, and homie was just shaking off some rust. He went 0/6 from three and had an uncharacteristically low assist output with only 1 assist on 11 potential assists. That’s a crazy ratio. Teammates let him down big time with that. But hey—first game of the season, and oh by the way, their coach was about to be arrested by the FBI the next morning. Might explain some things… some of those misses 🤣 We’ll put the miss on Chauncey. 

Since the Feds took down his coach, he’s been aces. There’s very little variance in his performances. They’re all clustered together like expertly thrown darts around the bullseye that is his 33.3 PRA average over this span. That’s an important indicator, when deciding on making this type of bet.

Deni’s last game vs the Nuggets: 

March 21, 2025: 36/8/7 (51)✅

He has cleared 30+ PRA in every game he’s played at least 30 minutes in vs the Nuggets over his entire career. 

He’s averaging 32 minutes this season, and should play at least 30 minutes and keep that streak going.

AG has a perfect clear rate for 3+ 1st quarter points with 11, 4, 7, 4. All it takes is one made 3 pointer for this to hit, and his 3 point shooting has become phenomenal: making 52.2% of his threes on 5.8 attempts a game.</td></tr>

Coventry City are top of the league and have the highest goals scored, scoring 2 or more goals in their 9 of their last 12 matches.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: ✅️ Felix Auger-Aliassime ML @ 1.56 — 3u

Vacherot has made it this far basically running on fumes. His match vs Norrie looked good on paper, but he survived only because he won every key point and saved 6/6 break points — not exactly something you can rely on every match. Don’t forget this guy was ranked around 200 in the world a few weeks ago and has never been a top-level player at 27 years old. Let’s not suddenly hype him just because he beat opponents who weren&#x27;t playing great.

Felix, on the other hand, is simply on another level. He&#x27;s a legit top player, used to competing at ATP events week in and week out. With some big rivals already knocked out, this is a huge chance for him, and motivation won’t be a problem.

Quality, experience, and physical level are all on Felix’s side. Vacherot is running on empty and will have to go all-out just to keep up — and I don’t think he can.</td></tr>

**Summary:** The away side going up 2-0 before half time opened the game up. The goal for the home team was nearly corrected by VAR again for offside and I might&#x27;ve flipped if that was the case 3 times in a row.. But it stood and that made the BTTS complete to end the losing streak! Lesgoooo!

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** ***Qarabag to win(1.32) + Erzurumspor to win(1.53) @ 2.02 -- 3 units***

**Write up:**

It&#x27;s Friday again and we are kicking off with an early Azerbaijan game once again.

**Qarabag v Imisli FK**  
This time its Champions League revelation Qarabag. They can also go top of the league with a win against 8th place Imisli. The thing that is worth mentioning here is that Imisli had a cup game on Tuesday against a THIRD division side that they came behind in and eventually won 2-3 with a last minute winner. Now this must have drained more energy then they would have liked and they are now already facing the best team in Qarabag <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Now the fact that they struggled against a team that came last in the Azerbaijan second division last season and now play third division tells me enough here to be honest. But I looked further into them and 7 of their 12 points were received against teams below them, and if you regularly trail my picks you&#x27;ll remember that in Azerbaijan the bottom 3 teams might as well have been playing a league lower as that is the quality of their squads. Qarabag have only allowed 3 goals against in 8 matches. Scoring 13 themselves. They are bound to be top of the league here after this win and motivation will be high.

**Hatayspor v Erzurumspor**  
A game here in the Turkish second division featuring relegated side Hatayspor. Now Hatayspor is far from promotion, in fact they are looking at another relegation battle. With a sad 4 points in 11 games, with big number losses amongst them they aren&#x27;t competing this season. Erzurumspor won against a relegation battling side last week and will want to continue this form into <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> as they are in need of points because of their 7 draws so far this season. They&#x27;ve won against all bottom sides so far and I think they&#x27;ll add another one to that tally.

**Best of luck if tailing!** 🍀

**Write Up:** I really do not understand why T1 is the favorite here. These are some legacy odds, because their form is awful. They went 3-2 in the Swiss stage, losing to GenG (pretty normal) and Flying Oyster. Their only wins were against western teams. The games they had showed bad gaming and bad drafting.

Anyone Legend&#x27;s on the other hand steamrolled through Swiss Stage. They won every series, even against HLE and GenG. Tarzan is on an absolute tear atm. Tabe is drafting pretty well in the tournament.

The support gap that T1 can normally exploit, will also be harder. Kael is in very good form.

NBA 76ers v Celtics 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: 1U Joel Embiid O6.5 points 1Q @ $2.10, Sportsbet (Australian only book)  

Write-Up: I break a tidy streak of wins but I will stick to my guns of sustainable betting, not being drawn into quick or rushed schemes. 

I’m going back to 1Q plays but with hopefully a better match-up. We got this line much better last game (4.5) but Embiid is building nicely and showing glimpses of his offensive best. If he is even slightly close to it, he should track at least at a point per minute and he should hopefully get 7 minutes of court time as he did 2 games ago. Embiid gets the Celtics who in my opinion simply don’t have the size to contain him for even 6 minutes. He will hopefully just play a post game with the size advantage he has and draw fouls, last time v the Celtics he shot at 3s early and it just wasn’t the way to go I think, so hopefully that’s corrected. I don’t tend to believe in “motivation” reasons as I think most elite sportspeople are elite because they are competitive consistently - but I don’t think Embiid playing poorly v the Celtics in game 1 of the season will 1) hurt this bet and 2) requires too much reading into. 

He’s hit 9 &amp; 8 last 2 games. His shot is falling and he is building minutes and usage. 7 &amp; 6 minutes last 2 1Q. 

As for food for thought/considerations of why you might not tail - it’s the same story as yesterday. He might get all the minutes &amp; usage but if he gets cold he won’t hit on a streaky 1Q bet.

EDIT: cashed out B365 bet ($1.86) and got on at Sportsbet (an Australian book which I don’t regularly use) @ $2.10 - I.e gone from -116 to +110. Time of edit is 1930 Friday AEDT, or 0430 New York time whatever timezone that is</td></tr>

I’m going back to Hong Kong after hitting on Mboko yesterday. 

Leylah Fernandez won this tournament last year and she’s recently won another title earlier this month in which she beat her opponent for this match, Sorana Cirstea. Fernandez is looking really good so far in HK too with two easy wins. **Recently defeated her opponent, in great form, won this tournament last year.**

The Islanders are on the second night of a back to back on the road. This is a spot I always like to attack in the NHL. They also played on Tuesday so they will be fatigued. They got destroyed in both games and have lost 3 straight.

The Caps have a great goaltender who’s allowing 1.44 goals a game with a .939 SV%. **They’re rested, at home, and the better team, while the Islanders are on their 3 game in 4 nights, have a disadvantage statistically in net, and have gotten thrashed in their last two.**

Edit - I mixed up the years, Fernandez actually won it in 2023. She won the match though. 1 leg down ✅</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: North Carolina ML (+110) 1 unit

Write up: Sharing my first ever <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> with a horrifying matchup fit for Halloween. Both teams are looking to snap 4 game losing streaks and have had absolutely nightmarish seasons up to this point. Syracuse began the season with a promising 3-1 start before losing their starting QB to an achilles tear and they have yet to score more than 18 points in a game since. Meanwhile, North Carolina’s circus of misery comes to town after also failing to score more than 18 points during that stretch (6 points less than the age of Bill Belicheck’s girlfriend). 


The key difference maker here is the recent form from each team. North Carolina lost a close one to an underrated Cal team and nearly upset a top 25 ranked Virginia team last week, while Syracuse has suffered blowout losses to both Pitt and #8 Georgia Tech. It might not look like it on paper, but these teams are going in 2 different directions. Ultimately on a short week I’m going with the team coached by a washed up superbowl winner facing a backup QB.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Nikola Jokic Triple-Double
(+105 HR | 1 unit) 

Start time &amp; TV: 10:00 PM , Altitude Sports, KTVD 20, Rip City TV Network

Reasoning:

Nikola Jokic entered tonight&#x27;s NBA Cup matchup in historic form — and with a chance to make even more history. The Serbian superstar has opened the 2025–26 season with four straight triple-doubles, averaging 11.3 assists and 14.5 rebounds per game, along with elite creation metrics of 17 potential assists and 22.3 rebound chances per game.

-With another all-around performance tonight, Jokic would be the first player ever to start a season with five consecutive triple-doubles, further cementing him as the league&#x27;s most complete offensive engine.

-Against the matchup, Jokic faced Portland three times last season, and he had a triple-double in one of them. In the other two, he had 8 assists with very good playmaking indicators, adding 13 and 9 potential assists, respectively. He was close in all three, just a few made shots from teammates away.

-Though his NBA Cup record isn’t quite spotless (just 2 triple-doubles in 6 appearances), it’s worth considering that there’s a discernible pattern from the Nuggets’ coaching staff: Jokic stays on the floor into the third quarter of would-be blowouts to secure his statistical milestones. The consistency in minutes is a major plus for this prop.

-In addition, tonight’s opponent should keep things competitive. The Blazers’ improved pace and offensive consistency mean Denver likely won’t run away early — ensuring Jokic plays his usual 33–35 minutes, plenty of time for him to rack up the necessary production across all categories.</td></tr>

(However, being plus money bet 1u to win 1.1u)

Write up: Fading another team playing their 3rd game in 4 nights, the islanders were embarrassed by the bruins on the road 5-2 on the 28th and now just last night the islanders got the doors blown off by the hurricanes on the road 6-2. Part of me wanted to take the over 5.5 in this game. But the more I look into it it just seems a bit easy. The islanders are now 9-1 to the over and we’re seeing a line under 6. SKETCHY. Look here’s why, the capitals are one of the best defensive teams in the league right now. Allowing the least amount of goals in hockey with one of the best goalies in hockey with Logan Thompson. While they haven’t scored as much as I’d like. (26th most goals in the NHL). I believe positive regression is on our side. (Capitals rank 5th in nhl in expected goals for) only 21 spots higher than where they actually score. So now go look at their games in which they lost. Majority were with the backup goalie in Lindgren. I gotta wonder how much this islanders team is really jazzed up to hop on a plane and go to Washington tomorrow on Halloween to play another game after just getting throttled twice in a row. Meanwhile Washington has been sitting rested after dropping two straight, and will be eager to put on a show in front of a packed home crowd on Friday night (and it’s Halloween) so obviously let’s get a dub for the fans. I believe this will be a convincing win for the capitals against an islanders team with tired legs and that probably just wants nothing more than to end this road trip and get back to New York for their game against the blue jackets on the 2nd.

Both of these teams SCORE. And both of these teams give up goals in bunches at times. It’s usually a high flying matchup when they square off, and with a days rest for both teams I think they’ll be ready to score. 

The Avalanche are the #1 offense in the league and are humming right now. They have the second most goals for, as well as second highest goals percentage. Nathan MacKinnon is the best player in the league right now and there’s not much teams can do to stop him and Makar. I’m confident they’ll put up 4-5 goals. 

The Knights situation is a little different. They are battling the injury bug with mark stone going on LTIR (again) and have a mediocre offense. Also, Schmid is starting in net with a .892 subpar save %. Colorado is middle of the pack and in goals against and has okay goaltending in net. I see this as 5-2 6-2 type of game.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: VJ Edgecombe 22+ PA, -115, 2u-&gt;3.74u

Reasoning: VJ Edgecombe has been lighting it up this season and has been playing crazy minutes. After a bit of a rough last game for his early standards, I expect him to have gotten the reps in now with Embiid who is slated to play against the Celtics. His poise on the court seems like he’s a growing and learning player, I expect him to want to focus on getting Embiid involved as well as being able to score well himself. In addition, VJ might be able to cash this line himself off of just points. He’s fighting for a strong ROTY campaign and I don’t suspect him to have 2 bad games, especially the confidence of knowing he can and have torched the same defense previously.</td></tr>

**Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>** - Malik Washington 25+ receiving yards (-136) + Marshall -2.5 vs Coastal Carolina (-194) | (**+162**) (**3 units**) ❌

Coastal Carolina’s third string quarterback Collier turned out to be a hell of a lot better than expected. Marshall kept getting 10 point leads and then giving up touchdowns to Collier, who kept CCU nipping at their heels. It was looking good at the start of the 3rd quarter with Marshall up 27-17, but CCU struck back quickly to make it 27-24, and from there, Marshall’s high powered offense responded by absolutely imploding. Four drives in a row went comically wrong, with their star QB throwing fumbling once (for his first lost fumble of the entire season) and then throwing 2 interceptions on back to back drives (DOUBLE the amount he’s thrown the entire season) before fumbling AGAIN on the fourth drive to make it 4 turnovers in the blink of an eye (what the actual fuck). Coastal capitalized on that chicanery and it was over. ❌

Malik Washington was quiet in the first half, only getting 8 yards on 1 catch, but the Dolphins fell behind 28-6 shortly in the 3rd and were forced to play catchup through the air in the 4th, creating a positive game script for the dolphins receivers. He finished with a season high 48 yards. ✅

Doesn’t matter because Marshall lost though.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>** - **Fernandez ML** vs Cirstea (-191) &amp; **Lauri Markkanen 30+ PRA** (-202) |**+127**| **3 units** | draftkings 

——————————————————

**Hong Kong WTA 8:00 EST**

——————————————————

**Jazz @ Suns NBA cup group play - 22:00 EST**

——————————————————

With this high plus odds strategy, we only have to win around 45-50% of our bets to make a nice profit in the long run, so it’s very important that I don’t let a single loss, or even multiple in a row, deter the process. Gotta stay psychologically strong. 

——————————————————

**Fernandez ML vs Cirstea (-191)** ✅

Leylah Fernandez is in excellent form at the moment. She started her Japan tour off with a title earlier this month — winning the Osaka WTA. 

In the Osaka WTA tournament, Cirstea had the misfortune of having to play against Fernandez in the semifinals. It was a three set victory for Fernandez, who showed great grit in the final set, coming from behind 3-1 in the final set to win comfortably in the end.
6-1, 2-6, 6-4

Quick breakdown of the statistics from it:

Total points: Fernandez 81 — Cirstea 71.
Winners: Fernandez 33 — Cirstea 21.
Winner ratio: 41% vs 30%.
Breaks: Fernandez 6/10 (60%) — Cirstea 5/5 (100%) (Fernandez had twice as many break chances).
1st serve in: 74% vs 56%.
1st-serve points won: 58% (33/57) vs 50% (21/42).
Aces / DFs: 1 / 2 (Fernandez) vs 4 / 0 (Cirstea).

Fernandez hit more winners and earned her winners at a higher rate, reflecting sharper shot selection and cleaner execution. That gap is something that usually holds up in repeat matchups unless the opponent radically adjusts.

The break disparity and conversion efficiency is a key thing to note here. Fernandez created double the break chances, with 10 to Cirstea’s 5, but only converted 60% of them compared to 100% for Cirstea. She left plenty on the table. Even converting at just 60%, she broke serve more often. If she maintains similar pressure, and statistically, she should, we’ll likely see a more decisive scoreline this time.

Cirstea once again finds misfortune on her side, getting paired with a superior opponent who will send her packing. 

After Leylah’s title win in Osaka, she performed well in Tokyo, beating the Greek Tank Sakarri. She lost in the next round to world #6 Rybakina, but there’s no shame in that.

She’s bounced back in Hong Kong, playing peak tennis at the top of her game, already having dispatched #167 Wang and #44 Lys as if they were amateur rec league players: (6-1, 6-4) then (6-4, 6-1). 

Cirstea has won against #96 Galfi and #86 Tomljanovic, but she dropped a set in the latter, has not looked as good as Leylah, and has given no indication that their rematch will differ in result.

Another reason I like this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, is because Leylah has an excellent track record here in Hong Kong — making it to the semifinals in 2023 and winning the whole thing last year in 2024. She clearly has an affinity for these courts, and I am confident in predicting a win. 

——————————————————

**Lauri Markkanen 30+ PRA (-202)**

Lauri Markannen has cleared 30 PRA in every game so far this season and he and he got 68 PRA with 51 points on 34 shots vs the Suns in their last matchup, just a few days ago. That one went to overtime, and I don’t expect a duplicate performance, but he has a taste for their blood now and is likely to attack them hard again in this NBA cup group play game.

Started with 3 assists in the first half but only managed to get 1 in the 2nd half, overall a bad read my bad .. we move 

First games of the NBA cup is here, should mean teams going harder at it a with every point mattering.

JB is over this line in 3/5 games this season avg 5.6 RPG and 11.2 rebound chances per game. He’s gone over in 5 straight games against the 76ers including 1/1 against them this season where he had 6 on 11 rebound chances. Some of those overs against the Sixers were with Tatum aswell so without him he should get even more chances to get it done.

Feels like I’m repeating myself but with how opposing teams guards Embiid and with how he plays, he draws the bigs out leaving tons of weak side rebound opportunities for the wings where Jaylen should eat.

Has gone over in 3 straight games against Embiid with 6, 6 and 7 boards, Tatum played in two of those games. Without him there’s even more responsibility for JB to fight for the rebounds.</td></tr>

**Last Pick:** **Tulane @ UTSA | College Football | Totals Over 53.5 (-123)**

**Write Up:** Solid win from yesterday&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. Solidifying the o53.5 before heading into the 4th quarter felt good. For Friday&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, I&#x27;m looking at the College Football lineups and will be targeting the C-USA matchup between Sam Houston and LA Tech.

Neither of these teams boast a great record in conference play, especially with Sam Houston sitting last in conference with an 0-7 overall record. Evaluating scores; Sam Houston averages 14 offensive points per game on the road while their defense allows 43 points per game. Compared to LA Tech, who averages 31 offensive points per game at home while their defense allows just 14 points per game.

Louisiana Tech lost 28-27 in Overtime to Western Kentucky in their last home game. Despite the offense having little issues moving the ball and staying neutral in the turnover margins for the game, the team came up short. The Bulldogs starting Kicker DNP in Tuesday&#x27;s game and the Bulldogs likely wished he had. They ended up missing two field goals in the duration of the game, the last one being the game winner. Drew Henderson will be back in action for Friday&#x27;s game, and LA Tech is going to be looking to bounce back with a win before heading on the road again. I&#x27;m taking the Over in this match up.

Against a smaller opposing frontcourt, expect plenty of second-chance looks and defensive rebounds. If he avoids foul trouble, 25+ PRA is very attainable.
He’s recorded 26+ PRA in 4 of his last 6 games, with better numbers against poor rim-protecting teams.

Event: Bundesliga ⚽️

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Borussia Dortmund U5.5 team corners vs Augsburg 5U @ 1.80 (Bet365)

Write-up: Really good win to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> up from Motherwell, who dominated Dundee with some brilliant football at times. They took the lead just before the half through Maswanhise and doubled it towards the end of the match with Watt scoring. On the cards front Hendry picked up a booking in the 63rd with nothing after that with only 9 fouls conceded.

After two very mixed seasons (for their standards) where they finished outside the top 3, Dortmund are slowly rediscovering some consistency under Kovac and are playing some nice transitional football. They defeated Frankfurt on penalties in the DFB-Pokal a few days ago and are 4th in the league - 2 points off second after some tricky opening fixtures to start the season. On the other hand Augsburg finished 12th last season, comfortably avoiding relegation  but find themselves in 15th spot right now after a poor start to the season. Under former Bayern player Wagner they have developed a counter-attacking style similar to Dortmund. At home, Augsburg have averaged 5.2 corners won over their last ten with 3.8 conceded whilst on the road BVB have averaged 4.1 won over the same period. That gives me 4.2 corners for Dortmund even by applying pressure as they are the better team.

That gives this play a 75% chance of winning with some very good value at stake. This line cleared in last year’s fixture and in 9/10 of both BVB’s last 10 away matches and for Augsburg’s opponents at the WWK Arena. BOL !

PSV face Fortuna in what could be an open match with goals expected. PSV’s attack has been strong recently, with three of their last six games going over 3.5 goals. They dominate possession and create plenty of scoring chances, especially at home. Fortuna can sometimes defend deep but also struggle against fast, attacking teams like PSV. If PSV start well and take control early, the game could see several goals again. Over 3.5 goals looks possible considering both sides’ recent trends and PSV’s attacking form.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Larger write-up coming...   
  
This is a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> for a few different reasons. But it boils down to two things that compound into one another. 

1. I think bookies have really struggled with what to make of Coventry so far. I feel like odds have been off for a while - which is fair to a degree, this has been pretty unexpected. It&#x27;s tightened a bit in the last few weeks, but still some caution. 

2. Wrexham, imo, have been overrated in the odds in a large percentage of games. 

Add these two together, and you get pretty good odds. It was at $1.91 but it changed in literally the ten minutes it took me to write this up. It might shorten again.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Al Hilal O1.5 Goal Vs Al Shabab + PSV Vs Sittard O2.5 Goal ( -167 ) 3u to win 1.8u

Write Up

Al Hilal come in as clear favourites. They have one of the best attacking records in the league and strong home performances. Theyve been in great form lately, creating chances nonstop and usually finding the net at least twice in most games especially at home.

Al Shabab’s defense hasn’t exactly been solid either, so unless they suddenly tighten up, Al Hilal should have enough quality to put in a couple of goals.

Onto next <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> I think the over 2.5 goals in PSV vs Sittard has a good shot. PSV almost always play attacking football, especially at home , they press high, create a ton of chances, and usually score two or three on their own.

Sittard might not be a top team, but they can sneak in a goal if PSV relax a bit at the back. So even if PSV run away with it, something like 3-0 or 3-1 feels pretty realistic.</td></tr>

**Slepsk Suwalki - Trefl** 🏐 Volleyball Poland Superliga UTC 19:30

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **Trefl +1.5 Set Handicap** @ 1.56

Yesterday Verona did not disappoint and won 3-0. 🎯

Let&#x27;s start with the odds shown for both teams. Trefl should be the favorites, even slightly. This is because the balance of strength currently favors Trefl Gdańsk. They started the season with a 3-2 win over Barkom Lwów, with MVP Tobias Brand (New Transfer) scoring 23 points. In week 2, they lost 2-3 away to Asseco Resovia in Rzeszów, making it 1 win and 1 loss in the first two matches. The on-field backbone (setter, hitter, and libero) is more established, and there&#x27;s more depth. The transfer window was a productive one for Trefl. High-level &quot;winning profile&quot; additions: Experienced/effective players like Tobias Brand and Piotr Nowakowski directly boosted the quality. Aliaksei Nasevich (OPP): He sprained his ankle in a league match on October 26th and was substituted. It&#x27;s uncertain whether he&#x27;ll be ready for the away game against Suwałki.

Ślepsk Malow Suwałki lost 1-3 at home to Resovia and 0-3 away to Jastrzębski Węgiel in Week 2; they opened the season 0-2. The long, 33-31 victory in the third set came in the Jastrzębie match. A major summer overhaul: two new setters (Kamil Droszyński, Karol Jankiewicz), midfield reinforcements (American David Smith, Jan Nowakowski). Captain Bartosz Filipiak has been extended; he remains the team&#x27;s primary scoring option.

Trefl has looked competitive and productive in two matches, while Ślepsk struggled to create sets against two strong opponents. Trefl&#x27;s core is ready for the season opener. Trefl&#x27;s wing/backline is capable of holding sets inside and will give their all to win this match.</td></tr>

PSG take care of business but unfortunately our second leg gets voided due to an eye poke and is considered a no contest which means it should be void on every slip.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s match: LA Tech vs Sam Houston State (CFB) 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: LA Tech -14 Alternate Spread (-142, Fanatics)

If your book does not have whole number spreads you must calculate it yourself using a run line calculator with -14.5 and -13.5  (https://zcodesystem.com/runline\_calc/)

Back to fading my favorite team <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, Sam Houston State is still winless in 7 games and they are coming off a bye week so the last time they played was the last time we faded them against UTEP. If we take a look at similar opponents these two teams have faced this year we can see that there is a clear talent gap here because LA Tech is actually blowing out the teams that are blowing out Sam Houston.

Sam Houston vs WKU 24-41 Loss

Sam Houston vs NM State 10-37 Loss

Sam Houston vs UTEP 17-35 Loss

LA Tech vs WKU 27-28 Loss

LA Tech vs NM State 49-14 Win

LA Tech vs UTEP 30-11 Win

As you can see LA Tech has covered the  spread against all teams who covered the spread against Sam Houston except against WKU. Admittedly LA Tech has not been in good form, they closed against Kennesaw State as a -5.5 favorite and against WKU as a -6 favorite and lost to both outright. They got destroyed by Kennesaw State 35-7 but performed much better in their loss against WKU in the second half which I&#x27;m hoping carries over to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. They were trailing WKU 20-7 but then held WKU scoreless in the second half and was able to force OT which they lost. I think this is a good bounce back spot for LA Tech who are basically the better team everywhere compared to Sam Houston, personally taking -14 for a two touchdown cushion which would be a push but I also like -16.5.

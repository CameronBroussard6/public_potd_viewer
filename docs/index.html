<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>: Crvena Zvezda vs **FCSB** to win at **8,5** odds

Very hard day to choose from. I ended up sticking with a very risky play here. I might be extremely stupid in this one, but I&#x27;m trusting the gut feeling here. Something feels off about this game. Crvena Zvezda is usually playing in the Champions League, but they are in the bottom half of the Europa League right now. That&#x27;s unusual, since they always used to perform on the highest level the past few years. Crvena is not really superior in the league either where Partizan will give them a tough time for the first place. They usually dominate heavily the Serbian league. 

FCSB on the other hand has been mediocre in the league, but performs decent in the Europa League. They lost vs Basel after the early red card, which makes it understanding. Bologna was a tough game where they &quot;only lost with 1 goal&quot;. And they also lost vs Young Boys at home with 0-2, where the xG was even with their goal chances as well. 21 shots and 6 on target for FCSB compared to Basels 16 shots and 8 on target. If there is a chance for an upset it should be here. Crvena on some type of a decline and failing to qualify for the Champions League by their own standards and FCSB putting decent performances stats wise in this tournament. **But** anything can happen in football. Good luck everyone.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: **Rashee Rice Longest Reception Over 23.5 (2 U)**  
  
Rashee Rice consistently generates mid-20s chunk gains, averaging **24.1 yards** on his longest catch this season. Dallas has been vulnerable to these exact plays, allowing a longer reception than this line in **7 of their last 10 games**. Their coverage structure gives up space on crossers, deep outs, and YAC-heavy routes — all core parts of Rice’s usage. Mahomes doesn’t need to hit a true deep ball for Rice to get there; most of Rice’s long gains come from schemed separation and turning a normal target into a 20+ yard play. You’re essentially betting on one clean window where Rice gets free in space, and that’s something Dallas has had trouble preventing almost every week.</td></tr>

⚽ **Glasgow Rangers - Braga** | UEFA Europa League

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **Braga X2 Double Chance + Total Yellow Cards Under (4.5)** @ 2.00

The story is much more complex on the Rangers side; center-back Derek Cornelius is injured and has been removed from the European list. John Souttar and young talent Mikey Moore are also out until the new year. Dujon Sterling, who was added to the list in Cornelius&#x27;s place, has just returned from a long injury, and his full-match rhythm is a question mark.

Braga&#x27;s side continues to perform smoothly; they&#x27;re volatile in the league but very strong in Europe; they have a record of 3 wins and 1 loss in the Europa League this season.

The Dutchman Allard Lindhout manages Rangers and Braga. Rangers and Braga have received only 9 yellow cards in 8 matches, meaning their card average is well below the league average. Referee Lindhout has also issued 62 yellow cards / 18 matches this season, averaging 3.44 yellow cards per game.

Braga&#x27;s 9 points in 4 matches, a goal-scoring record of 8-4,
Rangers&#x27; 0 points, a poor record of 1-8, and significant defensive shortcomings are pointing the finger at Braga.

<tr><td class='post'>**POTD Record:**  95 – 63 - 9

**Previous:**  Man City -1 Asian Handicap  &amp; Newcastle Double Chance  - LOSS

**Recap:**  Both legs lose… I have no explanation and no excuses.  Last writeup I specifically wrote “do not tail”, as we are on a losing streak here.  Borderline tilt.  That is 4 losses in a row, my worst streak ever

**New Event:**  Green Bay Packers vs Detroit Lions

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:**  David Montgomery Over 1.5 Receptions @ 1.88 (Usual 3 units)

**WARNING:**  I am on 4 game losing streak on <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>. 

If a “recession” is defined as 2 quarters of consecutive GDP decline, then after 4 losses I am living one.  But I will stop posting long before reaching depression status defined by me as negative ROI%.  Getting damn close though.  I want to walk away for a bit but want that 100^(th) win as well. 

**Data supporting my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>:**

* Both teams are missing their starting tight-ends.  Lions with Sam LaPorta and the Packers are missing Tucker Kraft. 
* In the absence of their starting tight end La Porta, Detroit will have both Gibbs and Montgomery on the field to use as options for short passes. Last week vs the Giants they had to use their RB’s for short screens and option passes. 
* Last week Gibbs was 11/12 receiving for 45 yards while Montgomery was 3/3 for 19 yards. 
* So far this season Montgomery has been targeted 22 times and caught 19 passes.  That is an 86% completion rate.  The guy does not drop many balls.
* In their week 1 loss at Green Bay, Montgomery was 4 for 4 receptions for 18 yards.

There are many options to bet this match.  But after careful consideration, I am not picking a side or total but following a logical scenario where the absence of Sam LaPorta forces Detroit to throw the ball more often to their running backs.  Green Bay’s defense will be able to apply far more pressure on Goff than the Giants did.  Therefore, dumping the ball to Montgomery at least twice is not an unreasonable expectation given his previous performance vs the Packers and last week’s 3 receptions.   I expect more of the same this week.

Happy Thanksgiving everyone.

**EDIT:**  I have been trying to post a ton of data on this writeup for everyone but the system keeps rejecting the writeup for some reason.  I will try to put it as a comment in case anyone is interested.</td></tr>

<tr><td class='post'>Strasbourg vs CP, CP ML


CP come into this matchup with the quality, structure, and intensity needed to overcome Strasbourg. The squad’s attacking depth and Premier League-hardened mentality give them a clear edge. Even when rotated, CP’s front line offers pace, direct running, and multiple goal threats that Strasbourg may struggle to contain.


In midfield, CP’s physicality and ball-winning ability can tilt the game in their favour. They are strong at breaking up play and quickly transitioning into attack, something Strasbourg’s defence—often vulnerable when pressed—has shown difficulty handling. 
If CP control the tempo and win second balls, the match will play out on their terms.Defensively, CP are typically well-organized, disciplined, and comfortable dealing with aerial threats, which limits one of Strasbourg’s main attacking outlets. With a back line used to facing elite attackers every week, CP should be able to neutralise Strasbourg’s forward movement and force them into low-percentage chances.Overall, the combination of superior squad depth, tactical versatility, and Premier League experience positions CP as strong favourites. If they impose their style early, Strasbourg will find it difficult to keep up—with CP well-placed to secure the win.</td></tr>

Chiefs ML/Ravens ML +101 

Both must win games for each team against teams that seem to be inferior. The Cowboys showed some life last week against the Eagles, but I will pay to see them do it again against the Chiefs. The Ravens have been a little slow on offense recently, but getting to play against the Bengals should help with that. I have concerns about Burrow stepping right in and being the great QB that we expect from him.

Write Up: I apologize for Harvard yesterday, turnovers killed us. We move forward. Statistically we were on the right side. <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> i’m Eyeing the Green Bay packers as they Face the lions. I feel Green Bay has the more sound defense in this matchup which I think keeps this close. Green Bay is allowing just 18 point per contest sitting at 5th in the league as opposed to Detroit at 11. Green bay is also significantly better in pass coverage allowing just 182 yards per game. Slight edge in the rushing defense as well for the packers as their 6th in the league in run stop. Aside from the lions generating a bit more Turnover per game, I see this being an evenly matched game for the most part. But I’ll be backing the packers as I think their defense will give them the slight edge in this one. Happy turkey day everybody, let’s get some money.</td></tr>

Broky has been in terrible form lately, going under in every game but 1 so far at the major. That map went to double overtime, where finished with 0.88 rating.

The list of players the new coach Alimpijevic of Serbia made has some respectable players, but they are coming in a few days. All of the Euroleague players played last night and on Tuesday. For this game, he can&#x27;t count on them.

The Swiss team has some interesting names, franch league players, and an experienced Greek coach, who I believe can make this into an interesting game, 23 points spread is set a bit too high here.

The recent Switzerland results in August, a preround of these qualifications, showed some decent quality against Ukraine and Slovakia, let&#x27;s say relatively decent teams.</td></tr>

Europa League | Roma v Midtylland

First of all, Midtylland doesn&#x27;t make many attempts, but when they do, it&#x27;s mostly on target. That is why they are leaders when shooting on target, with 25/51 attempts on target (49.02%) in the Europa League so far (4 games).  
In their last 4 Europa League match, they have hit this prop 100%:  
vs Celtic - 4 corner  
vs Maccabi Tel Aviv - 6 corner  
vs Nottingham - 8 corner  
vs Sturm Graz - 4 corner

On the contrary, the reason this is a plus money is because Roma has not allowed more than 3 corners to its opponent in their last 4 match (2,3,3,3).

The reason I like this plus money is because Roma is favored to win this match, which means Midtylland will have to try to create enough chances, and they are capable of that.  
For example, Midtylland has not conceded a goal in 1st half except with Nottingham, and their corner count exploded in that match (a total of 18 corners). I am projecting the same situation here; the key factor is Roma should be able to put pressure on them. GL 🍀.

 **Roma vs Midtjylland** : **BTTS + Over 2.5 goals @ 1.94**.(-106) 1 Unit



I’m rolling with **Over 2.5 + BTTS Yes** because the numbers are screaming goals. Midtjylland have scored **2 or more goals in every Europa League match this season**, while Roma come in having **scored multiple times in three straight games**. Add in Roma’s surprising defensive vulnerability at home and both teams’ attacking quality, and you’ve got a matchup built for goals on both ends.

If you want to play it safer, you can take **BTTS at 1.84** or simply **Over 2.5** if you’re feeling conservative.I also like goals in Viktoria Plzeň vs. Freiburg (Over 2.5), but for the official POD, Roma vs. Midtjylland is the one that checks the most boxes for me.

However, Midtjylland is at the top of the table in the Europa League with 4W0D0L and 11 goals scored. This league is pretty crazy and Midtjylland is one of my “don’t underestimate them” teams (the others being Pafos and Qarabaq) - I think 1.64 are pretty solid odds for them managing to score at least one.

Ludogorets are out of form for a while now, they&#x27;ve only won twice since the beginning of October. Those wins were against a team in a lower league in the cup and against the number 14th (out of 16) in their own league.

If we look at their performance in the Europa League it&#x27;s even more disappointing. They&#x27;ve won their first game against Malmö (who are still only on 1 point), but lost every single European game after that. They also conceded 2 goals in every game they&#x27;ve lost. They&#x27;ve also conceded 9 goals in their 5 most recent domestic matches.

Celta on the other hand have picked up great form recently. Except for Barcelona they haven&#x27;t lost since the start of October. With wins against PAOK, OGC Nice &amp; Dinamo Zagreb they are sitting 4th in the EL league phase standings. They&#x27;ve also managed to score 2+ goals in those wins. They&#x27;ve also scored a total of 9 goals in their 5 most recent domestic matches.

If we compare national leagues, according to UEFA: Bulgaria is sitting in 27th whilst Spain is sitting in 3rd. This doesn&#x27;t represent just these two teams, but it does show that performing well domestically in Spain would be significantly harder then Bulgaria. And Ludogorets can&#x27;t even manage to perform well in Bulgaria.

**Best of luck if tailing!** 🍀

[Auburn write up](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/s/0wmgsLb9bh)

Two nights ago I submitted without a doubt my worst <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> on here to date. The read was bad and I didn’t give y’all a great write up or anything. That was tough to watch and I apologize. We don’t lose two in a row and I’m comin back with a 2 unit play for thanksgiving after spending <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> recouping. Let’s get it.

Event: Michigan State vs UNC (NCAAB) (3:30pm central)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Michigan State ML (-130) (2U)

-everything is bet to win unit amount-

Write up: 

Michigan State enters the Fort Myers Tip-Off against North Carolina with the kind of profile that makes them a strong play in this spot. The Spartans are undefeated with statement wins already under their belt, including Kentucky and Arkansas, and they’ve been winning with margin thanks to an elite defense that has held opponents to just over 62 points per game on roughly 38% shooting. That defensive baseline is what travels on neutral courts, and it’s the reason Tom Izzo’s group has looked unbothered regardless of opponent. 

What makes this matchup particularly dangerous for UNC is that Michigan State’s offense has started to catch fire since the Kentucky game, shooting above 50% from the field and close to 45% from three in their most recent outings. If the Spartans continue to shoot at that level, there isn’t a team in the country that can keep pace when you pair that efficiency with a defense already ranked among the nation’s best.

The frontcourt battle is where Michigan State has a clear edge, and it’s not just about throwing bodies at UNC’s freshman star Caleb Wilson. While Wilson has been dominant early with over 20 points and 10 rebounds per game, UNC also leans on Henri Veesaar, a mobile big who can stretch the floor and protect the rim. Michigan State is uniquely equipped to handle that kind of versatility because their rotation of Jaxon Kohler, Carson Cooper, Coen Carr, and Cam Ward isn’t just physical — they’re also capable of stepping out defensively and contesting jumpers. Kohler provides scoring and rebounding inside, Cooper brings length and rim protection, Carr adds athleticism and switchability, and Ward has shown he can stretch the floor offensively, pulling opposing bigs away from the basket. That combination allows Izzo to mix and match, guard mobile bigs like Veesaar without sacrificing rebounding, and still punish mismatches on the other end. It’s a depth advantage that most teams simply don’t have, and it forces UNC’s frontcourt to play honest defense for 40 minutes.

Guard play also favors Michigan State. Jeremy Fears Jr. has been orchestrating the offense with strong assist numbers, keeping the Spartans balanced and disciplined rather than leaning on isolation. That structure has produced consistent scoring in the high 70s, and it’s reflected in their ability to generate quality shots across multiple games. UNC’s backcourt, while talented with Seth Trimble and Kyan Evans, has shown stretches of inconsistency, including a slow start against Kansas where they struggled to find rhythm early before rallying late. Against Michigan State’s connected defense and steady execution, those lapses can quickly turn into decisive runs that swing momentum on a neutral floor.

The numbers line up cleanly: Michigan State averages around 7–8 made threes per game, right in line with what UNC typically allows, and the Spartans’ defensive efficiency creates a significant gap between what UNC normally shoots and what MSU typically forces opponents into. Historically, UNC leads the series, but Michigan State won the most recent meeting in overtime last season, proving Izzo’s game plans travel well against this opponent. With the spread sitting in a tight range, the edge comes from Michigan State’s defensive floor, current shooting form, and rotational flexibility to neutralize both Wilson and Veesaar without selling out.

Michigan State has already proven it can beat elite competition, their shooting surge since Kentucky raises their ceiling to national-title levels, and their defense ensures the floor is high. If the Spartans continue to shoot like they did against ECU, they’ll bury UNC runs before they start, and when you pair that with a defense holding opponents under 40% from the field plus a frontcourt that can stretch the floor and guard mobile bigs, there isn’t a team in America that can outlast them over 40 minutes. The bet is clear: 2 units on Michigan State to handle business in Fort Myers. Let’s get right! Have a great thanksgiving and as always, cheers 🍻</td></tr>

Tennis | Bogotá Challenger | 10:00 AM EST (estimated)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Stefan Kozlov vs David Jorda Sanchis | **Kozlov ML at -141. 1 unit.**

Write-up: Solid match from Mejia, though he missed a match point on serve at 5-4 and needed a tiebreak to close out the second. 

Stefan Kozlov has been playing some solid tennis recently. After coming back from a three-month injury break in October and playing some open tournaments in Mexico, Kozlov captured his sixth career Challenger title in Champaign with a win over Murphy Cassone in the final. Following that title, he moved over to clay courts here in Bogota, where he was pushed all the way down to +118 from an opening price of +175 and defeated a solid player in Juan Bautista Torres in the first round. Kozlov hardly ever plays on red clay, but that doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that he&#x27;s terrible on it, and I actually feel that his spin-heavy game suits the surface quite well. He did make quarterfinals in Kigali 1, Kigali 2, and Merida (all 5000+ ft. altitude) in early 2024, and also has some strong results on green clay, which tends to play a bit like the altitude clay you see here in Bogota. 

Meanwhile, David Jorda Sanchis is a much more experienced clay-courter who possesses a big serve that can do some damage in these conditions. However, David&#x27;s recent results have been inconsistent, and the fact that he was only priced at -200 against Campana Lee in the opening round concerns me a bit. He did end up winning that match pretty easily, but Campana Lee has been losing to anyone and everyone as of late. I did feel that Jorda Sanchis made some loose errors in that match, and Kozlov&#x27;s touch and consistency should be able to force him into longer rallies. 

It&#x27;s true that Jorda Sanchis has been grinding the SA clay circuit for many weeks in a row now, but I honestly feel that this can be as much of a weakness as it is an advantage at this point in the season. Kozlov comes into this match as the fresher player and with plenty of ranking points to make up before the start of next year. I&#x27;m willing to go against convention here and <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> the less experienced clay-courter simply because I believe he is playing better overall tennis and has better chances in a long match.

Teams/Times: (Imperial vs. NRG 11:30 AM EST. | PARIVISION/Legacy | 2:00 pm EST.)

**Try O 14.5 Kills Map 2 (-161)**

* Imperial take on NRG and get a great match to potentially advance to do NRG using a coach. Try is easily Imperial&#x27;s best player, he is averaging a .81 KPR in the L3 months with a .85 KPR in the last month, this line just feels too low to me for how good he has been playing.
* So far at the major try is averaging a .87 KPR if he maintains this pace \~17-18 rounds to hit this line
* Map 2 is NRG <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, while they have multiple options and unsure how their map pool will change with using their coach instead of nitr0, based on their previous picks + Imperial weaknesses, I am expecting Train or Inferno to be their map <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. NRG outside of one game really haven&#x27;t gotten blown out at all. Their games have been relatively close. This is the 2-2 match and the loser goes home, everything on the line, expecting close/high round games
* Try is an AWPer similar to Jame, AWPing on CT side is much better as you get to hold angles and is just much easier to keep the AWP and consistently find good spots with it. We can see this with try averaging a 1.00 KPR on CT side in the last month and a .93 KPR in the L3 months.
* Try is averaging a .82 KPR on Train in the L3 months, he is averaging a .96 KPR on CT side Train
* Try is averaigng a .86 KPR on Inferno in the L3 months, he is averaging a 1.01 KPR on CT Side Inferno

**Jame U 5.5 Headshots (-208)**

* This line has immense value, I liked it a ton already at 4.5, he goes under a majority of the time, when he doesn&#x27;t he usually hits 5, so I really like the safety/insurance at 5.5
* Jame is the AWPer of PARIVISION, most famous for his play style of saving on repeat and always getting exit kills/stat padding with the AWP. While it might suck to watch it is great for headshot unders as he keeps the AWP out and you don&#x27;t get headshots with the AWP. He also isn&#x27;t great on pistol rounds either (twice a game) which are the most scary as nearly every kill on a pistol round is a headshot
* Jame is averaging a 30.4% headshot percentage in the L3 months with a 28.1% in the last month. So far at this tournament he is averaging a 19.6% headshot percentage. He is 0/5 at the tournament so far while dropping 17+ kills in every map played so far. He will also start on CT side which is a much lower headshot % side for the AWP
* Expecting Legacy to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> Inferno, with a small chance of Dust 2 as their map choice (Map 1). Jame is averaging a .66 KPR L3 months on Inferno with a 27.7% headshot percentage, with a .68 KPR in 2025 on a 29.9% headshot percentage. This is his lowest rated overall map. His Dust 2 stats are right with his normal averages in both headshot % and in KPR, but this was PARIVISION previous first <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, the games PARIVISION start on CT side he has a much lower HS % on  Dust 2.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** NRG ML @ 2.37 on Bet365 (3 units) ❌

**Write Up:** This is a wrong-team-favourite spot.

Both teams are 2-2 in the Swiss, but the paths are not close. NRG’s wins came over NiP, who have already punched their ticket to Stage 2, and FaZe, who are also sitting in the 2-2 group, while their losses came against M80 (through at 3-0) and Fnatic, another team already qualified. That’s a record of beating solid opposition and only dropping maps to teams that are advancing.

Imperial’s losses also came against teams moving on, but their wins are propped up by Rare Atom and The Huns, both already eliminated and combining for a single win between them. That’s a much softer way to get to 2-2 and makes their record look better than the quality of opponents suggests.

On an individual level, every NRG player not named Daps has outperformed every Imperial player not named Try, with Try being the hard-carry on the Brazilian side.

In the map pool, NRG have posted better results on nearly every map except Nuke and Overpass.

Power-rating everything, NRG come out as roughly a 1.90–1.66 favourite here, so anything around even money is already good value. At a price like 2.37, this is automatic, with the only real devil’s-advocate angle on Imperial being that they very likely have the best player in the server in Try.

Edit: Super disappointing and flat performance out of NRG. There may have been some momentum at play, NRG coming off back to back losses. Tough loss.</td></tr>

*With Detroit’s top-10 rushing defense, Green Bay is likely to lean on the passing game. With Jayden Reed and Tucker Kraft out, Christian Watson becomes a primary beneficiary of that shift.*  
  
*The Lions have allowed the 12th-most receiving yards to wide receivers this season and, over the past month, have played the most man coverage in the league—exactly the look Watson exploits.*  
  
*In his last meeting with Detroit, a similarly man-heavy game plan yielded 114 receiving yards for Watson.*  
  
*With Kraft unavailable, Watson further solidifies as the Packers’ best man-coverage answer, leading the team in yards per route run vs. man.*  
  
*Detroit’s secondary is also thinner than usual (e.g., Kerby Joseph out), and if Terrion Arnold is limited, the Lions will be forced deeper into their cornerback rotation—opening vertical and intermediate windows in Watson’s wheelhouse.*</td></tr>

THE LIONS ARE BUILT TO CONTROL THIS GAME WITH A RUSH-HEAVY, EFFICIENT OFFENSE BACKED BY A STRONG RUN DEFENSE. THEIR RUNNING GAME GIVES THEM A CLEAR EDGE — THEY AVERAGE OVER 5.1 YARDS PER CARRY, WHILE THE OPPONENT PASS RUSH/DEFENSIVE FRONT STRUGGLES SOMETIMES TO CONTAIN EXPLOSIVE RUNS. THEIR OFFENSE IS AMONG THE MOST PRODUCTIVE IN THE LEAGUE — THEY RACK UP NEARLY 30 POINTS PER GAME AND MOVE THE CHAINS EFFICIENTLY, MAKING THEM HARD TO STOP EVEN IF THE PASSING GAME GETS STUCK.  ￼ON DEFENSE, THEY HAVE THE RUN-DEFENSE TO LIMIT ANY RUSHING THREAT FROM THE PACKERS, FORCING GREEN BAY TO BE ONE-DIMENSIONAL AND HANG IN LONG THIRD DOWNS.  IF THEY PROTECT THE FOOTBALL, AVOID TURNOVERS, AND PLAY WITH DISCIPLINE — ESPECIALLY ON EARLY DOWNS AND THIRD DOWNS — THEY’RE IN PRIME POSITION TO CONTROL POSSESSION, CONTROL THE CLOCK, AND POUND OUT A DUB.

**Write-up:** Thanksgiving Football is Back! And so is Joe Burrow (from injury) and Ja&#x27;marr Chase (from spitting on Ramsey&#x27;s face). And so are we - going back to the same bet that is - since I love this one. Divisional rivalries tend to be a lower scoring than other games as teams know each other much better. The Bengals-Ravens rivalry is not one of those. Since 2021 they have played each other 8 times - with these scores:

https://preview.redd.it/ftstthltlp3g1.jpeg?width=150&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1e2ad813565d67fdde1f1686751d872ca8f6714

6/8 have gone over 50pts, and only twice has the losing team scored less than 20. More importantly for our purposes, 7/8 (87.5%) have hit our bet. More recently - in their last 5 games the Bengals have scored 30+ points in 3/5 while giving up 30+ in 4/5. The Ravens, over their 5 game win streak have avg 27pts/game. Their defense has improved to be sure - limiting scoring but they are still giving up a ton of yards and have faced pretty lackluster offenses in that span (jets, dolphins, vikings, browns, and bears before they got good). Bengals give up 3rd most passing yards, Ravens 10th most. Neither side has a potent pass rush (CIN 31st, BAL 23rd worst in PRWR). Both sides will drive the ball down the field. Honestly I cant see Zac Taylor settling for field goals knowing his D - especially if the Ravens go up early. O and did i mention Burrow is back?

The Lions are running man coverage at the **2nd highest rate in the league**. This just happens to be where Christian Watson excels. **He leads the team in targets per route run and yards per route run against Man coverage**. When this Lions team isn&#x27;t playing man, they are playing **middle-field-closed zone** primarily. This will leave the outside more open, which is exactly where Watson thrives. This outside of the field, big play potential was noticed last week as well. When the Lions faced off against the Giants, they **allowed 5 players to tally a reception of over 30 yards**, including Jameis Winston himself.

Lastly, the Lions are favored in this match up, and if this holds like I&#x27;m expecting it to, there should be a positive game script for Watson to clear this line tomorrow. **Remember, it only takes one play!**

**Write Up:** One word sums up our last pick: pain. I still stand by the read, everything went as expected, but we were majorly unlucky with the end result. 5 shots for van Dijk, all blocked or missed. That was tied for the most shots he&#x27;s ever taken for Liverpool, in the other match he had 2 on target. We move on.

Back south we head to Birmingham <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> as Aston Villa host Young Boys who, in case you didnt know, are currently 3rd place in Swiss Super League. Villa is a heavy favorite here as EPL sides tend to dominate this competition, and the home crowd has something to do with it as well. 

Donyell Malen tends to split time up top with Ollie Watkins. He has shifted to become the top <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> for Europa matches, partly due to his positive form, partly due to Ollie&#x27;s suboptimal form, and partly due to an injury Ollie picked up a few weeks back. **It is not 100% guaranteed that our guy Malen starts**, but it appears Watkins is still struggling with fitness and I believe coach will want to rotate the squad a bit here with the heavy schedule over the next few weeks. All that said, he is very likely to start and likely to play the entire match. Coming off a 6 shot, 4 SOT performance in the last Europa match and an impressive stint with Netherlands, I really like Malen to play well here <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. 

We have an admittedly small sample pool of data to pull from for Malen, which is partly why we&#x27;re getting such nice odds here. He has only started 3 EPL games this season and two Europa matches. I am banking on form and his trending upwards in all competitions. If he starts, he should smash this line. 

Young Boys on the other side give up a lot of shots (and goals). In their 4 Europa matches, the opposing team has taken the following shots oldest to most current: 18(6 SOT)-17(3)-15(4)-23(10). And none of these teams have the quality of Villa. 

If you want to be safe **wait for the starting lineups to confirm Malen starts**. The odds may go down once he is confirmed a starter, but there&#x27;s less risk. Either way, BOL and have a great Thanksgiving!</td></tr>

Writeup: Happy Thanksgiving to all my fellow Americans out there, and to anyone else who has things to be thankful for. For this batch of Thanksgiving games, we are going to go with the under in the Chiefs vs Cowboys game. Market support is currently on the under, with many sites dropping to 51.5 and may drop again before gametime. 

On paper, this total makes sense - both offenses are incredibly explosive with defenses that can get scored on quite easily. However, I think both defenses are being slightly undervalued in this one. With the addition of Quinnen Williams for the Cowboys, their run defense has stepped up in a big way. Their pass defense is still a little suspect, but they are now able to give their defenses some more help in the backfield while the front 7 do a better job of stopping the run. The Chiefs defense have also looked better in recent weeks along with the Chiefs offense finally looking more cohesive and spending more time out on the field.

We also have 2 potential injury concerns to 2 star players, those players being Rashee Rice and George Pickens. Rice has already been cleared to play and I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;ll be playing close to 100%, but there is always a chance of reinjury or limited snaps. This point is a much larger focus on the latter player. Last week, in the final moments of the Cowboys game, WR George Pickens suffered some sort of a knee injury, but there is very little clarity on what is going on with said injury. He has also been cleared to play after a full walkthrough, but again, this lack of clarity only supports the argument of the under. With both teams playing on a short week, I would not be surprised if both of these players see slightly less reps.

There is also the possibility that the Chiefs wipe the floor with the Cowboys, in which they can continuously run out the clock and not have to score towards the end of the game.

I think this game will be a bit of a defensive duel for teams with weaker defenses starting to emerge. I still expect a solid amount of scoring, but will not get over 52.5 points. I am guessing the final total will end up around 45 points.

Remember to only bet what you can afford to lose, and BOL!</td></tr>

Sport: Europa League - Real Betis vs. FC Utrecht @ 3:00pm EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Please ignore but leaving here for visibility - Real Betis W + Over 2 total goals = -105 (5 units)

Edit:**** New <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Real Betis -1.5 Asian Handicap = +103 (5 units)

Write Up: Real Betis form has slightly dipped as of late with low scoring draws to Valencia and Girona. However, they’re still 5th in La Liga, a league I consider more competitive and tougher than Eredivisie. FC Utrecht is currently 5th as well in Eredivisie. I think this bet is slightly higher risk due to a recent lack of scoring by both clubs but FC Utrecht will be desperate based on their Europa standing which will lead to more risky plays and opportunities for Real Betis. I believe Antony and co have the quality to win this game quite handedly, and they also have the international experience from last year. If you’d like to tail, please check my comment after lineups are announced as well. 

Edit #2: Lineups announced. Antony and Isco starting, I like it. Let it ride!

Crvena Zvezda are not a team that usually keeps clean sheets, despite being pretty good in attack. In the league phase so far, they hit btts in 2/4 games, lost 0-2 to Braga away, and beat Lille 1-0 at home, plenty chances for Lille and a btts should have hit there. FCSB are exactly the same with 2 btts hits, a 0-2 loss and a 1-0 win, again in a game where a BTTS should have hit. In qualifiers leading up to this tournament, Zvezda hit a btts in 5/6 games, FCSB in 6/8. In away games especially, FCSB hit btts very often with 7/9 league games hitting for them, Zvezda at home hitting in 5/7 league games.</td></tr>

Event: Bengals @ Ravens 6:20MST

Write Up: Quick write up here with nothing much to say here that doesn&#x27;t go without already being said. Joe Burrow is making his comeback from his toe injury this Thanksgiving weekend and Ja&#x27;Marr is making his comeback from his 1 week suspension. These two returns combined with the Ravens poor pass defense has all the makings of a fun and entertaining Bengals offensive classic. 

The Bengals and Ravens have yet to see each other this year but last season Chase BURNED the Ravens in both matchups. Game 1 he finished with 10 receptions and 193 yards, in game 2 he went ballistic @Baltimore with 11 receptions and 264 yards.

Even though 91.5 yards on an over doesn&#x27;t always feel desirable, but I believe this is more than achievable against this current Ravens defense and what is on the line for this division.

Tail or fade BOL to everyone and cheers! 🍻</td></tr>

Last pick: 49ers -7 (-120) ✅

Honestly I expected a better showing from the 49ers, just a terrible game from Brock Purdy with 3 interceptions. My read on Bryce Young however was correct that he would come back down to earth and that was good enough for the 49ers to take this win by double digits.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s match: Alabama vs Maryland (CBB)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Alabama -12.5 (-114, Fanduel)

Alabama (4-2) will take on Maryland (5-2) in a consolation game for the Players Era Tournament. Alabama&#x27;s record may be deceiving because they have played the toughest schedule so far with a recent brutal stretch of having to play Purdue, Illinois, Gonzaga, and St. Johns which are all teams in the top 25. They managed to get out of these games with a 2-2 record losing only to Purdue and Gonzaga who are ranked 1 and 2 on kenpom and they played fairly well in these games managing to play it close for the majority of the games.

Due to the tournament style we have seen how both these two teams faired vs similar opponents recently and Alabama just looks like the way better team beating UNLV by 39 who Maryland struggled against for most of the game and playing Gonzaga close who just so happened to also beat Maryland by 39. Alabama is one of the top offenses in the country and they take the 3rd most threes in college basketball with 34 a game and Maryland ranks 267th out of 365 for opponents 3 point percentage letting opposing teams shoot nearly 36% from 3 against them. Trusting the better team <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> who have been tested against top competition to cover the spread. BOL and bet responsibly.

PSG Vs Tottenham 

PSG win and over 2.5 goals 

(1.80) 2 units ✅

Great to be back with a win, would have been so underwhelming to come back to anything less


This actually drifted out to just over double money odds by kick off I couldn&#x27;t understand why.

A bizarre game with Tottenham going ahead twice, and actually scoring 3 goals from only 7 shots, both sides very clinical but PSG were the dominant team and good value for the win 5-3 in the end a bit sweaty at times but all my picks usually are 😅

Uefa Europa League 

Feyenoord Vs Celtic 

Feyenoord win and over 1.5 goals 

(1.90) 2.5 units

Celtic are a club in a very bad state at the moment, they&#x27;ve had a poor season for their standards performing very poorly, there are a number of factors for this but for me it&#x27;s mostly been the board and owners.

They have let some key players leave and have brought in some underwhelming players mostly on free transfers. Not helped also by arguably their best attacker Jota being injured also

Yes you may look and see they&#x27;ve won their last 2 games and Feyenoord have lost their last 3, for me you can&#x27;t just go off recent wins and loses, and performances and stats are much more important in the long term.


At home Celtic have an incredible atmosphere and the fans have carried them but away from home they have played some terrible performances, very lucky to recently beat minnows St Mirren 1-0 . St Mirren managed to accumulate 1.6 XG to Celtics 0.8xg

They got destroyed 3-1 away to Danish side Midtjylland lost also 3-1 to Hearts and lost embarrassingly 2-0 away to Dundee **just 1 win in their last 4 away games**

Feyenoord played in the champions League last season, they are having a blip in short term form themselves, losing their last 3 but still performing well in attack, no shame in losing to top German side Stuttgart, but should be doing better defensively.

**They still boost a strong home record of 7 wins from 10 home matches this season**

Feyenoord have much stronger pedigree in Europe in recent history, they have a much stronger squad on paper particularly in attack, with no significant injuries unlike Celtic I just can&#x27;t pass up on this play. Feyenoord should have far too much fire power for Celtic to handle.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>⭐️:🏈Chiefs -3 (-115) \[Bet365\]

Start Time &amp; TV: 4:30pm EST (CBS)

Units: 2.5 Units

Reasoning: Going with the Kansas City Chiefs over the Dallas Cowboys for some turkey day football. Both of these teams are coming off of game winning field goals and the two of these teams are fighting to keep their playoff hopes alive in this one. The main reason I like the Cheifs in this one is because of how bad the Cowboys defense is this year, especially in pass coverage and they are facing a Chiefs offense that is very pass heavy. The Cowboys defense is one of the worst in the NFL this year with over 270 passing yards allowed per game which is second to last in the league and also second to last in scoring defense allowing over 28 points per game to opponents. I think Rashee Rice, Xavier Worthy and Travis Kelce cook this Cowboys secondary and I wouldnt even be suprised to see Marquise Brown to make an impact in this one. The Chiefs run game has been stale recently but I am expecting that to change in this one as they are getting Isiah Pacheco back so I think this will greatly help the Chiefs offense out. The Chiefs have also been playing solid defense this year, they having been allowing less than 100 rushing yards per game as well as having a top 7 pass defense in the league. They are also doing a good job of keeping teams out of the endzone as they rank 4th in the NFL in points allowed per game with only an average of 18 points let up per game. With a pass offense that I think will exploit this Cowboys secondary and a solid defense, I think the Chiefs take this one by more than a field goal.

Prediction: 27-21 Chiefs

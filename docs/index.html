**Soccer | Bundesliga | Eintracht Frankfurt vs Borussia Dortmund**

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Dortmund win @ 2.02 \[1 unit\]

**Reason:** Frankfurt have a decent home record in the league this season (4 wins, 1 draw, 2 losses), but they have scored one goal or less in 4 of their 7 home league games. Their struggles in front of goal has seen them score just 4 goals in their past 6 games in all competitions.

Dortmund have the second best away record in the league (4 wins, 3 draws, 1 loss). They come into this match on an 8 game unbeaten run in the league (5 wins, 3 draws). They have scored in all 8 games, and have kept 4 clean sheets as well.

Writeup: I use two models for totals, one predicts a total of 230.9 and another predicts 225, which gives us roughly 11 points and 17 points of value respectively. This was at 240.5 last night, so I can see this total continuing to rise, however 56% of tickets and 58% of the money are currently on the under so I wanted to lock in now just in case this is the best number. BOL!

Background: I leveraged the book “Statistical Sports Models in Excel” by Andrew Mack to build a few NBA and NFL models. Each day (or week for NFL), I pull in the latest results to update the models, then make selections mainly based on the delta between my models and the current spread and the % of tickets and money coming in on each side. One thing to note, these models don’t factor in specific players so I also manually consider things like injuries in decisions.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: 🏈 Indiana -2.5 alt spread (-151).

Game starts at 7:30pm EST. Bet 3.25u

Writeup: Taking a point off the spread and going with Indiana to cover by 2.5 or more. If your book lets you, take them -3 for way better odds.

This is simply a bet of taking the better and healthier team. The Hoosiers are the top team in the country, sporting an absolute blowout against Alabama in their last game. In said game, Alabama only had 23 rushing yards. They are now getting an Oregon team with a ton of injuries that include their running backs Jordon Davidson and Noah Whittington. I expect them to have struggles having a balanced offense in this game, and it doesn’t help that Indiana has the #2 scoring defense in the league, only giving up 12 points per game. The Hoosiers also have the best redzone defense in the entire country, while Oregon ranks just inside the top 50 for their redzone offense.

In their last matchup, Indiana defeated Oregon 30–20. Oregon QB Dante Moore struggled in that game, throwing two interceptions and getting sacked six times.

On the flipside, Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza has been playing some incredible football and is absolutely deserving of his Heisman trophy. He has thrown for over 3100 passing yards this season with a touchdown to interception ratio of 36:6, and he boasts the number one EPA/play in the nation. He continues to build chemistry with his top receiver, Omar Cooper Jr., who has 12 receiving touchdowns on the year. This is noteworthy as Oregon’s defense ranks around the 100th spot in terms of defense against deep passes.

Indiana has covered the spread in 9 of their last 13 games, which is quite impressive given the caliber of opponent they have been playing. I do not expect this to be a total runaway game, as Oregon is a different caliber of team compared to Alabama. However, I expect Indiana to show both efficiency and consistency throughout the game and once again show us why they’re the top team in the nation. They are better than Oregon in almost every facet of the game, and I expect the Hoosiers to win by at least a field goal.

Remember to only bet what you can afford to lose, and BOL!</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: **Sacred Heart U31.5 1H points (-111 FanDuel) 1U**

Event: CBB | Marist @ Sacred Heart (7 pm EST) | 🏀

*Recap: Sweat-free cash. North Dakota State shot 53 percent, led by 20 at the half, and made UMKC look like a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>-up squad. Absolute brilliance from the Bison.*

I&#x27;m going back to one of my favorite bets: a smothering defense that plays slow on offense. It&#x27;s a style play. Sacred Heart (5-11) is a bad team that relies on the 3 ball, and Marist (9-6) is a tempo-control side with elite perimeter lockdown defense. I don&#x27;t think Sacred Heart will break 30 in the first half. It didn&#x27;t work two days ago with Northern Iowa against Belmont, but here&#x27;s why it will work tonight. 

First, there&#x27;s precedent. Marist has held five of its last seven opponents to 30 or fewer at the break, with Georgia Tech one of the teams that eclipsed the mark. In their last game, the Red Foxes held an Iona team averaging 80 points per game to just 22 in the first half. Marist is healthy and appears to be peaking defensively as it opens up conference play. For the season, Marist allows a scant 28.1 points in the first half, good for third in the nation. Tonight&#x27;s bet would easily be a two-unit play if they were at home, where Marist allows just 23.4 first-half points. And just to underline things, KenPom ranks little ol&#x27; Marist 30th in defensive rating. 

On paper, tonight&#x27;s matchup plays into the heart of that defense: Marist builds a wall at the 3-point line, where they rank third in the nation by holding opponents to 25.6 percent shooting. Meanwhile, Sacred Heart ranks 31st in 3-pointers made (10.4) but only 294th in 3-point percentage. In other words, they&#x27;re going to be jacking up shots. But if those shots aren&#x27;t falling, Marist isn&#x27;t going to surrender extra possessions. The Red Foxes are the better defensive rebounding unit. The only way I see Sacred Heart getting to 32 in the first half is if they solve the Red Foxes perimeter wall - or someone goes on an absolute tear, as happened with Jack Freaking Smiley in the Belmont game. Interestingly, both Marist and Sacred Heart play slow. They have identical pace (67.4) and rank 237th. I believe a methodical first half supports my thesis. 

Good luck and Godspeed!</td></tr>

Match: Sabalenka vs Muchova

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Muchova +4,5 games @ 2,14



Honestly, don&#x27;t understand the odds here. Yes, Sabalenka should be favorite to win this one without a doubt, but her and Muchova performances here definitely don&#x27;t deserve such a line. These two played each other 4 times, Sabalenka won the first match 7-5 7-6 in 2019, and since Muchova has won all 3, each time in 3 sets. Sabalenka is world number 1 and Muchova in only number 20, but the difference is nowhere near that big. Muchova had injury problems her whole career and that heavily influenced her ranking and achievements, but has looked amazing recently. Definitely one of my favorites on Tour, capable of winning anyone with here variety and all court tennis. She surely has a cure for Sabalenka big game, same as she had one against Rybakina. In my eyes, this is pretty even match, I have put some money on Muchova ML as well, but when I saw this line I jumped on it.

Bey is out and Queen is set for a matchup against the Wizards. Wizards are not a great rebounding team. They rank 27th in the NBA in defensive rebounding. The Pelicans meanwhile rank 10th in offensive boards.

Queen sees an average of 16.4 potential rebounds a game, 25% of them are offensive. Over his L5 and L10 games, he&#x27;s averaging 9 rebounds a game, including cashing L4/6.

Two fast paced, poorly disciplined teams. Expecting sloppy play and extra rebounds.

**Event**: English FA Cup - Wrexham vs Nottingham Forest - 19:30 GMT+0

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>**: Wrexham DNB @2.95

**Write Up**: Wrexham have hit form at the perfect time for this match. They&#x27;ve lost just twice in 14 games and have turned it up a notch to take four wins in their last four in impressive goal scoring fashion. Something detractors of Phil Parkinson&#x27;s playstyle wouldn&#x27;t have seen coming. But this is the biggest game of the season for them. Perhaps of the whole Wrexham project. They&#x27;ve waited years to get a Premier League side in the draw and it&#x27;s finally happened. With the perfect circumstances to actually progress. They&#x27;re in great form, they&#x27;re at home, Forest have been poor and a cup run may not be their most immediate of concerns. The 2-1 win against West Ham last weekend didn&#x27;t do much to inspire Forest that they&#x27;ve turned a corner but maybe just enough to see of relegation. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be much excitement or anticipation for the match from the Forest side and from fans online would like to see squad players given a run out. If that happens which is more than likely considering how consistent Forest&#x27;s traditional starting XI has been (opportunity to give them a slight rest) then it creates an opportunity for Wrexham. While it may still have quality, players who are not exactly match sharp and playing with players they&#x27;re not used to creates some disruption. I would look here to see the starting XI and adjust the bet accordingly if you&#x27;re not a risk taker.

**Additional Thoughts**: Last pick started off terribly due to some woeful defending for both Cremonese goals but thankfully clawed it back. Riskier one <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> but this is what betting is all about. The magic of the cup!</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Tari Eason O21.5 PR (-125), 1.25u to win 1u

**Write Up:** The Blazers have two options: they will either double KD, or let him go for almost 40 once again. In the likely scenario that they double him, Eason benefits a lot. As is, he has taken at least 15 FG attempts in 3 straight without Sengun in the lineup, attempting 18 two days ago against these blazers. The volume is there, and with the fact that the blazers are not respecting him and should respect him even less when they double KD, the shots will be relatively easy to fall. Portland is giving the third most offensive rebounds which can turn into points for Eason, he racked up 6 last game and had one that turned into points called off to win the game. With 22 rebound opportunities last game and a soft matchup on both statistics, i trust Eason to come through, even more so with the added fuel of the game winner called off and his expressed anger towards the refs on wednesday.</td></tr>

**Event:** NBA / Clippers @ Nets 7:40 pm EST

Back to Porter as he stays hot and has cashed us both times. I still believe there is good value here. Have to say, maybe I’ve become a little biased. I’ve favored watching the Nets recently as they are just a gritty team that likes to hustle and make plays for each other… think Pistons. Last game versus the Magic was one of the lowest scoring games I’ve seen all season, and Porter was straight up carrying.

Clippers have won some games recently but were torched by the Celtics, then beat the Knicks, who are struggling. Clippers in their last three games:

• ⁠28th in opponent points allowed

• ⁠20th in opponent rebounds allowed

• ⁠27th in opponent assists allowed

• ⁠23rd in opponent steals per game (9) while the Nets rank 4th in steals per game (11)

Opposing teams are shooting 47.9% against them, while allowing an average of 41.7 3PA (26th), so the looks will be there for Porter.

Over Porter&#x27;s last ten games, he is averaging 26 points, 8 rebounds, and 3.5 assists, while toting a ridiculous 52% FG% and 46.3% from deep. For him to be shooting that well, putting up 18+ shots a night is crazy, especially when half of them are threes. He has cashed this line 75% in his last eight and 61% this season. Vs bottom 50% defenses &amp; playing 28+ minutes, he is 10/11 on the season.

Notable players against the Clippers in the last three games:

• ⁠Jalen Brunson 36pra

• ⁠Stephen Curry 37pra

• ⁠Jaylen Brown 58pra

It is a one game system, a semifinals, and I expect Fener to want this win, especially since they lost to Mersin last year and then won the finals too. They won as guests and by 21.

What changed is Mersin team, they lost their best players Teaira McCowan to Fenerbahce, Bridget Carleton who went to USK Prague, Yvonne Anderson to Valencia, also Natascha Howard and Marine Johannes.

They got subs for this season, but not at that previous level when they had so many stars and played Euroleague finals and lost to Prague, they cut back significantly on expenses this year.

I imagine Fenerbahce wants a revenge here. 3-4 point win is nothing for these ladies, they remember and they want 20+ win. Also in the league, fener scored 90+ in their last 5 games.

Barry Town vs Llaneli Town Over 3.5 goals @ 2.12

This matchup strongly favors goals. Barry attacking power and high pressing style usually lead to dominant performances, especially against weaker opposition. Llaneli tend to struggle defensively and often allow many chances. Barry are capable of scoring three or more goals on their own, and any contribution from the visitors only increases the value.

Niagara&#x27;s defense gets worse the further you go out from the paint, and exceptionally terrible at defending the 3, something that Iona loves to do.  Iona is coming off maybe one of the most pathetic losses they&#x27;ve had in history, losing to Marist 38-83 shooting 1/14 from 3 and 24 turnovers.  If the coach didn&#x27;t threaten these kids, their parents did.  I expect Iona to lock back in on their home floor, and play with energy of a team that just got clowned on.

NBA | Nets v Clippers | 🏀  

Bad read, started good with 3 rebounds but Wizards just couldn’t miss and as a result Magic pulled their starters with 4 min left in the 3rd. We move 

Nets defense has looked great this season and I’m expecting tons of pressure and blitzes on the primary ball handler, in this case Harden. Think this’ll be tough game for Harden to score, but also a good spot for Zubac who should benefit of the Nets blitzes with good looks in the paint due to the pressure. Harden and Zu have a great P&amp;R chemistry and I think this’ll be a good matchup for him to have a good game here.

Just dropped 22 on the Knicks which is a very tough matchup for bigs, now gets a softer matchup on paper against the Nets who’s top 9 in points allowed to centers this season. Hasn’t faced them this season but did have a 21 point game against them in their last meeting.

WCJ 20, Sarr 19, Sengun 20 &amp; Embiid 27 points, just a few of the centers they’ve matched up against recently..

Nets have allowed 4th most FGM from less than 10 ft, making it a great matchup for Zu once again as he’s taking 93.1% of his shots from less than 10 ft.

Overall a great spot for him, looking like he’s back to his normal minutes again. Played 30 minutes last game and as I mentioned looked really good against the Knicks, should be in for 30+ once again with upside for more if the game stays competitive 

15.5 is fine, wouldn’t go higher than that tho</td></tr>

**NBL: Breakers v Kings - Robert Baker under 10.5 Points 3U** $1.75 (TAB) 5:30PM AEDT

  
Robert Baker attempts more than half of his shots from beyond the arc. Sydney, whilst mid tier in defending 3&#x27;s, allow the fewest attempts in the league by far. They allow the 2nd lowest PPG for opposing wings in the league per 40 minutes because they have long agile wings and good ball pressure chasing over screens and covering spot ups. 

Rob Baker&#x27;s defensive liabilities have been exposed recently and this has seen him slowly lose minutes to Carlin Davison. With Cooks out tonight, expect Kouat Noi and Jaylin Galloway to step up with bigger minutes. Noi especially, is offensively minded and will probably keep Baker on the bench in favour of Davison.

**Write up:** Was debating on doing NHL or NBA for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, decided to go with the Kings ML. This Winnipeg team is bad although often times find themselves in close games. In their last 10 they have been with one goal 8 times and two goals 2 times ( I like taking the +1.5 spread although that is currently at -230 ). Although inconsistent, I like the Kings to come here to win after having a heartbreaker loss to the Sharks. The Kings are the better team here, its just a matter if they can convert.

Todays <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: **Frankfurt v Dortmund: Dortmund DC &amp; u4.5 goals @1.62**

Frankfurt vs Dortmund should be a fairly controlled game rather than a crazy goal fest. Frankfurt have been a bit blunt going forward lately and are dealing with some attacking absences, which doesn’t help when you’re facing a Dortmund side that’s been pretty solid defensively. Dortmund don’t always blow teams away, but they&#x27;re hard to beat, especially in games like this where they’re happy to stay compact and play smart. I like Dortmund double chance here because they should at least get something from this match, and with Frankfurt not exactly free-scoring, under 4.5 goals feels very safe. This has 1-1, 0-1, or 1-2 written all over it. Dortmund DC + Under 4.5 @ 1.62 looks like a nice, sensible play.  I know these odds are bad, but I really want to keep this run going.  If you are really willing to risk it, you can try the Dortmund DC &amp; under 3.5 goals.  I feel that is likely also.

**Event:** NCAAB - USC @ Minnesota

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** USC +4.5

**Write Up:** USC +4.5 is a strong play because the Trojans are finally moving back into their own weight class after a grueling stretch against top-tier Big Ten defenses like Michigan and Michigan State. While those blowout losses look bad on paper, they were against teams with elite physicality that most teams in the country can&#x27;t match. Minnesota is a much more manageable opponent that lacks a true knockout punch on offense, averaging significantly fewer points per game than USC.

The matchup is particularly favorable for USC’s interior defense. The Gophers struggle to score consistently in the paint and aren&#x27;t a high-volume threat from the perimeter, which plays right into the hands of a USC team that ranks near the top of the country in blocked shots. USC has the length and athleticism to force Minnesota into a slow, half-court game where every possession is a grind.

Statistically, this game is projected by most models to be a one-possession affair, likely decided by three points or less. By taking USC at +4.5, you are getting a significant cushion that covers you even if the Trojans lose a close one. Eric Musselman is also historically excellent at getting his teams to bounce back after a loss.

Last pick: Houston Rockets vs. Portland Trail Blazers — OVER 225 Total Points (-110)❌ 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Desmond Bane “O”1.5 Made 3-Pointers

Reasoning:

Joel Embiid is Questionable with left knee injury management, and Kelly Oubre Jr. is Out. Without their best rim protector and wing defender, Philly’s defense is forced to collapse, leaving the perimeter open.
H2H Bane has hit this line in 67% of his recent matchups against Philly. In their most recent meetings, he exploded for 5 triples in one game and 2 in another.
 (Volume is King) Bane averages 2.7 makes per game this season. Even in a &quot;down&quot; stretch (hitting in 40% of his last 5), he is still seeing high-value looks as Orlando&#x27;s primary floor spacer.

Scenario A: The &quot;Whistle-Happy&quot; Game (Referee Influence)
 Officials are calling fouls at a 20-year high this season (43 per game). Orlando leads the league in Free Throw Attempts (30.0 per game).
 
Impact on Bane: Frequent whistles slow the game down into half-court sets. In these sets, Bane is the primary kick-out option when Banchero gets doubled.

 Outcome: Bane hits his 2 threes easily as Philly defenders are too scared to close out hard for fear of a whistle.

Scenario B: The &quot;Orlando Blowout&quot;
 Philly is &quot;gutted&quot; without Embiid and Oubre. Orlando recently hammered a short-handed Philly team 144-103. ,

Bane is still building chemistry with the Magic and usually stays in through the 3rd quarter even in blowouts. He scored 31 points in a recent double-digit win over Indiana.

Prop hits before the starters sit for the 4th.

Scenario C: The &quot;Maxey Takeover&quot;
 Tyrese Maxey (averaging a career-high 33 PPG) tries to carry the Sixers alone.

  Impact on Bane: Orlando will have to keep scoring to keep pace. Maxey’s speed pushes the transition game, leading to more &quot;trail&quot; threes for Bane.

 Outcome: High-volume attempts lead to a clear Over.

Scenario D: Scenario D: The &quot;Bane Facilitator&quot; Role

 The Play: Bane focuses more on playmaking (averaging 4.5 APG).

 Impact on Bane: While his assists might go up, your data shows his 3PM average (2.7) is significantly higher than the 1.5 line.

 Outcome: Even if he’s passing more, he only needs two shots to fall to cash this</td></tr>

**CFP - Indiana vs Oregon, 7:30 EST, ESPN**

***Indiana -2.5 (-151) 1.5u***

The second of 5 straight football plays takes us to the other half of the college football playoff, as undefeated Indiana takes on Oregon in the Peach Bowl.

Watching this line all week, seeing it drop from -165 to -150ish kinda scares me a bit, but it also gives me more value for a spread I was going to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> anyways. Word to Joe &amp; Soggy, and much of the nation, *Indiana is the team everyone is leaning on*, but I can’t find myself to stray from the public - I’m just a bit of a pussy, and I’ll pay for the insurance.

There’s of course metrics and data and information we can dive into - but honestly, the simple and plain fact of the matter is **Indiana has already beaten Oregon this year, and made them look basic in the process**.

You can stop reading here if you want - unless you believe the old adage in college football that *”it’s difficult to beat a team twice”*

For me, when the stage is this big, I have to lean on what makes the most sense to lean on: similar to my thinking in the first college football playoff game (kinda didn’t work, disclaimer), **I think the more balanced team, with the stronger defensive unit, will win**.

**Indiana are undefeated**, they’ve only **allowed more than 2 scores in 1 of their last 7 games**, they are the **number 2 overall defensive unit** in the country: they **rank in the top 3 in the country in yards against, rush yards against, scoring D &amp; 3rd down D**.

I shall not disregard the fact *Oregon have an elite level defensive unit themselves*, but Indiana have the offensive unit to match in spades: **7th in total offense, 3rd in scoring, the number 1 3rd down offense** - a lot of elite level ingredients to concoct successful playoff football.

Add to the fact that this feels like the Fernando Mendoza party - we are all just invited. The kid is a stud, and seems un-phased by the limelight. 

Give me Indiana by a FG minimum.

Last play review:

***CFP - Miami +7.5/Total u56.5 (-119) 1.5u*** ❌

(Boy oh fucking boy, if that isn’t the definition of a turn, I don’t know what is - this seemed cruised for a W before 4 lead changes in the 4th quarter made it a god damn tightrope - all the what ifs to reflect over this one: Miami had 3 INTs ripe to grab, a compete and utter lack of big play containment, and the touchdown on Miami’s final drive of regulation to kill us - this one is a heartbreaker)

Rose and Vinyl face off in the 2nd game of the season after seeing each other in the 2025 championship (Rose 62-54). Rose also won 2 out of 3 matchups in the 2025 season but there have been roster changes on both sides.

Rose retained 4 of their 6 with most notably Chelsea Gray returning. Rose didn&#x27;t miss a beat in their first game winning 80-62 against a shorthanded (and maybe league worst) Lunars Owls. Gray had a 35 point game and fowards Azurá Stevens and Shakira Austin (new addition) stepped up enough with Reese leaving the team. Kahleah Copper was ruled out but believe she&#x27;s expected to make her debut on Friday. 

Vinyl continue to be led by Rhyne Howard and Dearica Hamby but struggled in the first game losing 58-42 against a solid veteran Laces team. Vinyl&#x27;s explosive offense fueled their 2025 playoff run but they are still figuring it out. Losing 3 players (Ogunbowale, Boston, Canada) plus returning player Rae Burrell being out clearly impacted their opening performance. 

I think Rose continue off their momentum and win against Vinyl. Could keep an eye on injury updates for Copper or Burrell, but I think the Rose can keep their edge over Vinyl either way. BOL</td></tr>

___
Mirra Andreeva is still trying to bounce back from a disappointing end to last season, and so far she&#x27;s doing well.  <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> she faces Marta Kostyuk who is on an impressive 4-match win streak on hard courts, coming off of a surprising upset of #3 Anisimova and determined to get into the top 10.  Andreeva is favored, but with Kostyuk being in impressive form and having high confidence after her defeat of Anisimova, I see the *possibility* of an upset, so I&#x27;m taking a different angle here.  Andreeva lately has had a tendency to get a very slow start, partly evidenced by the fact that her last 5 matches have all gone 3 sets.  I anticipate this will start as an intense, highly contested match.  Kostyuk will likely steal a set, but since there isn&#x27;t much value in her set spread, and since betting over 2.5 sets carries a little extra risk, I&#x27;m instead opting for the third option and betting that we will see at least 22 total games.  This result will probably come by way of 3 sets (so no, I&#x27;m not opposed to betting over 2.5 sets at decent plus money), but the games total gives us the flexibility to also win with a potential 7-6/7-5, 6-3/6-4. 

Note: as a side bet, if you can find it:

Total balls hit aggressively by M. Andreeva into crowd or aimed at ball boy/ball girl OVER 0.5 is also a solid bet.</td></tr>

Stake: 2 units to win 4 units

Write Up:

Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> didn’t hit, so we reset and move on. Going with a player prop here.

I’m backing Julian Brandt to get at least one shot on target. In his last four competitive games he’s averaging 2 shots per match, and he’s been consistently getting one on target. On top of that, he’s in great form lately, scoring 4 goals in his last 3 games, including two against Bodø/Glimt in the Champions League.

He’s also done damage against Frankfurt before, scoring against them in their last meeting in the DFB Pokal. Even though he’s listed as a midfielder, Brandt loves getting into scoring positions, arriving late in the box, and his involvement has clearly gone up recently.

What I also like here is the matchup. In their last game, Frankfurt conceded a goal and allowed 3 shots on target from opposing midfielders, which lines up well with Brandt’s role and positioning.

We only need one on target, and at plus money this feels like a solid bounce-back spot with the stats backing it up.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Brisbane Roar Vs Auckland FC - **Auckland FC Win or Draw (Double Chance)+Over 1.5 Total Goals @ 1.72 (Melbet)**

**Write Up:** Brisbane Roar host Auckland FC in a match that looks more likely to produce goals than control. Both teams tend to play open football, and recent games suggest defensive discipline often takes a back seat once the match opens up.

Brisbane Roar’s recent form highlights ongoing defensive problems. They have lost three of their last five league matches, conceding eight goals in those defeats. That run includes a heavy 3–0 home loss to Wellington Phoenix, who were down to 10 men, and a 2–1 defeat away at Macarthur. Even in tighter games, such as the 1–0 loss to Melbourne City, Brisbane struggled to apply sustained pressure once they went behind.

At home, Brisbane Roar’s issues have been even clearer. In two of their last three home games, they conceded three goals and failed to score in both losses. While their away win against Central Coast Mariners showed they can be dangerous on the counter, that style hasn’t translated well at home, where they’re expected to control the game instead. Over the season as a whole, Brisbane Roar have scored just 11 goals in 12 matches. Even though they’ve conceded a similar number, their lack of attacking balance often leaves them chasing games rather than dictating the tempo.

Auckland FC come into this match with a stronger overall profile. They have won six of their 11 league games and scored 16 goals, showing they are more effective going forward. Recent away wins against Western Sydney Wanderers and Central Coast Mariners highlight their ability to handle pressure while still attacking with intent. Defensively, Auckland FC are not without their weaknesses. They conceded three goals at home to Newcastle Jets, and their 1–1 draw at Macarthur showed they can be exposed when teams attack them directly. Still, once games open up, Auckland often respond well and usually create enough chances to regain control.

Brisbane Roar come into this match after another away defeat in the A-League, making it back-to-back league losses. Looking at their recent form, the over 1.5 goals line has landed in three of their last five matches, though that drops to two out of five at home. Despite this, Brisbane’s recent performances haven’t been very convincing, and it feels like Auckland FC could take advantage of that. Auckland, on the other hand, have seen over 1.5 goals in four of their last five games and have either won or drawn in four of those matches. They are also unbeaten in their last five away games, with the same over 1.5 goals trend continuing on the road.

Overall, Auckland appear to be in much better shape in terms of form and momentum and could prove too strong for Brisbane. Their solid away form and sharper attacking play give them an edge against a Brisbane side that has struggled to assert itself at home. If Auckland take the lead, the match setup suits them, as they have the ability to stay on the front foot rather than sit back and defend.

I’m expecting points from these two teams which has been the norm throughout the season.  The O/U is currently at 48.5, but we can tease it down by 10 points to get us to 38.5 and a -110 scenario when combined with the ML.</td></tr>

Preston are top 4 in the Championship and Wigan are middling League One side. Debated taking the Preston ML here but there’s always the chance of heading to penalties here, so I’d rather just take the Over 2 total goals. BOL if tailing.</td></tr>

1st Leg - East Bengal has scored 2 or more in 5/6 matches they have played, and have scored 9,5,5 goals in the last 3 matches. Their player quality is well above the rest of the field &amp; should comfortably win here. However, Gokulam is pretty decent in defense, so going conservative &amp; taking a 2 goal asian line for EB to score.

2nd leg - THe HIL has started &amp; most games have been pretty decent goal wise. Both these teams have seen their 2 games hit this mark. I expect the total to end at around 5 or so, but i really want to get out of this rut, so going conservative with a 3 goal asian line.

Hope we get the W &amp; BoL</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Taiwo Awoniyi ATGS (+195) 1 unit to win 1.95 units

**Write Up:** That one hurt guys. 5 shots for Szoboszlai, including 2 free kicks, and he airmailed all of them. He had a great game too all around, and looked the most promising for Liverpool to score. I&#x27;m bordering fade territory with a couple unfortunate losses, might be best to limit your units or stay away for a few games. These plays are fun for me to back and gives me something to root for during the game, so we keep charging along. 

EPL goes on a bit of a break as the FA Cup comes to life this weekend. For those unfamiliar, the FA cup is a cup between pretty much ALL English professional teams, starting with over 700 teams. We are currently in the 3rd round with 64 teams, which is the first round that EPL and Championship teams join the matches. The FA cup is typically more prestigious than the EFL Cup, and the winning team earns an automatic berth in the Europa League next season. In these early rounds, you tend to see Premier League sides play a B team and lower division sides throw their all at the game to try and advance. 

For this match Wrexham, aka Hollywood FC, (9th in 2nd tier) host Nottingham Forest (17th) place in the EPL. Forest are in a proper relegation battle this season, so coach Dyche is going to have to preserve his top players and hope that mostly subs can grab the win here. Worst case he will throw on the bigger names after halftime if it looks grim. Wrexham have played 4 matches since Christmas, but also have a week off after this match so I expect mostly their first team. 

Taiwo Awoniyi (Big T) is an easy player to root for. He is a big and powerful center forward who a high motor, great attitude, and works super hard. He has had a really tough go of it over the last year, facing a really serious head injury at the end of last season when he collided with a goalpost. He&#x27;s had a slew of other injuries this year, but he&#x27;s finally fit again. This game is a prime game for him to show what he can do and finally get a chance. 

There is really no great data here to back up this play, because the sample size is so small. He scored a goal last season in the FA cup 4th round, but has otherwise struggled to find playing time. But with Wood out, and Kali out on loan, Big T will get his chance here as the team&#x27;s 2nd striker (Igor Jesus needs a rest). I&#x27;m backing that a premier league striker can find the back of the net against a 2nd division back line. 

No doubt this is a risky play, while I feel strongly that Big T will start, **lineups are always a risk in these cup games.** I personally am playing this now, as I expect the odds will go down once he is confirmed starting and lineups are out. But they&#x27;ll still be plus money, so please do your own research and consider the risk. 

BOL and happy Friday!</td></tr>

**Write Up:** Senegal are unbeaten against Mali historically and haven&#x27;t conceded more than 1 goal in any AFCON game so far. Senegal are a very organized, very sturdy team that plays as a unit, is top 10 in the world (in my opinion, FIFA ranks them #19) right now, doesn&#x27;t concede many chances, and most importantly is consistent. Mali on the other hand keep games very quiet, they&#x27;re okay-ish defensively, but are a team that&#x27;s relatively inexperienced and capitulates at most challenges. It&#x27;s not that they can&#x27;t go through, but I trust Senegal to finish the job without scoring too many or conceding much.</td></tr>

**Event:** Scottish Championship, Ross County v Partick Thistle, 2:45 pm EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Ross County 0.0 Asian Handicap, +135, 1 unit

**Write Up:** From the AFCON and the Spanish Super Cup in Saudi Arabia, the journey takes us to the good old second tier of Scottish football, where I&#x27;ve come across this very interesting matchup. We have the second placed Partick Thistle *(I could swear this team was called Patrick, immersion has just been ruined)* travelling to Ross County&#x27;s ground. Ross County currently sit dead last on measly 13 points, in comparison to Partick&#x27;s impressive 40.

*The form, as well as H2H also favor the guests,* as Ross County are winless in over 5 league games and they&#x27;ve lost the last three H2H encounters, conceding 7 and scoring just 2 in the process. The home team boasts a terrible goal difference of -18, having scored at a rate of less than a goal per game (18 in 19), while conceding almost twice per game (36 in 19). On the other end, Partick aren&#x27;t showing many cracks in their game, maintaining a positive goal difference with 33 goals scored and 23 conceded.

So, why on earth am I then backing Ross County if all the signs point to a Partick Thistle masterclass? Firstly, the **line just seems like a trap,** as at the time of writing, Partick&#x27;s ML is sitting at +105 odds.  Surely the paper favorite in such a favorable matchup should have lower odds? Secondly, Ross County are **playing at home,** and I&#x27;ve observed that especially the UK teams tend to get a big morale boost on their own ground. I have already backed the team that was supposed to be the paper favorite in a similar kind of matchup before, **and they&#x27;ve almost always dropped points.** So, I&#x27;m not making the same mistake. Taking the Ross County 0.0 Asian Handicap at the beautiful +135 odds because I truly believe in a sneaky Ross County win, while a draw isn&#x27;t disastrous. This is essentially a DNB <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, but for whatever reason, my book offers slightly higher odds on the 0.0 Asian Handicap. Make sure to check if that&#x27;s the case in your book too. Going with just the one standard unit because, knowing my luck recently, Ross County are getting hammered 3-0 with all the goals coming after the 80th minute. BOL and let&#x27;s enjoy another mad clash together ☘️🫡

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Alexander Bublik vs Juncheng Shang | **Bublik ML at -163 (BET365). 1 unit.**

Write-up: Easy win for Monday, as he seemed to be a level above Gentzsch in that one. That brings me to 4-1, +2.54 units in 2026, and I&#x27;m looking to continue my strong form with this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>!

Alexander Bublik comes in to Hong Kong ready to make an impact after an up-and-down 2025 that saw him capture four ATP titles but also win three games in a BO5 match (to be fair, it was against Jannik Sinner). He already got off to a good start against Botic, winning in just under an hour with an 8.36 performance rating, while Shang took down Sonego (7.57) and Comesaña (7.37). The market has been trending towards Shang, as Bublik opened at -200 before dropping to this price, and I completely understand why. Shang is a talented but injury-prone lefty who finally seems to be healthy again, has the crowd behind him, and has a 2-1 H2H advantage in this matchup. However, there&#x27;s also a pretty simple case for Bublik: he&#x27;s the better overall player, and his serve does so much damage on these courts. Shang is certainly a crafty player who demands patience in rallies, but Bublik has started to show a willingness to not bail out early with a drop-shot or slap forehand. The two matches where Shang beat Bublik came in late 2024, a low point in Bublik&#x27;s career where he didn&#x27;t seem to enjoy being on court, and yet Bublik was still able to keep those matches quite competitive (with one going to five sets). This is a big step up in competition for Shang, and I see Bublik coming through here.</td></tr>

I’m a Blues fan. They are awful, especially defensively. The Mammoth might score 5 by themselves. Only the Anaheim Ducks have given up more goals this year. Hofer will be in goal, who has been better than Binnington, but the defense is so bad it’s hard to trust anyone in net.

On the other side, Vejmelka has started 4 games in a row, so it seems possible that they go to the backup Vanecek in this one. He’s only got 2 wins in net this year with a .879 save percentage and 2.92 GAA.

In that debut run, we drew barrier 1 (like we do here), but instead of using that to advantage, we stepped slowly and ended up 7/8 in the run. Despite this, we still won running away by over 2 lengths, running the fastest last 200m split of the race by a fair bit.     
    
Trainer has indicated that the desire is to lead this race, or at very worst be 2nd/3rd in run, which would be ideal as there’s nothing in this race that could match our last 400/200 split.

**Tennis - ATP Hong Kong - Rublev ML** \[2U to win 1.05U (-190)\]

Time: 1:40 AM EST

 

Reasoning:

2-0 H2H record, Rublev is a player with a big first serve and big forehand that&#x27;s been around the top 20 for a long time. He&#x27;s mentally weak in big moments - however he&#x27;s just starting his season off in a small ATP 250 so shouldn&#x27;t be any nerves, and beat Yibing Wu who&#x27;s in good form recently (beat Medvedev, Korda late last season) and beat marozsan in straight sets. He beat Yibing Wu 6-2 and 6-1 last couple sets after dropping the first which is a steamroll, and indicates he found his groove at the end of the match.

 

Borges is an all-around solid player, but his mobility is mid so he is prone to being hit through. His power is decent but not great - good fundamentals but no big weapons. He&#x27;s playing decently right now having beat Cilic (big server, old, no mobility) and Dzumhur (short clay specialist, good mobility 0 power). I think Rublev&#x27;s power will be too much for him here, as has been historically with their record. Don&#x27;t see borges winning this unless Rublev completely doesn&#x27;t show up or gets injured. I would give Rublev an \~80% chance of winning this, so this line is good value. I actually got it at -220 when it first came out so getting worse odds than what you guys can get.</td></tr>

Indiana defense is legit, they average about 11 PPG on the defensive end, which is top 3 nationally - they get turnovers, they get after QB&#x27;s, they are, in my opinion, the most complete defensive team in college football this year - On the offensive side of things, Mendoza is a dog - over 3,000 yards passing, over 35+ touchdowns, and their offense averages 41.6 PPG - Even though Oregon also has a great defense, I believe Indiana is more efficient and takes care of the ball here - Not to mention, Oregon&#x27;s RB room is running low, especially after the injury to Davison last game - Indiana has a slight edge in this rematch, they are one of, if not the hottest team in college football - Give me the Hoosiers -3.5

Al Nassr failed us once again. Might be better to fade the ones making us lose. Lesson learned (or not?)

**Write Up:**

3U bets are not looking good but I am a lot of things and stubborn is one of it. Let’s try again.

This one might be a bit riskier but maybe that is the key to breaking this terrible streak.

Getafe are a menace at home. In 8 games they’ve scored 7 goals and conceded 6. Low scoring affairs are their thing and Real Sociedad with a 1-4-4 away record scoring only 9 in 9 away games are bound to walk into another disappointment.

Over in England we have an FA cup game between Wrexham and Nottingham Forest. Wrexham have scored in all their home games this season and Nottingham have conceded 17 in 11 games this season away from home.

All I am asking for is 1 goal and Getafe to do their thing. Is that too much? It probably is.

__Event:__ NCAAF: Indiana vs Oregon 7:30pm EST

__POTD:__ Indiana -3 (-125), 3.75u to win 3u (*bought .5 pt*)

__Write Up:__ This Semifinals matchup is a rematch from earlier this season, where Indiana won 30-20 in Oregon as an underdog. Indiana coach Curt Cignetti came into Indiana &amp; completely changed the program. In the 3 years before Cignetti’s arrival Indiana had a 9-27 record. Since his hiring he has led Indiana to its only two 10 win seasons in school history, with a 25-2 record in 2 seasons, &amp; they are currently undefeated playing for the national title. Cignetti was a former Nick Saban assistant so it makes sense how he has the blueprint for success. Interestingly, all 4 head coaches left in the playoffs were at one point on Saban&#x27;s staff. That includes Oregon coach Dan Lanning who also has only lost 2 games in the past 2 seasons &amp; is coming off a 23-0 win over #4 Texas Tech. Despite a 23-0 win, Oregon didn’t look great as they had a net success rate just above 5%. Lanning attempted 8 4th down conversions, converting just 4 &amp; went 4 for 19 on 3rd downs. TT’s offense also isn’t as strong as its 39.4 ppg suggests, ranking just 41st in offense FEI. Now Oregon looks to get revenge after their previous loss vs Indiana, which was a slugfest. 

Indiana’s defense stole the show in the 1st game, holding Oregon to just 13 offensive points. Oregon’s offense had just a 39.7% success rate. Oregon QB Dante Moore was sacked 6 times, the 3rd most sacks taken by an Oregon QB since 2014. He was pressured a massive 20 times. Indiana’s 50% pressure rate was the highest rate Oregon had allowed since 2020. But Moore is getting the ball out much faster in the 2nd half of the season. He went from averaging 2.8 seconds throw time down to around 2.3. But that hasn’t helped much as he has thrown 3 INTs in the playoffs, including a 0-1 TD-INT ratio vs TT. He’s had at least 1 TO worthy play in 5 of his last 6 games. Indiana ranks #1 in the nation in TO margin (+18). Moore has also struggled in the red zone, owning negative EPA when passing inside the 20. Oregon ranks just 47th in TD rate in the red zone. Indiana ranks No. 1 in TD rate allowed (26%). Oregon’s biggest success in the red zone has come from RB Jordon Davison, who is tied for 13th in rushing TDs nationally. Davison averaged 7.4 ypc vs Indiana in Week 7. But he has been ruled out with a broken clavicle. Oregon also just lost RB Jayden Limar to the portal. This is a major concern for Oregon’s offense since they run the 3rd most 2RB packages in the country. OC Will Stein runs a Sean McVay inspired offense utilizing 2RB’s/2TE’s. When these teams first met 52% of Oregon’s plays were in those formations, but that rate has jumped to 65% recently. Indiana allows just 3.4 yards per run (18th) vs 2RB/2TE formations. 48% of the Oregon’s carries go to the outside, they avg 6.6 yards/run. Indiana allows just 2.6 yards/carry (3rd nationally) against outside zone concepts, with the highest stuff rate and the most TFLs. Another issue with Davison being out is he ranks #2 among Big Ten RBs by PFF on pass blocking snaps, which will be tough to replace. It’s unlikely they pressure Moore 20 times again, but Indiana does currently rank 13th in pressure rate generated. However this is a new-look defensive front for Indiana since Week 7. Indiana will be without edge rusher Stephen Daley, who was injured in the Big Ten title. Because of this they primarily went with a 3 DL look vs Bama. Oregon has averaged 5.8 ypc vs 3 DL (7th) but that number is skewed by weak defenses in James Madison, USC, &amp; Minnesota. Texas Tech has a much more similar DL to Indiana &amp; used 3 DL sets 17 times. They held Oregon to just 2.4 ypc &amp; a negative EPA/play. In their last matchup Indiana went to 3 DL sets just 6 times, holding Oregon to -2.0 ypc. Indiana’s defense will look much different this time around, but their offense will as well.

Indiana’s offense has been elite this season. Heisman QB Fernando Mendoza has led their offense to rank #1 in EPA/Play. They’ve lost just 8 turnovers (3rd), they rank 1st in 3rd down conversion rate (56.5%), &amp; they’ve scored on 91.2% of their red zone possessions (17th). Ranking 8th in net drive starting field possession, every drive starts off on the right foot. Mendoza has been the most consistent QB in football. He has not been sacked nor turned the ball over on first down through 14 games. Mendoza ranks top 5 in throws of 20+ yards &amp; leads the nation with a 13% explosion rate. Against passes of 20+ air yards, Oregon ranks 86th in EPA/play allowed &amp; 95th in completion percentage (39.3%), without a single INT of 20+ yards. Mendoza’s depth of target has increased over the last several weeks with the emergence of Charlie Becker. Before Week 11, Becker had 8 career targets. Since then Becker is the #2 PFF graded WR with 21 catches for 399 yards, &amp; 2 TDs. He has destroyed man coverage. Oregon runs man coverage at the 12th highest rate in the NCAA. Becker ranks 3rd in yards per route run (4.7) vs man. He has a contested catch rate of 83% (12th in NCAA). Since Becker’s breakout Indiana ranks 6th in yards per pass (11.2) &amp; 10th in success rate (52.6%) vs man, including 2 great defenses in Bama &amp; Ohio St who ran man on 59% of plays. Since the first matchup between these teams, Indiana has dropped back against man the 13th most times in the nation &amp; has allowed just a 31.7% pressure rate. Indiana relies heavily on quick dropbacks &amp; Mendoza’s ability to get the ball out quickly helps avoid pressure. Indiana uses quick dropbacks 47% of plays (20th most). When forced into traditional dropbacks Mendoza has been even more elite, averaging 12.1 yards per pass (2nd). Another factor will be Mendoza vs blitzes. Oregon ranks 31st in total blitzes &amp; has blitzed 27 times this playoffs. Last game vs Bama, Mendoza went 9/10 for 167 yards, 3 TDs, 0 INTs, &amp; 27 rushing yards vs the blitz. The pass success &amp; recent emergence of Becker has made the offense more vertical, which has opened up the run. Indiana ran on 71% of snaps vs Alabama. Oregon who has stopped opposing RB’s for zero/negative yards just 15% of plays (88th). This happened in the first game as 8 of Indiana’s 11 carries gained 3+ yards. Indiana has also been incredibly disciplined this year. They committed just 50 penalties this year (8th), with 11 on defense (1st). They’ve only lost 380 yards to penalties. They’re the only team left in the playoffs with a positive Total EPA via penalties (9.21). Oregon has 71 penalties giving up 703 yards. They rank last in Total EPA via penalties at -30.19 of the remaining teams.

Indiana is going to play steady efficient ball. But the difference will be in the redzone, where Indiana has shined &amp; Oregon has struggled.

GETAFE VS REAL SOCIEDAD

Date: 09 JANUARY 2026 at 21:00

BET ON: Over / Under- Over +1.50

Odd: 1.68



\- In their pre-match press conferences, both coaches revealed tactical insights that suggest an open game with goals likely on the horizon. Pellegrino Matarazzo, Real Sociedad&#x27;s new head coach, emphasized the need for aggressive ball recovery and a high pressing game, noting that his team has struggled with creativity in the final third this season. Following a positive performance in his debut against Atlético Madrid, Matarazzo&#x27;s setup with a 4-4-2 formation and vertical attacking play has shown signs of rejuvenating the team&#x27;s offense, particularly through Oyarzabal and Méndez linking up with Kubo and Guedes. The coach acknowledged that Sociedad&#x27;s games tend to open up after halftime, making it more likely to see goals in the latter stages. On the other hand, José Bordalás of Getafe is facing a defensive crisis, with key absentees like Djené, Duarte, and Abqar, leaving the team with no natural center-backs for the match. Bordalás, known for his disciplined defensive approach, has expressed concern over the lack of defensive solidity, admitting that his team might struggle to maintain their usual compact shape. With Getafe likely to sit deeper and look for counterattacks, Bordalás&#x27;s side will have limited ability to resist Sociedad&#x27;s intense attacking play. Given the injury-hit Getafe squad and Matarazzo&#x27;s pressing game, goals seem inevitable, especially as Getafe&#x27;s defense is weakened, and Sociedad will look to exploit the spaces left open. All signs point to a match that will likely see over 1.5 goals, with both teams adapting to their respective tactical needs but struggling to prevent goals.</td></tr>

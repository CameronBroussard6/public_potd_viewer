<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: UEFA, Arsenal -1.5 v Slavia Prague -130

3.9 Units to win 3 

Arsenal 3-0-0
Slavia Prague 0-2-1

Arsenal 4th in the UEFA Champions League
SLP 28th

Arsenal Goal differential +8
SLP goal differential -3

Arsenal has not allowed a goal in their last 7 matches. (Champions and premier league) 1 in November and 6 in October. 

SLP was blanked in their last 2 matches. 

Arsenal has won 2-0 or better in 3 of last 5 and 2 of last 3. 

I expect this one to be a good old fashion dog walking. Arsenal is the superior team. They should win handily. 

Don’t stress at a 1-0 or 0-0 HT score, they can score fast and often. 

3-0 Arsenal</td></tr>

PSG vs Bayern Munich

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> : Bayern to Win or Draw @1.64 for 5u

Bayern are in the best form of any team in Europe right now while PSG have big injury problems and a weak recent record against them. Bayern have won all 15 matches to start this season, which is the first time any team in Europe&#x27;s top five leagues has ever done this, and they have scored 54 goals while only letting in 8, showing they are unstoppable right now. Harry Kane has been incredible with 22 goals in just 15 games this season including 5 goals in 3 Champions League matches, making him one of the most dangerous strikers in the world. 

Bayern lost the last meeting with PSG at the Club World Cup in July, Bayern were the better team in the first half and conceded both goals only in the second half after Jamal Musiala suffered a very bad injury just before halftime, which completely destroyed the team’s morale and rhythm. Bayern have beaten PSG in the last 4 UCL games and PSG has failed to score in any of those fixtures, showing they know how to beat the French champions. PSG are missing important players for this match, with Desiré Doué ruled out for weeks with a thigh injury and Ousmane Dembélé not expected to start the game even though he just returned to training, which weakens their attack badly. Bayern is coming in this match after beating Bayer Leverkusen 3-0 while resting most of their best players, proving how strong their squad is.

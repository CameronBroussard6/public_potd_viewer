Last Pick: Patrick Zahraj ML vs Thai-Son Kwiatkowski (-125, 1 unit): Win

Tennis | Charlottesville Challenger | 1:40 PM EST (estimated)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Rafael Jódar vs Murphy Cassone | **Jódar to win 2-0 at +125. 1 unit.** 

Write-up: The first set was pretty up-and-down, as Zahraj had to fend off a set point on his serve, but he ended up closing it out and then winning the second in fairly straightforward fashion.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>, I&#x27;m going with Rafael Jodar to take down Murphy Cassone in straight sets. Jodar is probably the strongest college tennis player right now, and has already improved his ranking to the point where making Australian Open qualifying is all but guaranteed, leading many to suspect that he may not return to Virginia in the spring. Even with AO qualies locked in, Jodar still has plenty of reason to improve his ranking right now and try to sneak into some ATP events next year. 

This summer, Rafa has already captured two Challenger titles (including one indoors) and made an additional two semifinals. He should be intimately familiar with the setting, as this tournament is actually hosted at Virginia&#x27;s tennis facility, and I have no doubts that he&#x27;ll attract the bulk of the crowd support. I feel that his game suits indoor conditions very well, as he plays with quite an aggressive style and loves to dominate with the forehand.

Meanwhile, Murphy Cassone, another former college standout, isn&#x27;t coming into this tournament with nearly as much confidence. He had a decent start to the year, but his form has dipped dramatically, with his most recent match being a concerning straight-sets loss to Mats Rosenkranz in Sioux Falls (5.43 performance rating). I honestly don&#x27;t view Cassone as having a very high ceiling game - he doesn&#x27;t do anything particularly poorly, but also doesn&#x27;t really have weapons at this level. He&#x27;s comfortable enough indoors, but his recent performances simply have not been confidence-inspiring. Jodar was recently priced around the same odds against Patrick Kypson in Sioux Falls, but there&#x27;s a pretty big gap in form between Kypson and Cassone right now, making me feel that these odds are a bit mispriced. Sure, Rafa lost that match (6.17 performance rating), but that shouldn&#x27;t be such a big factor in how the market is pricing this match. 

For all of those reasons, I like Jodar to take care of this one in straight sets at plus money.

Historically BTTS is my favorite bet for less than excellent futbol. Empoli is 14th in Serie B and Sampdoria is 19th so less than excellent is accurate. 

Empoli BTTS has happened in their last 6. 

Sampdoria BTTS has happened in their last 3. 

Both teams average over a goal a game. 

Empoli has allowed 16 goals in 9 matches 

Sampdoria has allowed 14 goals in 9 matches. 

Empoli is 6th in shots on target. Sampdoria is 11th. 

Sampdoria is the worst in serie B for allowing goals on shots (goal every 9 shots)

Empoli is the 3rd worst in serie B for allowing goals on shots. (goal every 10 shots)

PROFIT/LOSS = +15.64

PREVIOUS BET = Porto Win and BTTS/No 

RESULT = Another L, the only positive I can see from this is that it wasn&#x27;t a sweat that made us lose at the end. Morierense had an XG of 0.28, 1 shot on target and they scored in the 18th minute. Porto won but man that was tough. A losing streak has started, let&#x27;s try kill it off fast. 

TODAYS BET 

EVENT/S = Real Sociedad VS Negreira AND Sevilla VS Toledo

PARLAY BET =  (Real Sociedad VS Negreira Total Goals Under 8) AND (Sevilla Handicap -2) @2.01

UNITS = 3U to Profit 3.03U

SUMMARY = These games took a lot of time to research and decide on my parlay. Copa Del Rey round one&#x27;s always have some mismatches. Let&#x27;s talk about Sociedad first. I took Under 8 goals Total for the value of it. Sociedad are having a bad season and currently sit 17th in La Liga. They are having an alright season when it comes to home games winning 2 and drawing 1 but when it comes to away form they aren&#x27;t doing well at all. They have lost 3 and drawn 2. Playing away against Negreira I do expect them to win but I don&#x27;t think their form has shown any reason to think by more than 7. Personally i think it&#x27;ll be 4-0. Playing on a worse pitch than they are used to, without their home support and while being in bad form it will be tough for them. 

Now onto Sevilla. Sevilla to win by 3 or more goals against a team from the 5th division of Spanish football is more than possible with the form Sevilla are in. Having a pretty decent season so far with the highlight by far being 4-1 against Barcelona. They are averaging 1.7 goals per game in La Liga. You might think Sevilla away would be similar to Sociedad having struggles and when it comes to the pitch this would be correct but when it comes to the league. If the league was just based on away games, Sevilla would sit in 4th. That&#x27;s a big difference from 11th so their away form is great, winning 3 out of 5 games. I think Sevilla will easily clear this line.</td></tr>

Last Pick: Crystal Palace U2.5 cards vs Arsenal ✅

Event: Serie A ⚽️

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Lecce +3 corner handicap vs Napoli 4U @ 1.83 (Bet365)

Write-up: To the Arsenal 1-0 and a really good win for them in the title race especially with Liverpool and City losing to retain that top spot 4 points clear. It’s early days but could this finally be their year? It’s not the prettiest football but is undeniably effective and limiting a giants slayer like Palace to just 1 SOT is impressive and has been the tale of their season. Time will tell. Anyways on the cards front not only did Crystal Palace not get carded but there were simply no bookings all match. Mr. Bramall once again proving to be extremely lenient on them as one or two challenges could’ve definitely be sanctioned but I’m definitely not complaining.

Napoli are sitting at the top of the league but it’s pretty close with just 3 points separating them from fourth to Inter Milan. They secured a big win against the Nerazzurri, needing to bounce back from their hefty 6-2 defeat against PSV mid-week. Lecce meanwhile sit just above the relegation zone in 16th counting just one win all season. Their goal this season will be to survive the drop once again having avoided relegation by the skin of their teeth last season. On the corners front, Lecce has averaged 5.3 corners and conceded 5 at home whilst Napoli has averaged 4 corners and conceded 4.6 on the road. In terms of playing styles that may alter the numbers, Lecce have been playing with width since appointing Di Francesco with crossing being a key part of their playing style - leading to more corners. Meanwhile Napoli like to control possession and attack through the middle which leads to less corners, especially with KDB’s absence which will lead to a big loss in creativity. Nevertheless I apply some pressure on Lecce’s numbers as Napoli are simply the better team. Using all factors I get a mean of 5 corners for Lecce and 4.5 for Napoli.

That gives this play an estimated 83% of winning which is exceptional value as I literally predict Lecce to have more corners (though the margins are tight). In fact, last season in this exact fixture the Giallorossi had 5 corners to Napoli’s 2 to crush the line. BOL !

Last pick: Cobolli vs Machac: Cobolli ML

Easy win for Cobolli in straight sets. Smokes him in the first setand broke him at 4-4 to win the set. Nothing much to say here. 

I was deciding between 2 plays from the Italian league or a tennis <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> again. 

Todaya <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:

ATP Paris: Ben Shelton vs Cobolli: Cobolli ML@1.85 ( i got it at 2.1 but the line is dropping fast)

I’m going back to Cobolli here after he cashed for us in straights. These Paris courts are playing way slower than anyone expected,  the ball grips, rallies extend, and flat hitters are really struggling to hit through the court. That hurts a guy like Shelton way more than Cobolli.

Shelton still hasn’t looked right since the shoulder injury at the US Open. His serve doesn’t have the same pop and he’s been off-rhythm in rallies. he scraped by Majchrzak, then got handled easily by Munar and didnt look like he is at 100%. On a fast indoor court maybe the market makes sense, but here? Totally different story.

Cobolli’s game just fits better right now: great defense, makes a ton of balls, and forces opponents to overhit. He just beat Machac again playing confident, clean tennis and even pushed Sinner hard for a set. Momentum’s on his side.

Given the surface, the matchup, and Shelton’s form, I honestly think this should be closer in favor of Cobolli. The market opened with 2.2 for Cobolli and it keeps dropping. With long rallies expected and Shelton still rusty, Cobolli has a real shot to grind this out.

Event : Germany DFB Pokal 🇩🇪

Energie Cottbus vs RB Leipzig

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> : Leipzig -1.5 @1.65 for 4u

Leipzig is a Bundesliga team and they are playing against a third-division club and should win by a huge margin. Leipzig are third in the Bundesliga and have been in amazing form with seven straight matches without a loss since losing to Bayern on the opening day, and they just destroyed Augsburg 6-0 last Saturday showing how dangerous their attack is. They have an incredible record in the German Cup against lower-league teams, winning their last 15 cup matches against teams from lower divisions, which means they always take these games seriously and win by big scores. Energie Cottbus are only a 3. Liga team who are the leaders of the third division but the quality gap between them and a Champions League team like Leipzig is absolutely massive. Cottbus have not made it past the second round of the cup in their last 11 tries, showing they always struggle when facing better teams.

__Event:__ NCAAF: UTEP @ Kennesaw St 8pm EST

__POTD:__ Kennesaw St -9.5 (-120 FD), 3.6u to win 3u

__Write Up:__ Starting off by saying I went back &amp; watched every game for both teams. I will be at this game as Kennesaw St is my Alma Mater &amp; I live closeby, although I’ve been a lifelong Georgia Tech fan. This is the last week we get Tuesday &amp; Wednesday football action so I figured I’d fire up a writeup. Tuesday we have UTEP (2-5, 1-2 CUSA) traveling to Kennesaw St (5-2, 3-0 CUSA). __KSU is coming off a 45-26 road win over FIU, extending their 5 game win streak.__ They are 1st in the CUSA right now &amp; are coming in hot. Let’s take a look at their last 5 games including each teams Sagarin rating (my most trusted analytical CFB &amp; CBB rankings I’ve used for years). Starting with the most recent game: 

Kennesaw St’s Sagarin Rating #107:

W21 @ FIU - #149

W28 vs LA Tech - #103

W8 vs MTSU - #171

W7 vs Ark St - #108

W14 vs Merrimack - #225

KSU had dominant 20+ point wins in their last 2 games. LA Tech is a good team who is Sag ranked 45 spots better than UTEP at #103. FIU is ranked #149 which is right next to UTEP who is ranked #148. __Let’s take a look at UTEP who has lost 4 of their last 5 games:__

UTEP Sagarin Rating #148:

W18 @ Sam Houston - #207

L11 vs Liberty - #120

L19 vs LA Tech - #103

L6 LA Monroe - #160 

L17 Texas - #9

UTEP’s only win came against an 0-7 Sam Houston. __But the biggest takeaway is UTEP lost by 19 to LA Tech. Kennesaw State beat that same LA Tech team by 28 the very next week. Sagarin’s analytical predictions has KSU winning this one 33-16.__ Having said all that, rankings aren’t everything. I just wanted to give background on these 2 virtually unknown teams.

Kennesaw St’s offense is coming into this game hot as the Owls averaged 5.2 yards per carry &amp; a whopping 16.7 yards per pass. They had a balanced attack producing 214 rushing yards &amp; 284 passing yards. Their offense is led by Wofford transfer Amari Odom. __Odom is a dual threat QB who ranks Top 10 in the NCAA in Completion percentage (70.8%).__ Odom has 5 pass TD’s &amp; 3 rush TD’s on just 1 INT this year. 

*More writeup incoming*

__Kennesaw State -9.5__

Last Five Predictions (Old - New): ✅❌✅✅❌

Net Units: +19.88

Yesterday&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Moreirense v Porto. Porto (-1.0 &amp;-1.5) Asian Handicap. 3u @ $1.54 ❌ /✅ 

Lost half the initial stake as the first bet (-1) pushed, and the other (-1.5) lost. Unsure exactly how to write that on the ledger, but counting it as a loss because I walked away with less money than I put in. 

Porto dominated possession but didn&#x27;t create that many chances from it. Moreirense scored within 20 minutes, which wasn&#x27;t ideal. Porto equalised just before halftime. 

In the second half, Porto dominated again, but didn&#x27;t get the winner until the 88th minute. From there, it was unlikely they&#x27;d push the issue for a third. 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Thun v Winterthur. Thun (-1.0 &amp;-1.5) Asian Handicap. 3u @ $1.87

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Going with the Asian Hanidap again on Thun. 

Newly promoted, but currently in first place, Thun hosts last-place Winterthur in the Swiss Super League. 

The Swiss Super League has started tight, with every team losing at least two of their opening ten games. Thun&#x27;s two losses so far have been to Young Boys and Basel, who are two of the best teams in the league. 

Thun&#x27;s two goals a game is the second-best in the league, and their 1.3 goals against are the third-best in the league. 

While I don&#x27;t expect them to win the league in their first season back in the top flight, they&#x27;ve looked good so far. 

Meanwhile, Winterthur are 0-1-4 in their five away games in the league, copping seventeen goals in those games. In fact, in Winterthur&#x27;s ten league games, they&#x27;ve conceded 30 goals, which is the worst in the league by 11 goals.

I like Thun at home in this match. </td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Jamal Murray Over 8.5 Assists.

I gotta say this is a very odd line to me maybe its a trap maybe not because this is such a off line to me. 

Murray is averaging around 20-25 Potential assists a game with Jokic gone now and New Orleans are the worst in the league, yes bottom 30th in the League at defending opposing PGs for assists. They are ranked 16th in guarding opposing PGs for points. I also like the fact the totals are set at 235.5 meaning a very fast game. Also they are bottom 5 in defensive rating meaning a lot of easy buckets should be given up. Keep in mind Herb Jones isnt playing so could mean Murray may score however I expect this to be a close game due to the nuggets not having anyone to deal with Zion.</td></tr>

BTTS has hit in this exact matchup in 8/L10 matchups; and BTTS in the same 8/L10 games. Stuttgart has scored at least once 7/L8 last games while playing away. Just need one team to score twice and we should be golden.  Bundesliga is often known for its hyper attack, geigenpresses, and overall quick paced offensive games. Hope this is one of those.

**Write Up:** <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> we&#x27;ve got the first leg of the two leg EFL cup semi final as Newcastle host Man City.

Coming fresh off a 10 goal thrashing in the FA cup, I expect City to ride the momentum and go after this game as well. 

Haaland needs no introduction. We&#x27;ve ran with similar plays with the big Norwegian with great success and we&#x27;re backing him here again <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Haaland only got the first half of their FA Cup match a few days ago, so I&#x27;m expecting him to be rested and start <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. I also see City changing back to thr &quot;feed Haaland&quot; tactic they started the season with, with all of their creative players and the new arrival of Semenyo. He is coming fresh off an 8 shot, 4 SOT, 1 goal match in the EPL against Brighton. With 26 goals in all comps this season, I&#x27;m backing Haaland to add to his tally with an extra SOT and cash for us.

**Event:** NCAAB - Baylor @ Oklahoma St.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Oklahoma St. +2.5

**Write Up:** Playing at Gallagher-Iba Arena is historically one of the toughest road trips in the Big 12, and this season is no different; the Cowboys currently boast an impressive **11-0 home record**. While Baylor features a high-octane offense averaging over 88 points per game, it has struggled significantly in true road environments and enters this matchup on a **three-game losing streak** (losses to TCU, Iowa State, and Houston). Oklahoma State’s offense is equally potent, ranking 17th nationally in scoring ($90.2$ PPG), which should allow them to match Baylor’s pace in what oddsmakers expect to be a high-scoring affair.

The &quot;plus-points&quot; position is particularly attractive here because the Cowboys are the more disciplined team at the free-throw line—shooting over **75%** as a unit—which is critical for covering small spreads in the closing minutes of conference games. Baylor’s recent defensive lapses, where they allowed Houston to shoot nearly 40% while struggling to secure defensive boards.

Bayeux vs Marseille looks ideal for goals, with Over 3.5 goals @ 2.00 offering solid value.

**Match**: Borussia Dortmund vs. Werder Bremen &amp; Deportivo La Coruna vs Atletico Madrid

**League**: German Bundesliga &amp; Spanish Copa Del Rey

**Last Pick Summary**: Well, shit. That was a fuckin’ sweat and really had no need to be. I am not sure I have ever seen a more idiotic defensive play in my life than the one we saw by Szoboszlai. Barnsley had a couple early chances, but that was a very undeserved goal. Liverpool had their fair share of chances but really didn’t take advantage of all the opportunities. We caught a lifeline in the 90’+4’ with Liverpool 4th goal that helped us cover and end on the right side of this one. I’ll be staying away from this Liverpool side for a bit. That being said, hit my prediction with 4+ for Liverpool and 1 or less for Barnsley.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s Write Up:** <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> we are rocking a classic European 2-legger so that we can get 2x as sweaty while two matches rage on simultaneously. First leg at 1:30 PM CT is Dortmund ML over Werder Bremen. Dortmund at home and Dortmund away are quite different squads. This season, Dortmund has 5 wins and 2 draws in 7 matches at home, with 4  wins, 4 draws, and 1 loss away. They are a top tier Bundesliga team, but their home win rate has far surpassed their away win rate. On the other side of the pitch, Bremen has been awful away, coming up with only 1 win, 3 draws, and 4 losses on the road. This season on the road, they lost 4-0 to Bayern, 2-0 to RB Leipzig, and 4-1 to Eintracht Frankfurt; which are their most similar road matches against the top ⅓ of the table. I’ll be riding Dortmund ML on a matchup like this 10 times out of 10. Give me Dortmund to score 2-4 goals and Bremen to score 1 or fewer.

Our second leg is Atletico Madrid ML vs Deportivo La Coruna in the Spanish Copa Del Rey. There isn’t a ton to say here other than we have a top 4 La Liga squad in Atletico against a La Liga 2 team. Atletico just lost 2-1 to a really good Real Madrid squad(who just kept it very close with Barcelona in the Spanish Super Cup Final 3-2), and are looking to [rebound.](http://rebound.as) As an interesting point of reference, Atletico Madrid just drew away at Real Sociedad 1-1. Deportivo la Coruna recently played at home against Real Sociedad 2 (the B squad) and lost 3-0. I could probably go on for awhile about reasons why Atletico should win this easily, but I’ll leave it at that. I love Atletico to have a clean sheet here, but if they have a mental lapse, I’ll take them to win by at least 1. Expecting 1-3 goals for Atletico and zero (maybeee 1 for DLC).</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>** : Dallas Stars vs Anahein Ducks at 10:00pm EST (NHL/Hockey)

Dallas Stars ML (-110)

I&#x27;m going with Dallas on this one. I think betting sites have it wrong by putting them at -110. While I do see that the Stars are struggling just like the Ducks, the stats say a completely different story. Stars are 3-7 in their last 10 games with 37 goals scored and 35 goals allowed while the Ducks are 1-8-1 with 26 goals scored and **48 goals allowed**!! For me this is just a Dallas Stars team in a slump (who are still 2nd in the whole league btw) while the Ducks are showing their true colors by being a top 5 team for the draft.

You could tell me the argument that the Stars will be tired from their back-to-back games wellllll the exact same scenario happened the last time they played this season (December 19) with Dallas playing the day before while the Ducks came in fresh. The result? The Ducks got destroyed 8-3. 


Dallas will also have Jamie Benn back in the lineup while I saw at Ducks practice that one of their top forward, Leo Carlsson, left early and did not return so there&#x27;s a chance he doesn&#x27;t play or plays injured (which might be the case already). Troy Terry will also not play for the Ducks so they might play without their 1st and 2nd best forwards.

Unless the Stars have major injuries tonight against the Kings I see this as a back and forth game that the Stars will ultimately win because of their experience and better goaltending(I know DeSmith has been leaky lately but both Ducks goalies have been way worse).

Stake: 2 units

Write Up:

Last pick cashed early, so I’m going right back to it.

I’m backing Brandt 1+ shot on target again. At this price, I just can’t ignore it. Dortmund are heavily favored at home, and Brandt’s role in this team right now is perfect for this kind of prop.

The head-to-head is what really sells it for me. In the last six games against Werder Bremen, Brandt has had at least one shot on target in every single one. That’s too strong of a trend to just overlook.

Add to that his current form — 1+ SOT in his last four games and 4 goals scored — and it’s clear he’s confident, involved, and constantly getting into good positions around the box.

At +112, I’m happy to keep riding this until the wheel falls off.

Edit: Betcity (🇳🇱)has it at +112 and Bet365 at -200. I see I am already getting downvoted for not noticing this. Proof is in the comments.

**Event:** Copa del Rey, Deportivo La Coruna v Atletico Madrid, 3:00 pm EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Deportivo La Coruna Win or Draw, +162, 1 unit

**Write Up:** European domestic club competitions are back and they haven&#x27;t disappointed, already giving us some crazy underdog stories, most notably the 6th tier Macclesfield knocking out the holders Crystal Palace, and Paris FC stunning their Parisian rivals. I think this trend is going to continue in the Spanish cup and I feel like Atletico are going to be the (un)fortunate victims of an upset. Their **form has been patchy** and their playstyle often hot and cold, with their **clunky slow build ups** that have become predictable. Their key players are either **out of form, like Griezmann and Alvarez,** or **injured, like Barrios and Lenglet.**

Meanwhile, their opponents, Deportivo are close to the top of the second Spanish division, fighting for an automatic promotion spot, *although their form has also been anything but stellar* as of late. Still, they&#x27;re not a pushover in the slightest and I back them to at least reach extra time against a what should be a tired and **heavily rotated Atletico Madrid** side that had travelled all the way to Saudi Arabia to face Real Madrid in an intense match just a few days ago (which they lost, so **their morale is at a season low).** They&#x27;re definitely not going to be at their best and I seriously believe they&#x27;re in for a rude awakening when they clash with Deportivo. Taking the morale, energy, injuries, poor individual and collective form, and rotation into consideration, I think these odds that cover two outcomes are absolutely golden. If you want to sprinkle a cheeky BTTS Yes here, I certainly don&#x27;t mind that either, but the odds are already more than tasty enough imho. Going in with just the standard unit once again, as the bankroll has expectedly been spread rather thin. BOL and let&#x27;s watch some weird cup madness ☘️🫡

**Game: Newcastle VS Man City - 3:00 PM EST**

**Really loving the odds on this, especially considering Newcastle’s recent home form and Manchester City’s drop in form, coupled with their defensive injuries.**

\---

St. James’ Park in a cup match is not an easy place to go, regardless of who is fit. It’s a ground where even in-form players can disappear in key moments. Newcastle come into this game on a three-game home winning streak, and I can tell you right now that place will be bumping tomorrow.

Before Manchester City’s emphatic win against League One side Exeter, they drew three straight matches against Premier League opposition - Sunderland (0-0, A), Chelsea (1-1, H), and Brighton (2-2 ,H). City have started to adapt to being more open and allowing teams more time on the ball, but the issue is that opponents still find themselves in behind and in one-on-one situations with City defenders far too often. You can tell the back line is nervous about conceding late — and ironically, they still ended up conceding late goals against both Chelsea (90&#x27; + 4) and Brighton (60&#x27;).

A significant development here is that City lost both of their starting centre-backs to injury just over a week ago (Dias and Gvardiol). Alleyne has looked solid, but St. James’ Park is no joke — especially when you’ve only played one Premier League match so far with your new back line.

I see the Exeter game painting over some defensive cracks that will resurface against athe riled up  Magpies, not saying City will lose but considering this is leg 1 of a 2-game tie, I see Newcastle throwing the kitchen sink at it

**Last:** (CBB) Illinois -1 (1.5u) - ✅

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** (CBB) No. 12 Michigan State (-6.5) vs. Indiana

**Start Time:** 7:00 PM ET (Peacock)

**Odds:** \-106 (FanDuel)

**Units:** 1.5U

**Reasoning:** Death. Taxes. Sparty respecting our coin.

For those of you who’ve been along for the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> ride since last February, it’s a phrase you’ve heard me repeat quite a bit. For good reason too, as Michigan State has had a knack for delivering the goods whenever we’ve backed them. And although some of the familiar faces from last year’s squad no longer remain, this year’s Spartans (14-2) are more than capable of taking up the baton.

It all starts with a defensive unit that, believe it or not, is even better than the year before.

Through 16 games, Michigan State ranks 5th in opponent field-goal percentage (38.4%), 11th in scoring defense (64.5 PPGA), 14th in defensive efficiency (0.923) and 45th in opponent three-point shooting (30.3%). Those numbers have looked even better as of late, as the unit has conceded just 58.3 points per game on 34.1% shooting—27.5% from beyond the arc—over its last three contests. Sure, Indiana presents a tough out offensively, ranking 26th in offensive efficiency (1.185), 41st in field-goal percentage (48.3%), 42nd in scoring (84.5 PPG) and 57th in three-point shooting (36.3%). However, the Spartans defense has proven it can match wits with the best of them.

Don’t take my word for it, just take a look at how the unit has fared in its seven matchups (5-2) against offenses ranked in the Top 70 in offensive efficiency:

* **Arkansas (15th):** 66 points, 39% shooting (25% from three)
* **Duke (18th):** 66 points, 38% shooting (31% from three)
* **Iowa (20th):** 52 points, 38% shooting (30% from three)
* **Kentucky (38th):** 66 points, 35% shooting (23% from three)
* **Nebraska (53rd):** 58 points, 34% shooting (36% from three)
* **North Carolina (54th):** 58 points, 38% shooting (17% from three)
* **Northwestern (66th):** 66 points, 38% shooting (23% from three)

Conversely, here’s how the Hoosiers (12-4) have fared against opponents who rank in the Top 60 in defensive efficiency:

* **Nebraska (20th):** 77 points, 46% shooting (37% from three)
* **Louisville (22nd):** 78 points, 41% shooting (32% from three)
* **Kentucky (43rd):** 60 points, 34% shooting (17% from three)
* **Minnesota (54th):** 64 points, 40% shooting (30% from three)

Not only did Indiana lose all four of those games by six points or more, those numbers in Saturday’s matchup with Nebraska are a little misleading. While the team did shoot lights out during the first half, the Hoosiers only managed to shoot a meager 36.7% from the field during the second half while coughing up a 16-point lead in the process. Not surprisingly, the team is still seeking its first Quadrant 1 victory after falling short in each of its first three opportunities.

Look for Michigan State’s interior presence to loom large on Tuesday night.

Per KenPom, the team ranks 22nd in average height and 20th in effective height. Not surprisingly, the Spartans have made their impact felt down low, ranking 24th in second-chance points (14.6 per game) and 32nd in blocks (4.8). That advantage shows up on the glass as well, as the team ranks 5th in total rebounding (42.7), 8th in defensive rebounding (27.6) and 12th in offensive rebounding (12.3) while also ranking 4th in opponent total rebounding (29.1), 6th in opponent offensive rebounding (6.6) and 17th in opponent defensive rebounding (19.3). That should present more than a handful of problems for an Indiana team that ranks just 105th in total rebounding (36.8), 122nd in opponent offensive rebounding (8.6) and 167th in opponent second-chance points (11.1).

However, if there was one Achilles heel for Michigan State, it’s turnovers.

On the season, the team has struggled mightily to keep control of the ball, ranking 214th in turnovers (12.4 per game), 235th in turnovers per possession (17.8%) and 279th in opponent steals (7.6). That imperfection was really put on display during the Spartans’ disaster of a first half last time out against Northwestern, where the team turned it over eight times. Fortunately, the Hoosiers defense doesn’t appear to be equipped with much bite in that area, ranking just 229th in turnovers forced (11.4), 236th in opponent turnovers per possession (16.0%) and 298th in steals (5.6). Those numbers have been even worse over the team’s last three outings, dropping to 7.7, 11.3% and 2.7 respectively.

Look for Michigan State to put together two full halves of clean, dominant basketball in front of the home fans on its way to a comfortable victory.

HAMBURGER VS BAYER LEVERKUSEN

Date: 13 JANUARY 2026 at 20:30

BET ON: Over / Under- Over +2.50

Odd: 1.65



\- HSV have conceded heavily all season and continue to show defensive vulnerability — their last five matches all saw more than 1.5 goals and goals at both ends, reflecting a systemic issue in transition and structure that coach Merlin Polzin hasn’t fully fixed yet. Even with absences (Glatzel, Poulsen, Elfadli suspended), Polzin’s 3-4-3/3-4-2-1 setup invites open play with wing-backs pushing high and frequent transitions, often leaving space at the back that opponents can exploit.

\- Leverkusen, under Kasper Hjulmand, openly acknowledge a need for improvement after their recent 1-4 home defeat against Stuttgart and are motivated to score more — Hjulmand stressed before the game that the team must perform “much better than Saturday” and that he expects a tough, open match against a speedy Hamburg side. With Patrik Schick hopeful of returning from injury to boost the attack, Leverkusen’s offensive firepower increases, but they historically concede in phases when trying to maintain high possession and press aggressively.

\- Combining these factors — HSV’s ongoing defensive lapses and direct style, Leverkusen’s need to respond offensively after recent setbacks, and both coaches’ public confirmation that the match will be competitive and demanding — strongly indicates a game with multiple scoring chances and goals on both sides. Recent statistical trends in German Bundesliga data also show both teams contributing to higher-scoring matches, making Over 2.50 goals a convincing market choice.</td></tr>

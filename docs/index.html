Last Pick: Desmond Bane (Magic) O18.5 Pts@ 1.84. 3U. ***TBD***

Game at HT, will update record post-game.

 

Next <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **Toronto Raptors +2.5 vs Philadelphia 76ers @ 1.91**. 4U play.

I’m higher on the Raptors than most people and will be happy to bet on them against the 6ers who will be missing Embiid and PG13, as well as Oubre and Bona. For Philly, once again it will be the Maxey show with VJ as an inconsistent secondary. This Raptors team has its best team available, and they continue to play well together, with all starters contributing each game. They are 7-2 ATS ad 8-1 SU in the L9 games. The 6ers have lost 4 ATS in a row. Add in that the Raptors have much better depth and rotations, and I’ll happily bet on the underdog.

Event: NBA | Hornets @ Pacers


<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:  Miles Bridges Over 21.5 @1.79 3u to win 2.3u


Write Up:  
 


Bridges has pretty much been the Hornets’ go-to guy whenever they need someone to actually get a bucket. With all the injuries and the up-and-down play from the rest of the roster, he usually ends up with a solid chunk of the offense, and that usage jumps even more when Tre Mann or Brandon Miller aren’t fully out there. He’s the one they trust late in the shot clock or when they need someone to create something on their own.


The matchup helps a ton too. Indiana’s defense just isn’t the same without Hali and the other guys they’re missing. They don’t really have that big, physical wing who can stay in front of Bridges, so forwards like him usually get good looks specially in the mid-range .


And the nice part is Bridges isn’t one-dimensional. He gets points in transition, he can pull up in the mid-range, and he’ll hit spot-ups or pops from 3s. Because he scores in so many different ways, he doesn’t need a perfect shooting night to get past 21.5.


In games like this, he usually ends up taking around 15–20 FGs, and if that happens again, he’s basically sitting right in the 22+ range without needing anything crazy. It’s just a good spot for him.

__Write Up:__ First basketball writeup of the year for one of the biggest games of the early season. This game is taking place in Chicago, Illinois at the United Center, home of the Chicago Bulls &amp; Blackhawks. This is technically a “neutral site” game but it takes place just 2 hours north of the University of Illinois, the arena will be packed with Illinois fans. #8 Illinois is coming into the game undefeated at 4-0, with a huge 81-77 win vs #11 Texas Tech (rank last week) who have an elite team that KenPom has ranked #15 in the nation. They’ll be facing #11 Alabama who are 2-1, with one of the toughest schedules in the nation.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>PICK</mark>: SYDNEY THUNDER W TO WIN @ 1.76 (3U)

WRITE UP:

Annoying one last time out with Romania winning 7-1 but Austria being held to a 1–1 draw in a game they dominated. Can’t win them all.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Todays pick</mark> is the definitely rogue to what people expect on this thread lol. Women’s cricket isn’t exactly top of the agenda for most people including me. 

First and foremost from the outside looking in this seems a weird <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> as Sydney thunder a 0-3 facing the Scorchers who are 2-2. However, The thunder are punching way below their weight and should find their form and get rolling at home - a ground which favours the bowling attack, of which they have the better! 

Back them to get the job done and wake up to some great profit. Really confident with this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> and backing with 3 Units.

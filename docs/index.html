<body><h1>r/sportsbook – POTD (Tomorrow)</h1><h2>Pick of the Day - 11/26/25 (Wednesday)</h2><p><small style='color:var(--muted)'>Updated <strong>5:40 PM</strong> CST • Target date: 2025-11-26</small></p><table><thead><tr><th>Post</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class='post'>After a long time away, I&#x27;ve decided to return, having had a good few weeks personally I feel it&#x27;s worth while to get back to what I done well for so long

Picks will always be at around 1.80 better, yes I could play it &quot;safer&quot; but for me it pays off in the long term to take the risk to win more units.


Overall record 73W-44L

Units +63.7

Last pick:

Hannover vs Schalke 04

Both teams to score and over 2.5 goals 

(1.85) 3 units ✖️

This feels like a long time ago now. But I can actually remember it very well now that I&#x27;m writing about it again.

A very cruel loss here , the away side and under dogs Schalke raced to a 2-0 lead in the first 14 minutes.

They then sat back and defended for most of the game and despite scoring 3 times , all 3 goals for Hannover got overturned by Var, so many chances and goals ruled out I&#x27;m still pissed about this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> 2 months later 😂



<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>:
 
Uefa Champions League:

PSG Vs Tottenham 

**PSG win and over 2.5 goals 

(1.80) 2 units **

Defending champions PSG host a Tottenham side who started the season well but the wheels have started to come off badly for them.

The sides met at the start of the season for Super Cup, which ended 2-2 , the PSG squad had just played the club world cup 3 weeks before this and the players had just come back from their summer break, with no training or match fitness they still almost won this.

PSG come into this game with 3 wins from 4 champions League games, **scoring 14 goals conceding 5**, they are outrageously stacked in attack so even with injuries to Dembele and Doue, Kvaratskhelia should start coming back from an injury, and Barcola and Ramos look good as has midfielder Joao Neves who&#x27;s scored 6 goals in his last 5 matches in all competitions.

For Tottenham they started the season well, but have just **1 win in their last 5 matches** , it&#x27;s not just the fact they&#x27;ve not been winning it&#x27;s how they&#x27;ve been getting dominated alot of matches, Dominated against Arsenal in a 4-1 loss, dominated at home to Chelsea where they lost 1-0 but Chelsea managed 3.67 XG. Away matches against Leeds who managed 16 shots and 1.6xg, Everton managed 1.78 xg against them Leeds and Everton both teams without a good striker between them.

Leeds and Everton didn&#x27;t punish Tottenham despite playing well and creating a ton of chances they both lack great attacking players,but a team as good as PSG really should score at the very least 2 goals here.

Tottenham will get chances though, and do usually find a way to score.
Since Hakimi&#x27;s injury at right back , midfielder Zaire-Emery has been filling in and although he&#x27;s an incredible midfield he&#x27;s out of position here only 19 years old, they have conceded a lot more shots in the 2 games he&#x27;s played out of position whether that&#x27;s a coincidence or not.

As long as PSG can break Tottenham down reasonably early I can&#x27;t see why they don&#x27;t win this and the match has at least 3 goals here.









BOL and only bet what you can afford to lose!</td></tr>

Prev <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Caniato ML -154👎 -1.54u
First loss in like 5 plays, feels weird. That just means we start a new streak <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.

Sport: Tennis Tournament: Maia Challenger Time: 6:00am est

*<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Daniel Merida Aguilar ML -120 1u*
(Playable up to -150) {{I played this 4 hours ago sorry the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> thread only gets posted late}}

Reasoning: *backing the 21 year old Spaniard with the higher floor and higher ceiling vs Cadenasso. Cadenasso transitioning from a final on clay in Montemar three days ago to now *indoor* clay in Maiai might find him taking a while to adjust. Whereas Merida’s hard court experience (much better than Cad on HC’s) will transition a lot better to the slightly faster conditions of the indoor clay. Merida has 1 win in the last 1.75 months including 3 first round exits. Financially and ranking wise he *cannot* afford another first round exit here and he’s perfectly primed for the win here.*

My lord that&#x27;s about as sweaty as it gets. I had all but given up when Curry went scoreless in 3Q, and looked lethargic in the 4th with only 14 points. He dials it up to bring his total to 24, but still seems too little too late with only a couple minutes left until Phoenix is forced to foul him to stop the clock once, and then again on the last play. And hilariously on the final play the refs wouldn&#x27;t even call the intentional foul so Curry lays it up to cash us out in the 48th minute, finishing with exactly 28 points. 

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s Event:** NBA 🏀 Chicago Bulls @ Atlanta Hawks (12:30pm PST)

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Bulls +4.5 (-108 on DK); 3 units

This is more of a fade on the Hawks than a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> for the Bulls, but both perspectives are favorable. 

The Hawks, for whatever reason, are not playing well at home, and are one of the few teams that have a worse record at home (5-7) than on the road (10-7).

In terms of the spread, the Hawks are 4-8 ATS at home, 5-9 ATS as the favorite, and a whopping **0-5 ATS as the home favorite**.

The Bulls offer the reverse, though a little less extreme. As underdogs, the Bulls are one of the best teams ATS this season with a 10-3 record. Likewise, they are 5-2 ATS as road underdogs.  

In terms of matchup, Bulls won their only prior matchup against ATL by 5, despite being 2.5-point underdogs. Trae Young was playing in that game as he is expected to play in this one. 

The return of Trae actually creates a further advantage, as it disrupts whatever rhythm the Hawks have built for the majority of this season with NAW starting and JJ being the primary facilitator. 

Meanwhile, the Bulls have been playing well again lately, just recently beating the Cavs in back-to-back games, despite being the underdog in both of those as well. 

I&#x27;ll acknowledge that CHI is not a great team, but the conditions are pretty favorable to side with them in this underdog position against a bad ATL home team that has not covered the spread once this season as home favorites.</td></tr>

Sunday’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> - Geno Smith u 19.5 completions -128 (1.28u to win 1u)

Is there a worse mismatch here in the entire league between the Raiders offense and the Texans defense? In Geno’s last 2 games, he went up against some pretty good defenses (Chargers and Broncos) and was under this line in both of those games. I think Houston’s defense is even better than those.

The Houston defense has been making it very difficult for starting QBs. Brissett did pretty well last week against them, but outside of that, not many QBs have done well. (Mahomes 14-33, Danny Dimes 14-27, Josh Allen 24-34 but was sacked 8 times). 

Good luck!</td></tr>

The Raptors have superior offensive and defensive ratings compared to the Nets this season, giving them a clear edge in efficiency on both ends of the floor.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s play:

NFL - New England @ Baltimore

TreVeyon Henderson 40+ Rush Yds/10+ Rec Yds (+107) 1u

We reach the end of week one with a bit of a tribute play, and a background story as to who I am.

Long story short: I was my grandfathers caregiver for 7 1/2 years when my nan died, one of the things we shared and did together often was gamble. Every Sunday he would give me a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> to play, and we would keep track of how he was doing. “$5, that’s it” - this has become my way of staying connected with him - all this to say, if the streak ends <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, it’s his fault 😂.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> we <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> his favourite player during this past season: Patriots rookie TreVeyon Henderson very quickly rose to fame in our household - for whatever reason early in his career, as he was the clear RB2 to Rhamondre Stevenson, my grandfather truly liked this kid: “He’s got something to him, he’s gonna be special” - every week I more or less waited for whatever he saw in him to flourish but it never did, until it did - more on this after, I’m sure at this point you want numbers:

Originally I had the all purpose yard play in the back pocket for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, but upon doing some line juggling I found + money on a play that should hit but maybe with a touch of sweat - something he would enjoy.

Henderson has hit 40 rushing yards in 7 consecutive games since becoming New Englands RB1ish, seeing double digit rush attempts over all 7 of those games.

The real gamble is on the receiving end: Henderson has hit 10 receiving yards in 4 straight games, showing he is a growing &amp; important part of the New Englands passing attack garnering 23 targets in the last 6 weeks - THIS ALL SAID, he’s still not a clear dual threat yet. A lot of his receptions come in the second phase, and usually isn’t the intention of the play call.

Part of this gamble is I anticipate New England to trail in this game in portions, if Baltimore find a way to get ahead, this may bring a few more check down passes his way than usual. This is a gut play on my end which is why I’m comfortable + money.

To finish the story: the week my grandfather fell ill was the week Hendo broke out: week 10, 150 all purpose yards, 2 TDs, following week, 3TD’s, 93 yards, all of a sudden as my grandfather was dying, his boy was starting to show up.

One of our last conversations went in order: CM Punk won the title, Jays are probably gonna keep Bieber, and Hendo scored 3.

“Three?!” He lit up and smiled, then he laid back down. He died 5 days later.

Fun fact: 2x Super Bowl Champion Tyrone Williams is my cousin!

Event: Switzerland NLB ⛸️🏒

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: EHC Olten vs GCK Lions O5.5 goals 1 unit to win 1.2U @2.20 (Bet365)

Write-up: Loss again olé olé I mean just look at that form. It’s just pretty shit isn’t it, all analysis goes to the toilet despite the research put in. I don’t necessarily find the picks bad and that’s why I provide all the numbers involved in my write-ups which I hope you guys appreciate but in hindsight they are and it’s annoying. Never seen a team dominate possession and do nothing with the ball as Lokomotiva who other than one big chance they should’ve scored looked completely bereft of ideas. They deservedly lost 2-0, nothing more to say.

Swiss second division of ice hockey is where I’ve landed, get me out of here. Regardless at plus odds this baffles me. Thirty games into the season and Olten are 5th whilst the Lions are 7th (out of 11). They both should make the play-offs to attempt qualification to the top division as the lions are 10 points clear of 9th spot. At home, Olten’s matches have cleared the line in their last 11/12 in the league (92%). Meanwhile, the Lions have gone over in their last 8/9 away (89%). Should be a no-brainer that there are goals aplenty (at least 6) but you never know, don’t shoot the messenger. This very fixture two months ago saw 7 goals whilst their reverse encounter last month also had 7 goals scored. Maybe I’m out of my depth and we’ll see a borefest I don’t know but either way BOL !

<tr><td class='post'>**Record:** 6-2

**Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Brian Thomas Jr. longest reception o20.5 yards ✅️

**Game:** NFL - Jaguars @ Broncos, 3pm CDT

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Jakobi Meyers o56.5 receiving yards (-114 on FD)

**Rationale:**

In the six games that Jakobi Meyers has played with the Jaguars since he was traded from the Raiders, he has averaged 6.3 targets, 4.5 receptions, 59.2 yards, and .5 TDs per game. If you remove the first game he played in (after only having two days of practice), those numbers jump to 7 targets, 4.8 catches, 62.8 yards, and .6 TDs. Simply put, Jakobi was the missing link to Liam Coen&#x27;s offense and has immediately cemented himself as the WR1 on the team.

Meyers also kills the Broncos. In his four career games against Denver, Jakobi has performed very well each time, averaging 9.75 targets, 7 receptions, 83.75 yards, and .75 TDs per game. Several of those games also saw Pat Surtain II covering him, making those lines even more impressive.

Given BTJ&#x27;s new role as the primary field stretching receiver, I expect Surtain to be shadowing him, which should make Jakobi&#x27;s day a bit easier. Even if that is not the case, Jakobi has always played well against Surtain in the past.

I expect this to be a game where both defenses stymie the run, leading to more pass attempts from Trevor. I think Jakobi hits 60+ here.</td></tr>

AJ Brown gets it done with 8 catches and 80+ yards in the first half. On a mini roll with ✅✅✅ in a row.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** NFL Bengals at Dolphins (1pm EST) **De’Von Achane 120+ yards Rush and Receiving (+100)** 2U

Writeup: Gonna keep this short since Packers/Bears game about to start. Cincy heads to Miami who just benched Tua for Rookie QB Quin Evans (231^(st) <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> in last year’s draft) who gets his first start. Bengals give up the most rushing yards to RB’s (129/game) and the third most receiving yards to RB’s (45/game) for a total of **174 yards/game**. 

Achane is 4^(th) in total scrimmage yards at **117/game**. He’s facing a defense that cant tackle, cant get penetration and allows large chunk plays on screens and broken plays. The reason I’m going for Rushing and Receiving rather than just rushing is Evans. First start for a rookie usually means a lot of checkdowns and designed short passes and screens – letting Achane be Achane and Bengals D be Bengals D. Should be a fast paced game with Miami forced to keep up with Chase and Burrow. **De’Von Achane Rushing + Receiving over 120 yards**. BOL to everyone tailing!</td></tr>

Darts, World Championship

Event: Joe Cullen vs Mensur Suljovic

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Joe Cullen ML @ 1.62

Joe Cullen came into this tournament knowing he’s been a bit out of form. He was heavily underestimated in his first round against the young talent Brooks. He proved to the crowd what he was capable of and crushed Brooks 3-0 with a 99.33 average. This performance probably also came through due to his experience on the biggest stage in the world.

On the other hand, we have Mensur Suljovic, who also played a good first round and cruised past a weaker opponent with a 3-1 win. Both players are experienced but Cullen is simply the better player and is capable of holding a higher level of darts for a longer period of time.

To me, it still feels like Cullen is a little underestimated due to his bad form this year. I feel like he’s still winning this game and his odds of 1.62 don&#x27;t represent how he actually can be. Expecting a 3-1 win for Cullen here.

Cullen ML @ 1.62 it is.

Just my luck atp, oh well if we had to lose, at least it was in a spectacular fashion. Onto some greener pastures now, though. I&#x27;ve been eyeing this fixture for the past few days (managed to get it at even odds, but I see that it&#x27;s currently on -105), let&#x27;s finally get to it!*

**Event:** LaLiga, Villarreal v FC Barcelona, 10:15 EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Villarreal Win or Draw -105, 2 units

**Write Up:** Villarreal and Barcelona are two of the most in-form teams in LaLiga, having **won 6 and 7 games on the bounce respectively,** meaning the match is going to be competitive. **Barcelona have been iffy in big challenges this season,** for example, their loss to PSG, Real Madrid, a spanking at the hands of Chelsea etc. all point towards a bigger issue, and <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>&#x27;s fixture definitely classifies as a big game. **Villarreal are extremely tough to crack at home**, the iconic Estadio de La Ceramica, and they&#x27;ll be looking to extend their incredible run of form in LaLiga, thus putting them in pole position to secure a top 4 finish come the end of the season. They **concede at a rate of less than a goal per game**, which is significantly better than that of their opponents. This means they should be able to **absorb any sort of pressure** Barcelona would try to put on them, while exploiting their **ridiculously high line** that nearly shipped 4 goals to Club Brugge in the CL. The **recent H2H is also promising** \- just one singular loss to Blaugrana since 2024. To make matters worse, **Barcelona have a long injury list**, and now we can add **Pedri** to it. *Villarreal also have a couple of absences,* but I think Barcelona is definitely worse off in this case, as they&#x27;ll be missing a couple of absolute star players, not to mention a lot of their players are **just coming back from various injuries**. With the injuries, form, H2H, and venue taken into consideration, I feel very confident in backing Villarreal. They can surely secure at least a draw, but I predict a narrow win for the yellow submarine. BOL and let’s end this unlucky madness once and for all ☘️</td></tr>

Recap: Leeds v Crystal Palace BTTS (YES) – Wow, we knew Elland Road was difficult but slapping around a team 4-1 who are 5-2-1 away form, that is crazy, didn’t see that coming I’ll be honest. Not pretty but nonetheless we take the cash in the 90+2 on a penalty. Shall we try make the next one sweat free?


<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:Aston Villa over 1.5 TEAM goals v Manchester United

Odds: 1.80x / -125 (Bet365)

Units: 2.5 units (Remember always follow our units) 
 

After a sweaty bet, lets just walk this one over shall we? Let me explain why this is a walkover. If there is one thing I love, it is Afcon. Players leaving, and targeting sides with important Afcon players.
 

First of all, let’s just get it straight. Manchester United are shit defensively. That’s the first argument, terrible side that will concede goals to anybody even Burnley or Wolves.  Manchester United are 3-3-2 away this season, conceding and scoring 14 goals in 8 games. Recent results include conceding to the worst offensive side in prem history Wolves once, and a very poor West Ham. They recently just played 4-4 against Bournemouth at home, another side who have been poor recently.
 

Let’s get into the juicy AFCON bit and lineups because that is the kicker. Man United are predicted to start Luke shaw, Martinez and Yoro. That is a terrible back line and there is two ways this game goes, either 4-4 again or Aston Villa absolutely terrorize them in my opinion. Mbeumo, Mazraoui and Amad Diallo are out for AFCON and Maguire, De Ligt and Casemiro are out with suspensions and injuries. While Aston Villa have an injury and that is Torres who is their starting CB, which isn’t really relevant to the bet. One AFCON player in Guessand which is honestly a benefit as he’s much worse than Ollie Watkins who should see 90 minutes here. 
 

Lets get even juicier, Aston Villa last 5 have gone over 1.5 team goals in 4/5 and one of them being against Arsenal where they won 2-1 against probably the best defensive side in the world. Now they facing a shit Man united side with AFCON, injuries and suspensions in their back line. Please do hand me this free money. Aston Villa right now have won 9 games in a row in all competition, facing sides where the games have been goals galore. 
 

You’re probably thinking, why not just take the ML and it’s a good <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> in itself but you just never know what United you will face, it could end 4-4 or it could be 4-0. Don’t take a risk you don’t have to take if you can find a loophole and this is what we did. Here is the loop hole, I highly doubt this game will end 1-0 to Villa and that’s where the edge of over 1.5 goals comes into play. 

Having also watched a lot of both of these teams this year I expect to see a high intensity end to end game with plenty of shots, both teams love to shoot and shots means goals. United are desperate right now having only taken 5/9 points from 3 bottom six sides and a win away at Villa would massive for them, hence I think they will go for it, leaving gaps at the back for the villains to exploit!
 

Let’s take advantage of this United defence and see Aston villa demolish this shit United side.

**Write Up:** Well, the first EPL match of the season Enzo doesn&#x27;t start. Genuinely confused. Glad a few of you got this voided, unfortunately I did not and am counting it as a loss. Always the risk with player props, sorry friends. 

Lets right the ship <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> with the only EPL match on the slate as we see 3rd place Aston Villa host 8th place Manchester United. Staying away from props as my main <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, with our streak of bad luck. Aston Villa are arguably the best home side in the league this season outside of Arsenal, touting an EPL record of 6-1-1 (9-1-1 in all comps) at home this season, and have won their last 6 in a row (including Arsenal and Man City) after a bumpy start. Putting this another way, they have won every home game in all comps since August. Villa Park has been a fortress and I don&#x27;t think Man U can crack it. 

Man United have been a pretty good away team this season with a record of 3-3-2. They also have tons of talent. But that talent just hasn&#x27;t seemed to click and they&#x27;ve been very inconsistent. They&#x27;ve also just lost two of their best attacking players, including their leading goal scorer, in Mbuemo and Amad to AFCON, which won&#x27;t help their disjointedness or scoring hopes. 

Overall, Villa is the better team and is playing at home. I like them to take this one, BOL.</td></tr>

**Time: 11:30 AM EST**

**-----------------**

Lovely day of football <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, and it seems like we’re a bit shorter on picks, but there are still some great options.

United are a very on-and-off team, but one thing I’ve really noticed over their last few performances is how much individual brilliance somehow leads to so many shots on goal. Cunha is our man for this. Coupled with the team’s inability to defend, you end up with a chaotic shootout at both ends of the pitch.

If you’ve watched either of these teams this season, you’ll know how much of the football resembles ping-pong, with chances flying at both ends incredibly quickly.

United are coming into this game after a 4–4 draw that featured 18 total shots on target.

In Aston Villa’s last six Premier League games, there have been 7, 15, 17, 10, 8, and 11 shots on target, respectively.

BTTS looks right here, but I’m staying away as I’m expecting some big saves tomorrow.

__POTD Record:__ 67-32-1 (+77.23u) - 15-4 in last 19

__Event:__ NFL: Jaguars @ Broncos 4:05pm EST

__POTD:__ Courtland Sutton o58.5 receiving yards (-115), 3.45u to win 3u

__Write Up:__ For my 100th write up, Saquon went off cashing us our 15th win in 19 picks. For write up #101, we’re taking it back to the beginnings. Those who have been here from day one will remember backing Courtland Sutton for our 16th win in a row back on our 17 win streak last year (see comment below post). Starting off the next century of picks, we’re going back to the well in another great matchup. The Jacksonville Jaguars (10-4) are traveling to Denver to take on the Broncos (12-2) at Mile High Stadium, with big implications for both division leaders on the line. The Jags have ridden an offense that’s been on fire to the top of the AFC South. They can clinch a playoff berth this weekend with a win &amp; a Colts/Texans loss. Sitting at 10 wins, the Jags are looking for their first 11+ win season since 2007 (shoutout to my former fantasy MVP Maurice Jones-Drew). They are on a 5 game win streak, averaging 34.2 points per game. But their 4 most recent wins were against the Titans (2-12), Jets (3-11), Cardinals (3-11), &amp; a Colts team after they lost their starting QB. They’ll face a real challenge this week vs the hottest team in the NFL. The Broncos not only are 1st in the AFC West, they are at the top of the entire AFC. Denver is coming into this one on a heater riding an 11 game win streak with an undefeated record at home, having not lost at Mile High since Week 6 of 2024. The Broncos have won 12 consecutive home games, their longest streak since the 2012-2013 season (13 games). Denver is the only team that has led in every game this season. With a win vs the Jags (&amp; a Chargers loss to the Cowboys), Denver can clinch the AFC West for the first time since 2015. If the Patriots lose to the Ravens Sunday night &amp; the Bills somehow lose to the Browns, Denver can clinch the AFC overall 1 seed. Coming off a big win over the Packers who had come into Denver as favorites despite having a worse record, the Broncos confidence is at an all time. That’s especially the case for QB Bo Nix who is playing like a mad man right now.

In Week 11 the Broncos lost starting RB JK Dobbins to a foot injury. Since then, __Head Coach &amp; Play-caller Sean Payton has shifted his offense pass heavy throwing the ball +8.6% over expectations in their last 4 games (2nd most in the league). Broncos QB Bo Nix has thrown for at least 295 yards in 3 of the 4 games with just 1 INT. That should continue this week vs a Jags defense that has faced opposing offenses that have thrown the ball 4.9% over expectations, 2nd most in NFL. This is due to the Jags having the heaviest pass funnel defense in the league. With the best run defense in the league, allowing just 86.3 yards per carry (only team below 90), opposing offenses are forced to pass on their defense, giving up 222.2 passing yards per game (20th). They’ve given up even more on the road allowing 248.3 passing yards, 5th highest in NFL.__ Now they’ll face Bo Nix who is coming off an incredible game last week vs the Packers, completing 23/34 passes (67.6%) for 302 yards for a season high 8.9 yards per pass &amp; 4 TD’s. Bo became the 1st &amp; only QB this season to throw 4 TD’s against zone coverage in a game. Now he faces a Jags defense that runs zone at the 4th highest rate in the league. Who was his favorite target last week? Courtland Sutton. __Sutton is coming off a 7 catch 113 yards, 1 TD game last week &amp; has been on fire lately. He has 49.5% of the Broncos air yards over the past 2 weeks &amp; 29.4% of the targets. In Weeks 6-13 he had a 15.6% Target Share, 17.8% 1st Read Target, 0.18 Targets Per Route, &amp; a 1.59 Yards Per Route. In the last 2 weeks he has a 27.8% Target Share, 37.5% 1st Read Target, 0.31 TPRR, &amp; a 2.69 - YPRR. He has now put up 59+ yards in 4 straight games, having 10+ targets in his last two. Sutton plays out wide at WR &amp; now faces a Jags defense that has allowed the 3rd most yards per game to outside WR’s this season.__ With his recent 37.5% 1st Read Rate in the Broncos last 2 games it’s been clear their strategy has been to get Sutton the ball. That was confirmed recently when Head Coach Sean Payton said in an interview “When we need a play in a critical situation, find 14. Because even when he’s covered, he’s not. He’s our best player &amp; we gotta keep feeding him the ball.” __Since 2024, Sutton is the best WR in the NFL on 3rd down: 1st in receiving yards (819, 1st in 1st downs (48), 1st in 20+ yard receptions (16), 2nd in catches (54). That’ll help this week vs a Jags defense that is poor on 3rd downs, allowing a conversion on 41.9% of plays (26th), 44.44% on road (27th). Sutton also is a speed demon &amp; a master at bringing in tightly contested catches, so naturally Nix loves to lob him the deep ball. Sutton ranks 7th in the NFL in 20+ yd catches (15) &amp; 6th in 30+ yard catches (7). Last week Sutton hit 23.3 mph on a long catch, the fastest speed of any ball carrier all season.__ Nix slings it. He has the most 20+ yard TD throws in the NFL since 2024. Nix will continue to let it fly this week vs the Jaguars defense that is elite against medium passes, but weak against the deep ball.

The Jaguars and Broncos defenses are both top 6 in rushing DVOA, setting up a pass heavy game. Nix has averaged 38.5 pass attempts over the past month. Jags QB Trevor Lawrence passed 9% over expectation last week as with TD passes vs the Jets. Jags RB Travis Etienne has averaged just 3.0 yards per carry the last 3 weeks, which won’t bode well vs the dominant Broncos run defense. I’ll gladly side with the Broncos leading pass catcher in a shootout. 

Nix lets it fly to his favorite guy. Sutton eats.

<tr><td class='post'>💎<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: 🏈 Bucs ML
Odds: -146 on FanDuel
Wager: 3 Units

Record: 6-7
Net Units: -2.5 Units

Explanation: The Buccaneers should beat the Panthers tomorrow because even though both teams are 7–7, Tampa Bay has been the more efficient offense on a per-play basis, and that’s usually what decides close divisional games. 

Tampa Bay is producing 0.372 points per play (average performance 
, but clearly functional), while Carolina is down at 0.308 points per play (bottom tier), which is a meaningful gap in determining how often drives turn into points. 

While I do think Carolina’s defense has been more respectable than Tampa’s in raw scoring efficiency allowed (0.385 opponent points per play, middle of the league), I determine the Bucs still have a clear path to winning by controlling the game. Their run defense has been a strength (top-10 in opponent rush yards per game), which can force Carolina into longer 3rd downs and more dropbacks, and that’s where an already low-efficiency Panthers offense can stall out. On top of that, Tampa Bay is coming in relatively clean health wise. Friday’s report had no game designations.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: CAR/TB BTTS 15+ points, DET -2.5 v PIT, +103 on DK at time of writeup, betting 4.5u

We’re starting this one with my favorite matchup of the day: TB v CAR for leg 1 of the NFC south title. I like this one because it is a good spot for CAR, arguably the weirdest team in the league. They win games they are supposed to lose and lose games they are supposed to win. They are an underdog of 3 and playing at home. This is a good setup for them. I’ll start with TB. This has hit in 5 of L6 for them, missing when they put up 7 vs LAR. Mike Evans is back and healthy and playing well. Their offense is pretty much entirely healthy. After choking last week against ATL, TB has a chance for a bounceback here, and they are on extra rest. CAR has the 6th worst EPA per pass allowed. With a healthy receiving corps and offensive line, I like Baker to do well here. He’s playing against his former team. Last year, TB won 26-23 and 48-14. This offense has been weak at times due to injury, but are still over 15 in all but 2 games. I don’t think they will have much trouble putting up at least 2 TDs and 1 FG in a tight game that they will really want to have since they have lost 5 of L6. CAR has an offense that is less consistent, but they are in a good spot. TB has the 3rd worst redzone defense in the league. When CAR gets there, they will likely be scoring TDs. TB is a defense that tries to take away the rushing game and force passing. This seems bad for CAR, although their offense is pretty balanced in terms of EPA (22nd in passing, 15th in rushing). This offense is pretty self-dependent: they’ve dropped 31 and 16 against good LAR and GB defenses, and 9 and 7 against below average SF and NO defenses. So, why back a team that appears inconsistent? It’s all about the spot. First, their past 8 games have been on a WL pattern. When they suck, they bounce back in the next game. They are playing at home, and they are fighting for their division lives. TB has allowed 24 and 29 points to NO and ATL in their past 2 games. CAR will come into this game and have to match TBs scoring output, which they are in a good spot to do. This is less of an advanced stats <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, but choosing something based on expected gameflow, game stakes, and recent form at good odds (-213). This feels like a 24-23 or a 21-17 or something of that like. I don’t know who will win, but I am very confident both teams will produce to their typical levels on offense.

For the 2nd leg, I like DET over PIT. We all know the trend: DET has won their last like 15 in a row coming off a loss. I’m not much of a believer in those types of things to predict what the next game will be, but I like DET in this game. They are fighting for their playoff lives, and every game is pretty much a must win for them. PIT is in a different spot. They are up 1 game on BAL, and they can lose the next 2 games, beat BAL in week 18, and win the division. PIT has CLE next week, a game that is much more winnable to add an extra game of cushion to their division lead. PIT will still try to win this one, it just won’t be with as much intensity as DET will be playing with. The way to beat DET is to outscore them, which LAR did last week. PIT is not a high scoring team. They are not a team that is built to put up a bunch of big plays against DET’s injured secondary. Their offense hasn’t actually been horrible this year, 13th in EPA and PPG. But they are very thin at WR, which is beneficial for DET’s defense, who is thin in the secondary. DET has the 7th best EPA per rush on defense. The DET defense does not need to shut down PIT entirely, they just need to hold them to a regular number. The PIT defense has been average this year, and are still missing TJ Watt. They are 25th in EPA per rush and 15th in EPA per pass on defense. DET has one of the best offenses in the league, 5th in EPA per pass and 10th in EPA per rush. Their offensive line is still banged up, but should be good to go. Critically, they are playing at home. DET is much better at home. Jared Goff is much more effective at home. DET will put up points, and I don’t think PIT will be able to keep up. DET should control this entire game. They have a lot more to play for. They always win following a loss, which I don’t really care about, but is still an applicable stat. PIT can lose this one and it won’t be that consequential for them. Give me the better team at home to win by 3 or more.

Taking both of these together at just barely + money is brilliant odds. I like this at 4.5u.

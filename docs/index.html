Payton Pritchard over 9.5 rebound/assists

\-135 BetMGM

The Heat are the worst team in the league with allowing point guard rebounds (7.43/game), and fourth worst with allowing point guard assists (9.48/game). Additionally, Pritchard has covered this line in 14/20 away games this season. What’s also great about Pritchard is that he hasn’t fouled out once this season, averaging 1.5 fouls per game.</td></tr>

**NBA: Orlando Magic vs. Memphis Grizzlies**  12:10 MST 

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Orlando Magic -4.5**

Write Up: Haven&#x27;t kept up with posting consistently this year but The Grizzlies have no one right now. And the Magic have Bane who is playing his former team for the first time since they traded him which always seems to light a fire. Also they are in Germany- the Wagner bros want to put on a show- even if Franz is on reduced minutes. I see a team hungry to win and show Germany what the NBA is about and a team riddled with injuries and just disjointed. Give me Magic to 8

ETA: Grizzlies are 3-19 straight up vs. teams over .500 and an NBA worst 8-16 against the spread as a dog. Also has a negative net rating over the past 10 games</td></tr>

Last Pick: FC Koln v Bayern Munich -1

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: Union Berlin double chance and over 0.5 goals between both teams in the second half v FC Augsburg 

Competition: Bundesliga

Sport: Football

Odds: 21/20. The same bet but over 0.5 goals in the first half is 13/10 which is solid value. 

Reasoning: Apologies for the late <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, I waited for line-up confirmation. Union Berlin double chance is supported by the standings and form shown: Union sit mid-table with a far better goal difference and recent form than FC Augsburg, who are bottom-three and conceding at over 2 goals per game. The over 0.5 goals in the second half aligns with Augsburg’s defensive trend and Union’s tendency to score or concede after the break, making at least one second-half goal the most common game state while Union still avoid defeat.

Write Up: LETS GO BABY! Back in the win column after UAB dismantled Tulane by 13. Hoping this is the start of another upward trend for my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>! I fully intend on hitting a STAGGERING 60% or higher through my first; 10, 20 and 30 plays which means I need to smack these next 2. BUCKLE UP, TIME TO NUT UP OR SHUT UP! 

Going back to the mantra, K.I.S.S.

Keep it simple stupid! 

Game starts in 1 hour so I’m going to keep it short and sweet…

Franz has a typical line of around 25 PPG leaving us with some INSANE value at 15+

This line is deflated due to this being his first game back since the ankle sprain! He’s easily cleared this in his last 13 of 15 games (87%) and I’ve NEVER seen his line this low. 

Honestly based on my projections he’s going to hover around 23.5+ <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> and has around an 88% probability to cover 15. 

This is a 5 ⭐️ rated bet for me and should be the one to get us back in the GREEN for POTDs.

Lindbom is in net for Vegas and has a horrible 1-3 record, 3.55 GAA and .848%

The main play here is Vegas was playing in Los Angeles last night at 1am, they wouldnt have arrived at Toronto until around 6:30-7am because of a snow storm that happened last night. These guys are gonna be exhausted mentally and vsing a Leafs team who have finally figured things out after removing Marc Savard and are 8-1-2 in their last 11 games and recently beating the Avs in OT who are the hands down best team in the league. This clash has been waiting to happen, with Mitch Marner being traded to Vegas, the Leafs will be trying their hearts out tonight trying to prove they dont need him. With how hot Vegas has been playing I wasnt comfortable taking the slight underdog but I am very comfortable taking Nylander 1+ point in which he has 46 points in 36 games and 10 points in his last 5 games. Nylander averages just around 2.02 shots per game and has the edge against Carl Lindbom because of his quick release and ability to shoot in stride. Nylander is very good at picking high corners, especially high glove, which is a known weak spot for Lindbom when he has to move laterally, so I expect him to know this and abuse it tonight with a few shots. 

Edit: didn’t notice was writing about travel to Toronto, game IS IN VEGAS, only 1.5hr flight. Regardless it’s a b2b with struggling goalie vs a rested team that’s playing well, Woll on 3+ days rest has a 2.14 GAA and .929%

Event: NBA | Magic vs. Grizzlies in Berlin (2 pm EST) | 🏀

*Recap: I am become death, destroyer of conference leaders. On Tuesday, I took first-place George Mason (16-1, 4-0) to handle an injury-riddled Loyola (5-12, 1-3) in the first half, and the Patriots needed every bit of 40 minutes just to cover the original line. On Wednesday, I took first-place East Tennessee State (12-5, 4-0) to clear 6.5 points against SoCon bottom-dweller Western Carolina (5-10, 1-3) and the Catamounts won outright! Two conference leaders. Two opponents with five wins each. Two terrible picks. Looking at the slate, Florida Atlantic, Liberty, UMass Lowell, and Gonzaga all lead their conferences and all play <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> against teams they should beat. ...are you thinking what I&#x27;m thinking?*

I&#x27;m posting with short notice before a 2 p.m. tip-off, but I wanted to get a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> on the board. After suffering my first back-to-back losses since beginning this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> experiment, I&#x27;m going back to well with the Orlando Magic. Betting with them (Anthony Black) and against them (opposing point guards when Jalen Suggs is out) has done well for me. I&#x27;m laying the points with Orlando for several reasons. First, Memphis&#x27; frontcourt is depleted. No Zack Edey. No Brandon Clarke. Plus, no Ja Morant. Memphis is thin in the paint. I think Paolo Banchero eats this game. I also like rebounds for Wendell Carter. Second, Orlando is getting Franz Wagner back. It&#x27;s not just a German homecoming for him, it&#x27;s a huge boost for a Magic team trying to stay ahead of a feisty Miami team in the Southeast Division. Wagner hasn&#x27;t played since Dec. 7. He might only get 15-20 minutes <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, but he&#x27;ll give them offense during that limited time. His points line is 15.5, after he&#x27;s been averaging 22.7 the rest of this season. Moritz Wagner rejoined the team on Jan. 11. contributing eight points in nine minutes of a win over the Pelicans. The offensive engine is finally back for Orlando, albeit in diminished capacity. Third, Memphis is 6-12 against the spread when they are an underdog of five points or more. As underdogs in general, they are 8-16 ATS. Memphis is 8-11 on the road. I know this is a road game for both teams, but the Grizzlies already don&#x27;t travel well and the Morant circus follows them. I also think there&#x27;s something to the Wagners and Tristan da Silva going &quot;home.&quot; The crowd will undoubtedly be pro-Orlando.

Good luck and Godspeed!

**Wager**: 2.5u to win 2.27u  (-110 on Bet365)

**Match**: Hofstra @ Stony Brook

**League**: NCAAB

**Last Pick Summary**: Not much to say on this one other than it didn’t go as planned. FC Barcelona cruised to their side of the bet with 5 team goals, while OL Lyonnes were only able to net one time on 79% possession, 8-9 shorts on target, and like 25 total shots. For a team that averages about 4.5 goals per game (OL Lyonnes) and a team that averages 2.7 goals conceded per game (Lens), a 1-0 outcome was far from expected. On to the next.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s Write Up:** I will preface my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> with this, I am not a basketball person. Because of that, this will be a smaller unit <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. We have a huge mid-major slate <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> in college basketball and these are actually some interesting competitive match ups. I looked through all the games and found the matchup I like best in Hofstra -7.5 over Stony Brook.

Hofstra has a 99 Ken Pom ranking and they have won away at bigger opponents such as Pitt and Syracuse. Within the CAA, they are 4-0, and are 13-4 on the season. Their strength of schedule ranking is 118 with a non-conference SOS ranking of 85. They have faced pretty stiff competition thus far, relative to Stony Brook.

On the other side of the court, Stony Brook has a Ken Pom ranking of 278. Their strength of schedule ranking is 289 with a non-conference SOS of 285. Basically, their is a significant difference in the quality of teams that Hofstra and Stony Brook have played so far this season.

Hofstra has a baller guard named Cruz Davis who basically plays all game, every game and is shooting nearly 50% from the field.

This seems like a pretty mismatched game that maybe has a dampened line because Hofstra is the away team.

No matter, I like Hofstra here to win by 12 points or more.</td></tr>

EVENT: Copa del Rey, Racing Santander v FC Barcelona 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Barcelona -1.5 Handicap, -182, 1UNIT

Write Up: First time posting my picks so im kinda nervous so here’s the full breakdown 

Barcelona go into this Copa del Rey tie against Racing de Santander in red hot form with a club record winning streak under Hansi Flick, having just extended it to 10 consecutive victories across competitions by beating Real Madrid 3-2 in the Spanish Super Cup, and they have looked both potent in attack and tight in defence in recent matches, scoring regularly while conceding very few goals in their last five games.  Historically, Barcelona have dominated this fixture as well: across previous meetings Barcelona have won the vast majority of their head to head games, 14 wins to Racing’s 1 with only a handful of draws, and often by multiple goals, showing a significant quality gap between the sides.  Statistically this season Barcelona’s performances have been far superior; they average close to 3.3 to 3.7 goals per game in recent form and score in nearly every match, while Racing’s numbers are lower both offensively and defensively, and although Racing score regularly themselves and have been competitive at home, they also concede at a higher rate and lack the sustained defensive solidity of their elite opponents.  Racing are no pushovers and have had some success in cup competition, but Barcelona’s consistent goal output, superior squad depth and tactical control, reflected in strong possession stats and shot volume in recent matches, make a multi goal victory plausible, which supports the likelihood of the Barcelona -1.5 handicap hitting if they impose their quality and maintain defensive discipline away from home.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: (NCAAB) Florida Atlantic -4.5 vs Wichita State (-110) (9:00 PM EST)**

Reasoning: FAU is 7–1 at home this season, 5–1 ATS at home with an 11–4 ATS record overall. They’re also 4–1 ATS when favored by 4.5+ points as well. Despite Wichita averaging more points per game than FAU they shoot worse from the field. Wichita State rely on offensive rebounding and their defense to win games. Wichita State enters this matchup at 10–7 and has struggled away from home, going just 2–4 on the road. With home court advantage, the offensive edge, strong ATS trends, and line movement favoring FAU, I’m laying 4.5 points on them tonight.

**Unit stake:** 3U

**Odds:** 2,0

**To win:** 3U

**Recap:**

Not as sweat-free as the day before but another win added. As expected PSV Eindhoven scored multiple goals but also gave up enough chances for FC Den Bosch to capitalize once. Not much else to say about it honestly. I would have liked an earlier FC Den Bosch goal but I take a W any way I can get them.

**Write Up:**

We’re going with a 3U bet on this one. I don’t like many games <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> so I do this mainly because I want to watch this game the most.

Racing Santander has a 73% BTTS statistic playing at home in the Segunda Division. They’ve scored 25 times in 11 games at home. Conceding 15 in 11 games.

Barcelona in La Liga have a 70% BTTS statistic playing away from home. Scoring 25 and getting 15 goals against them in 10 matches. Many goals are expected in their away games.

Barcelona are playing solid right now but never underestimate tired legs. They’ve just played, and won, the cup final vs Real Madrid only 4 days ago in Saudi Arabia. After which they had to return to Barcelona before making their way to Santander. Which is also another \~700km/430 miles.

Even players who didn’t play vs Real Madrid will feel the travel in their legs. Which will translate to more open spaces and hopefully an exciting game between a motivated Santander and possibly tired Barcelona.

The pure quality of Barcelona can’t be overstated so they will definitely find their chances and goals but with this bet a 2-2 is also covered. I still expect a 1-4/2-4 victory for Barcelona.

**ODDS**: 1.83 / +120

**1. Dubai&#x27;s Strong Home Dominance**

Dubai has turned Coca-Cola Arena into a fortress this 2025-2026 season, with an 8-2 home record in EuroLeague games. They average \~86 points at home, often winning by 7+ points in key victories (e.g., 92-81 vs. Fenerbahce on Jan. 8, 2026). Stars like McKinley Wright (12.8 pts, 6.7 ast) and Filip Petrusev (13.7 pts) drive an explosive offense, making it realistic for them to cover -4.5 by imposing their pace—far more likely than Virtus keeping it within 4 points.

**2. Virtus&#x27; Visitor Struggles**

Virtus (10-11 overall) falters away, with just 2 wins in 13 road games, scoring only \~66.5 points while allowing 71.6. Their defense leaks \~83 points on the road, and offense dips significantly. Experts note Virtus&#x27; &quot;away struggles&quot; and potential playmaker absences, reducing their ability to respond in a hostile environment. While Virtus beat Dubai 79-78 at home earlier, the venue flip favors a wider Dubai win, not a close cover for +4.5.

**3. One more thing...**

Last two Virtus games has been as visitors. Last two Dubai games as locals. Consider a big travel from Bolonia to Dubai.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Orlando to win the game by 5 or more, 1.84, 1.5u

A game will be played in Berlin, the hometown of the Wagner brothers. Reports say both of them should be back from injuries tonight. How they play and how much they play is unclear. Orlando also has Tristan da Silva, so the logic is that Orlando, with 3 German players, will be more invested in the game than Memphis. This shall basically be a home court for Orlando.

They also have a second game in 3 days in London, so that one probably goes to Memphis.</td></tr>

**POTD Record:** 25-26

**Net Units:** \-6.77

**🏀 Amen Thompson o17.5 Points -110** vs the Oklahoma City Thunder

Amen&#x27;s poised for a solid performance against the Thunder. Recently, he&#x27;s cashed in L2/3 of their matchups, shooting \~50-60%.

Overall, he&#x27;s been on a roll, cashing this line in L8/10. Momentum has been toward his scoring, he&#x27;s averaged 23.8 points per game in L5, over an 18.8 point average this season.

Thunder are ranked top 3 in Defensive Rating, but they&#x27;re ranked 24th in allowing points to SGs. Thunder&#x27;s constant pressure-based defense opens up room for downhill drives from Thompson. Meanwhile, Durant &amp; Sengun will draw much of the Thunder&#x27;s defensive attention.

Lastly, his minutes per game has been at an all time high lately, playing 40+ min in both of his last games. Any kind of usage that high is a major plus in scoring opportunities.

Blue Jackets Next goal (First goal) (-140)

I&#x27;m changing strategy hockey is too random with the moneylines feels like obvious choices can just be a coin toss unless its like the Avalanches

Blue Jackets have hit that prop 8 times in their last 10 home games. Canucks have given up 8 times the first goal in their last 10. Canucks are 1-9 in their last 10 games, have lost 8 in a row and are playing like garbage. If you watched them play they give up grade A chances every 2 minutes. According to their GM who just did an interview, everyone on the team is tradeable so their morale is at their lowest. Jackets meanwhile come with some momentum giving their new coach his first win last game and have won 2 games in a row.

**Event:** NBA - OKC Thunder @ HOU Rockets (4:30pm PST)

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Rockets +4.5 (-118 on DK) - 5 units

Third time&#x27;s the charm?

OKC started the season looking invincible, but went through a slump recently. While they are 4-2 in their last six games, that stretch included losing to a good (not great) Suns team, getting blown out by the Hornets, barely beating the Jazz in OT, and winning their game against Memphis by just 1 point. They are obviously still an elite team, but not looking as dominant.

If the Thunder have a weakness, it is rebounding, ranking #19 in total RPG (43.9). Their only strong rebounder is Hartenstein, who is still out with injury. And without him, their total RPG drops to 42.4 which would rank 25th in the league.

As it turns out, Houston&#x27;s biggest strength is rebounding, leading the league. Houston also leads in 2nd-chance points, which is a good answer to OKC&#x27;s elite defense and will give them a definite edge over a bottom-tier-rebounding OKC team sans Hartenstein.

Houston has also been nearly unbeatable at home, going 12-2 on the season. The two losses came against elite teams, Detroit and Denver, both of which by 4 or fewer points.

***Edited to add: while a small sample size, HOU is 3-0 ATS as underdogs.*** 

In their only prior matchup against the thunder (played in OKC), the game went to double OT and OKC ended up winning by 1. ***Edited to add: HOU was +6.5-point underdog.***

So despite a large gap in the two teams&#x27; records and ranks, Houston matches up well against OKC especially at home. I expect a pretty close hard-fought game, with Houston seeing this opportunity to prove they are legit contenders, and so I&#x27;ll gladly take the 4.5 points with the home team with the massive rebounding advantage and everything to prove.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Sidney Crosby Over 1.5 Points +200 1u**

**Write Up:** Another unlucky L. The Sens did win but could not cover the puck line. They scored 2 in the 1st period and looked ready to run away with the game, but they let up a goal and couldn&#x27;t score on the empty net and even hit the post with a few seconds left! An even more frustrating result when we look at their most recent game where they scored 8 on the Rangers. Moving on- <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> we will be playing our first player prop backed by schedule data. Crosby owns the Flyers with 137 points in 92 career games, and 75 points in 47 games versus the Flyers at home in his career. Combine this with the fact that the Flyers are on a B2B, playing their 3rd game in 4 nights, 4th in 6 nights, and playing in Pittsburgh makes this a slam spot.  The Flyers used both of their goalies last night in an embarrassing loss to Buffalo where they let up 5 goals on 14 shots, so no matter who starts they will not be 100% rested, and this could also mean that they could call up one of their minor league goalies to make a start.

TLDR: Crosby owns the Flyers especially at home + The Flyers are tired &amp; having goalie issues.

If you can&#x27;t bet on player props I also like the Penguins to win and cover the -1.5

**5U - Kendric Davis (SYD) o6.5 AST (-125)**

Sydney are big favourites in this one, and justifiably so, but we can&#x27;t forget that Sydney will be running a skeleton crew. They&#x27;re missing 3 starters in Kuol, Cooks, and most importantly Delly. In the 3 games without Delly (injury) this season, Davis has registered 8, 4, 11 assists. Another thing to note is that when Delly returned and had his minutes managed, while playing less than 21 minutes, Davis is over the line 5/5 avg 8.00 AST. Davis is the primary ball handler of the team, and without Delly&#x27;s playmaking, Davis has to step up his passing which he has shown he can do in Delly&#x27;s absence. Lastly, Brisbane concede a lot of assists to guards and it was proved again last week where Cairns player had 13 AST, giving me enough confidence for an unoffical ladder up to 10 AST.

Start Time &amp; TV 6:00 &amp; 7:00pm EST (CBS Sports &amp; ESPN+)

Units: 3.25 Units

Reasoning: Going with a college basketball play tailing the Liberty Flames (13-3) over the New Mexico State Aggies (9-6) and the Georgia Southern Eagles (12-6) over the Old  Dominion Monarchs (5-13). I like going with the Georgia Southern Eagles because their offense is much better than this Old Dominion offense as they rank higher than them in points per game, field goal percentage, free throw percentage, and offensive rebounds per game. I really like how Georgia Southern has the home court advantage in this one as they are undefeated at home this year with a 7-0 home record while Old Dominion has played very poor on the road this year with a 1-10 road record. Also, Georgia Southern and Old Dominion have already played once this year and Georgia Southern won that game 93-86 on the road so I think they should be able to have repeat success at home in this one. I also like going with the Liberty Flames against the New Mexico State Aggies as the Flames have an edge offensively and defensively as they score more points per game than the Aggies as well as allowing less points to teams per game. The Flames rank 5th in the nation in field goal percentage with a 52.3 percent while the Aggies rank 261st in division one with a 43.8 field goal percentage so the Flames are much more efficient from the field than the Aggies. The Flames are also a top 5 team in the nation in turnovers per game as they are good at limiting mistakes while the Aggies are a middle of the pack team in regards to turnovers per game. I think home court advantage will be a big factor in this one as well as the Flames are undefeated in front of their home crowd while New Mexico State has not won a road game yet this season. I think both of these teams should be able to handle business at home in their games.

Prediction: 74-67 Liberty, 89-81 Georgia Southern

Last pick:🏀ETSU ML/Iona ML💩Jaylen Smith played 30 minutes and didnt make a shot all game and Brian Taylor ends the game with the most unclutch layup attempt and 2 missed free throws.

**Football | Italy - Serie A | 03:45 AM (GMT+8)**

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Como Vs AC Milan - **BTTS @ 1.77 (Melbet)**

**Write Up:** Como come into this fixture in good form, winning four of their last five league matches and conceding just two goals in that run. Convincing 3–0 away wins at Pisa and Lecce show how effective they are on the counter, while home victories over Udinese and a 1–1 draw with Bologna highlight their ability to stay organised and manage games when they need to control the pace.

Como’s goals tend to come in controlled moments rather than flurries. They’ve scored more than once in just two of their last five matches, but their strong structure has limited opponents to very few clear chances. That balance shows in their season record, with only 13 goals conceded across 19 league games. At home, Como are especially difficult to break down. They focus on staying compact and well-spaced rather than pressing aggressively, which often keeps matches tight deep into the second half. Even when they concede first, their response is usually calm and measured, not rushed, which further points toward low-scoring games.

AC Milan come into this match unbeaten in their last four league games, but recent performances have been more about control than outright dominance. Back-to-back 1–1 draws against Fiorentina and Genoa reflect that pattern, with both games decided by small moments rather than sustained pressure. Away from home, Milan have tended to play with caution. Their 1–0 win at Cagliari followed a similar script, while the more convincing 3–0 home victory over Verona stands out as an exception. Over the season, Milan’s matches rarely open up, as the combined average of goals scored and conceded per game stays below two, highlighting how controlled and tight their games usually are.

Luka Modric is set to return after being rested, while Allegri can also bring Fikayo Tomori back into the side following his suspension. Tomori is expected to slot into a back three alongside Strahinja Pavlovic and Matteo Gabbia. Pavlovic has been cleared to resume training despite needing nine stitches after a collision against Fiorentina, but there are still doubts over Rafael Leao’s availability. If Leao misses out, Christian Pulisic could partner Niclas Fullkrug in attack, with Nkunku also pushing for a start after a strong run of form.

Nkunku has been particularly effective recently, registering four goal involvements in his last three league matches after managing just one assist in the 10 games before that. For Como, creative side of stuff rests largely on Nico Paz and Jesús Rodriguez. Both have provided six league assists this season, with Paz also adding six goals of his own.

While this match looks more suited to a low-scoring game overall, both sides still have a good chance of finding the net given the quality in their squads. Earlier this season, Milan edged Como in two tight 2–1 wins, with both matches staying close until the final stages. That shows both teams are capable of scoring in this matchup. Even though BTTS isn’t the standout angle on paper, both sides will likely push to come away with something here. The game should remain controlled and tight, but there’s enough quality for goals at both ends.

Magic facing Grizzlies. 

His career average is 19.4, 3.7 assists and 4.9 rebounds per game in 32.4 minutes in average and 47.5 FG%. This season his minutes are at 33.4 and his PRA this season at 32.5, so 9 over the line.

He is coming back from ankle injury, saying he&#x27;s feeling good.

They are playing the game in his country Germany, so he will be motivated.

Bookies giving us -110 odds which calculates in 52.4% probability to cash. But Wagner went over this line in 23 of 24 in this season (96%) and 57 of 60 (95%) in last season. So we have 43% edge over the prediction in this season. I hope he will play and return in same rhythm as he left.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Anthony Black o14.5 pts (-130) DraftKings 1.5u



**Write-up:** Early game here set in Berlin. Franz Wagner is coming back into the lineup <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> from his injury, plus this is his home country. Should be on a minutes restriction. Also might not be. I was tempted to play his props, but I felt it was too risky, so I chose Black. Without Suggs in the lineup, Black has solidified himself in the starting point guard position, averaging over 30 minutes a game. Over his last 20 games, he has averaged 18.5 ppg. Without Suggs in the lineup and playing at least 30 minutes, he has hit this line in 12/14 games. Without Suggs and with Wagner, he is 3/5… not a ton of data. Even with Wagner coming back, I don’t see him taking a lot of Black&#x27;s production, as he still averages 12 field goals attempted. Should have a good matchup here, as the Grizzlies rank 28th in points to opposing point guards and 29th in three-point shots made to point guards. When playing for at least 30 minutes and against teams that defend the point badly, he has grabbed 20 points every time. Almost feels like a trap line, but I don’t see how Franz comes back and eats into Black&#x27;s usage rate that harshly. We will see.

* Previous reddit account was unfortunately hacked by someone who had my passwords and was unable to be recovered before it was banned, trying to get reddit to reply to anything is nearly impossible, been waiting for \~30 days and decided I want to be able to post for y&#x27;all so making a new one for posts now that the player break is over and tier one CS is finally back for 2026

**Writeup:**

* M80 take on GentleMates in the first match of BLAST, GentleMates are currently projected to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> their map second, this is a very straight forward <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> ban as both teams have permanent bans (Dust 2 for GM, Nuke for M80) and obvious first picks, M80 should <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> Mirage with GentleMates picking Inferno, it is both the best in slot first <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> for both teams, and weak maps for their opponents.

**Inferno Stats:**

* GentleMates are a very strong Inferno team and always have been with this roster core, they are 57% win rate on 7 maps played, 15-10 in the L6 months and 43-22 overall in 2025 on the map
* M80 are a very weak team on Inferno relative to their other maps, the win rate hides how bad they are with how much they play low tier NA competition, but against tier 1/1.5 competition in 2025, they were 2-9 on Inferno as a roster losing nearly 65% of their rounds played

**Lake Inferno Stats:**

* For reference, Lake is averaging a .76 KPR L3 months with a 52.8% headshot and a .76 KPR with a 50.8% headshot in 2025 as a whole
* Lake is averaging a .58 KPR L3 months on Inferno, a -.18 KPR drop, a .63 KPR L6 months on the map, with a .68 KPR in 2025 as a whole, still a nearly -.08 KPR drop
* Lake is averaging a 41% headshot on Inferno in 2025, this is a nearly 10% dropoff from his 2025 averaging of 50.8%, a MASSIVE drop off
* In 2025, Lake hasn&#x27;t hit this line since March 2025, with a 0/24 hitrate on Inferno missing this line with multiple high kill games including 18/19/20 even a 25 kill game
* with a 41-44% headshot average, it would take Lake 20-22 kills on Inferno to hit this line of 9 headshots, even being generous and taking his .68 KPR line from 2025 on the map which is very inflated from NA teams it would give him roughly 14-15 kills, this is well short of what he needs to hit 9 headshots

Found the best odds on Polymarket for this match. It&#x27;s generally around the -150 mark elsewhere but anything in the -133 or better range strikes me as good value for the following reasons:

\- M80 have played two tournaments in 2026 whereas Gentlemates have played zero so they are coming into this match with a lot less official match time

\- M80 won their last tournament pretty easily and the players will be coming to Europe in high spirits/good form (they have traveled from Las Vegas to Europe for this match which isn&#x27;t optimal but they are young and this match is scheduled for 11am)

\- Gentlemates had some good performances last year but at the end of the year their level dropped a bit and they ended the year with a record of 6 wins in 10 bo3 matches 

\- M80 have a strong map pool: their best map is Mirage which they have a 83% win rate compared with 20% for GM. GM&#x27;s first-choice map is Inferno which over the last 6 months they have won 60% of the time compared with 55% for M80 so it should be competitive. If the game goes to a deciding map it will be Ancient which both teams are good at.

Overall, assuming no travel fatigue, I think M80 are the more promising team with the higher ceiling, they get to choose their map first, and I was surprised I could find odds close to even money here. As always best of luck and please bet responsibly!</td></tr>

\- Racing are not a bad team, but they&#x27;re not going to get a result here. Segunda teams don&#x27;t fare too well historically against top teams.

\- Racing are top of the Segunda Division, but have 1 win in their last 5. Barcelona have 5 in 5. Barcelona are a top team, and will want to bring momentum from their super cup win into this game, as they chase a historic season.

\- After Real Madrid&#x27;s shock defeat to Albacete yesterday (due to a management crisis), and due to Racing being part of Spanish footy&#x27;s old guard, and because they are chasing a historic season after last year&#x27;s heights, Barcelona will be motivated as they have half a free run at the Copa del Rey and because the game&#x27;s narrative &amp; expectations will push them.

\- Barcelona have the profile to defeat Racing comfortably any day, Racing&#x27;s profile combined with form cannot defeat Barcelona. If one of those 1 in 20 games happen, they could *maybe* get Extra Time.

\- It&#x27;s hard to think of many risks, but Barcelona must turn up, which means they will perform, which will mean they&#x27;ll deliver enough to win, which for Barcelona will look more than a 1-0 win.

Now the form to come out of this race is amazing, with most horses running really well at their next starts, but it’s the runner up who really enhances this form, winning its next two starts by almost 3 lengths both times.    
    
<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> we draw barrier 2, and with only one noted speed influence in the race, I envision us camping right of the leader and having a dream run throughout. Hopefully that’s all she wrote. Never won over the 1100m distance, however last starts finish suggests we’ll handle it just fine.     
    
Opposition is pretty moderate here. The second market elect BOLD RESPONSE has a 4kg apprentice on, so I’m not forecasting a great ride, and some of the others are drawn poorly. There is one danger, KYLE, who ran great last start and now draws a soft barrier. I’m hoping that it lands directly behind us, and has a hard time finding clear air.    
    
For this bet, for every $10 you are putting on, you should be be paid out $23.50 ($13.50 profit). If yours is significantly less, you’ve place the bet wrong.

Last Pick: Roberto Bautista Agut +2.5 games vs Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard (-118, 1 unit): Loss

Tennis | ATP Adelaide | 1:30 AM EST (estimated)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Ugo Humbert vs Alexander Shevchenko | **Humbert to win 2-0 at -125 (DK). 1 unit.**

Write-up: RBA put up a decent fight after being down a set and a break against the huge-serving Mpetshi Perricard, but ultimately fell short in straight sets. Nevertheless, that snapped four wins in a row for me, and I&#x27;m still up +3.06 units on the year, so I can&#x27;t be too disappointed.

This Adelaide quarterfinal is one where I see one player having a significant edge. Ugo Humbert&#x27;s results last year were significantly stunted due to a recurring hand injury, but he was still able to round in to form in the indoor season. Now, after a couple months of rest, he seems to be completely healthy again. Humbert has posted excellent performance ratings in all three of his matches so far (7.77 in a Brisbane loss to Norrie, and 8.0 against Atmane, and 9.04 against Griekspoor). In comparison, Shevchenko has made it through four matches here in Adelaide; however, these were against lower-level opposition, and he failed to score higher than 7.57 in any of them. Shevchenko plays a solid aggressive baseline game, but he doesn&#x27;t have Humbert&#x27;s weapons, and it&#x27;s hard to see him finding a good gameplan in these lively conditions. Additionally, Shevchenko has a woeful 3-10 career record against lefties at this level, including an 0-2 H2H against Humbert. Looking at recent market prices, Humbert was priced similarly to where he is here against Atmane, who I view as more dangerous in these conditions despite his bad current form. Overall, Humbert&#x27;s serve and forehand should make the difference here, and he&#x27;s looking at a pretty reasonable title path if he moves on to the semis.</td></tr>

**Event:** Milwaukee Bucks @ San Antonio Spurs

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Stephon Castle Over 17.5 Points

**Write Up:** Castle enters the matchup with significant momentum and a favorable history against this specific opponent. He is coming off a stellar **20-point performance** against the Oklahoma City Thunder on January 13, and he notably dropped **20 points** on the Bucks in their last meeting. Currently averaging **17.3 points per game** for the 2025–26 season, Castle has become a primary playmaker for the Spurs, frequently logging **30+ minutes** and taking advantage of his aggressive drive-to-the-basket style. This plays well against a Bucks defense that currently ranks **22nd in the league** at defending points from the guard position and allows an average of **115.7 points per game**, making it a prime opportunity for Castle to exceed his season average. At home, Castle’s shooting efficiency often sees a boost, particularly with his aggressive rim-attacking style that leads to a high free-throw rate.

* **Recent Home Highs:** 24 PTS (vs. OKC), 23 PTS (vs. GSW), 20 PTS (vs. UTA). 
* He is shooting roughly **46.1% from the field** on the season, but his &quot;per-36 minute&quot; home splits suggest a scoring ceiling closer to **21 points** when he sees heavy usage.
* **The Matchup Edge:** Milwaukee’s perimeter defense has struggled to contain athletic, downhill guards. Given that Castle is averaging **6.2 free throw attempts** per game, he is likely to exploit the Bucks&#x27; tendency to foul in the paint, providing him with &quot;easy&quot; points at the line to help clear the 17.5 threshold.

Thursday’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> - Blackhawks ML -110 (1.1u to win 1u)

Chicago has looked like a solid team in January despite where they are in the standings right now. In January, they have a 5-2 record and they are 4-1 when Spencer Knight is in goal, which I imagine he will be. They also got a boost to their team with their player Bedard coming back from injury recently. He was out in their last game due to illness, but was back at practice <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.

They’re going up against a Calgary team that is 1-5 in January and has a pretty atrocious road record. I normally don’t look into that too much, but 7-12-3 on the road compared to 12-7-2 is a pretty big difference. I’m assuming that Calgary will be starting Dustin Wolf who has given up 4 goals in 5 straight games.

This is not as much as a BTTS rather than it is a &quot;can Waalwijk be competitive&quot; bet. For those of you that don&#x27;t know, possession and pressure based football (*Totaalvoeetbal)* was created in the Netherlands in the 1970s, more specifically by Ajax in Amsterdam. Pretty much the tactic that revolutionized soccer forever, and leads us to just continue the nice tradition that Mr. Cruyff instructed in legendary teams like the early 90s Barcelona. Anyway, I&#x27;m drifting away from the point; I expect this to be a typical soccer game in the Netherlands; explosive attacks, high pressure; and punishing the opponents mistake.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Bologna to score + Under 9.5 corners (Como vs Milan) @1.86 (1u)

**Write-Up:**

Bologna have scored in their last 8 away league matches. The only two away games where they didn&#x27;t score were the first 2, against Roma and Milan, two of the strongest defenses in the league. Verona, meanwhile, have conceded in their last 8 home games, with the only cleansheet at home coming in their first home match. Bologna sit 9th, Verona 19th, making Bologna the clear attacking favorite.

Como&#x27;s home games consistently produce low corner counts, averaging 6.55 corners per game. Even against the strongest opponent they faced at home this season, Juventus, the game ended with just 5 total corners (4 for Como, 1 for Juventus). Last season&#x27;s H2H between Como and Milan also ended with 5-6 total corners in both games. Milan’s style relies on structured, central build-up rather than constant wing pressure, which means corner counts are often suppressed against disciplined, compact teams like Como.

Some caution points: although Como has a very low corner count at home, Milan averages 9.1 corners away this season. I’m counting on Como’s disciplined style to suppress their usual numbers, but if Milan generates pressure quickly or scores early, the corner count could rise.</td></tr>

🚨🚨🚨“UNDERDOG ALART”🚨🚨🚨 <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: John Higgins to WIN VS Zhao Xintong @ +146 on FD for 2.06u  win 3u

EARLY BIRDS START YOUR ENGINES! Now to me, this feels like a spot where John Higgins just has the edge in a first-to-6. He’s already shown this season that his game is in a really good place, especially at the Masters where he looked sharp, confident, and controlled from the first frame. The head-to-head also leans his way, and that matters in a short race like this. Higgins knows how to manage Zhao tactically, slow things down, and turn small mistakes into stolen frames. In best-of-11s, that experience and match awareness usually producing a win.

Now it’s obvious Zhao Xintong is dangerous and can outscore anyone when he gets rolling, but Higgins’ current form plus his history against Zhao make all the difference here. Higgins doesn’t need to dominate; he just needs to stay solid, win the safety exchanges, and capitalize when Zhao overreaches. Over six frames, that kind of pressure and consistency is often enough, which is why Higgin should take his game to the Semi finals. And at plus odds I felt like it’s worth sprinkling a few units. 

A part of me wanted to take the spread at +1.5 frames but I trust that if it’s gets to a decider, Higgins locks in and takes it. He either Wins by 2 or loses by 2+

**Event:** Copa del Rey, Racing Santander v FC Barcelona, 3:00 pm EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Racing Santander +1.5 Asian Handicap, +120, 3 units

**Write Up:** We saw another massive shock yesterday, as a struggling Albacete side that hangs just above the relegation zone in the second division knocked out Real Madrid in a pretty convincing fashion. This is a type of game the Spanish league cup can readily cook up and I truly believe we&#x27;re about to see more of that <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> as Racing Santander host Barcelona. Travelling from Saudi Arabia, where they&#x27;d just played an intense match against their bitter rivals, Real Madrid, a few days prior, and perhaps feeling **tired,** as well as **complacent, the Barcelona players are not going to be at 100%** for the clash with Santander. Moderate to heavy **rotation and minute management** of the star players are also expected, and that only nudges the odds further in our favor.

Racing Santander, unlike Albacete, aren&#x27;t struggling - quite the opposite, they in fact find themselves at the very top of the Segunda Division at the halfway point of the season, *though their recent form hasn&#x27;t been stellar.* Still, they certainly aren&#x27;t a pushover. They have some quality players, such as the talented **Asier Villalibre, who has already scored 10 goals and added an assist in 20 games this season** and will be looking to continue his fine run of form against a Barcelona team that isn&#x27;t defensively bulletproof. I&#x27;m feeling a shock <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, but even if Racing lose by a goal, the bet still comes through for us. So far, we&#x27;ve seen an uninspiring Atletico Madrid barely beat Deportivo 1-0, Athletic Bilbao needing extra time to dispatch Cultural Leonesa, and Real Madrid deservedly getting knocked out by one of the weakest sides in the Segunda Division in Albacete. What am I getting at? **All the big Spanish sides have struggled against second division teams so far,** and these teams are, on paper, much weaker than the one Barca are coming up against <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. A shock is certainly on the cards, and I&#x27;m sending it with 3 whole units. Covering three outcomes *(win, draw, narrow defeat)* at these odds is just a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> I can&#x27;t refuse.

**NBL: Kings v Bullets - Alex Ducas 10+ points** **4U** $1.65 (Bet365) 9:30PM AEDT

   * Sydney play one of the fastest paces in the game scoring 95 PPG and are a transition team.
   * They may only allow 86 PPG but this is a different story with Delly and Bul Kuol out. Their starting 5 is all out attack.
   * Even when Delly and Kuol were in, they were letting in 31 3P attempts per game. Melbourne got up 36 shots against them last round in the game Delly went down. That&#x27;s a 20% increase over Melbourne&#x27;s season average 3PA.
   * Brisbane&#x27;s two primary attack weapons right now are Moldonado (legend) and Terry Taylor. Moldonado attacks the rim and Terry Taylor plays from the key and backs his way to the rim. If the focus is on these two guys, there will be plenty of kick-out options.
   * Ducas has attempted 140 3PA (5.6 per game) this season. That is more than **double** the 3PA of any other Brisbane Bullets player. Given the Kings tendency to give up the 3 ball, he will get plenty of looks tomorrow night.
   * But he&#x27;s not just a one trick pony. He&#x27;s young and athletic and has good handles to attack the rim. In a high pace game, I can&#x27;t see why he can&#x27;t get one or two rim attacks in transition or when they run him off the 3.
   * He might be averaging 9 points per game but with all the injuries and the 3 pt stats above, I think this line should be an easy clear for him.

These odds seems to be dropping quickly so please consider that when staking. At some point, his natural 11.5 point line @ $1.85 becomes the better bet. Your call but this is what I&#x27;ve locked in.

Tosay we take a rare trip to Spain for an interesting cup match between Barcelona and 2nd division team Racing Santander. Racing is currently first place in the 2nd division of spanish football. What i like about this matchup is that Racing scores the most goals in the 2nd division and, outside of the bottom 2, concedes the most goals in the 2nd division. Their matches are the highest scoring in the league. 

Barcelona, as many may know, are currently the first place team in La Liga and also score the most goals on La Liga with an average of over 2.5 goals per match. While they tend to have a decent defensive record, they have been struggling on the road recently. Conceding 2 goals to Madrid in the Supercopa final, 3 goals to Real Betis a few weeks back, and 2 goals to Celta Viego before that. These sorts of inter division cup matches tend to be boom or bust with goals, usually hinging on how early the higher division team scores. The earlier they score, the more risks the lower division team takes, the more open the game is. I&#x27;m banking on an early Barca goal or two against the spotty Racing defense, which will hopefully lead to 5-6 total goals. 

To clarify, over 4 is a push if 4 goals are scored. We win with 5 or more. I&#x27;m predicting 4-5 Barca goals and 1-2 Racing goals to win this one, let&#x27;s say 5-2 Barca.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Orland Magic -4.5

Now the reason why this one sticks out to me is because the game is actually held in Berlin, which is where Franz and Mo Wagner are from. Franz is actually a very critical part of this team because of how BAD this teams three point shooting is, Desmond Bane and Banchero can not shoot the three ball. Making the spacing on the floor horrible and predictable, not only this but the injuries have deeply hurt this team. The bench depth is very skeletal as Anthony Black does best on the bench but currently he starts meaning the substitute players that come in don&#x27;t really bring in energy or that firing power. I expect Franz and Mo playing will be a good enough help, also considering that they are from Berlin will be extra motivation.

Memphis on the other hand I believe are at an all time low so this could be a good bounce back spot for them. However I can&#x27;t really see it atm . Ja Morant is arguing with team mates now and also commenting that he feels betrayed by team mates and Jaren Jackson also wants to be traded. Recent performance in last quarters has been horrid, they lost to a OKC team with no starters besides Jdub and nearly collapsed to a nets team without Michael Porter Jr.</td></tr>

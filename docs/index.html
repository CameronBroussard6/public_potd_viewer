&gt; **Write Up:** This <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> is from my soccer model that I&#x27;ve been using for the past two years. It assigns ELO ratings to players and projects a win chance based on the combined ELO ratings of the players on each team. TeamReddit is projecting a 62% win chance here which creates value here on the ML.</td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>

<tr><td class='post'>POTD RECORD: 174-129

Season record: 11-6

Last POTD: __Jalen Suggs O4.5 AST @1.86 1U__ ✅

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: __Davion Mitchell O6.5 AST @1.86 1U (Bet365)__

NBA | Bulls vs Heat | 🏀  

Suggs gets it done with 5 minutes left in the first half what a beast, we move 6-1 run.

NBA Cup games is back and this just stands out immediately, we get a high total of 247.5 in this one and it’s for the right reasons. Heat is ranked #1 in pace this season whilst Bulls are ranked 4th, expect a high speed high scoring game here which is golden for assist props. Cup game should mean starters playing more minutes with every point mattering, lost minutes last game due to foul trouble but should be in store for 30+ minutes here at least.

With 29+ minutes Davion is over in 7/10 games this season avg 8 assists per game &amp; 13.6 potentials per game. Over in 3/3 H2H against the Bulls with those same filters Avg 8.3 assists per game.

Davion is leading the Heat team in passes made per game, assists per game and potential assists per game, so expect Davion to keep facilitating and run the offense in what should be a great game.</td></tr>

Analysis: feeling pretty unmotivated after that Pigossi result so all I’ll say is Gakhov in Spain. Tail, fade, BOL regardless.

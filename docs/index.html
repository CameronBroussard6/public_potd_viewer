<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Avalanche vs Rangers - Devon Toews  2+ SOG

Start Time: 12:30pm eastern

Odds: 1.95 on Bet365

Units 1U

Reasoning: 

Here we have an early game with the Avalance vs Rangers. The Avalance, the best team in the NHL fresh off of a loss at the hands of the Islanders loosing 6 - 3 and we can expect to see a motivated Avalance return to their winning form. But our <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> is with defenseman Devon Toews, Known for his two-way reliability and ability to contribute offensively. In his last 6 games he has met or exceeded 2 SOG and at the price of 1.95 I love the value here. Recently, in a 7–2 win against Montreal Canadiens, Toews fired four shots on goal and even scored.  As  one of Colorado’s top-pair defensemen this season we should see heavy ice time.

Basketball | NCAAB | 2:15 p.m. / ET 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Louisville -4.5 (-110) - 1 Unit 

Write Up: Louisville stands out in this matchup with their superior athleticism and strong home-court advantage at the KFC Yum! Center, where they’ve been averaging 82 points per game while clamping down defensively to hold opponents to just 38% shooting from the field in their wins this season. Key contributors like guard Skyy Clark and forward J’Vonne Hadley have been pivotal, providing efficient scoring and rebounding that exploit mismatches. On the flip side, Indiana’s offense has been sputtering lately, dipping under 70 points in three of their last five games and ranking outside the top 150 in adjusted offensive efficiency on the road issues compounded by turnover problems (averaging 14+ per game away) and inconsistent shooting from beyond the arc. Projections from advanced models like KenPom and Bart Torvik show Louisville pulling away for an 85-75 type win, covering the spread comfortably, especially given their 6-2 ATS record at home against Big Ten foes in similar spots over the past few seasons. The line has held steady around -4.5 to -5 across major books with sharp money leaning toward the Cards, and experts from sites like Action Network and Covers are pounding them to cover up to -6 or better, confirming strong value here.</td></tr>

Cavs are on 2nd night of B2B after playing last night against the Spurs where Garland didn’t play, expecting a couple of guys to get ruled out <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> and Garland to play in this one. Merill &amp; Allen are already out, over in 3/4 games without them this season avg 16.3 RA’s. Wouldn’t get too surprised if Donovan Mitchell sits but wouldn’t bank on it, Lonzo should sit as he hasn’t played any back to back games this season, over in 3/3 without Lonzo this season avg 10.3 RA’s on 19 RA chances.

Has had great success against GSW where he’s gone over in 4/4 games last three seasons H2H avg 10 RA with 16+ potentials in every game. 

Should be fresh and ready to play here against a side he’s done great against previously, not the best and not a bad matchup either but with a couple of guys ruled out I’m expecting this line to go higher.

Last Pick: Lille Draw No Bet (+2.96 units) vs Marseille ✅

Last Pick Reflections:
Lille took control early and never really let Marseille get comfortable. The defensive structure was solid throughout, the energy was there from the first minute, and once Lille got in front they managed the tempo extremely well. Marseille pushed late but struggled to create clear chances. This played out exactly as expected from a situational and structural standpoint. Good bounce-back win.

**Event: PSG vs Rennes – Ligue 1**

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Under 3.5 Goals (1.85) – 5 units**

Write Up:
PSG is once again the public favorite here, but this matchup against Rennes tends to be played at a much more controlled pace than most expect. Rennes usually sits deep, stays compact, and looks to frustrate rather than engage in open attacking football.

From an eye-test perspective, PSG has been managing games more than blowing teams out in these types of spots, especially against disciplined defensive opponents. Rennes’ structure limits space between the lines and makes it difficult to create high-volume scoring chances.

With the Under 3.5, we are covered on most realistic scorelines in this matchup. We only lose if the game completely opens up into a shootout, which statistically and tactically is unlikely here. Given the tempo, the matchup, and the stakes, I see strong situational value on a controlled, low-to-mid scoring game.

Best of luck to everyone riding, and as always, please gamble responsibly and only wager what you can afford to lose.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Real Betis vs Barcelon – Barcelona to Win @ 1.75 (2 Units)**

Write up: While Barcelona&#x27;s dominant form makes this look straightforward, the alternative consideration here was the Over 2.5 goals market given Barcelona&#x27;s attacking output. However, the straight win provides better value when considering the model&#x27;s projections and historical dominance.

Model Projection: The statistical model projects Barcelona with a 72.6% win probability, representing clear value in this matchup.

Alternative Consideration: For those seeking additional value, Barcelona -1 Asian Handicap could provide even higher odds while still maintaining positive expected value given their scoring record against Betis. The Over 2.5 goals market also presents value considering Barcelona&#x27;s attacking output combined with Betis&#x27; respectable offensive capabilities.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Serie A -Sassuolo ML vs. Fiorentina @ 3.00 -1 Unit ✅

This one is more of a bold <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. I’m purely taking the value here. In previous seasons, backing Fiorentina ML would’ve been the obvious choice. But their current form is atrocious: they’re second to last with just 6 points, scoring only 10 goals while conceding 21. They don’t have a bad squad, but nothing is clicking.

Meanwhile, Sassuolo sit comfortably in 10th place and are having a solid season by their standards-16 goals scored and 16 conceded. The H2H has generally been close, except for their last meeting. I’m taking a shot here because Fiorentina are in the worst shape they’ve been in for a long time, and Sassuolo are at home. That’s why I see value in this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Game Total Under 154.5 (Bovada)

Last pick: We were feeling pretty good at half up 9 with Burton out but Notre Dame pulls it out. We move. 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: I got this one turning into sort of a grind. GCU already has a middle of the pack tempo and add that to the fact that OSU forces long possessions is a great recipe for an under. I just don’t think there will be enough possessions to get over 154.5. The three ball also doesn’t worry me since neither team shoots much and when they do, they’re not making many. OSU hits them at a 32% clip and GCU at a 29% clip. I think OSU has a legit defense and while I don’t believe the GCU defense is top 50 (per KenPom), if they are even close to that, this game should fly under.

**POTD:** Merab Dvalishvili ML + Alexandre Pantoja ML (Parlay)

**Event/Start Time:** UFC 323 - 10:00 PM ET

**Odds:** \-130 

**Units:** 3U

**Reasoning:** First <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, feel really good about this one.  
Merab has been unstoppable. Hasn&#x27;t lost since 2018. He&#x27;s nicknamed &quot;The Machine&quot; for a reason. He just wears his opponents down through relentless wrestling and a combination of unnatural cardio. He is unstoppable at bantamweight, and Yan simply doesn&#x27;t have the skills or physicality to beat Merab. Like a lot of recent championship matchups in the UFC, we see here a fighter with the ground game advantage vs a fighter with the striking advantage. The overwhelming trend we see is that the fighters with the upper hand on the ground dominate. Just look at all the recent matchups. Hooker vs Arman, JDM vs Islam, Pereira vs Ankalaev, Khamzat vs DDP. Tonight&#x27;s main event will be no different. Oh, did I also mention that these two fought before in 2023? Merab won a unanimous decision. Expect that again tonight.

  
Now onto Pantoja. If you thought Merab was unstoppable at Bantamweight, he&#x27;s nothing compared to Pantoja at Flyweight. He is THE most underrated champ in the UFC right now. Pantoja has essentially cleared out the division, and while Van is talented, he&#x27;s just not enough for Pantoja. Pantoja and Merab have strikingly similar styles. Like Merab, Alexandre &quot;The Cannibal&quot; Pantoja wears down his opponents, and as soon as he sees an opportunity, he strikes. Van is a crowd-pleasing, exciting striker, riding on a wonderful story to the title, but he is about to learn there are levels to this sport. No one Van has faced thus far has been close to Pantoja&#x27;s level of MMA skill. Pantoja is used to dealing with dangerous, fiery strikers, and time after time, we hear Bruce Buffer announce &quot;AND STILL.&quot; We will get two of those tonight. 

BOL</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>POTD Record 3-2

Toronto Maple Leafs vs Montreal Canadiens at 7:00pm EST (NHL/Hockey)
Over 5.5 goals (-175)

This season both games have went over that line and i&#x27;m not expecting this to change tonight. Both teams score a lot of goals and they give up a lot of goals.

Leafs score 3.48 goals on average this season. (4th in the NHL) 
Leafs give up 3.37 goals on average this season. (7th in the NHL)

Canadiens score 3.31 goals on average this season. (6th in the NHL)
Canadiens give up 3.54 goals on average this season.  (2nd in the NHL)
 
While the stats do help, what makes me confident in this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> is that the Leafs lost Joseph Woll in their last game to a lower body injury which means they don&#x27;t have their #1 and #2 goalie. Hildeby will be starting and although his stats are not bad at all, he only played 13 games in the NHL and he is 1-2 when starting in net this season. For the Canadiens it doesn&#x27;t matter who starts really, both goalies give up 3+ goals on average this season. If it&#x27;s Montembeault, he has the worst stats of a #1 goalie in the NHL (.861 save percentage which is dead last and 3.61 goals allowed on average this season). If it&#x27;s Dobes, which I think will be as he won the last game for Montreal, he gives up 3.11 goals on average and has a .892 save percentage which is not good for a NHL goalie.

And although their goalies are struggling, another reason why I feel confident with the over 5.5 is because both teams have a lot of difficulties defending in their own end and they usually give up grade A scoring chances to their opponents which makes it difficult for their goalies to stop them.

In other words, this should be a goal festival between these two division rivals or one team is gonna get dominated by the other (their last 2 games this season went 5-2 Toronto and then 5-2 Montreal).

We&#x27;re 3/3 on Blocks props this season. I like this big plus money to get us to 4/4.

Pelicans are like the Bulls, they get blocked by everybody. 7 of the last 8 SFs to face them have gotten a block, including players like Jake LaRavia and Jaylen Wells. They rank 27th in allowed blocks and 21st in allowed blocks to SFs.

Meanwhile, MPJ has gotten a block in his L2/4 games. Against the Pelicans, he&#x27;s above average, cashing in L3/5.

Expecting some sloppy play in this mid-off and MPJ to get his hands on one to cash us out. If there&#x27;s one thing the Nets are semi-decent at recently, it&#x27;s getting a few blocks.

Pantoja is a dominant champ with a big edge in experience and is a clear favorite over Van. Van is tough, has never been an easy out, and most of his recent wins have come late or by decision, which lines up with the market heavily expecting this fight to get past Round 1.

Write Up: Tottenham is in poor form and Brentford, though not horrible, has some defensive flaws. Both teams let in goals, and have continued to do so for the last 5 games. I think this could potentially be a high scoring affair. I do not have the conviction of one team or the other winning this game, but I do believe there will be scoring opportunities for both sides. I also think this game will not end in a 1-1 draw, therefore, to juice the odds a little bit, I’ve added over 2 goals.

Switching it up a bit this time - I&#x27;m a massive Pels fan (tough life trust me), and I know this team inside out, so for this run I’m only betting on Pelicans games. Hopefully we nail the five wins straight off the bat, but either way I’m grinding until we hit that $10k.

**Win Streak**: ❌ ✅ ✅

Super happy with this read, went exactly as predicted. Onto the next one.

**Wager:** $1596 (Day 3)

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** New Orleans Pelicans v Brooklyn Nets | Jeremiah Fears O 19.5 Points and Assists @ 1.86

Since Zion went out, Fears has been extremely aggressive and has essentially stepped into the secondary scoring role behind Trey.  Pels clearly trust him to push the pace, and after almost any made basket he’ll sprint the floor for a transition layup, and he converts those at a high rate. Ideal matchup too, Nets are bottom five in transition points allowed, which fits perfectly with his playstyle.

He also tends to come out firing in the first quarter, so hopefully he sets the tone early. I did look at Fears O3.5 first-quarter points, but I might save that prop for next game.

Across his last three games without Zion, he’s averaging 20.6 points on 14.7 FGA, so the volume is clearly there. His three-point shooting has improved as well, and with Trey likely drawing doubles, Fears should see even more clean three point looks going forward. Books feel a touch behind on this.

Matchup-wise, the Nets have been leaking points to point guards recently: Keyonte George 29 points, Josh Giddey 28 points, LaMelo Ball 12 points (on a really poor shooting night). Brooklyn are also among the worst in the league in both points allowed and opponent 3-pt percentage, so there’s real upside for Fears to add a couple threes on top of his usual transition buckets.

For assists, Fears has become the main driver of the offence. With his usage increasing, his distribution has naturally jumped, and he’s averaging 4.7 assists in his last three without Zion even tho the team has actually been shooting threes poorly, so there&#x27;s only upside. Matchup helps too, as in their last three games the Nets have bled assists to PGs - George: 10 assists, Giddey: 11 assists, LaMelo: 14 assists

Overall, projecting a big Fears game with both scoring and playmaking upside. As a little bonus look, Fears O3.5 first-quarter points.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>⭐️:🏈Virginia ML/Texas Tech ML (-116) \[Action247\]

Start Time &amp; TV: 12:00 &amp; 8:00pm EST (ABC)

Units: 3 Units

Reasoning: For this Championship Saturday well be going with the Texas Tech Red Raiders to defeat the BYU Cougars in the Big 12 conference championship game and the Virginia Cavaliers to defeat the Duke Blue Devils in the ACC championship game. This Texas Tech team is a wagon and I believe they have a serious chance of winning the national championship this year as they are undefeated 10-0 when quarterback Behren Morton starts under center with their only loss coming when he was out due to injury. Their high powered offense is one of the best in nation and in terms of scoring they are ranked 3rd nationally with over 43 points scored per game. They are also paired with a damn good defense. This Red Raiders defense is excellent against the rush, so much so they have the nations number one ranked rush defense allowing less than 70 rushing yards per game. They also rank 3rd nationally in points allowed per game allowing just 11 points on defense per contest. This Red Raiders squad is a complete package and we saw this earlier in the year when they faced off against these same BYU Cougars winning that game in convincing fashion 29-7. I also like the Virginia Cavaliers to defeat the Duke Blue Devils for the second time this year. Virginia went on the road and handed Duke a 34-17 loss and when I went back and rewatched that game a couple things stood out to me. Even when Duke stacked the box, they simply could not stop the run. Runningback J’Mari Taylor rushed for 133 yards and 2 touchdowns and the team as a whole rushed for 225 yards. Also this Duke secondary did not have an answer for wide receiver Trell Harris as he recorded 161 receiving yards and found his way into the endzone. The final score of 34-17 makes it seem like it was kind of a close game but it really wasnt. Virginia manhandled Duke on the line of scrimmage and this game was 31-3 in the third quarter before the Cavaliers put in some of their backups. I expect history to repeat itself in this one and Virginia to be crowned as champions of the ACC.

Prediction: 30-20 Texas Tech, 31-23 Virginia

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> : Cricket - India vs SA - Match sixes over 15.5 @1.9  2U✅

Write up : 

Series decided <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. It&#x27;s been high scoring matches in the last 2 matches and I expect the same here in Vizag. Vizag venue is known for dishing out batting friendly pitches. Women&#x27;s World Cup matches saw some of the flattest pitches ( Australia W chasing 300+ , England W chasing 180 in 30 overs) . The venue doesn&#x27;t get many international matches on the Mens side and hence it would be ideal for them to make another flat one to attract more crowd( if Virat and Rohit aren&#x27;t enough already to make it houseful)

The sixes line cleared in the last 2 matches and I&#x27;m fairly confident to get this done as well. Plenty of six hitting ability in both sides. Players who aren&#x27;t known for exclusive six hitting have also joined the party ( Gaikwad, Kohli). Jaiswal is yet to perform well and he will be under pressure to perform as this will be his last opportunity before Gill replacing him. 

South Africa have definitely exceeded expectations in the series and have come close to winning 2 matches. Their batting depth is something they&#x27;ve been focusing on its paying off this series. Markram, Brevis, Bosch, Jansen are the usual suspects again.

My first 2U bet here. Good luck 🤞🏻</td></tr>

So, looking at goals. I think, BTTS would be a pretty good choice, as both teams have scored atleast a goal in their last 5 matches + Arsenal&#x27;s defense is a little weak since Gabriel has been out

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Ohio State ML vs Indiana + Indiana Team Total Under 24.5 

Start Time: 8:00pm ET (FOX)

Odds: -132 (FanDuel)

Units: 1U

Write-Up: Ohio State has been consistent all year, against vast differences in levels of competition, &amp; it seems as if they’re peaking at the right time, the same as a year ago. I have faith in this defense that’s given up just under 8 ppg this season, and only once have they given up more than 2 scores, a game in which they gave up 16. 

On the other side, I actually do think Indiana is solid and well coached, but until anyone in CFB proves that they’re in the same atmosphere as OSU, it’s going to be a you’ve got to prove it to be type of deal with just about anyone Ohio State runs into this postseason. Too much speed &amp; skill on the outside and players and coaches who have been there and done that. 

Two of the sports best, most balanced in a year where the top 8 isn’t nearly as potent as years past. I’ll take OSU 31-17 in a game that’s close in the first half, but controlled all the way through by the Buckeyes. 

Good luck if tailing, CFB was my money maker last year, first post since my bad run at the end of baseball season.

Write-Up:
I’m taking the submission angle here because both fighters bring real finishing threats on the mat. Chris Duncan owns a tight, aggressive guillotine that he’s shown he can latch onto the moment opponents shoot sloppy entries. On the other side, Terrance McKinney has multiple first-round submission wins and consistently forces fast grappling scrambles early in fights.
This matchup sets up perfectly for a tap: McKinney comes out explosive and chaotic, which either gets him top control opportunities or puts him directly into danger if Duncan times a counter choke. Neither guy is known for slow, methodical pacing. The early exchanges should be wild, and with two proven submission threats, I see this fight hitting the mat and ending with someone getting caught inside the first two rounds.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Michigan State ML (+100) (1U)

Write up:

In what is shaping up to be the biggest game the Breslin Center has hosted in the last decade, Michigan State moneyline stands out as a strong even money play against Duke. The Breslin has been one of the most intimidating home environments in college basketball, and with an undefeated 8–0 MSU team hosting a top‑10 Duke squad, the atmosphere will be volcanic — the kind of edge that analytics never fully capture but bettors should never ignore. MSU’s physicality and frontcourt depth give them a real blueprint to challenge Duke star Cam Boozer, who enters averaging 23.6 points per game on 56.2% shooting. The Spartans counter with Jaxon Kohler, their leading scorer at 14.3 points per game on 52.5% shooting, and a team rebounding rate ranking first in the nation at 59%. Duke is 20th in the nation. MSU is proving they have the size and toughness to battle inside. Combine that with Tom Izzo’s 744 career wins and his unmatched preparation in marquee matchups, and MSU’s blend of experience, physicality, and home‑court firepower makes their even‑money line a compelling and analytically supported bet heading into this Breslin Center showdown.

Game/League: Counterstrike 2 | Starladder Major | Teams/Time in screenshot below

**NQZ U 5.5 Headshots Map 2 (-192)**

* Headshots on AWPers can be inherently risky, because two bad pistol rounds and your AWPer can hit this line, but in most cases these lines are just too high given the overall headshot %
* NQZ is averaging a 33% headshot last 3 months, that means taking his average on its own, he would need \~18 kills to hit this line, while this is already hard given .67 KPR it gets even worse on projected map:
* B8 are higher seed so they should <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> their map 2nd, both teams have a perma ban, and paiN have a clear weak map which is Ancient, while B8 historically always first <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> Mirage, this is the time to go for the Ancient punish <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, as paiN beat them on Mirage last time, and paiN are much worse at the map
* paiN are 17% winrate on 6 maps of Ancient, B8 are 71% winrate on Ancient on 14 maps in the L3 months, they are also on a 7 winstreak
* NQZ is averaging a .54 KPR L3 months on Ancient with a 17.6% headshot in 6 maps with a 0/6 over hit rate, in 2025 he is averaging a .62 KPR with a 21.2% headshot in 12 maps played with a 1/12 over hitrate, in his last 3 months of Ancient maps, he dropped 3 headshots as his highest on a map. Would need \~28 kills at this headshot % to hit his line
* On top of worsening map stats, hes had a rough major so far dropping to .58 KPR and 27% headshot so far

**Jimpphat U 8.5 Headshots Map 1 (-192)**

* MOUZ are higher seed so they should <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> 2nd, Falcons <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> first, both teams have perma bans
* Falcons <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> Ancient, 91% winrate on 11 maps, MOUZ 33% winrate on 6 maps
* Falcons 4-0 h2h vs. MOUZ on Ancient since kyousuke joined, 13-5/13-7/13-9/13-9, CT start good for U HS
* Jimpphat 49.3% headshot L3 months&gt;38.5% on Ancient, 50.8% 2025&gt;45.5% on Ancient
* Jimpphat 1/15 hitrate L3 months on Ancient, only hitting against FaZe in a 27 map life game complete outlier. He has missed this line in multiple 15+ kill games including a 20 kill game and a 22 kill game
* Jimpphat 0/4 hitrate against Falcons on Ancient, 21 headshots in 67 kills total in 4 maps, averaging a 31.3% headshot against Falcons on this map

Overall, model loves both of these plays giving a major edge on these lines parlayed at + money, with elite hit rates, big model projection differences, and both starting on CT side which is the much worse side for obtaining headshots, expecting both teams to lose their opponents respective map <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> and hopefully we can avoid OT!</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> : BTTS + Over 2.5 Goals @1.7 for 3u

Leipzig are second in the Bundesliga with 26 points and are a strong attacking team who will score multiple goals at home, while Frankfurt are 7th with 21 points and have a positive goal difference showing they score consistently whenever they play. Both teams have the quality to break through each other&#x27;s defenses because Frankfurt will not sit back defensively away from home and will try to win the match, meaning Leipzig&#x27;s attack will find space and Frankfurt&#x27;s attack will create chances as well. Leipzig have been in excellent form winning most of their home games and Frankfurt have scored against even tough opponents, so expecting both teams to score is very realistic and has happened in most recent meetings between these two clubs. The over 2.5 goals requirement is almost guaranteed because this is an open attacking match where both Leipzig and Frankfurt will try to win.

Event: Georgia @ Alabama 2:00MST &amp; Indiana @ Ohio St. 6:00MST

Write Up: It&#x27;s conference championship weekend and it&#x27;s going to be an exciting day watching these teams face off in these winners take all matchups.

With the first game on my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> I have Alabama covering the spread within a single possession touchdown in which I believe is a very winnable game outright for Bama. They have already beaten this Georgia team earlier in the season in a close game, away in Athens and I&#x27;m predicting this one to be a very close one as well. Both teams rank very similarly in offensive and defensive numbers this season, with the exception of the Bulldogs having an elite top 10 run defense. Even then, the Crimson Tide is more known for their passing game and I don&#x27;t believe the run game to be much of a factor for them coming into this game. Alabama is 8-3-1 against the spread this season and are 9-0 in their last 9 SEC championship appearances. This game has all the makings for a down to the wire finish in what feels like a coin flip matchup.

With my second leg I have Indiana covering within 10.5 points in this clash between the 1st and 2nd ranked teams in the nation, with what really feels like a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> em matchup. This matchup features the nation&#x27;s best scoring defense (7.8 PPG allowed) against the second best scoring offenses (44.3 PPG). While the Buckeyes are favored and have a 30-game winning streak against Indiana, the Hoosiers have an elite rushing attack and I believe they can control the clock and keep the Buckeyes offense off the field to keep this game within striking distance. So far this season Indiana has performed well against the spread with a 7-5 record and I believe they will be able to cover this line as well at a neutral site that is one hour north of their home stadium in Bloomington.

League - Prem

Game: Aston Villa VS Arsenal 

Time: 7:30 pm EST

**-----------------**

Villa are currently on fire with 5 wins in a row. I see them struggling to keep constant pressure on this Arsenal side, but more than enough to see us cover here.

With Ariel demons, Saliba, Gabriel, and Mosquera out tomorrow, Arsenal will struggle to defend those dead balls into the box as well as they normally do. Don&#x27;t see Villa getting too much space in the box which will naturally force them out wide and into corner opportunities. Wingbacks will have to adjust to the changes, which will cause more errors, leading to set-piece play.

**In Villas&#x27; last 10 Prem games, they&#x27;ve averaged 5.1 corners per game with this line hitting in 8/10 games (80%).**

Friedsam is aggressive but struggled a lot against Sonmez in the last round, where she could have easily been knocked out of the tournament. I feel like there will be a lot of baseline rallies in this match and I favor Korpatsch to win this. These two faced each other in this tournament last year, with Korpatsch winning 2-0

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Over 150.5 @1.8 1u to win 0.8u

Write Up:


im on the OVER 150.5 in Purdue vs iowa State, and it makes way too much sense when you look at how these two teams actually play. Purdue’s offense is one of the cleanest in the country efficient, well-spaced, and always generating high-quality shots inside or kick-outs. They’re averaging high-80s because they don’t waste possessions, and against Iowa State’s pace they’re going to get even more opportunities than usual. Iowa State doesn’t exactly slow the game down either. They’re sitting in the mid-90s per game because they run, attack early in the clock, and force a tempo that most teams struggle to match. Add that to Purdue’s tendency to play up to the pace of aggressive teams, and you suddenly have a game that’s naturally trending toward the mid-150s without either team needing an outlier shooting night.

This matchup isn’t about whether one side clamps the other it’s about two high-powered offenses trading efficient possessions, fueled by tempo and ball movement.</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>**Record:** 30-16-1 (+12.43u) 

**Last:** (CBB) Tennessee -6.5 (1u) - L

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** No. 2 Arizona (-7.5) vs No. 20 Auburn

**Start Time:** 10:00 PM ET (ESPN)

**Odds:** -120 (FanDuel)

**Units:** 1U

**Reasoning:** You’d be hard-pressed to find a team with a better resume thus far than Arizona.

After opening the season with an impressive 93-87 victory over then-No. 3 Florida, the Wildcats (7-0) also added wins over then-No. 3 UConn (71-67) and then-No. 15 UCLA (69-65). The team was just as impressive in its other four outings, winning by an average margin of 32 points. 

Conversely, results have been all over the map for Auburn to start the season.

The Tigers (7-2) opened the season with a scare against Bethune-Cookman, needing overtime to escape with a 95-90 victory as a 24.5-point favorite. The team rebounded to taken then-No. 1 Houston to the wire in a 73-72 loss before getting flat-out embarrassed against then-No. 7 Michigan, 102-72. Since then, Auburn has seemingly turned things around, shooting 60.8% from the field (56.7% from three-point range) over its last three halves, including a 55-point second half to knock off then-No. 14 St. John’s 85-74. 

However, don’t expect that offensive prowess to continue Saturday night.

Despite ranking quite impressively thus far—27th in offensive efficiency (1.195), 35th in scoring 87.9 PPG), 43rd in field-goal percentage (49.2%) and 121st in three-point shooting (35.1%)—the Tigers have only faced two defensive units that rank Top 75 in defensive efficiency. In those two games (Houston, Michigan), the team shot a combined 44-of-120 from the field (36.7%). Look for it to be another frustrating shooting night against a stifling Arizona defensive unit that ranks 24th in defensive efficiency (0.908), 41st in scoring defense (67.0 PPGA), 56th in opponent field-goal percentage (40.5%) and 168th in opponent three-point shooting (32.7%). 

On the other end of the floor, look for the Wildcats offense to take whatever it wants.

Through seven games, the unit ranks 12th in field-goal percentage (51.8%), 33rd in offensive efficiency (1.183), 37th in scoring (87.3 PPG) and 64th in three-point shooting (37.2%). That could be a cause for concern for an Auburn defensive unit that ranks just 131st in defensive efficiency (1.012) while also ranking 79th in opponent field-goal percentage (41.5%), 153rd in opponent three-point shooting (32.4%) and 167th in scoring defense (74.4 PPGA). Look for the Wildcats to take advantage on the break, where they rank 27th in fast break points (16.3 PPG; 93rd percentile) while the Tigers rank just 202nd in opponent fast break points (11.1 PPG; 45th percentile). 

The battle on the glass should prove to be a major X factor in this one.

Arizona dominates the boards on both ends of the floor, ranking 15th in total rebounding (42.6 per game), 20th in offensive rebounding (12.6) and 26th in defensive rebounding (27.0) while ranking 3rd in opponent defensive rebounding (17.1), 15th in opponent total rebounding (29.7) and 90th in opponent offensive rebounding (8.1). Meanwhile, Auburn ranks 46th in offensive rebounding (23.9), 58th in total rebounding (39.3) and 112th in defensive rebounding (23.9) while ranking 52nd in opponent defensive rebounding (19.9), 105th in opponent total rebounding (33.7) and 243rd in opponent offensive rebounding (9.8). To add insult to injury, the Tigers struggle to defend the paint, ranking 144th in points in the paint allowed (30.9 PPG; 61st percentile). That will be a major issue against a Wildcats offense that ranks 3rd in the category (46.6 PPG, 99th percentile). 

Taking care of the ball will also be crucial for Arizona.

Thus far, the team has struggled to play clean basketball, ranking 192nd in turnovers per possession (17.4%), 199th in opponent steals (7.0 per game) and 224th in turnovers (12.9). Although Auburn ranks 51st in steals (8.6), the team only ranks 122nd in turnovers forced (13.2) and 136th in turnovers forced per possession (18.0%). This could go a long way in deciding if the Wildcats can cover the number. 

Trust Arizona to show out in front of the home crowd.

BOL if tailing, and as always please do so responsibly. One bet should NOT lead to a crash out.</td></tr>

Last POTD: 2 <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> Parlay: NBA Nuggets ML vs Hawks / CFB Boise State vs UNLV o48.5 (2.50$ TO WIN 1.91$)✅

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: CBB St. Bonaventure ML vs. Buffalo / CFB Texas Tech ML vs. BYU (2.50$ TO WIN 1.85$)**

Write up: This is not a model play FYI - this is a personal bet.

• ⁠Buffalo has put their name on the map this year because for the first time ever, they are 8-0 - they had two good wins, Depaul &amp; Vermont

• ⁠This is MID-MAJOR basketball; anything can happen of course. I believe St. Bonaventure is MILES better than UB, but because of the rivalry and them being on the road, I believe this is why the line is lower than it should be 

• Buffalo have 3 guys, Freitag being their #1, the Wisconsin transfer - if Bonaventure can hold him to less than 20 points, I believe they have a big chance of winning


• Bonaventure is deep, playing around 8-10 per game - the bench guys have come up clutch for them when they needed too, and their bench is pretty darn good for being a mid-major program - between Buddy Simmons, Frank Mitchell, Lonati, Charles, Big Joe, and Marshall, Bonaventure have the weapons to beat up on Buffalo


* I do not see anyone stopping Bonaventure&#x27;s big, Frank Mitchell, and if they do, Bonaventure has enough fire power around him to win them the game - if Bonaventure can slow Buffalo&#x27;s scorer&#x27;s down just a touch, they will roll
* The model is projecting Texas Tech to cover, so I added them as the ML 2nd leg - Bonaventure is only -4 favorites so their ML should be in the 200&#x27;s something

Let&#x27;s keep rolling.

BOL!

This is obviously risky because the Leafs are also off to a slow start, but this Flames team is very bad.  One of their two wins came against the Rangers who are absolutely woeful, and they&#x27;ve lost every road game this year by at least two goals, so -1.5 is just too juicy to pass up in this situation.  I&#x27;m going 5 Units on picks like this all the time hoping to capitalize, but if you&#x27;re worried, go 1 Unit on this and 3 on the ML at -185 in case it&#x27;s close, but the Leafs should win this game by 2.

NBA 76ers v Wizards 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: 1U Joel Embiid O4.5P 1Q @ $1.86 (-116 American odds), B365 

Write Up: With Maxey FTA line going to 7.5 up from 5.5, and Reaves/Pritchard not playing, got to look elsewhere. 

Now, I said in a previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> (with Wemby O26.5) that I felt a bit square because the line seemed too easy. This again is the case here, I feel almost silly - but also, potentially like Wemby, the books haven’t adjusted also and are being cautious with limited minutes. 

Why am I taking a prop on such an injury prone player? Yes, he is on a minutes restriction, but he played a lot better when his court time was extended, essentially on for 3x7 minute periods v the Hornets compared to 4x5 v the Celtics. This means he gets time to work into the 1st quarter even if his first couple of shots don’t fall. 

V the Hornets, he played 7 minutes in the 1st quarter, he had 6 field goal attempts - on 2 of them he was fouled and went to the FT line (going 3-4), and he went 2-4 from the field otherwise, with both FG made being 3-pointers, clearing this line with 9 points which is more of what we expect from him, compared to his first outing v the Celtics. Embiid having his 3 point shot going basically means we need 1x3 &amp; 1x free throw trip to clear this, and he’s likely to take 6-8 shots again. 
He was rested <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> with Maxey, Oubre &amp; Edgecombe averaging 40 minutes each so I’m hoping early in the piece they delegate to Embiid. 

Match-up wise, Embiid has never played on Sarr, who is a good defender with plenty of size for his age, and who can block shots. However, Embiid is a master at drawing fouls. Way back in 2022-23 when he was the best scorer in the league, he was the 2nd leading player for FTA while shooting them @ 85%, and was 3rd highest for FGM. We aren’t going to see that for 35 minutes, but I think against a player 3 games into his 2nd season, we can see that shrewd foul-baiting and FG shooting for 7 minutes. Sarr has a foul rate of 2.7 fouls per 36 minutes, so he’s definitely able to be drawn in, and he just lacks the experience of Embiid. I really think Embiid will bring his post game for 7 minutes and show Sarr how it’s done with a couple of easy fouls drawn. 

Against this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> are if Slowel Embiid shows up again like game 1 - I doubt it but it’s not impossible. If he doesn’t get good early shots he may be rested earlier in the quarter while the 76ers get their game going, as the team may be more cohesive without him right now. Maxey, Edgecombe &amp; Oubre could again play big minutes and take bulk of the usage, limiting Embiid, and also he might only take 3 pt attempts and easy enough to go 0-4 for example.</td></tr>

Munar’s been playing too well for me to see this being an easy win for Medvedev. The slower court conditions favor Munar, and he is 1-0 in the H2H. It’s hard to put too much stock in that match because of how poorly Medvedev started the season, but it was still a good win for Munar. I do think Medvedev will win though, based on his form, better serve, and just overall acumen, but I think it’ll be tight with either a (7-6, 7-5) type of match or a 3 setter.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> - Ohtani 6+ strikeouts (-200) and LA Dodgers ML (-205) | (+100) 2 units

Blue Jays @ Dodgers 22:00 EST 10/28

Ohtani is otherworldly right now. Dude just threw a shutout with 10 Ks and hit 3 dingers in the NLCS, then followed it with 2 more dingers last night in that 18-inning war. 

His confidence is obviously through the roof. Arm’s fresh, command is nasty, and he’s facing a Toronto lineup that’s been whiffing at 22.4% against lefties all postseason. He’s punched out 25 Jays in 19 career innings—11.8 K/9. 

His main line is a bit lower than I’d expect at 6.5 because I think he’ll go at least 6 innings, maybe* more with how brutal last game was on the pens. With how well he’s been pitching, six punches should be easy.

Bieber’s on the bump for Toronto and he’s been shaky: 4.38 ERA this October, coughing up 5+ hits a game, 1.32 WHIP. Dodgers are gonna get to him early and often. I’d be fucking scared if I was him after watching what Ohtani did last night.

That 18-inning marathon torched both bullpens. Dodgers used 8 arms, Jays 7. Both teams will want their starters to go deep tonight. That’s a massive edge for LA with the better pitcher who can actually go 6+ and rack Ks while doing it. Ohtani single-handedly wins games (and this bet hopefully).</td></tr>

**Net Units/ROI:** \+21.37u / +54.79%

**Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** ***GAIS to win @ 2.10 -- 2 units***✅

**Summary:** A good start of the week with the win for GAIS with a pretty decent odd, happy overall. With a 2-0 lead at HT after Diabate had another 2 goal contributions they needed to hold on in the second half. They didn&#x27;t create much themselves but managed to get it over the line.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** ***Valletta to win @ 1.66 -- 2 units***

**Write up:**

For <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> there&#x27;s lots of cup football which nearly made me skip <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> as I do not like the unpredictability of the cup matches. But then I found this match in Malta. Valletta is having a good season this year as they are second with 21 points out of 9 matches. They&#x27;ve already won against the 1st and 2nd team but drew against sides that are known to play European football in Malta. So they&#x27;ve had a difficult schedule but still managed to sit in second place.   


Now the value here is because on paper the Away team Gzira seem to be picking up form. Gzira are sitting in 8th (out of 12). This looks quite alright but I&#x27;ve looked deeper into their matches. They are currently on 9 points, with 6 of those being in the 2 most recent matches. If we look at their opponents in these matches, it are both the teams that are sitting at the bottom of the league. And even those matches weren&#x27;t won with Gzira playing well, in one of them the opponent picked up an early red card in the first half. The other match ended in 4-3... Not convincing wins at all. Against bottom of the league. If you leave those two matches out they would only be on 3 points. Not good enough to beat Valletta here I dont think. Let&#x27;s get another win on the board <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>!

Dominating performance from Brondby, ended 4-1, not one bead of sweat ran down a forehead.


**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Todays Pick</mark>:** Lecce - Napoli
**Both teams to score - YES**


**Odds:** $2.20


**Wager:** 1 Unit


**When:** 6 hours from post


**Why:**


Lecce vs Napoli suggests a cheeky both teams to score to me, if you look into the recent form. Napoli are on fire going forward, but let’s be real, their defense isn’t exactly air tight, so Lecce might sneak one past them, especially with the home “advantage” and crowd support. Lecce themselves aren’t shy about having a go, they’ve scored in most of their matches, even if they end up losing most of them. So, you’ve got the perfect mix, an attacking Napoli who’ll likely (hopefully) leave gaps, due to attacking focus, and a scrappy Lecce side that loves to poke the giants and maybe make it look dramatic. Basically, expect goals, a bit of chaos, and maybe someone flinging a few cheeky comments in excitement if it hits, both teams to score is the fun and value play, not to mention the stats of these teams back this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. Dont forget the nice odds, which does tell you, this isn&#x27;t the expected outcome, so be aware, but i like it for my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>potd</mark> nonetheless. </td></tr>

The win streak stays hot with a plus money winner. Script played out well in the first half. Maxey was able to create his own shots while Suggs was on the bench. He didn’t shoot as efficient as I imagined but I knew he was going to attempt enough shots which he converted into 3 deep ones before halftime.

2nd half Maxey focused his offense primarily on driving to the basket and facilitating but we ultimately got the money deep ball late in the 4th Q.

NBA | NY Knicks @ MIL Bucks | 8PM EST

Next <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **Jalen Brunson Over 27.5 Pts** (-102 on Fanduel) Bet 2.5u to Win 2.45u

Currently this season Brunson is shooting at high frequency 68% FG, 30 PPG (2.8 above the line). Last 3 games: 23, 31, 37 pts.

Bucks defense is in the vulnerable column against guards. They’re 17th defending PG’s with a 112 DRTG. Allowing 118 PPG overall (14th worst in NBA). Their 3PT defense is at 37% allowed (19th). Plus they’re missing Kevin Porter and Cole Anthony is questionable for defending assignments. If KAT is out (which is very possible) another plus as that correlates to more usage for Brunson **This is the perfect storm for a guard to go off.** but there’s more

Brunson recent matchup (hit rate) history vs Bucks: 44 pts ✓ | 15 pts ✗ | 43 pts ✓ | 38 pts ✓ | 36 pts ✓ | 24 pts ✗ | 45 pts ✓

Last 7 games averaging 35 PPG with a 5/7 hit rate (71%). **That’s not a coincidence - Brunson owns the Bucks.**

The icing on the cake is that Brunson is currently averaging 8.7 FTA per game this season (up from 6.9 last year) at 92% accuracy. **Even if he’s cold at his shooting he will get to the line and convert some points either way.**

I wouldn’t be surprised if line move on this one, I was surprised to see this at nearly plus money odds at that.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Brentford ML vs Grimsby + Sporting ML vs Alverca @ 1.77 - 1 unit

Write Up: Let&#x27;s continue with the &quot;obvious&quot; picks, no juice. We&#x27;re just here to build a bankroll, right? Brentford is a mid table premier league who recently defeated Liverpool, West Ham and Man Utd (and only lost 1-0 to Man City). Grimsby can be tough but they are still a league two team.

Sporting are playing at home and are in second place in the table with 7W 1D 1L while Alverca is a mid team with 3W 1D 5L.

Like with most of my picks, these teams **should** win, but sometimes these matches can be unpredictable. I still think it&#x27;s best to go with what I think **probably** will happen.

**Extra:** with the same logic of &quot;should win&quot; you can also get Napoli ML at 1.59. They are at the top of the table with 6W 0D 2L playing against Lecce with 1W 3D 4L.</td></tr>

Had to take the day off due to another agonising loss. We were cruising here and a late goal before the half wasn&#x27;t ideal but was still fine to manage. 

Copping a 76th minute goal and finally a 96th last minute winner was pretty heartbreaking as analysis was pretty spot on but the execution from Brisbane just faltered in the final minutes, making it a 4 out of 5 extremely close losses.

Australia will travel to England for a friendly international after only defeating much weaker opposition in Wales 2-1. For comparison, England beat Wales 6-1 at the Euro&#x27;s in July and went on to win the tournament proving they are one of the footballing powerhouses of the world.

Once upon a time the Matildas were a force to be reckoned with but they have faded somewhat from those years. They still have some big names in players like Sam Kerr, Steph Catley, Caitlin Foord etc.

They have been facing a lot easier competition in Panama, Wales, and Slovenia with mixed results as England have enjoyed wins against world class opposition in Spain, Italy, and Sweden at the Euro&#x27;s.

Although coming off the back of a loss to Brazil, I still see this England team having way too much quality with huge notable names across the pitch. 

Given the home advantage, and the competitive nature of the fixture, I’d back the Lionesses to bounce back and put a few past the Matildas.

Recap: Wow what a game. In the beginning everything was going well for the Jazz while absolutely nothing was landing for the Suns. But the Suns are full of streaky players, Booker, Allen, and Williams all putting in their effort in making it a close game. In the fourth quarter the Jazz were up by 10 and I had turned the game off, after I came back to check, it was in overtime and I decided to double down on the Jazz. Keyonte George and lauri markkanen both had amazing games with Lauri dropping his first 50+ game. All-in-all the game was way closer than it should’ve been and closer than what I thought it was going to be.



Game: Hornets @ Heat 7:00pm EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Lamelo Ball o7 Rbs, +151, 1u-&gt; 2.51u

Reasoning: The Hornets and the Heat have both been very high rebounding teams this season but for differing reasons. Lamelo Ball has been a very good rebounder for the Hornets as his tracking of long range balls and defensive rebounds have been very good. He’s the second best rebounding guard in the league. Bam Adebayo is the leading rebounder for the Heat and their rebounds are relatively disjoint so they shouldn’t share many rebounds together.</td></tr>

<tr><td class='post'>**POTD Record 36-33-1**

Easy easy dub. Cavs came out hot, and game went even better in our favor than I expected. Feeling momentum this NBA season, as I am already up almost 10 units personally so far this season, while being 2-1 on my POTDs. I am seeing the board right now, and feel a streak on its way. 

One of the benifits of being 6 hours behind the east coast, is that I get to stare at lines, re watch games on league pass and hammer early lines all while being in bed before 9pm. Tonight, while i was going through my normal routine, this game just jumped out at me, and went ahead and bet it and figured I may as well share it with everyone on here. I&#x27;m fading a team I bet several days ago.

**Miami Heat - 6**

Okay, so Miami’s roster is extremely balanced offensively. In the young season the Heat already feature seven players averaging double‑digit points: Norman Powell (24), Bam (19), Jaime Jaquez (15), Fontecchio (13),  Wiggins (12), Jovic (11) and Kel’el Ware (10). That depth means Miami can roll out many different scoring options and defenders can’t key on just one or two players. On the other side, Charlotte currently relies heavily on a few stars. LaMelo Ball is leading the Hornets with 28PPG and 10APG, and Miles Bridges adds about 20PPG himself. Beyond those two, Charlotte’s bench production is spotty. Without additional reliable scorers, Miami’s more even attack should exploit the Hornets’ defensive rotations. I am not going to lie i really love Kon Knueppel. Sexton and Kalkbrenner are also really good palyers, but outside of them and Bridges, I really don&#x27;t think anyone else is to worry about tomorrow.

Erik Spoelstra remains one of the NBA’s top coaches. In a recent NBA GM poll he was voted the league’s “best head coach” by a wide margin, highlighting his ability to get the most out of role players and game plans. Spoelstra’s Heat culture, which emphasizes team play, defense, and conditioning, helps a deep roster click together. Contrast that with Charlotte’s situation.... Despite improvements, and a team I am generally hight on this season, the Hornets are still a work in progress. In this matchup Miller will be out so Charlotte is already hamstrung. Spoelstra’s track record suggests Miami will have a large tactical edge to exploit their weaknesses. 

Losing Miller’s scoring and playmaking forces Charlotte to lean even harder on Ball and Bridges. In addition, Charlotte just finished a road trip and has only one day off for travel. This one day of travel in a city like Miami, really catches my attention. I am not usually someone who bets based off of hypotheticals, however I already like Miami in this matchup based on how they have looked so far, but I also really like fading a young team traveling to Miami with a rest day in between. Specifically a young team like Charlotte, whose 2 best players are young guys who have been known to be labeled by media as immature. I am in no way shape or form making a character judgement on these two players (I think Ball has really made a jump in his professionalism personally, and Bridges seems to have his shit together minus the suspension awhile back) but rather just stating it is normal for young multi millionaires to enjoy themselves in a city like Miami, with a day of rest in between. 

Okay back to basketball. Miami’s bench  is a huge piece to this play. On recent box scores, reserve players like Jovic and Ware are contributing double figures (Jovic started one game, and ware started 2), and solid role players like Jaquez, Fontecchio, Jose Alvarado, Dru Smith and honestly a few others (Larsson gets buckets when he plays) are providing defense and occasional scoring. By contrast, even with Charlotte’s offseason bench upgrades, there’s still a drop‑off. This year’s bench is better on paper, but the Heat’s bench should still outplay it, by a large margin. 

Miami’s multi-pronged attack and excellent coaching give them a clear efficiency advantage, while Charlotte will more than likely scramble without Miller. The Heat outscore opponents by a large margin (they averaged 127PPG in three games so far and rarely rely on any single player to carry the load. 

PS: also bet Philly -5.5 tomorrow. I know every gave me major shit for the shaq comparison to embiid (I WAS BEING DRAMATIC), however my other angle in that play was that I did not think Edgecombe could sustain what he did in the first game, but oh boy was I wrong. This guy is legit. Also Wash is IMO one of the worst teams in the league.</td></tr>

 -3 units 

Sport | NCAAF - 8:00pm EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Wayne Knight OVER 64.5 rushing yards (-112 FanDuel) 3 units

Write Up: Wayne Knight over 64.5 rushing yards against Texas State was one of the more shocking lines on  Tuesday&#x27;s slate. Knight has cleared the 64.5 yard threshold in 6 of 7 games this year posting 151 (Georgia Southern), 111 (Louisiana), 89 (Weber State &amp; Liberty), 85 (Georgia State), 74 (Old Dominion) and 12 (on 5 carries against Louisville). Knight leads the Dukes with 611 rushing yards, averaging over 120 yards per game, making the 64.5 line appear quite generous.

The matchup couldn&#x27;t be better for Knight&#x27;s continued success. Texas State&#x27;s defense ranks 97th in the nation in rushing defense, allowing 162.7 yards per game, while JMU boasts the 8th ranked rushing attack in the country. I watched Robert Henry Jr. and UTSA run all over Texas St a few weeks back posting 17 carries for 159 and 2 touchdowns (RHJ). I am fully expecting a similar showing out of Knight and this JMU squad. 

Being on the east coast myself with some wind and rain I ended up checking the weather chances for both games. Kennesaw could see some late rain so it made my decision even easier. San Marcos will be pleasant in the low 50s, however wind gusts are expected to reach 28-35 mph throughout the game. This could induce an even larger workload for Wayne. With everything pointing to Knight having another big day and I think we have a high chance to surpass 64.5 yards.

Expected outcome: Wayne Knight 19 carries, 126 yards, and 1 touchdown</td></tr>

Paris, Round 1, 5:30AM MST 10/28

Hornets @ Heat 5:30PM MST 10/28

Fonseca is looking very good coming off of a finals win at Basel where he dropped only one set in total. Fatigue will not be a factor here as he had 3 straight sets victories, a walkover, and not even a complete 3 setter win vs shapovalov who retired in the 3rd set down 4-1.

He plays Shapovalov again now in the first round of the Paris Masters. Shapovalov is a head case who, seemingly, basically rage quit in their Basel match. That’s not a good sign for the rematch just days later. He also had 9 double faults and was losing it with errors at the end before retiring. He may hampered by something physically (there was some mention of back issues), but certainly mentally and either way that’s an advantage for Jao who should beat him again either way.

Lamelo averaging 9.7 assists per game with no less than 8 in each game so far. Cleared 7 assists in all 4 games vs the Heat last season. 7/8 clear rate in last 8 vs Heat. Heat allowing 7th most assists to point guards this season at 9.16, albeit small sample size. I have little doubt he will hit 7. That’s all I’ll say.</td></tr>

Josh Hart over 11.5 RA +100(Hard Rock Bet) 2.5U

I love this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> against the bucks as they have let hart clear this line in 5 straight. Hart himself has gotten 17 and 10 RA’s the first two games and went from 19 minutes to 29 the second game so I expect 30 plus. The bucks have let guards/forwards eat on the glass giving up the 12th most to forwards and 5th most to two guards. Hart plays 2-4 when he’s out there so that bodes we’ll for his rebounds and he’s one of the best at his position. For the assists he’s been able to collect 5 and 3 with limited minutes so I at least expect 3 and his rebounds sit at over 6.5 at (-155) while the assists are at 3.5 at (-175 so I love taking a stab at RA at plus money at 11.5. I’ll also be placing a unit on a double double at +450 as he has done it the last two times he’s played them and finished with 9 boards the other two times. BOL!!</td></tr>

**Units:** 2

**Record:** 0-0

Shapovalov +1.5 games is my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick of the day</mark>. While Fonseca’s rise has been impressive, this line undervalues Shapovalov’s recent form and experience. He’s been showing flashes of his top-20 level again—serving big, dictating points, and cleaning up his unforced errors. He also has a 9-2 record on indoor hard courts which makes me think the match will be competitive. Fonseca’s raw athleticism and power can cause problems, but over a full match, Shapo’s lefty serve and variety should keep him in every set. Even if Fonseca takes one, the +1.5 spread provides strong coverage given Shapo’s ability to hold serve and force tight sets. At -120, this number has solid value on a player who’s rediscovering his rhythm and competing hard on tour again. Fonseca is also coming off a title win in Basel so fatigue could play a factor especially due to it being near the end of the season. Good luck!</td></tr>

**Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>** - Marcus Mariota 25+ rushing yards + Rashee Rice ATTD -187 and -105 = +200 (5u) 💰

Nice to win my first <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. The crazy amount of red zone targets and targets per route run from Rice’s debut last week, along with Washington’s major struggles against slot receivers, made the ATTD an appealing option despite the inherent high variance. I don’t usually go for ATTD for a WR, but the stats told me it was a very good idea here. Took until the 4th quarter, but it happened. Mariota scrambled quite a bit as I predicted, and the Chiefs rush yards allowed to QBs track record proved to be a successful indicator. 

I started off with a +200 <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> and I’m going to go right back to another +200 <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> now. Why not eh.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>** - Jaume Munar ML vs Daniil Medvedev (+200) 2 units

**Paris 7:10AM EST**

I like this based on value for a few reasons. 

Munar is having his best year on hard courts, and has done well on indoor hard (6-2). He performed great in Basel, beating Shelton and FAA — top players known for their prowess on the surface. He was also very good in Shanghai earlier this month.

The courts in Paris are reportedly playing slow which I think should be an advantage for Munar. Munar is a clay specialist foremost, and slower hard courts can feel closer to clay and are favorable for him. 

Munar defeated Medvedev earlier this year in Miami which is one of the slower hard court tournaments on circuit as well. This was during a relative slump for Medvedev, and I don’t expect another easy two set win for Munar, but it demonstrates that he can defeat him on hard courts. 

Medvedev is notorious for his disdain for slow-playing hard courts. He’s called them a disgrace in the past, and his game is generally better suited to faster courts. He has a poor record in Paris too, never having advanced past the 2nd round of this tournament.

Medvedev has played pretty well in the past month, so I’ll only go with 2 units on this, but the value is there.</td></tr>

Bridges is over this line in 2 of 3 games this season. He’s been shooting efficiently and in Mike Brown’s system he has higher usage and more offense flowing through him. Forwards have found success against the Bucks this season, going over their lines more often than not. With KAT remaining questionable and the game expected to be close, I’ll back the in-form Bridges to cover this relatively modest line.

**Writeup:**

* B8 are now 2-0 and look fantastic so far this tournament, beating two of the heavier hitters on paper in Astralis and 3DMAX in clean fashion with a 4-0 record overall.
* paiN have had a lighter schedule overall but beat a slumping GM 2-0 and GamerLegion in a relatively close 2-1 where they showed a lot of heard after losing their own map <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> and surviving being 10-2 down against paiN.
* paiN are projected to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> their map first/start off the veto. Both teams have had consistent perma bans so should be a very straight forward veto, paIN ban Train, B8 ban Nuke, paiN <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> Inferno/Dust 2 and B8 <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> Mirage which would be map 2.
* B8 are one of the best Mirage teams in the entire world, despite being a tier two team they have consistently showed how deep/good they are at this map. Their stats speak for themselves which will show below.
* Overall paiN aren&#x27;t a BAD mirage team, they have had moments of being very good/strong on the map overall, but I think they are just wildly inconsistent on the map, especially since picking up DGT, which is shown with recent losses on the map to FUT and Virtus Pro, they beat GM 13-10, but GM are 20% winrate on Mirage

**Mirage Stats:**

* paiN are 50% winrate on 6 maps of Mirage, 13-13 record in 2025 on the map
* B8 are 80% winrate on 10 maps of Mirage, 40-12 record in 2025 on the map
* B8 are on a 4 map winstreak and have won 8 of their last 10, despite being a tier two team, they have beaten some huge names on Mirage recently including Astralis, FaZe, FURIA, and G2. Similarly when they played GM on Mirage (the team paiN won 13-10 against), they won it 13-3
* Overall keep it simple, NPL is an absolute monster on Mirage, best player in the series on his best map</td></tr>

Tennis | Charlottesville Challenger | 6:00 PM EST (estimated)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Rafael Jódar vs Murphy Cassone | **Jódar to win 2-0 at +125. 1 unit.** 

Write-up: I felt like that was a solid <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, as Zahraj closed at -215. The first set was pretty up-and-down, as Zahraj had to fend off a set point on his serve, but he ended up closing it out and then winning the second in fairly straightforward fashion.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>, I&#x27;m going with Rafael Jodar to take down Murphy Cassone in straight sets. Jodar is probably the strongest college tennis player right now, and has already improved his ranking to the point where making Australian Open qualifying is all but guaranteed, leading many to suspect that he may not return to Virginia in the spring. Even with AO qualies locked in, Jodar still has plenty of reason to improve his ranking right now and try to sneak into some ATP events next year. 

This summer, Rafa has already captured two Challenger titles (including one indoors) and made an additional two semifinals. He should be intimately familiar with the setting, as this tournament is actually hosted at Virginia&#x27;s tennis facility, and I have no doubts that he&#x27;ll attract the bulk of the crowd support. I feel that his game suits indoor conditions very well, as he plays with quite an aggressive style and loves to dominate with the forehand.

Meanwhile, Murphy Cassone, another former college standout, isn&#x27;t coming into this tournament with nearly as much confidence. He had a decent start to the year, but his form has dipped dramatically, with his most recent match being a concerning straight-sets loss to Mats Rosenkranz in Sioux Falls (5.43 performance rating). I honestly don&#x27;t view Cassone as having a very high ceiling game - he doesn&#x27;t do anything particularly poorly, but also doesn&#x27;t really have weapons at this level. He&#x27;s comfortable enough indoors, but his recent performances simply have not been confidence-inspiring. Jodar was recently priced around the same odds against Patrick Kypson in Sioux Falls, but there&#x27;s a pretty big gap in form between Kypson and Cassone right now, making me feel that these odds are a bit mispriced. Sure, Rafa lost that match (6.17 performance rating), but that shouldn&#x27;t be such a big factor in how the market is pricing this match. 

For all of those reasons, I like Jodar to take care of this one in straight sets at plus money.

SUMMARY = These games took a lot of time to research and decide on my parlay. Copa Del Rey round one&#x27;s always have some mismatches. Let&#x27;s talk about Sociedad first. I took Under 8 goals Total for the value of it. Sociedad are having a bad season and currently sit 17th in La Liga. They are having an alright season when it comes to home games winning 2 and drawing 1 but when it comes to away form they aren&#x27;t doing well at all. They have lost 3 and drawn 2. Playing away against Negreira I do expect them to win but I don&#x27;t think their form has shown any reason to think by more than 7. Personally i think it&#x27;ll be 4-0. Playing on a worse pitch than they are used to, without their home support and while being in bad form it will be tough for them. 

Now onto Sevilla. Sevilla to win by 3 or more goals against a team from the 5th division of Spanish football is more than possible with the form Sevilla are in. Having a pretty decent season so far with the highlight by far being 4-1 against Barcelona. They are averaging 1.7 goals per game in La Liga. You might think Sevilla away would be similar to Sociedad having struggles and when it comes to the pitch this would be correct but when it comes to the league. If the league was just based on away games, Sevilla would sit in 4th. That&#x27;s a big difference from 11th so their away form is great, winning 3 out of 5 games. I think Sevilla will easily clear this line.</td></tr>

Event: Serie A ⚽️

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Lecce +3 corner handicap vs Napoli 4U @ 1.83 (Bet365)

Write-up: To the Arsenal 1-0 and a really good win for them in the title race especially with Liverpool and City losing to retain that top spot 4 points clear. It’s early days but could this finally be their year? It’s not the prettiest football but is undeniably effective and limiting a giants slayer like Palace to just 1 SOT is impressive and has been the tale of their season. Time will tell. Anyways on the cards front not only did Crystal Palace not get carded but there were simply no bookings all match. Mr. Bramall once again proving to be extremely lenient on them as one or two challenges could’ve definitely be sanctioned but I’m definitely not complaining.

Napoli are sitting at the top of the league but it’s pretty close with just 3 points separating them from fourth to Inter Milan. They secured a big win against the Nerazzurri, needing to bounce back from their hefty 6-2 defeat against PSV mid-week. Lecce meanwhile sit just above the relegation zone in 16th counting just one win all season. Their goal this season will be to survive the drop once again having avoided relegation by the skin of their teeth last season. On the corners front, Lecce has averaged 5.3 corners and conceded 5 at home whilst Napoli has averaged 4 corners and conceded 4.6 on the road. In terms of playing styles that may alter the numbers, Lecce have been playing with width since appointing Di Francesco with crossing being a key part of their playing style - leading to more corners. Meanwhile Napoli like to control possession and attack through the middle which leads to less corners, especially with KDB’s absence which will lead to a big loss in creativity. Nevertheless I apply some pressure on Lecce’s numbers as Napoli are simply the better team. Using all factors I get a mean of 5 corners for Lecce and 4.5 for Napoli.

That gives this play an estimated 83% of winning which is exceptional value as I literally predict Lecce to have more corners (though the margins are tight). In fact, last season in this exact fixture the Giallorossi had 5 corners to Napoli’s 2 to crush the line. BOL !

ATP Paris: Ben Shelton vs Cobolli: Cobolli ML@1.85 ( i got it at 2.1 but the line is dropping fast)

I’m going back to Cobolli here after he cashed for us in straights. These Paris courts are playing way slower than anyone expected,  the ball grips, rallies extend, and flat hitters are really struggling to hit through the court. That hurts a guy like Shelton way more than Cobolli.

Shelton still hasn’t looked right since the shoulder injury at the US Open. His serve doesn’t have the same pop and he’s been off-rhythm in rallies. he scraped by Majchrzak, then got handled easily by Munar and didnt look like he is at 100%. On a fast indoor court maybe the market makes sense, but here? Totally different story.

Cobolli’s game just fits better right now: great defense, makes a ton of balls, and forces opponents to overhit. He just beat Machac again playing confident, clean tennis and even pushed Sinner hard for a set. Momentum’s on his side.

Given the surface, the matchup, and Shelton’s form, I honestly think this should be closer in favor of Cobolli. The market opened with 2.2 for Cobolli and it keeps dropping. With long rallies expected and Shelton still rusty, Cobolli has a real shot to grind this out.

Energie Cottbus vs RB Leipzig

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> : Leipzig -1.5 @1.65 for 4u

Leipzig is a Bundesliga team and they are playing against a third-division club and should win by a huge margin. Leipzig are third in the Bundesliga and have been in amazing form with seven straight matches without a loss since losing to Bayern on the opening day, and they just destroyed Augsburg 6-0 last Saturday showing how dangerous their attack is. They have an incredible record in the German Cup against lower-league teams, winning their last 15 cup matches against teams from lower divisions, which means they always take these games seriously and win by big scores. Energie Cottbus are only a 3. Liga team who are the leaders of the third division but the quality gap between them and a Champions League team like Leipzig is absolutely massive. Cottbus have not made it past the second round of the cup in their last 11 tries, showing they always struggle when facing better teams.

__Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:__ [✅ Rashee Rice o6.5 rec (+125), 3u](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/s/FlQygVzdkm)

__Event:__ NCAAF: UTEP @ Kennesaw St 8pm EST

__POTD:__ Kennesaw St -9.5 (-120 FD), 3.6u to win 3u

__Write Up:__ Starting off by saying I went back &amp; watched every game for both teams. I will be at this game as Kennesaw St is my Alma Mater &amp; I live closeby, although I’ve been a lifelong Georgia Tech fan. __It’ll be a packed house at Fifth Third Stadium as Kennesaw St has a chance to get their 6th win &amp; become Bowl Eligible for the FIRST time in program history. This is the biggest game ever for KSU football.__ It’s the last week we get Tuesday/Wednesday football action so I figured I’d fire up a writeup. Tuesday we have UTEP (2-5, 1-2 CUSA) traveling to Kennesaw St (5-2, 3-0 CUSA). __KSU is coming off a 45-26 road win over FIU, extending their 5 game win streak.__ They are 1st in the CUSA right now &amp; are coming in hot. Let’s take a look at their last 5 games including each teams Sagarin rating (my most trusted analytical CFB &amp; CBB rankings I’ve used for years). Starting with the most recent game: 

Kennesaw St’s Sagarin Rating #107:

W21 @ FIU - #149

W28 vs LA Tech - #103

W8 vs MTSU - #171

W7 vs Ark St - #108

W14 vs Merrimack - #225

KSU had dominant 20+ point wins in their last 2 games. LA Tech is a good team who is Sag ranked 45 spots better than UTEP at #103. FIU is ranked #149 which is right next to UTEP who is ranked #148. __Let’s take a look at UTEP who has lost 4 of their last 5 games:__

UTEP Sagarin Rating #148:

W18 @ Sam Houston - #207

L11 vs Liberty - #120

L19 vs LA Tech - #103

L6 LA Monroe - #160 

L17 Texas - #9

UTEP’s only win came against an 0-7 Sam Houston. __But the biggest takeaway is UTEP lost by 19 to LA Tech. Kennesaw State beat that same LA Tech team by 28 the very next week. Sagarin’s analytical predictions has KSU winning this one 33-16.__ Having said all that, rankings aren’t everything. I just wanted to give background on these 2 virtually unknown teams.

Mitch Militello is in his 1st season as the Offensive Coordinator &amp; QB coach at Kennesaw State. Militello came to KSU, reuniting with head coach Jerry Mack, after 4 seasons on the offensive staff at Tennessee working closely under UT’s HC Josh Heupel, specifically with Vols’ QB’s. Last year’s horrible KSU team ran an option offense. Militello came in &amp; immediately made an impact. implementing a Veer &amp; Shoot offense. __KSU’s has their #1 offense in CUSA in EPA, the only one with a positive EPA. This new offense ranks 44th nationally in EPA &amp; 27th nationally in EPA/Pass.__ Their offense very balanced with the pass &amp; run, as evident in last week’s win where they produced 284 passing yards &amp; 214 rushing yards They were on fire averaging 5.2 yards per carry &amp; a whopping 16.7 yards per pass. Their offense is led by Wofford transfer Amari Odom. __Odom is a dual threat QB who ranks Top 10 in the NCAA in Completion percentage (70.8%). Odom is the best QB in CUSA with the highest QB Rating (69.1) &amp; the 43rd ranked in the NCAA.__ Odom has excelled in the Veer &amp; Shoot offense with 5 pass TD’s &amp; 3 rush TD’s on just 1 INT this year. Odom popped up on the injury report this week &amp; is considered day to day. Ever if he can’t go Tuesday night, they won&#x27;t miss a beat with Senior dual-threat QB Dexter Williams under center. Dexter Williams has also been solid in substantial playing time, completing with 605 yards, 5 TD’s &amp; 1 INT, while also adding two scores on the ground. A lot of their offensive success is due to a great offensive line. __KSU’s OLine has only given up 1.2 sacks per game, 22nd best in the NCAA.__ Out at WR they are led by 2 Senior studs. They have a lightning speed guy in Senior Gabriel Bernard. __Bernard has the most receiving yards in all of CUSA (495 yds).__ They also have a 6-3 monster in Christian Moss who’s averaging 15.9 yards per catch. They face a UTEP defense that refuses to get turnovers. __UTEP’s defense ranks T126th among FBS teams for INT’s this season with only 2. They are -8 in turnover margin 130th.__ They also can’t get any stops on 3rd down. __UTEP ranks 129th among FBS teams for 3rd down conversion percentage this season (31.4).__ Their defense struggles majorly against the pass. __UTSA ranks 120th in EPA/Pass allowed.__ KSU wins in the trenches &amp; this team’s balanced offense that has scored 27 points in 4 of their last 5 games against better defense is going to keep it going this week. KSU’s defense has been hot as well.

UTEP saw success against a brutal Sam Houston State defense last week, but I don’t expect that to continue against a stout Kennesaw State defense. __If you take away the outlier game where KSU played an unfair game vs Indiana, they have allowed just 15.5 points per game. That would rank 11th in the NCAA. On the season, UTEP averages 21.0 points per game, ranking around 122nd nationally.__ They are one of the worst offenses in the country. __UTEP’s offense ranking 133rd out of 136 in EPA offense. They have 9 turnovers in their past 3 games (worst in NCAA).__ This is an offense that can’t pass or run the ball. __UTEP’s 1.8 INT’s per game is the worst in the NCAA. Their 5.9 passing yards per game is the 129th in NCAA. Their 3.1 yards per rush is 127th in NCAA.__ They also can’t convert on third downs. __They only convert 30.43% of their 3rd down plays.__ They did make the change to QB Skylar Locklear 2 games ago. He did decent last week vs an 0-7 Sam Houston. But he already has 4 INT’s in just 9 quarters with just 3 TD’s. The week before he only had 9 completions for 90 yards. UTEP’s new offensive coordinator Mark Cala is not doing well in his first coordinator role. I’m running out of room, just know UTSA offense = bad. KSU defense = good

KSU #1 in CUSA in EPA (59th in NCAA) &amp; is the only team in CUSA with a + EPA margin (+0.037). UTEP is 2nd worst in EPA in CUSA, #131 in NCAA (-0.319). __KSU has covered 4 straight games, and the Owls seem to be getting better with each passing week.__

KSU gets the biggest win in program history becoming bowl eligible and covers. 

__Kennesaw State -9.5__

Last Five Predictions (Old - New): ✅❌✅✅❌

Net Units: +19.88

Yesterday&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Moreirense v Porto. Porto (-1.0 &amp;-1.5) Asian Handicap. 3u @ $1.54 ❌ /✅ 

Lost half the initial stake as the first bet (-1) pushed, and the other (-1.5) lost. Unsure exactly how to write that on the ledger, but counting it as a loss because I walked away with less money than I put in. 

Porto dominated possession but didn&#x27;t create that many chances from it. Moreirense scored within 20 minutes, which wasn&#x27;t ideal. Porto equalised just before halftime. 

In the second half, Porto dominated again, but didn&#x27;t get the winner until the 88th minute. From there, it was unlikely they&#x27;d push the issue for a third. 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Thun v Winterthur. Thun (-1.0 &amp;-1.5) Asian Handicap. 3u @ $1.87

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Going with the Asian Hanidap again on Thun. 

Newly promoted, but currently in first place, Thun hosts last-place Winterthur in the Swiss Super League. 

The Swiss Super League has started tight, with every team losing at least two of their opening ten games. Thun&#x27;s two losses so far have been to Young Boys and Basel, who are two of the best teams in the league. 

Thun&#x27;s two goals a game is the second-best in the league, and their 1.3 goals against are the third-best in the league. 

While I don&#x27;t expect them to win the league in their first season back in the top flight, they&#x27;ve looked good so far. 

Meanwhile, Winterthur are 0-1-4 in their five away games in the league, copping seventeen goals in those games. In fact, in Winterthur&#x27;s ten league games, they&#x27;ve conceded 30 goals, which is the worst in the league by 11 goals.

I like Thun at home in this match. </td></tr>

Cash it! Cruised through the first 2 rounds and Cannonier didn&#x27;t do enough for a 10-8 in the third. Lets go!


**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Julius Randle over 3.5 free throw attempts (BET365 1.74 odds)**

NBA: MIN Timberwolves vs LA Lakers

I absolutely love this line.

In 3 regular season games last year, Randle had 7, 4 and 8 free throw attempts. The 4 attempts was in a blowout game where he just played 24 mins. 


In the 5 game series in the first round vs the Lakers of last year&#x27;s playoffs. Randle played very well and his free throw attempts were 1, 9, 10, 4 and 7. Game 1 was his worst game of the series where he had just 16 pts.

He also had 4 attempts in game 1 of the year vs Portland who definitely has more bodies to throw at Randle than the Lakers do.

There is no match up that I like for the Lakers. LeBron probably played him the best in the playoffs, but Randle still went off. Rui, Vando or any other Laker as very little chance of guarding him.

Let&#x27;s hope he stays out of foul trouble and the game remains competitive.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Todays Pick</mark>:** Leeds United - West Ham 
**BTTS - Yes**


**Odds:** $1.95


**Wager:** 1 unit 


**When:** 6 hours from post


**Why:**


Both teams to score in Leeds vs West Ham makes a lot of sense when you look at how they’ve been playing lately. Leeds are strong going forward at home and usually manage to create a few clear chances, but they’re also not exactly watertight at the back. West Ham however, have enough attacking quality to take advantage of that, and their defence has been shaky all season.


Two struggling teams, not sitting in a good spot on the table but usually have they attacking power to find an opportunity. Both teams are experiencing many BTTS matches. With Leeds at 15/20 and West ham at 10/15 having both teams score in them. Stat wise it tells us this is likely to happen.


It’s one of those games where both sides are desperate for a result, and that usually leads to an open, scrappy match with mistakes and goals at both ends. Leeds should find the net with their energy and pressing, and West Ham always seem to nick one through a counter or set piece.


In short, neither team looks capable of keeping a clean sheet, but both have the firepower to score. Seems like a pretty fair bet for both teams to get on the board in this one.</td></tr>

Another day, another Moist Conflict! Bad day yesterday, most teams that were supposed to win didn’t match the expectations but that&#x27;s ok, we keep going.



<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the day</mark> for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> is a combo at odds 2.05


<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s combo bet brings together two solid picks with strong data and context behind them. We&#x27;re backing Heerenveen to avoid defeat while seeing goals against NAC Breda at 1.45, and combining that with over 2.5 goals in the massive Saudi derby between Al Ittihad and Al Hilal at 1.42, giving us combined odds of 2.05. 

Starting with the Eredivisie clash at the Abe Lenstra Stadion, Heerenveen comes into this match in impressive form, particularly at home where they&#x27;ve been nearly unbeatable this season. The stats tell a clear story here. Heerenveen has lost just once at home this campaign, giving them a remarkable 6.7% home loss rate, one of the best in their club&#x27;s history. They&#x27;ve secured two wins, two draws and just that single defeat in five home matches this season, averaging 1.8 goals scored while conceding 1.6 per game at home. The head-to-head record heavily favors the hosts as well, with Heerenveen winning 10 out of 16 previous meetings against NAC Breda, including their last four consecutive victories. In recent form, Heerenveen has won their last two matches and sits comfortably in 11th place with 12 points from nine games.

Now, NAC Breda shouldn&#x27;t be completely dismissed here. They&#x27;ve actually shown some improvement lately, particularly in their attacking output, having scored in several recent matches and showing better finishing. Sydney van Hooijdonk has been their main threat with four goals, and they&#x27;ve managed to find the net in most away games this season. However, their away form remains a concern, with zero wins in their last four road trips and just one point collected from four away matches overall this season. They currently sit 14th in the table with only eight points, and while they can score, they&#x27;ve also conceded 16 goals in nine matches.

The goals angle looks solid too. Both teams have been involved in high-scoring affairs this season. Heerenveen&#x27;s matches have seen over 2.5 goals in 80% of their home games, with both teams scoring in all five home fixtures. NAC Breda&#x27;s away matches have produced over 1.5 goals in 100% of games, though they struggle defensively on the road. Given Heerenveen&#x27;s attacking prowess at home averaging nearly two goals per game, combined with NAC Breda&#x27;s ability to find the net but also their defensive fragility, expecting at least two goals in this match is very reasonable. The double chance covering Heerenveen win or draw protects us against an upset while the over 1.5 goals complements the attacking nature of both sides.








Moving to Saudi Arabia, we have one of the biggest fixtures in Asian football as Al Ittihad hosts Al Hilal in what promises to be an explosive encounter. The head-to-head history between these giants is packed with goals. In their last 34 meetings, a combined 108 goals have been scored, averaging over 3 goals per match. Al Hilal dominates this rivalry with 20 wins compared to Al Ittihad&#x27;s six, but crucially, 80% of recent matches between them have produced over 2.5 goals, and 65% have seen both teams score.

Al Hilal comes into this match in sensational scoring form. They&#x27;re averaging three goals per game this season in the Saudi Pro League, having netted 15 goals in just five matches. In their last five games across all competitions, they&#x27;ve been absolutely ruthless going forward, with recent results including 5-0 against Al Ettifaq, 3-1 against Al Akhdoud, and 2-2 against Al Qadisiyah. Their away form is particularly strong with four goals per match on the road, and they&#x27;ve scored in every single game this season without fail. With 80% of their matches producing over 2.5 goals and 60% seeing both teams score, Al Hilal brings serious firepower to every fixture.

Al Ittihad&#x27;s situation is interesting. While they&#x27;re currently sixth in the table with 10 points, they&#x27;ve actually been scoring well themselves, averaging 2.2 goals per match this season. However, they&#x27;ve been experiencing significant defensive issues, which even led to the sacking of manager Laurent Blanc after a 2-0 home defeat to Al Nassr just recently. Blanc had openly admitted before his dismissal that he was dealing with serious defensive problems, particularly due to injuries in the back line. They&#x27;ve conceded 1.4 goals per game, and at home specifically they&#x27;ve leaked two goals per match in their two home fixtures this season. Their matches have produced over 3.5 goals in 40% of cases, with 60% seeing both teams score.

The context makes this even more compelling. This is one of the biggest derbies in Saudi football, with Al Ittihad, Al Hilal and Al Nassr traditionally being the three powerhouse clubs fighting for supremacy. These high-stakes matches naturally produce goals, and with Al Ittihad currently dealing with defensive chaos and a new coaching situation, while Al Hilal arrives in blistering scoring form, the over 2.5 goals looks extremely solid. Their most recent meeting in September ended 3-1 to Al Hilal and historically their clashes at King Abdullah Sports City have averaged 4.75 goals.




Heerenveen&#x27;s home fortress combined with NAC Breda&#x27;s poor away record makes the double chance safe, while both teams&#x27; attacking capabilities support the goals. Meanwhile, the Saudi derby has everything pointing toward goals, from historical head-to-head records to current form, defensive issues for Al Ittihad, and Al Hilal&#x27;s incredible scoring run. Combined at 2.05 odds, this represents solid value for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>&#x27;s action.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Austin Reaves over 4.5 Free Throw Attempts (1.8 Bet365) 1unit to win 0.8 unit

Wolves gave up 35 Free Throws (6th most in the league so far) to the Trail Blazer last game. Reaves cleared this line last game with 10 attempts. Lebron is out again so we will be expecting Reaves to have the ball in his hands more, sharing his usage with Luka and running the offense without Bron he will have more opportunity getting in the paint and be able to draw some fouls.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>⭐️:⚾️Dodgers F5 ML (-145) \[ESPN Bet\]

Start Time &amp; TV: 8:00pm EST (FOX)

Units: 3 Units

Reasoning: Time for some World Series baseball with the AL champions the Toronto Blue Jays and the NL champs the Los Angeles Dodgers. My key factor in this one comes down to the starting pitching as I think the Dodgers have an upper hand in starting pitching in this one. They are starting Blake Snell who has been amazing this year for the Dodgers, he finished his 2025 regular season with a 2.35 ERA, 1.26 WHIP and an opponent slash line of .230/.307/.315. He has performed even better in the playoffs with 3 performances with his last two games being shutouts with only one hit allowed in each game and tallying 19 strikeouts. I think he will out pitch Trey Yesavage who only has 6 appearances this year with 3 of them being in the postseason and he was hit on pretty hard in his last two starts with 7 runs allowed in his two appearances against the Mariners.

Prediction: 3-1 Dodgers F5

Last pick:⚾️Mariners Blue Jays O7.5💩What a tease there in the 8th with first and third nobody out but couldnt get a run.

NBA, Spurs v Pelicans

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Wembanyama O26.5P @ $1.86, B365 

Write-Up: I’ve been trying to target markets with less volume (free-throws, fouls &amp; turnovers) and also stay away from the superstars, as these markets with more volume through them should be sharper. However I find it incredibly difficult to stay away from Wemby scoring 27 points. The Pels just gave up 128 to the Grizzlies, and while Ja is good and went 11-14 from inside 2FG range, he isn’t an alien. Wemby is. This is purely a can’t stay away play and I’d be surprised if his line stays at 27 for long, should be 30 in a week or 2. I don’t see how they stop him. 

Easily the squarest single bet I’ve made I reckon but I just think I will ride this Wemby train for the foreseeable future until we see real line change. He gets ~20 shots again, with his ability to get close to the basket and make it a certainty, he’s going over 27.</td></tr>

Game: Celtics @ Knicks 7:30 ET

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Brunson o29.5pts, +134, 2u-&gt;4.7u


Reasoning: the Celtics are coming off of a shakey loss against the 76ers who had a lackluster performance out of embiid. The main stars of that game were Maxey (40 pts) and Edgecombe (34 pts). While the Celtics perimeter defense of Brown and White have always been above average, they’ve lost a form of their defensive identity after losing Porzingis, Holiday, and Tatum. They’re coming into night 2 at MSG, a notoriously difficult stadium to play in. Although Brunson only scored 23 against the Cavs on opening night, he shot an abysmal 5-18 field goal and 1-9 from 3. This is a far cry from his usual efficiency and I would expect a bounce back game in MSG against a geographical rival. Given that the guards of the 76ers scored so much, a bad first game from Brunson, and a lack of defensive identity from the Celtics. I am hopeful my first <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> here will be a success</td></tr>

**Write up:**

After a midweek of European football where the UCL was more favorable then the EL, the football weekend starts early this Friday! In Azerbaijan the kick-offs are very early for the rest of the world, 12.30 PM my time. Hence why I&#x27;ve posted this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> in the comment section of yesterday&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> beforehand, so everyone could trail this way ahead of time as I post my picks at around 8.30am my time (4 hours before kick-off). Here&#x27;s the write up!

**Karvan FK v Turan Tovuz:**

Karvan FK are one of the 3 teams in Azerbaijan that are competing for bottom of the league this season. Karvan have only scored 1 goal in their last 6 games. They´ve only managed to win one game so far, and that was against the only team below them, who are also dog in what was a game who could literally conceed the least (3-2). Then if we look at Turan Tovuz, they are competing this year. Sitting 3rd in the league and winning all games against lower sides (their 3 losses were against 1st/2nd/4th) they are looking good enough to beat this Karvan side.

**Napredak v Vojvodina:**  
Napdredak are bottom of the league in Serbia. They have lost their last 5 games. To check if those losses weren´t undeserved I went through the XG-stats of all those games and they´ve only managed to outperform XG in 1/5 matches. Napredak has only won 1 game this season, And hey, in that specific game their opponent received a red card in the 21st minute.

Then we look at Vojvodina, they´ve only lost twice this season. Both those losses happened to be in their last 5 and I figure that is why there´s a good value on this bet. If we look deeper into those losses what stands out are that they were against teams placed 2nd and 4th and that in both those games Vojvodina received a first half red card! As long as Vojvodina does not get a red card in the first half, and even then, I don´t see them losing or drawing this one.

Best of luck if tailing! 🍀

SUMMARY : Well that one was a layup. Mathurin looked great especially towards the end of the second quarter and he picked up right where he left off and went off in the second half. This cashed before the 4Q!!!! I will say it helped once nembhard was ruled out as it was him and siakam dominating the ball. His odds for MIP surely have to be improved after tonight.

EVENT : BUCKS VS RAPTORS (NBA 6:30 PM   EST)

Myles Turner over 21.5 PRA (-110 Hard Rock Bet) 

I always like to look at matchups and this one caught my attention quick. Looking at Turners last game he went over with 24 and had 5 assists which was a bonus he only shot 4/12 and 2/8 from deep which is well under his career averages. If you look at what the bigs from Atlanta were able to do against the raptors you will see why 21.5 is simply too low in my opinion. Kristaps was able to clear his over and this number with 29 as well as jalen Johnson with a whopping 37. Oneyaka Onkungwu also cleared his with 25. Point being the raptors just lack frontcourt depth with Poetl as the only viable big and he tends to foul a lot. Not to mention you have Giannas that can put anyone in foul trouble fast. It is not remotely funny his game logs vs the raptors…he has cleared this line in 9/10!!!! The kicker is the only miss was a blowout where he ended with 21 in 21 minutes. I know this is a different team and Myles turner has not had someone like Giannas on his team that is so shot and ball dominant but simply put this line is ridiculous. Grab it now before it’s at 23.5 before tip. BOL!!!</td></tr>

Missed last one, but we got another one from our tennis expert El TioSharp <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Shapovalov has quietly been in strong form, winning 9 of his last 10 hard-court matches. Fonseca is an incredible young talent and will be a force in the future, but he’s still working through some growing pains against more seasoned opponents.

This should be a fun match — both players hit big, but Fonseca’s aggressive style still comes with a lot of unforced errors. Shapo’s experience, court coverage, and ability to stay composed in longer rallies should give him the upper hand.

Looking for the vetted player to come through in a spot where experience matters.

Last pick: Denver Nuggets ML vs Warriors (+108) 3u ❌ -3u

Fucking hell man, Denver really should have had that. Curry’s still Curry, special player. Warriors are a very good team. AG Career high 50 points. He looks incredible—books might take a minute to adjust to the new AG—could be some good prop opportunities in the immediate future. Nuggets as a team too, despite the result, they looked very good. 

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>** Ausar Thompson 7+ rebounds (+160) 3u

Pistons @ Rockets 10/24 6:00PM MST

Ausar Thompson has 8 and 9 rebounds for an average of 8.5 in his last two games vs the Rockets. He only played 18 and 23 minutes in those games too. He played 33 minutes in the opener vs the Bulls and pulled in 9 boards. He should see similar minutes here, and his twin brother plays for the Rockets, so good chances he’ll want to show out with his best effort.

He pulled in at least 5 boards in every preseason game, playing low minutes: 5.5 rebounds in 21 mpg. 

He should play 30+ minutes again, he’s already gotten 9 rebounds in the first game, and he’s averaging 8.5 rebounds against his brother last year on 20.5mpg. 

This line seems straight up mis-priced to me. You can go with 6+ at -125 on FD if you want to be safer or add 5+ at -230 to a parlay like AC Milan ML that works out to around +100 and looks very good, but I’m just going to go with the alt line of 7+ rebounds at +160 on bet365.</td></tr>

*Wagner has cleared in 8 of his last 9 vs the Hawks, which comes out to roughly 6.5 RPG in that span.* 

*Atlanta play fast—3rd-fastest pace last season—and they’re right back on the gas to start this year (tied at the top of the early pace board through opening night), which typically inflates rebound chances for wings.* 

 *We also just watched Toronto out-rebound the Hawks 54–34, with Brandon Ingram (9) and RJ Barrett (8) combining for 17 boards from the wing spots—a blueprint for Wagner’s lane tomorrow.*

 *Zooming out, Atlanta were a top-10 team in opponent rebounds per game last season (≈44.2, 8th-most), and several defense-vs-position models had them in the bottom third vs small forwards on the glass (Rotogrinders logged \~8.1 REB allowed to SFs per game).* 

 *On Wagner’s side, his typical workload sits in the mid-30s minutes with \~5.7 RPG last season, and he’s consistently active crashing from the wing—enough that a 6–7 board median in this pace spot feels more than fair.*

*The Hawks allowed the 9th-most rebounds to SFs last year and the 2nd-most to SFs in the Raptors game.*

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Dodgers to Win

Streak (Last 5): LWLLW

5 Unit Play to Win 3.3 Units

We have best pitching vs. best hitting in this World Series. We all know defense wins championships. 

Blake Snell, the Dodgers post season giant is on the mound and he will likely go at least 6 innings. He’s given up 1 earned run in his past 3 starts with 0.86 ERA. Meanwhile, the Jays are starting their rookie fast ball pitcher Yesavage. Yesa has been great, but he burns out after 4 IP. The problem there is the Jays pen has looked rocky as the Rockies were this season. Consistently burning through pitchers. They got away with that with the Mariners just barely, but won’t likely be able to with the Dodgers. 

The series is priced at -200 or shorter and I think this is the best price we get all series with Snell at the mound too and I have to take it even as a Jays fan. Speaking of Jays fans, sports betting is rampant in Canada and 80% of their bets are on the Jays. Part of the reason we are getting a decent price. Good luck and only bet what you can afford to light on fire.

Cashed in a win on what was a pretty sweat free over for Siakam. He started off scorching hot 4/4 shooting in the 1st Q as I anticipated he would facilitate majority of the offensive load for his squad early.

Next <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **Giannis Antetokounmpo Over 30.5 Pts** (-130 on Fanduel) Bet 2u to Win 1.54u

Giannis has been absolutely on fire stemming from last season, averaging 32+ points over his last 10 games and a 37 pt outting last game against Wizards **in just 26 mins.** The Raps defense is shaky inside, and losing Boucher doesn&#x27;t help their defensive case either. 

With Kevin Porter out with a sprained left knee he suffered in the season opener, **this correlates to some extra usage and playmaking from Giannis** (without their starting PG to help facilitate their offense.)

Raptors also consistently struggle defending high <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> n roll actions, Giannis bread and butter offensive system. Milwaukee’s offensive sets are specifically designed to exploit this weakness, with Giannis operating in space where Toronto’s defenders can’t effectively recover. I expect Giannis to have his way against this raptors defense for the point total over.

If tailing, only risk what you can afford to lose. Bol!

**UPDATE**: Giannis is listed as probable for tonight’s game due to a minor back issue, but all signs point to him suiting up as expected. He carried this same status before the opener, then dropped 37 points against the Wizards **without visible limitations**. As always, monitor for any last minute news, but this appears to be Milwaukee exercising its usual early season caution.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Norman Powell o21.5 Points -105 1u (Hard Rock)
Event: Miami Heat vs Memphis Grizzlies 8:00 PM EST.
Explanation: Decided I would try doing this now that the NBA season is back. Will mainly focus on NBA bets but will definitely sprinkle in some NCAAB, UFC and American football picks too.

Remember last year when Norman Powell had a stupidly low line for like 2 months? Well I think this is a stupidly low line. Powell was Miami’s big offseason move and showed it in game 1. Without Tyler Herro he took over his role by leading the team in minutes, shots and points with 36, 19 and 28 each. 

Memphis has a pair of high level defensive guards in KCP and Jaylen Wells. I figure that KCP will get the assignment on Powell which should bode better for Norm. KCP has carved out a nice NBA career but he’s the smaller and older option of the two. 

In terms of game script it should be close and high pace. Both teams I figure should be around .500 this year and had top 10 paces in the first game of the season. I figure it to be a close game (within 10) and higher scoring (both teams easily clearing 100+ points) which figures to be very positive. I think Powell gets pretty similar stats to game 1 and the multifaceted scorer should be able to adjust to whatever the game demands he does whether it’s spot up shooting or iso scoring or driving into the lane. 

Tail if you’d like. Hard Rock easily has the best odds from what I could find right now. I’ll try to post consistently and hopefully we can all make money together :)</td></tr>

He’s over this line in his last 4 games against the Lakers, and in two-thirds of all the games he played last season. It’s expected to be a close game, so I am not worried about a blowout.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Juan Manuel Cerundolo vs Gustavo Heide | **Cerundolo ML at -135. 1 unit.**

Write-up: Two days were fully rained out in Costa do Sauipe, but Habib and Navone were finally able to play <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Navone 2-0 closed around -175, and he ended up mostly cruising to victory. 

Similar angle to the Navone one here. Juan Manuel Cerundolo, younger brother of Francisco, struggled a bit during the hard court season (though he did win a Challenger title during the Asian swing), but his game is much better suited to clay courts. In this season alone, JuanMa has managed to defeat Felix Auger-Aliassime, Alex Michelsen, and Casper Ruud on the surface. His biggest tournament this year in Gstaad came in pretty different conditions to these, as Gstaad sits at a much higher altitude, but he&#x27;s also found success in lower-altitude SA clay tournaments like Buenos Aires.

In comparison, Gustavo Heide is also a strong clay player, though his season was disrupted by a long injury break in the middle of the year. He possesses a heavy serve that does a ton of damage on the surface, but I don&#x27;t feel that he&#x27;s nearly as adept a grinder as Cerundolo, and his overall results haven&#x27;t been quite as impressive. Heide certainly comes into this match with plenty of rest having played his first round on Monday, but I honestly think I prefer Cerundolo&#x27;s situation. Juan secured a fairly straightforward victory over Sebastian Gima, and I feel like he got in rhythm with losing much energy. Meanwhile, I&#x27;m not sure how much practice time Heide has gotten since Monday given the rain situation (and the fact that all the R1 were packed into <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>), and this could be a difficult mental spot for him. 

This is definitely a slightly different spot from the Navone-Habib one, as Heide is a legitimate clay-courter. However, I expect Cerundolo&#x27;s lefty grinding game to be extremely effective in these conditions, as RealFeel temperatures are expected to climb into the 30s tomorrow, and I feel that he should be a bigger favorite here.

Competition: Eredivisie


Match: Heerenveen - NAC Breda


Start time: 2pm EST / 20.00 CET


<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Boy Kemper over 0.5 shots on target (odds 6.00 at bookmaker VBet or Bet365)


Units: 1


Yes we are back with a player prop as I simply cannot ignore the value in this bet. NAC Breda make the trip to Heerenveen for the opening match of round 10 in the Eredivisie. Heerenveen are the favourites, but NAC should not be underestimated. NAC have scored at least 1 goal in all of their last five matches, with a total of 8 goals. They play in the 4231 formation. Boy Kemper, the captain of NAC, plays as a left back. Even though he’s technically a defender, he comes forward quite often on the wing during attack and when there is a corner. Here’s the key stats:


In 9 matches this season, Boy Kemper has shot a total of 10 times, averaging 1.11 shots per 90 minutes played


He shot on target in 5 out of 9 matches this season, averaging 0.56 shots on target per 90 minutes played


He is 2nd on the list of NAC players with the most shots on target (5), only behind forward Mohamed Nassoh, who has a total of 6 shots on target


As he is the captain, he played the full match in all games this season and never got subbed off


According to these stats and taking into consideration the opponent they play against, the true odds for a shot on target from Boy Kemper should be between 1.80 - 2.50. But bookmakers VBet and Bet365 give us odds of 6.00 (!!!). If you don’t use VBet or if you are banned on Bet365 like I am, then Unibet offers odds of 4.60 for this bet which is still really good value. Other bookies I use price this bet at 2.80.


Let’s hope he can have his moment of magic in this match and give us an amazing return on the stake, which we would really deserve after the bad luck we’ve had with player props. I’m not giving up, let’s keep finding the value.


Good luck and bet responsibly 🍀

Unfortunately not an easy 7-1 win where we were basically home after 15 minutes. However, I assure you that I could tell who would win 7-1 every day I&#x27;d be on my own private beach sipping cocktails and not sharing them on Reddit. 
Good win <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> though; 3-1 win. 

Was a classic game of two halves. We were 1-0 down at half time, and playing bad in some terrible weather. However, three goals in the second half (one of which in injury time, so it felt like a 2-1 more than a 3-1) got us over the line 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Melbourne Victory to win at Newcastle Jets 1u at $2.15 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: I don&#x27;t really have too much that I like a lot in the price range <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> (I backed Coventry over Watford -.75, then realised that game is tomorrow in the states), so I&#x27;m going with a one unit bet that is - and this isn&#x27;t great to say - largely vibes based because the season in Australia is so new (this is round 2).

Newcastle Jets have been rubbish for years. There&#x27;s a bit of optimism after they won the biggest cup competition in the country recently, however that ends in the preseason for the A League, so most teams don&#x27;t really take it too seriously. The ones that do take it seriously definitely aren&#x27;t match-ready. Proof of this is that there were so many &quot;cupsets&quot; over the course of the comp this year.  With semi-pro teams knocking out A League opposition.

Yes, Newcastle look better, and there are some really signs. But they just copped three goals to a Central Coast team that is an absolute disaster. 

Basically, I think some people are upping Newcastle a tad too much. 

Victory had a rough patch last season and their reputation suffered a lot. But they turned it around, and made the Grand Final. 

I think Victory have a way better chance at winning this than the price tag says.... But I&#x27;m only 1u confident because it&#x27;s the A League and anything goes.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: James “The Machine” Wade to WIN vs Mike “Small” de Decker at -146 on FD for 2.5u to win 1.7u

Writeup: Alright I was looking at this matchup from the jump. I think we have a statistically balanced matchup but recent form I believe leans in James Wade’s favor. Even if Mike de Decker wins the first throw, Wade has the edge in consistency and experience. He’s been floating around a 94–95 average over the past year, hitting close to 46% on his doubles. He may be getting older but he still knows how to grind out wins on the big stage. Wade’s recent mid-90s averages and calm under pressure, show he’s still got that old-school composure that wins short, tense matches.

Mike De Decker’s got plenty of talent and can throw heavy when he’s on, averaging about 94 himself, but his finishing sits lower at around 39%, and he’s been a bit streaky this season. Really just consisting of one good run followed by a few flat games. The head-to-head and odds lean Wade’s way, and in a short best-of-11 format, that experience in closing legs is massive. Unless De Decker finds top gear early. With that being said the odds aren’t great but I’m a big fan of Wade’s swagger and demeanor. I have a feeling Wade will break de Decker and will hold throw.

Trust “The Machine” on his first game in the 2025 PDC Machineseeker Championship.

As always, BOL, if you have any interest in darts this may not be the Biggest game on the slate but I think it will be profitable… only bet the shmeckles you’re willing to wipe your ass with. let’s keep the streak alive!!!

The opening premier league game of the week features 2 relegation candidates. If they are going to offer almost even money for the 2.5 goal line for a West Ham game then I’m happy to take it. 

Nuno playing away from home is more likely to take the safe approach and stick to his counter attacking football for West Ham. They were gutless moving the ball forward last game.

Leeds have shown defensive capabilities this year too producing a few clean sheets along the way, but have struggled going forward. They were unable to break down somewhat stubborn defence in Burnley (also relegation candidates) last week, failing to score.

Leeds have only registered 6 goals in the league, including an anomaly 3-1 win against bottom place Wolves which gives them 3 goals in their 7 other games.

West Ham hold an identical scoring record with 6 goals, and 3 of them coming against Forest who funnily enough Nuno was managing at the time before being sacked.

All of West Ham’s games with Nuno in charge have seen the under 2.5 mark hit. Everything points towards under goals, I just see the right value here.

North Texas leads the NCAA in scoring with a whopping 45 ppg and 42 total touchdowns.

Pretty annoyed at myself for the Maryland play. Maryland ended up covering the +3.5 but did not hit the ML. I think I had the correct  read, just tried to get too cute with it and ended up paying for it. We move onto the next <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Cal +5.5 -112 4u to win 3.89

California Golden Bears @ Virginia Tech Hokies. Lane Stadium, Blacksburg, Virginia. 7:30pm EST Kickoff.

This line is a headscratcher. You’re telling me a 5-2 team is 6 point dog against a 2-5 team? It really piqued my interest so I did a deep dive on both programs and tried to understand what the hell Vegas is seeing.

STATS SECTION:

According to nearly every power rating computerized system, this game should be a Cal lean on a neutral field. Sagarin rating has Cal as the 77th rated team in the country with a rating of 67.74. Their recent metric is sitting at 65.77. ESPN SP+ has them rated as the 75th team in the country with an overall rating of -2.3, offensively at 97th in the country with a 23.0 rating, and 59th in the country at 25.3 defensively. Their Resume SP+ is -39.9, 63rd in the country. PFF has them at 78.1 overall rated, offensively 68.5, defensively 84.5.

Virginia Tech is the 76th rated team in the country per sagarin with a rating of 67.99. Their recent metric is sitting at 66.53. ESPN SP+ has them rated as the 91st team in the country with an overall rating of -5.7, 91st in the country offensively att 23.6, and 88th in the country at 29.6 defensively. Their Resume SP+ is 109th in the country at -62.2. PFF has them rated at 74.5 overall, offensively at 64.5, and defensively at 77.0. 

In nearly every metric that I care about, Cal either matches VA Tech, or beats them handedly. Cal is the better team in a lot of statistical metrics, and both are just as undisciplined, in the bottom quartile of penalties in their last three matchups.

I’m not in love with stats, but Vegas is, which makes sense why they’re giving Cal 5.5 points on the road. Their computers likely indicate a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>’em, typically a road team gets a 2.5 point bump, and I’m assuming a cross country road trip is worth an additional 2 points. 

EYE TEST:

Defensively, VA Tech gave their most recent opponent, Georgia Tech ZERO struggles offensively. Georgia Tech is rated highly and run an untraditional offense with a lot of strange run sets that are difficult to scheme against. Georgia Tech had 0 notable negative plays that weren’t turnovers, and were effectively able to do whatever they wanted on the ground, scoring 35 points. G5 Old Dominion beat the piss out of VA tech, throwing for  nearly 300 yards, and rushing for 250, averaging 8.5 YPP. Both teams notably have running QB’s. Offensively they operate successfully in the run game by handing the ball off to Terrion Stewart, who is liable to cut loose for a 25 yard gain on any given play, or in the pass game by getting lucky with blown coverage. Their receivers can’t catch, can’t run routes well, and the line doesn’t block well in pass pro. Don’t gift VA tech a wide open receiver in off coverage and contain the RB and you’ll be in great shape to win against Tech.

Cal’s key to victory? Score 21 points. 3 touchdowns. That’s all they need. I’m not worried about their defense, it doesn’t take an elite defense to stop this VA Tech team. (It does help that Cal has a pretty good defense, rated in the top half of the ACC.). Cal has scored at least 21 points in all but one game this year. In watching their game against Minnesota and having a really good understanding of Minnesotas defense, they operated very successfully in both phases. Passing the ball is their strong suit, and their QB is very precise, manages the pocket well (not the cleanest of pass pro’s by any stretch of the imagination but he handles it well), and receivers get open. I’m extremely impressed in his discipline of diagnosing coverages and hitting the pockets in zones. Receivers aren’t great playmakers by any means, but they catch the ball well and sit down in routes well.

INJURIES:

VA Tech’s #1 contributor offensively is listed on the injury report, Terion Stewart. He’s currently listed as probable but if he’s not ready to go, I don’t think VA tech has a glimmer of hope.

TL:DR:

I think 5.5 is a lot of points to give Cal. At the end of the day, records DO matter, and teams that consistently win ballgames are better than teams that don’t (Duh). This may be a matchup that is relatively similar on paper, but Cal has the momentum and history to prove they’re a better team than Tech this year. One of Tech’s two wins on the year comes from a team called Wofford. I don’t know where the hell Wofford is, and I know damn well if 50% of your wins come from schools that nobody has ever heard of in week 9, you’re NOT a good football team. Their only other win came from NC State, which was a 2 point win.

Cal is the better team. I’m sprinkling a little bit of the ML, and definitely taking Cal + the points in this matchup.</td></tr>

Summary: 

Well, there isn&#x27;t a whole lot to say about that one. That was just an all around awful game by the Vikings. They were out coached, and outplayed on both sides of the ball. After watching nearly all of their Eagles game last week, it was a completely different team that came out last night. They couldn&#x27;t run the ball, because they couldn&#x27;t block. They couldn&#x27;t pass because they couldn&#x27;t block. When they blocked, Wentz held the ball for too long. It was a mess. For a team that at least put up a fight against the Eagles last week, the Vikings simply laid down last night. Always unfortunate when a game isn&#x27;t even competitive. I&#x27;ll take a loss when its a competitive game, but that was a complete blowout from the jump.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> is a new daw folks and this is long term game we&#x27;re playing. Apologies to anyone who followed me onto the Vikings last night.

On to the next💰

Friday’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>

Italian Serie A

AC Milan v. Pisa (1:45 PM CT)

Straight  // AC Milan Win to Nil 

(-117 on Fanduel) - 3u to win 2.56u

Alright alright alright. I jumped back and forth about 50 times writing this as to whether I wanted to add one more leg and rock a 2-leg Football+Futbol parlay or keep it to one. Ultimately, I decided that I will keep it simple for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today’s pick</mark> and not give the anti-parlay purists any ammunition /s. If you are interested in the 2-leg parlay that I’ll be taking with this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> and a football <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, feel free to shoot me a DM and I’ll send it over! I’ll probably toss a unit on that and drop this straight bet from 4u to 3u.

After an odd day of Europa League matches where we saw a ton of favorites stumble (which was preceded by a bunch of favorites winning in CL the two days before), I am headed away from Football and am moving back to the pitch for some Futbol. We are headed to Italy for a beautiful night game at the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza in Milano. AC Milan is playing host to Pisa, and according to every data point out there, the home team *should* cruise here. 

AC Milan sits atop the Serie A table through 7 games in which they have collected 16 points and are 5-1-1. They are one point above a three team, 15-pt tie of Inter, Napoli, and AS Roma. So far this season AC Milan has played exceptionally well, scoring 11 times and only conceding 4 times. Those 4 goals have come against Napoli (1), Fiorentina (1), and Cremonese (2). The Cremonese match is their only loss this season, and was on matchday 1. Their form has been tremendously improved since that loss, with their only draw coming away against Juventus (0-0). They have held a clean sheet in 4 of 7 matches (including the Juve match) and all of those games have been against teams a fair bit stronger than Pisa. Serie A table leaders on 4 days of rest, at home, against the Serie A bottom dwellers. What’s not to love? Give me AC Milan to take this one.

For the second portion of this straight bet, we are looking at AC Milan to keep a clean sheet and see zero goals conceded to Pisa. I kind of hate these bets because you are watching the whole match for something to not happen, which is way worse than waiting for something to happen (in my opinion). Nevertheless, I think there is good value in the win to nil bet here.

Since AC Milan’s loss in their first match, they have only conceded 2 goals in 6 matches, and those were to a more formidable Napoli side and a Fiorentina team who has also netted against Napoli and Roma. Pisa on the other hand has only scored 3 times through the first 7 matches of the season, and have gone their last 4 matches without scoring. They have only got on the score sheet in 2 matches so far this season and against one of the top defenses in Serie A, there is good value on Pisa to go another match without a goal.

Best of Luck to those who tail, as well as those who don’t! Please make sure to bet responsibly and only bet what you can afford to lose.

I generally spend a couple hours a day combing through as much action as possible from across the world, in order to find value. I do have my own bankroll behind all my picks, but if you are feeling generous, any tips will just go towards enjoying a cold, 22 oz lager at the bar down the street (they&#x27;re only $4.50 each during happy hour).

- 1.Milan are in strong form at home: in recent matches they’re averaging ~2 goals scored per game and conceding under 1. Pisa are struggling: hardly any wins, very low goal-scoring output, especially away from home. 


- 2. Both teams are strong offensively in recent form (particularly Al Hilal) so the scenario where BTTS will hit its gonna happen. BTTS occurred in 6 of the last 8 matches. </td></tr>

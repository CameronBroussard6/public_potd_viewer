Write Up: Celtics are 11-4 ATS in their past 15 matchups against bottom 10 defenses. Celtics are looking for a bounce back win after their loss against the Trail Blazers. The Jazz are coming off back to back wins against 2 good teams and this just seems like a spot to where they come back down to earth.

Aton Villa to win @ 7 

Aston Villa to beat Arsenal at 7.10 reminds me of the old days, when football was won with grit, not headlines. I’ve watched this game for decades, and I know when a side is ready to bite. Villa are tough, organised, and fearless, especially when written off. Arsenal like rhythm and comfort, Villa will give them neither. This is the kind of match where experience, hunger, and belief make the difference. I’ve seen giants fall many times before, and I tell you now, this has that same feeling written all over it.</td></tr>

The Canadiens appear to be starting Montembeault. He has not started in goal since Jan 9 as he was loaned out to an AHL club. On the season, he has an .856 save percentage and has a 3.65 goal against average.

The Panthers will be on the second half of a back to back. Bobrovsky is starting tonight, which means likely we will see Tarasov tomorrow. He had a pretty good start to the season when he filled in, but lately he’s been struggling. In the last month, he’s had a .886 save percentage and a 3.54 GAA.

Both of these teams are capable of scoring enough to get above the 6.5 mark, especially at plus money.

Good Luck</td></tr>

Carolina’s goal ratio is also better: they are 126 GF/ 108 GA, while penguins are 116 GF /116 GA. Penguins have been struggling as of recent , while hurricanes are a hot team. I don’t see the Hurricanes losing momentum against the Penguins tomorrow.</td></tr>

**Event:** EPL (Soccer) - West Ham vs Brighton (19:30 GMT)

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>**: Brighton to win @ 2.15 (1 Unit)

**Write Up:** In all honesty <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>&#x27;s slate really isn&#x27;t all that great but I&#x27;m going with Brighton to win vs West Ham because I think they&#x27;re generously priced and I fancy them to get one over on the Hammers despite being away from home. **Brighton sit 13th** in the premier league table whilst **West Ham sit 18th** and currently in the relegation zone, **5 points away from safety**. Statistically this game doesn&#x27;t give that big of an edge to either side but we will go through them as we always do with my opinions sprinkled in alongside.

Our home team <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> West Ham have won **none of their last 5 games** in the league picking up **2 draws and 3 losses** across those games. Their 3 losses have come from their last 3 games meaning a loss to Brighton <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> will make it **4 losses on the bounce** for Nuno&#x27;s Hammers team. However 2 of those 3 losses have been to **2nd place Man City** and **3rd place Aston Villa** with their final loss coming against **10th place Fulham** in their most recent game. West Ham are the second worst home team in the EPL this season picking up just **6 points from their 9 games** played at the London Stadium, **scoring 10** and **conceding 21** in the process. This translates to **1.11 goals scored per game** which actually drops to 1.00 when playing away. Defensively this becomes an average of **2.33 goals conceded per game** at home which is great news for travelling Brighton. I see Nuno bringing veteran striker Callum Wilson into the starting lineup this week in an attempt to fire some goals in to help change their fortunes going into the new year.

As for Brighton they are coming off the back of an expected loss to league leaders Arsenal at the Emirates but they put up more of a fight than most would have expected but I will get to that in a moment. In terms of their last 5 they have exactly the same record as West Ham, **winning 0 drawing 2 and losing 3**. Their games have come against harder opposition in my opinion with losses against **Arsenal (1st)**, **Liverpool (4th)** and **Aston Villa (3rd)** and draws against **7th place Sunderland** and actually **West Ham earlier this month** which ended 1-1. This game is the first time in a little while that either team is facing an opponent in the bottom half of the table (other than earlier in December where they met each other) so both should be hopeful of a more positive result but I think Brighton are the better team on paper. Going back to that game against Arsenal, despite probably deserving to be 2 more goals down than they were, Brighton gave Arsenal a headache during the second half only being denied an equaliser through a world class David Raya save for the Gunners. On top of this, Welbeck is expected to come back into the lineup which will give Brighton some much needed firepower and defender Van Hecke was back in the matchday squad last time out so could be getting some minutes here <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> which is a big boost to Brighton&#x27;s defense. In terms of the numbers Brighton are scoring a slightly low **1.11 goals per game** away from home this season whilst **conceding 1.56**. On their travels the Seagulls have picked up **8 points from 9 games** scoring **10 times and conceding 14.**

This game could be an absolute toss up but I think Brighton have had a harder run of games recently and I think they did look pretty decent against Arsenal especially considering that is the best defense in the league and arguably the entire world that we are talking about here. I am also banking on Danny Welbeck making a considerable difference coming back into the team after his injury as the Englishman has **netted 7 times** this season so far and if Van Hecke does also return to the lineup he will be a big help in keeping West Ham out. I&#x27;m going for something in the range of **2-1 Brighton**.

<tr><td class='post'>**POTD Record:** 6-17-3 *Zimbabwe were so close to giving me another win, but it just wasn&#x27;t meant to be - sounded too good to be true, I guess. Another super tight match that sadly just didn&#x27;t go in the direction I needed it to, with a narrow 3-2 defeat at the hands of South Africa. I&#x27;ve thus (perhaps a bet or two too late) decided that AFCON in fact isn&#x27;t going to bring me much luck, so I&#x27;m switching to club football for now - eyeing up a tasty fixture. Let&#x27;s get it done for reals*

**Event:** Premier League, Arsenal v Aston Villa, 3:15 pm EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Aston Villa Win or Draw +162, 1 unit

**Write Up:** Aston Villa might just be **the most in-form team in world football** at the moment, having notched up incredible **11 wins on the bounce,** and I back them to *(at the very least)* avoid defeat against Arsenal <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. It&#x27;s not going to be an easy one as Arsenal have been solid at the Emirates and sit at the very top of the table, but recent trends suggest this isn’t going to be a straightforward match up for them. **Arsenal’s last meeting with Villa saw them lose 2-1,** thanks to a last-minute winner, and Villa’s overall recent H2H record against the north London side has been more than impressive, with Villa picking up **three wins in their last five matches** against Arsenal.

As I said, Aston Villa’s current form is nothing short of remarkable. Under Unai Emery, they&#x27;re riding an **11 match winning streak in all competitions,** showing consistency and grit that few sides can match this season. Their ability to grind out results, especially away from home, gives them a real fighting chance heading into the Emirates. Crucially, Villa have proven resilient in recent encounters, **recovering points even when under heavy pressure,** which is why I&#x27;m loving the look of <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>.

Arsenal, despite being favourites on paper, have **defensive injury concerns** and haven’t always controlled the game as comfortably as their league position would make you believe, **conceding in several recent games,** as well as **struggling to score from open play recently.** They&#x27;ve barely scraped by a historically awful Wolves side and even needed some **assistance from own goals recently.** Their **set pieces have also dried up,** not being nearly as threatening as they were at the starting point of the season. Meanwhile, Villa’s attack, led by the likes of **Ollie Watkins** and **Morgan Rogers** has been consistent and lethal, capable of breaking down even strong defensive units, and they should handle whatever Arsenal might throw at them.

In a match likely to be of narrow margins, Villa’s **momentum and edge in the recent H2H meetings** should see them through this fixture. At +162 odds I simply can&#x27;t ignore the sheer value in this play. How the Villans are such heavy underdogs on paper is beyond me. Expect a competitive contest where Villa don’t just survive, but have every chance to leave with a point or more, troubling the Gunners at every possible opportunity. Just the one standard unit on this one. BOL and let&#x27;s enjoy some club football again ☘️</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Arsenal VS Aston Villa Over 2.5 Goals @ -117 | 1.17 unit to win 1 Unit (1xbet) 

**Write Up:**

Arsenal are in **dominant home form**, with an 8W-1D-0L record, scoring **22 goals in 9 matches (\~2.44 per game)** and conceding only 9. Their attack has been prolific, highlighted by results such as a **5-0 win against Leeds**, a **4-1 win against Tottenham**, and a **4-2 win against Brighton**. They average **\~62% possession** at home and consistently generate high shot volume, indicating strong attacking control. While Arsenal have a few injury concerns (Havertz, Timber, and Mosquera listed as questionable), squad depth remains strong, and their offensive output has not slowed.

Aston Villa’s **away defense has been vulnerable**, conceding **22 goals in 9 away matches (\~2.44 per game)** while scoring 14. The situation worsens with **key defensive absences,** including **Pau Torres (out), Matty Cash (suspended), and Boubacar Kamara (suspended)**. Villa has still shown attacking intent, contributing to high-scoring matches, which increases the likelihood of both teams contributing to the goal total.

Overall, the matchup projects **≈3.0 total goals**, with an estimated **\~72% probability for Over 2.5**. Arsenal’s home attacking consistency, combined with Villa’s defensive issues, creates strong value at current odds. For bettors looking to **reduce risk**, a lower unit size (0.5–0.75 units) is an option, or waiting for **live betting**—if there’s no early goal, **Over 1.5 live** after 20–25 minutes often provides a safer entry with improved odds.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Arsenal Over 4.5 SOT @ 1.68**

**League - Premier League**

**Game: Arsenal VS Aston Villa**

**Time: 3:15 PM EST**

**---**

Arsenal have an opportunity to set things straight against Aston Villa after falling short in that last second just a couple weeks ago. Arsenal lost to Aston Villa away from home on December 6th and managed **9 shots on target** (hitting the post twice). Now Arsenal get a rematch at their ground while needing a win to create a distance with Villa. Also, they forced 5 shots on target in the first half against Brighton on the weekend and I expect a similar start.

**Player information:**

No Matty Cash, Kamara, Pau Torres for Aston Villa -  3 massive defensive misses

Arsenal attacking-wise will be without Havertz, all other forwards being healthy.

**---**

Arsenal at home is a game that prints money, and for good reason. They’re currently unbeaten at home this season, and it’s the kind of match you want to be involved in, especially under the lights.

Villa have been in unbelievable form, but the underlying metrics tell a different story — one of a team that’s been lucky not to concede more while being extremely clinical themselves. Considering they had **ZERO SHOTS in the first half against Chelsea** and still went on to win the game… that’s exactly what I mean.

**---**

**Arsenal Home games this season: Shots on target - AVG 5.6 per game**

**6, 7, 2, 7, 8, 8, 5, 3, 8, 5, 5, 3, 5, 5, 6**

**That is 15 Home games this season - Line covered in 12/15 of those games. Expecting it to follow tmr against a revenge-driven game against a defensively weaker Villa side.**

**Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Jaden Philogene 1+ SOT (-140) 🅿️

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s Event:** English Premier League (Soccer) | Chelsea vs Bournemouth (11:30 AM PST)

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:**  Antoine Semenyo -1 SOTs (+160) 1 units to win 1.6 units

**Write Up:** I tried a similar play a few days ago that ended in a push, so I&#x27;ll try to explain it again. This play pushes at 1 SOT and wins if he gets 2 SOTs. You are placing two bets, one for 1+ SOT that adds up to your total units, and a smaller one for 2+ SOT. If your units are 100 for the sake of easy math- as of writing this 1+ SOT is -155 and 2+ SOTs is +310. So you&#x27;d place $61 on 1+ SOT to return $100, and the remaining $39 on 2+ SOT to return ~$160. This way you push if he only lands one and win if he lands 2. Let me know if anyone needs help with the math, and feel free to take 1+SOT at (-155) if you prefer. 

On to the play. Semenyo has been the brightest spot on this Bournemouth team this year with 9 goals. He has had 1+ SOT in 15/17 matches this season. He has scored a goal in his last 3 matches, and had 2+ SOTs in 3 of his last 5, including 3 SOTs in the reverse fixture a few weeks ago vs Chelsea and 4 SOTs on Saturday @ Brentford. He has really kicked into another gear lately. 

There are also a lot of rumors floating around that Semenyo will be sold to Man City here in a few days. This may be his last game for Bournemouth. Emotions will be riding high for the lad, and I expect him to give it his all and take a lot of shots. Bournemouth had 4 SOTs in the goalless draw against Chelsea a few weeks back, 3 of which were Semenyo. Chelsea just gave up 9 SOTs to Villa at home a few days ago, so they certainly are open for shots.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Brighton Double Chance + Over 1.5 Goals
Odds: 1.57

Write-up:
Originally, the play was Brighton to Win at 2.13, based on their clear edge in the underlying data from my AI sports analysis model. Brighton hold a significant ELO advantage, stronger strength of record, better weighted form, and a higher overall attacking threat. On top of that, the fixture difficulty rating heavily favours Brighton, even away from home.

That said, West Ham’s home factor and a draw probability of around 32% make a straight away win slightly riskier than the raw numbers initially suggest. While Brighton are the better side, this matchup still carries the potential to be competitive.

For that reason, the safer and more pragmatic option is Brighton Double Chance + Over 1.5 Goals at 1.57.</td></tr>

* Jaylen Brown is averaging 30 points per game this season and 33 points per game in December. Also in December, he is averaging 36 minutes per game and 22 shots per game.
* Jaylen Brown is averaging 35 points per game when he has at least 20 shots per game.
* Jazz are the top team allowing the most points to small forwards in the last 15 games and the second-best in the last seven games. An average of 31 points per game.
* Jazz are the fourth-fastest team this season.
* Jazz have the second-worst defense this season.
* After the game against the Blazers, Brown tied the Celtics&#x27; franchise record set by Bird - a series of 9 consecutive games with at least 30 points. At the same time, he surpassed Bill Sharman and climbed to 12th place in the all-time Boston Celtics scoring rankings. I see this as very relevant, and the ambition to set a new record in the Celtics franchise should be huge.
* Jazz are one of the top four teams that allow the highest FG% to opponents in the &quot;Less than 8ft&quot; zone, the zone from which Brown shoots most often.

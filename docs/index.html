Entertainment | Kings League | Porcinos vs Ultimate Mostoles / 18:00

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Porcinos ML | 2.00 | 3u

Write Up:

Porcinos is the superior team with a far more polished and cohesive squad. I&#x27;ve watched their last two matches, and they&#x27;re on another level: impeccable organization, fluid attacking patterns, and total control of the game.

Porcinos loss to La Capital is misleading. La Capital gained an early edge by fielding two professional-level players against two non-footballers from Porcinos. On top of that, Porcinos missed *two penalties* and still dominated possession and chances—they had their opponent completely suffocated for most of the match.</td></tr>

Event : Italy Serie A 🇮🇹

Verona vs Inter Milan

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> : Inter Milan Win + Total Under 4.5 goals @1.68 for 3u

Inter have a huge historical advantage and are much stronger than Verona this season. Inter have not lost any of their last 20 games against Verona and have won 9 of the last 10 meetings between the clubs, showing how dominant they are in this fixture. They have won their last 5/6 away matches this season and are fighting for the Serie A title with a solid team. Verona, meanwhile, are near the bottom of the table, struggling for results, and have only scored 9 goals from 8 matches while conceding 18, making them weak at both ends of the pitch. Verona are winless in last 10 games. All this suggests a win of the visitors and Inter scores 1.75 goals per game while Verona conceds 1 goals per game, making under 4.5 goals more probable.

**Sport: ⚽** ***/ Ligue 1 &amp; Eredivisie / Rennes v Strasbourg &amp; Utrecht v NEC***

**Net Units/ROI: +26.09u / 49.23%**

**Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** ***Marseille to win(1.70) + Benfica to win(1.42) @ 2.02 -- 3 units***✅

**Summary:** Very sweaty first half at Benfica but they came out Flying in the second half and with a red card for Guimaraes that game was done after that. How different was Marseille when they received a red card for a stupid challenge at the halfway line, with a goal reversed by VAR earlier in the game it was a sweaty game, but we managed to get the high-risk parlay over the line!

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** ***FC Utrecht v NEC Nijmegen over 2,5 goals(1.65) + Rennes v Strasbourg over 2,5 goals(1.66) @ 2.75 -- 2 units***

**Write up:**

It&#x27;s starting to look like a French weekend for my picks, with Marseille yesterday and another French game in <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. Another high overall odd in this parlay where we need 6 goals in 2 matches. Do-able? I think so, but we lower to 2 units <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.

**Utrecht v NEC Nijmegen**

Utrecht is a very attacking side with amazing set pieces. With **left-back Soufiane El Karouani at the top of the assists chart** in the Eredivisie they are looking to get more goals <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> against NEC. NEC is probably the most attacking side in the Eredivisie, of the 11 players their coach puts in the squad, 8 are attack minded. With only the centre backs and goalie thinking defensively, NEC&#x27;s matches are goalfests. **46 goals in 10 matches so far in matches that NEC has played in**. Utrecht have covered over 2,5 goals in **4/5 most recent domestic matches.**

**Rennes v Strasbourg**

I&#x27;ve personally watched Strasbourg&#x27;s game against Lyon last weekend as it was the last game that I needed goals from in a big parlay. This time I&#x27;m using the over 2.5 goals market again for a Strasbourg game, but this time its being used in the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>. Strasbourg have **topscorer of the league Panichelli**, and he really impressed me in that game. They were the better side against Lyon until their red card. Over 2.5 goals has hit in **6/9** of **Strasbourg&#x27;s games**. It also hit in **6/9 games for opponent Rennes**. Combine those goalscoring qualities and lackluster defenses and this is a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> I&#x27;m fairly confident in.

**Best of luck if tailing!** 🍀

Welp, Vandy came up just short, even with the refs helping lol. Frankly I’m surprised it ended so close considering Texas led by 21 at one point. Nevertheless, kudos to the Longhorns.

Event: NFL Football Denver Broncos (6-2) @ Houston Texans (3-4) 11/2 1pm EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Broncos ML +105 (1 unit)

Write up: These two elite defenses collide in an AFC showdown that could be a potential playoff matchup. Denver enters this game on a 5 game win streak featuring clutch defensive performances (holding the defending champ Eagles to 17) and impressive offensive showings (they’ve put up 33 and 44 points over the last 2 weeks). Bo Nix appears to be taking the second year leap, sporting a TD/INT ratio of 10/2 during the win streak. Houston has struggled against quality competition this season, with their most impressive win coming against a banged up 49ers team. CJ Stroud and the offense have been their biggest weakness, with the former Buckeye posting a passer rating below 100 during each loss.

Quarterback play will be the key difference maker here, and the choice seems obvious. I expect Sean Peyton to limit Stroud through the air while Nix does just enough to secure the win. BOL to those who tail. Let’s do some winning!</td></tr>

__Event:__ NFL: Bears @ Bengals 1pm EST

__POTD:__ Kyle Monangai o73.5 rushing yards (-115), 3.45u to win 3u

__Write Up:__ Back at it again going for 50 wins &amp; 69% win rate. The Chicago Bears (4-3) are traveling to Cincinnati to take on the Bengals (3-5). The Bengals are coming off an embarrassing loss, giving the New York Jets their 1st win of the season. The Bears had their 4 game win streak snapped in their last game vs the Ravens. __There are going to be a lot of points scored this game as both the Bears &amp; Bengals are tied for 30th in points allowed per drive on possessions without a takeaway (3.08). Cincinnati has allowed a TD on a league high 37.7% of opponent drives when they fail to get a turnover. The Bears rank 30th at 36.7%. The Bears (6.8) &amp; Bengals (6.1) are the 2 worst defenses in yards allowed per play on early downs.__ The Bengals have had some life in them after acquiring Joe Flacco from the Browns. The Bears have won 4 of their last 5 games &amp; are looking to keep their offense hot vs the Bengals. 

Going into their Week 5 bye the Bears had a weak run game &amp; Bears Head Coach Ben Johnson went to the lab &amp; started cooking. __Before the bye, Bears RB’s averaged 3.4 yards per carry &amp; 1.18 yards before contact. After the bye, they’ve averaged 5.9 yards per carry &amp; 3.17 yards before contact.__ The Bears have deployed a RB tandem with both D’Andre Swift &amp; Kyle Monangai. Monangai only has 1 game with 10+ touches this season, in Week 7 vs the Saints. Monangai had 13 carries for 81 yards. Over the past 2 weeks, Monangai has had longest rushes of 25 yards &amp; 15 yards, his 2 longest rushes of the season. In these 2 weeks Monangai has a 39% rush share, compared to just a 23.6% share in Week 1-6. This week Bears RB’s D’Andre Swift &amp; Roschon Johnson are out, leaving Monangai in a bellcow role. He’s going to see at least 18-20 touches this week. The Bears took Monangai in the 7th round of this year’s draft. Monangai is 5’8″ 211 pound rookie out of Rutgers, who faced elite competition in the Big 10. He played in an awful offense with an awful OLine, &amp; he still but up big numbers in back-to-back seasons as he was their entire offense. He had 270 touches 1364 yds, 14 TDs in 2024, &amp; 250 touches, 1340 yds, 8 TDs in 2023. __Monangai’s 139 forced missed tackles over in his last 2 seasons at Rutgers were the 8th most among FBS RB’s, &amp; he didn’t fumble once his college career with over 670 carries.__ Monangai hasn’t had many chances to show his skills much so far this year, but that’s going to change Sunday as he is the only healthy RB on the Bears roster vs a horrrible Bengals run defense. But he has still put up big numbers. __His 4.4 yards per carry ranks in the Top 24 of RBs this season, &amp; his 5.1 Yards per Touch is 17th. Fantasy Life’s Ian Hartitz created a stat called “Cool Sh*t”, a list of RBs with 50+ opportunities &amp; what % of those went for TDs/explosive plays/avoided tackles, &amp; Monangai ranked 8th with 39.2%. He has a 4.8% explosive rate &amp; averaged 0.17 mossed tackles per rush.__ He now faces an atrocious Bengals run defense that has been torched on the ground this year. Here is how opposing RB’s have faired vs the Bengals this season:

Breece Hall 18/133, Isaiah Davis 7/65

Jaylen Warren 16/127

Josh Jacobs 18/93

Montgomery/Gibbs 30/119

JK Dobbins 16/101

Jordan Mason 16/116

Etienne/Tuten 22/113

__The Bengals have given up 132 rushing yards per game to opposing RB’s this season. The Bengals are 30th in defensive success rate (52.8%). 89.8% of the rushing plays against the Bengals have gained yardage, the highest rate in the NFL.__ They have a tough matchup this week as Chicago has been elite on the ground this season. __16.2% of Chicago&#x27;s run plays have gained 10+ yards, 2nd in the NFL behind the Ravens (17.8%).__ The Bengals haven’t been able to stop an RB’s this year. __They are currently 31st in EPA/Rush allowed &amp; are allowing the 4th most yards per carry (5.00). They are allowing the 4th most yards before contact per attempt in the NFL, which won’t improve this week facing a Chicago OLine that is generating the 4th most yards before contact per run in the NFL (2.61).__ Schematically Monangai is set up for a big day as well. The Bengals have been horrible against zone rushing concepts. __Monangai runs zone carries at the 12th highest rate among RBs. Cinci is allowing both the 2nd highest yards per carry (5.71) &amp; 2nd highest success rate (56.0%) in the NFL against zone attempts, as well as the most yards before contact per run (2.65) on these rushes.__ The Bengals also struggle defending exterior runs. __Cincinatti allows the 5th most yards per carry (6.04) &amp; 3rd most yards before contact per carry (2.99) vs outside runs. The Bears offense runs outside on 54% of their attempts, 6th highest rate in the NFL. It works well for them too as they rank top 10 in both YPC &amp; success rate.__ The Bears have been running it a ton over the past few weeks. __Chicago ranks 5th in the NFL in Run Rate Over Expected since Week 4.__ With the Bears favored by 3 points, that should continue this week against a struggling Bengals team.

In a bellcow role vs a horrible run defense, there’s no one I trust this week more than Kyle The Run Guy Monangai. 

__Kyle Monangai over 73.5 rushing yards__

Went exactly as I expected, probably should have just taken the regular spread knowing the huge gap between these teams but usually its better to be safe than sorry betting on the bottom tier teams in college football.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s match: Man City vs Bournemouth (Soccer/EPL) 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: BTTS + Over 2.5 Goals (-110, MGM)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> we head to Etihad Stadium where Man City will host Bournemouth in a matchup that is historically one-sided with Man City winning 17 of their 18 H2H matches and undefeated in all home matches. Both teams were top 3 in goals scored before this weeks slate of games started with Man City scoring 17 goals and Bournemouth scoring 16. Even though this matchup is predominately one-sided their last 6 games against each other have seen BTTS over 2.5 in 5 of them. Bournemouth also enter this game in good form starting the season fantastically and sitting 2nd on the table while scoring in every game this year besides one game against Newcastle, similarly Man City have also scored in every game this year besides last game against Aston Villa where we also saw Haaland&#x27;s 12 game scoring streak come to an end. I&#x27;m expecting Man City to get back to winning ways tomorrow being at home but I expect Bournemouth to net at least one goal. BOL and bet responsibly.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: [NCAA Basketball] Eastern Washington +8.5 vs Seattle U (ESPNBet -110)

Analysis: Do not be fooled by EWU’s 0-3 record. The Eagles, who play in the Big Sky Conference, have opened up with #12 UCLA (covered +29.5, lost by 6), LMU (covered +9.5, lost by 8), and Colorado (covered +15.5, lost by 5). That is about as battle tested as a small-conference team can get this early in the season. This group plays hard and doesn’t go away. <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> is the Eagles best chance to not only cover, but to earn their first win of the season against an in-state foe. 

Seattle has been double digit favorites in both of their games played so far and has failed to cover in each of their two games so far. This team went 14-18 last year and the Redhawks were picked to finish 8th of 12 teams in the WCC this year. The Redhawks just lost to Cal Poly in their last game and with the way that EWU has been playing against better competition makes me think this spread is way too big. I also like the Over 149.5 as there should be a lot of threes taken tonight, as well as a little sprinkle on EWU ML. 3 wins in a row would mean a streak has started so let’s do it!

Once again this is gambling at the end of the day so bet responsibly, control your emotions, thank you to those who tail and best of luck🧏‍♂️</td></tr>

NBA | Cavs v Heat | 🏀  

Sweaty <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> for no reason but he got it done at the end after cruising in the first half. Felt very good about the read tho, we move

Cavs are as shorthanded as they come with Mitchell, Garland, Mobley and Tyson out in this game vs the Miami Heat. Great matchup for Hunter amongst others (Lonzo?) who could feast in this one, I’ve talked about Heat and their pace (ranked 1st in pace) making their games great for assist and rebound opportunities which can be seen from the high total of 238.5.

Without Garland he’s over in 4/6 games avg 8.2 RA per game but he’s avg 7.7 potential assists and 9.8 rebound chances per game which is very nice volume.

What makes it even greater is that those in those games, Mobley and Mitchell has actually played and now we get this matchup without any of them playing so the potential for this bet is very promising.

Hunter is a great rebounder and will be in good spots to get the weak side rebounds, has really improved his facilitating aswell.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **Houston 1st Half -17.5** (-120 FanDuel)

So far between this season and last season, Kelvin Sampson and Houston have played 9 games against low major teams. They have won the 1st half by 17pts or more 8 of those 9 times. 
 
The full spread for this game is -30.5, in these 9 low major games, when the spread was 27 or higher they covered 17 or more in the first half all 8 times.

Last game was the ONLY one where Kelvin Sampson and Houston did not start strong and cover the 1st half spread. I fully expect Sampson to be all over them to have a good start this time. So that game does not worry me.

Houston has one of the best defensive teams in the country every year. They should be motivated at home after a sloppy start to last game.

Detailed Analysis: Why the New Jersey Devils (+135) Are the Model&#x27;s Top <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> to Beat the Chicago Blackhawks


Bummer on Columbus falling 5-4 in OT to Edmonton —the model&#x27;s 51% win prob (regulation or OT) held as &quot;almost sound,&quot; but McDavid&#x27;s heroics (1A in OT) exposed the Oilers&#x27; GA luck regression we flagged. 


For Nov. 12, the slate spotlights NJD @ CHI (8:30 PM ET, United Center), where the Devils emerge as the model&#x27;s alpha <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> with a 55% projected win probability. This undercuts Vegas&#x27; 61.5% NJD favoritism (-160 implying 61.5%, per BetMGM), but flips to a massive 12% value edge on NJD at +135 (CHI implied 42.7%). Chicago&#x27;s weekend blowout (5-1 vs. DET) masks deeper flaws; NJD&#x27;s efficiency exploits them. Breaking it down with stats through Nov. 11 (~16 GP/team), trends, and model layers.




1. Pythagorean Efficiency: NJD&#x27;s Balance Overpowers CHI&#x27;s Volatile Offense (Core Driver)
Devils&#x27; Rock-Solid Foundation: NJD sits 9-5-2 (20 points), firing 48 GF (3.0/GP, 10th NHL) while stingy on D with 42 GA (2.6/GP, 4th). This nets a Pythagorean win % of 55% (48² / (48² + 42²) ≈ 0.55), backed by a +6 differential that&#x27;s held in 6-2-1 road form. No fluff—NJD wins tight (8/16 by 1 goal), with 85.7% PK (7th) throttling power plays. Recent skid? Nah, 4-1-1 in last 6, including 3-1 at NYI.


Blackhawks&#x27; Mirage: CHI&#x27;s 6-7-3 (15 points) looks punchy with 52 GF (3.25/GP, 6th, fueled by Bedard/Bertuzzi&#x27;s 19 combined goals), but 58 GA (3.6/GP, 22nd) screams regression—their 42% Pyth% (52² / (52² + 58²) ≈ 0.42) trails actual .438 win% by 3.8%, worst in East. That 5-1 DET W? Outlier on 45 shots; norm is 3.8 GA/10GP, bottom-5 in high-danger chances against. Model weights GA 60% (early-season predictor)—NJD&#x27;s edge projects +0.7 expected goals.


2. Goaltending Matchup: NJD&#x27;s Wall vs. CHI&#x27;s Patchwork (Regulation Stabilizer)
Devils&#x27; Duo Dominance: Jake Allen (2.45 GAA, .915 SV%, 5-2-1) and Vitek Vanecek (2.78 GAA, .910) anchor a .912 team SV% (6th), allowing &lt;3 GA in 9/16 starts. NJD is 7-1 when holding foes &lt;3 goals, and road SV% (.914) neutralizes CHI&#x27;s shot volume (31.5 SOG/GP). Post-OT lesson: This tandem&#x27;s 1.1 GA/60 in 5v5 covers CHI&#x27;s chaos.


Hawks&#x27; Revolving Risk: Petr Mrazek (.898 SV%, 3.5 GAA) and Drew Commesso (.885) yield .902 team SV% (24th), with 3.6 GA/GP spiking to 4.2 in last 5 (28 GA). CHI ranks 26th in saves above expected (-4.2); Mrazek&#x27;s pulled twice recently. Model SV% adjustment (+3% to NJD prob) tips low-event games—under 6.5 cashed 8/16 for CHI, 9/16 for NJD.


3. Offense &amp; Special Teams: Parity with NJD&#x27;s Edge in Discipline
Scoring Breakdown: NJD counters CHI&#x27;s flash (Bedard 12G, Bertuzzi 9G—all high-danger) with Hughes (18 pts, 6G-12A) and Meier (10G), averaging 2.8 GF/GP road but +5 differential away. CHI&#x27;s 28.6% PP (3rd) tempts, but NJD&#x27;s 86.2% PK (5th) has killed 14/16 vs. top units—limiting Bedard&#x27;s bounces (just 2 PPG).
Model Projection: xG proxies (GF/60) forecast 3.2-2.7 final, favoring NJD&#x27;s even-strength control (51.2% faceoffs via Hischier). CHI&#x27;s over-reliance on PP (6/10 overs at 6.5) falters vs. NJD&#x27;s discipline (fewest PIM/GP, 8.2). Post-Columbus, model dings CHI&#x27;s 4-6 as underdogs for similar &quot;hype&quot; traps.


4. Value &amp; Adjustments: Odds Gap + Home Ice = NJD Upset Leverage
Prob Gap Gold: -160 implies 61.5% NJD, but model caps at 55% after 4% CHI home boost (historical 54% wins)—still a 12% edge on NJD ML (+135 yields +12% ROI at true odds). CHI&#x27;s +135 implies 42.7%, but their 4-
5 as +130+ dogs (44% win) underrates NJD&#x27;s road dominance (6-2-1, +9 diff).
Backtest Fit: Model nails 56% on road favorites vs. middling offenses (like CHI&#x27;s 52 GF but 58 GA). Historical NJD-CHI: 3-1 Devils last 4, including 4-1 in CHI.


5. Intangibles: Injuries, Schedule, &amp; Momentum
Injuries Tilt NJD: CHI misses Seabrook (LTIR, D depth hit) and Reichel (day-to-day, top-6 F); NJD fully healthy, rotating fresh lines.
Schedule Squeeze: CHI on back-to-back (vs. DET Nov. 11? Wait, no—rested, but 3-in-4 stretch looms). NJD fresh off bye, eyeing Central climb.


OT Tweak: +2% to road teams with SV% edge in models post-regulation risks—bumps NJD to 57% in sims.
Bottom line: Model&#x27;s stats lens (70% Pyth/SV, 30% odds) unmasks CHI&#x27;s offensive smoke, projecting 3-2 NJD regulation win (55% clip, under 6.5 -105). Fade the Hawks&#x27; glow—+135 is sharp money in this mismatch. Track lines, small stakes, big vibes. Let&#x27;s flip that L to W together!</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Austin Reaves over 22.5 Points (+100 FD) (Lakers Vs OKC)

Austin Reaves has hit this total on 7/8 this season. He just returned from a groin injury but that didn&#x27;t stop him as he scored 24 points against a weaker match-up in Charlotte. His 30.3 PPG on the season is definitely unsustainable with Luka back and Lebron returning soon. But I like the odds on 22.5 at + money. Lakers have been really good this year despite Lebron being out and Luka missing a few games. I think this game will be competitive enough where Austin will get enough minutes to hit this point total. Even if he has a poor shooting night, Austin still gets to the line enough to score points.</td></tr>

Event: CFB – MACtion Wednesday | Toledo @ Miami (OH) – 4:00 PM ET
<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: 🏈 Miami (OH) +4.5 (–110) | 5u to win 4.55u

Write-Up:

MACtion’s back, and this one fits a setup my model loves. The system I run looks for games with early sharp movement one way and public pressure the other — and Toledo vs Miami checks every box. Toledo opened –3.5, took some early sharp money, and now sits at –4.5 with around 65–70% of bets still on Miami. That kind of split usually leads to value on the dog once the line inflates past the key number.

Toledo’s a solid team, but they’ve been awful on the road (0–4) and are dead last in penalty yards per game (71.9). That’s a nightmare for favorites covering spreads on the road. Miami’s defense is disciplined, top-25 in stop rate, and they’ve kept almost every game within one score.

On offense, Miami lost RB Kenny Tracy, but Jordan Brunson’s been running hard and QB Aveon Smith gives them mobility to extend drives. It’s not pretty, but it chews clock and limits possessions — exactly what the model likes when backing a home dog in a low-total game.

Weather looks fine (mid-30s, light wind), no big advantage either way. Toledo’s defense will make plays, but their offense has dropped off lately — averaging barely 20 PPG in MAC play.

Situational trends line up too:
	•	Home dogs in midweek MACtion are 11–5 ATS since 2022
	•	Toledo is 2–8 ATS last 10 road games
	•	Miami has covered 4 of the last 5 vs Toledo at home

This just feels like that classic midweek MAC game that gets weird late — penalties, turnovers, maybe an overtime field goal. My model’s projecting this closer to a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> ‘em, so +4.5 has solid value.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Keldon Johnson o13.5 Points + Rebounds vs GSW -112

Risk: 3 units

Profit: +2.68 units

Total return: 5.68 units

Keldon’s been quietly one of the more consistent combo producers on the Spurs this year, especially at home. He’s gone over 13.5 P+R in 13 of his last 17 home games, averaging 20.9 P+R in that stretch. When you dig into his recent form, he’s cleared this line in 9 of his last 10 overall, and he’s 2-for-2 vs Golden State in their last two matchups (25 and 29 P+R).

Golden State’s defense against small forwards has been vulnerable lately — they’re giving up solid looks to slashers who can attack closeouts, and Keldon fits that mold perfectly. The Warriors also rank bottom-10 in opponent rebound chances to wings, which boosts his floor even if the scoring isn’t there early.

Keldon’s minutes have been stable around 26 MPG, and he’s averaging between 21.4 and 30.5 P+R in similar usage windows against comparable opponents. His shooting volume (around 8–10 FGA per game) and rebound chances (9–11 per game) make this line look short, especially considering how well he’s historically matched up with the Dubs’ smaller lineups.

All signs point to a number that’s simply too low for his current role and efficiency. If he sees his usual workload, he should clear this comfortably. 3 unit play</td></tr>

Haven’t posted in about 3 years but I’m giving it a shot again. I don’t have any stats or feel about this game, I just believe in betting on these big programs with huge lines against much smaller schools to be generally profitable. I typically like to bet the 1st half spread because the line is obviously smaller and I think these big teams try to solidify their large lead early and coast through the 2nd half. Line for the full game is -41.5 which I like but I love the -24.5 for the 1st half better.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: NBA Spurs v Warriors 

1U Castle O6.5 assists @ $1.71, B365

Write-Up: Big slate tomorrow, wanted to find higher odds considering the number of games we have to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> from but unfortunately couldn’t find one, and this was my first look so sticking with it. 

The case for it is pretty clear - he’s cleared this in his last 4, going 8-13-13-11 taking on a play-making role. He doesn’t need 11 or 13, just 7. 

Warriors are coming off a B2B from playing the Thunder so hoping there’s some easier scoring routes with a bit of fatigue. They also concede the 4th least free throws per game in the comp, which is great as nothing more annoying than your assist play getting burnt on shooting fouls. The Warriors effective field goal (EFG) defense % is mid tier for the league, while the Spurs are 5th for attack for EFG %. 

As long as he gets his usual minutes &amp; usage, and the Warriors don’t get blown out too early, I think this is a neat <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, if potentially just a smidge too low odds ($1.75 would be ideal).</td></tr>

Spain Primera Division

Zamora Vs Ourense CF BTTS NO 1.75

Two sides that love a grind. Don’t expect fireworks here — expect discipline, compact lines, and probably one team walking off scoreless.

📊 H2H trends:

* BTTS landed in just **3 of the last 7 meetings (43%)**
* Avg goals per match: **2.1**
* Last 2 H2Hs both **under 2.5 goals**

Form-wise, Zamora are averaging **0.8 goals/game**, while Ourense sit around **1.1**. Both play structured, risk-averse football — control first, creativity second.

Ourense away are especially cautious, while Zamora at home often struggle to break teams down. Everything points to another tight, tactical match where one side blanks.

🎯 **<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** BTTS = NO (NG)   
💰 **Odds:** 1.75  
📈 **Reasoning:** Historical trends + current scoring data suggest around a **58–60% probability**. That gives a **nice bit of value** at this price — a steady edge in a game that fits the profile perfectly.</td></tr>

It was probably bothering him but Felix was definitely copping out. He’s now had time to recover and should be more than fine to take a set off Ben Shelton who under a no-injury-speculation match in these settings, would be the rightful underdog to FAA here. WORST case scenario, we’re insured by a retirement if he’s *actually* still hampered, gets smacked first set and then retires after to confirm injury speculations and avoid hate.

Why: The Blazers just look like the better team right now. They’re putting up points in bunches, moving the ball well, and playing with confidence, while the Pelicans can’t seem to find any consistency on offense. Even with Portland’s defensive lapses, their scoring should be too much for a short-handed New Orleans squad to keep up with.

As for the Thunder, they’ve got everything clicking — energy, depth, and home momentum. They rebound better, defend harder, and don’t rely on one guy to get things done. The Lakers are running on fumes without their full lineup, and that’s a tough ask in OKC’s building. I’d roll with the Blazers and Thunder tonight — both are just in better form and have clearer paths to win.</td></tr>

Two big teams in this matchup, Bayern being top of the Bundesliga and Arsenal being the current title holders of the Champions League.

Bayern have scored in every single game in the past 10 matches. Arsenal have scored in 9 out of their last 10 matches.

Bayern have only kept a clean sheet in 5 of their last 10 matches and as Arsenal is the favorite in the matchup I think they don&#x27;t keep a clean sheet here.  
Arsenal have only kept a clean sheet in 3 of their last 10 matches. Both teams to score has hit in 7/10 last matches for Arsenal and 5/10 last matches for Bayern.

Back after a little break and starting with a win here feels nice. After a slow start Lowry cleared 92 yards. Although a little sweaty, once he got his passing game moving the rushing yardage started to clock up and he executed in the final quarter.

**Todays <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** NCAAF - Central Michigan v Buffalo - *Ta-Quan Roberson o209.5 Passing -* $1.85 - 4 Units

Chips are good for 66th in the country for passing yardage allowed with 224 per game.

We did see Buffalo revert to more of a running game in their last win but Roberson hit this line the previous 3 games including a massive 402 yard game with 36, 38 and 55 attempts respectively.

Bulls haven’t had much difficulty scoring points this year, averaging 25.6 ppg with a game low 17 points and that’s been largely due to Roberson’s passing game. 

His failure to execute in the last game saw the rush being utilised so I’m happy to scrap that performance. I think we will see a return to normal service here and Roberson should give himself plenty of opportunities to get on a roll against a below average pass defence.

They played OT there, good games from all their top players, Shields, LeDay, Bolmaro, and Guduric.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Ben Shelton over 12.5 Games Won (-165)

Russ cashes this easily; covers just on the basis of his points and assists and cashes every ladder up to 32, plus multiple rebound/assist parlays of 6/6, 7/7 and 8/8.  Books continue to undervalue him this season, going to be hitting it for the foreseeable future.

For <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> I&#x27;m backing Ben Shelton to win over 12.5 games.  I also like his moneyline but like this one a little more because ultimately it comes down to this: is it more likely that the match is a quick blowout one way or another or that Felix beats Ben? In my opinion, with two of the top servers in the game both in excellent form in recent months (both legitimately playing the best tennis of their careers), I&#x27;m seeing a competitive match.  The worry here is that a) Felix has been great so he could definitely win this one, or conversely b) Felix has been injured and might not be 100% tomorrow.  That said, I still think this should cash if not in 3 sets then with Shelton winning something like 7-6 6-4.  Personally I will be playing a couple units on both this and the Shelton ML, but forced to choose just one for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> I&#x27;m going with over 12.5 Games.

\- Wemby has had 9(!) 3FG Attempts in the past 2 games with the return of Fox. 

\- He made 6 Threes last game. While certainly an outlier, we can expect some more attempts after such a successful night.

\- Warriors middle of the pack (rank 16) in allowing Threes to Centers

\- In the past week, Jokic and Chet (C) have both made 2 Threes against this Warriors defense

\- Also expect Steph&#x27;s aura / shooting to incentivize some Wemby attempts

What a game. Back in the winners column, and my god was that fun. I can’t lie that when embiid got ruled out, I actually liked the play even more. What a game, and finally got a W betting against Boston . Theory didn’t hold up for why I’m fading them, but regardless a W. 

Back at it tomorrow, and keeping write up short again, but love this play. 

**Pistons -2.5**

Okay, these are two teams have had basically completely opposite seasons so far this young season.

Detroit started the season 2-2, losing to the Bulls in their first game, and my cavs a few games in, however they are currently on a 7gm win streak since that loss in October. I will say Detroit has been playing the bottom of the league in this streak, however a 7 game win streak is still impressive this early in the season.

Bulls on the other hand started the season 5-0, however now are 1-4 since then. The bulls have lost to the top of the league only losing by 10+ in 2 of those. Their 4 loses were against knicks, bucks, cavs and spurs. IMO those teams top 7-8 In the league. 

The stats, also show the bulls are the better team on paper. The bulls are the top half of the league in almost all O &amp; D categories, while the pistons rank towards the bottom in some of the key areas. For example, Pistons are 17th in opp 3pt %, while bulls are 4th in 3pt %. The one advantage I do think Detroit has in on the glass. The pistons crash hard on both ends, and are IMO the scariest O rebounding team in the league, and at home I see that being a big part of the game. 

With all that being said; you’d think the bulls were the right side, however this is a bet on my belief that Detroit js in the same tier as the those teams. Yes, they’ve had a cushy road to this win streak, however that is exactly what a young team needs to start the season. Momentum.

I know this isn’t the most conniving angle to boast a bet, but I just really think Detroit wins this at home tomorrow. I have paid close attention to Detroit all season, and just think this team is going to be a tough out and compete with the top teams in the league this season. I also think they bulls overachieved and we are getting value with their hot start this season. 

Right now Cade is Q, so I may regret making this play so early. Giddey is also Q for the bulls so hopefully he doesnt play, while Cade does.</td></tr>

Event: North Texas @ Oregon st (8:30pm central)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: North Texas +3 (-120)

-everything is bet to win unit amount-

Write up: 

You know this is one of those games where I just think the wrong team is favored. My power ratings make this North Texas -1.5, and I’m gladly taking the points. We may as well call this squad the North Texas Vikings, because head coach Daniyal Robinson brought three starters with him from a Cleveland State team that consistently contended in the Horizon League. Robinson’s teams are gritty, pesky, and tough — his Cleveland State unit finished 73rd in defensive efficiency last season, and he’s clearly instilled that same identity in Denton.


Both teams this year have played at a snail’s pace, ranking in the bottom 30 nationally in tempo, which makes a close, grind-it-out game highly likely. That’s exactly the kind of environment where taking the points makes sense. Oregon State’s two wins this season have come by just 2 and 3 points, respectively.
Now let’s talk numbers. North Texas has the edge in nearly every statistical category. They’re shooting 39.1% from three compared to Oregon State’s 31.6%. From the field overall, North Texas is hitting 48.3% of their shots, while Oregon State sits at 43.2%. On the glass, North Texas holds a rebounding percentage of 52.4%, slightly better than Oregon State’s 50.1%. Defensively, North Texas is allowing opponents to shoot just 32.7% from the field, while Oregon State has allowed 45.8%.


The rim protection disparity is massive. North Texas averages 7.0 blocks per game, while Oregon State is averaging just 0.7. That’s not a typo — it’s a real gap in interior defense. Turnovers are another key edge: Oregon State coughs it up 16.0 times per game, which ranks near the bottom nationally, while North Texas commits just 11.0 turnovers per game, well above average. On the flip side, North Texas is generating 7.3 steals per game, compared to Oregon State’s 4.5.


Strength of schedule is relatively even, with Oregon State getting a slight nod, but not enough to offset the statistical dominance. North Texas also has an extra game under their belt, sitting at 3-0, while Oregon State is 2-0. Continuity matters, and that’s another edge for the Mean Green. Oregon State’s roster is still gelling — several players are underclassmen and international recruits who haven’t played together much. Meanwhile, North Texas has a core that’s already battle-tested and cohesive.


And it’s not just the numbers — it’s how they’re winning. North Texas held Loyola to just 32.7% shooting in their last game, showing they can impose their defensive will on the road. Oregon State, meanwhile, allowed opponents to shoot 45.8%, which is a major liability against a disciplined team like UNT. North Texas also forced 12 turnovers and grabbed 8 steals in that game, continuing their trend of creating extra possessions through pressure defense.


In a game with a total set at 136, we’re expecting a low-possession, defensive slugfest. That favors the team with better efficiency, better rim protection, and fewer mistakes — and that’s North Texas across the board. I’ll gladly take the 3 with the Vikings of Denton. Let’s bounce back big fellas and preserve our record of no b2b losses, as always, cheers 🍻</td></tr>

NCAAB // Prairie View A&amp;M Panthers @ Oklahoma State Cowboys

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Oklahoma State -32.5 (-105) 1u**



Oklahoma State welcomes in Prairie View A&amp;M in a tune up game that embarrasses all other tune up games. Prairie View A&amp;M is projected to be one of the worst teams in one of the worst conferences in the country. Their last game out they played Wichita State, who sits at #108 in KenPom, and got laughed off the court losing by 43 points, 62-105. They put Wichita State to the line 41 times and had 2 players foul out. They also only went 2/16 from 3 for 12.5%, yikes. Prairie View A&amp;M is truly awful. 

  
Oklahoma State on the other hand has looked great so far this season as they try to follow up their NIT run with an NCAA tournament appearance this year. They are 2-0 on the season beating both Oral Robberts and Texas A&amp;M by 24 points. Both teams ranked higher than Prairie View. Also worth noting Oklahoma State came into the Texas A&amp;M as a slight underdog and still took care of business controlling the game from the opening tip. 

Oklahoma State: #51 in KenPom, 

Prairie View A&amp;M: #341 in KenPom

Oklahoma State 2-0 ATS covering by an average margin of +14.8pts.

Prairie View A&amp;M 0-1 ATS not covering by -22.5pts. 

If Prairie View and Oklahoma State both keep up their same level of play, this game should be a blowout similar to Prairie View&#x27;s last outing and a comfortable cover.</td></tr>

Even without that factor, the Hawks have looked good, most recently pulling the big upset against the Lakers and beating the Clippers. Trae remains out, but the squad has adapted to his absence and are playing some good basketball. The Kings squad is a mismatch of aging talent and while a few guys can pop off, they are nowhere near as fluid and consistent as the Hawks.

 

*This line is available on DK. I’d play it to -4.0.*</td></tr>

Last Pick: Roman Andres Burruchaga ML vs Federico Agustin Gomez (-200, 2 units): Win

Tennis | Montevideo Challenger | 6:00 PM EST (estimated)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Vilius Gaubas vs Ignacio Buse | **Buse ML at -112 (DK). 1 unit.**

Write-up: Burruchaga closed at -335, and while he should have been able to serve it out at 5-4 in the second set, he was able to get the job done in the end. That win officially brought me back into the green for the first time in a while - I know that I&#x27;ve a lot of ups and downs as a capper, but at the end of the day, breaking even isn&#x27;t the worst outcome in a world where most people lose money. I hope that I can stay in the green as the sample size gets larger, and my next goal is to reach my highest unit return ever again. 

This should be a good matchup between two of the top performers in clay Challengers this season, Ignacio &quot;Nacho&quot; Buse and Vilius Gaubas. My reasoning here is actually pretty simple: I believe that the market is overvaluing the head-to-head. These players have faced off on clay twice this season, once in April in Menorca and once in Lisbon in September, with Gaubas winning two closely contested matches. What interests me, however, is that Buse closed at around -220 in both matches. In fact, Buse was pushed to those closing odds from an opening line of -189 in Menorca, meaning the market ultimately was not concerned by the first result.

As for the second match, it couldn&#x27;t have been much closer considering that it was a straight-setter. Buse won 56.0% of his service points compared to Gaubas&#x27;s 58.3%, and Gaubas also benefited from first serve percentages in that match. The performance rating told a similar story, with Gaubas earning a 7.31 while Buse earned a 7.16. The players seemed to be on pretty even footing, with Buse finding some nice attacking patterns to disrupt Gaubas&#x27;s heavy topspin.

Has anything happened since that second match to justify the price moving this much for the third? Not really, in my opinion. Gaubas followed up his Lisbon performance with a final in Braga, but then struggled after moving to South American clay, and didn&#x27;t look all that great in the first round against David Jorda Sanchis (7.16/10). In comparison, Nacho has been playing in this conditions for a few straight weeks, scoring some decent results in two Lima events and then crushing Timofey Skatov in the opening round here (7.98/10). Buse&#x27;s more attacking game is theoretically better on faster European clay, but the oddsmakers have still been pricing him as a high-end CH player here is SA, as he closed as a heavy favorite against solid players like Joao Reis Da Silva and Alvaro Guillen Meza. 

The conditions tomorrow should be similar to what Buse experienced in Lima, with mild temperatures, moderate winds, and high humidity, and I think his big groundstrokes should still be able to shine even if the courts aren&#x27;t the fastest. 

A lot of clay grinders, like Gonzalo Bueno and Sebastian Baez, have already struggled here in Montevideo, and I was even a bit surprised at how much difficulty Burruchaga had with Gomez&#x27;s big serve and forehand. Overall, I have no reason to believe that Buse won&#x27;t be able to use his superior serve and willingness to go for his shots to his advantage here, and I&#x27;m happy to take him at the best price he&#x27;s been available at in this matchup.

Last Five Predictions (Old - New): ✅❌ ✅❌✅

Net Units: +17.17

Yesterday&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Merthyr Town vs South Shields BTTS and o2.5 3u @ $1.80✅

Covered before half time, which is always good. 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Atletico MG to win vs Fortaleza 3u @ $1.61

Again, not a lot on <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> (midweek during international breaks can be grim... to the point where I&#x27;m even backing Bahamas to win) but I don&#x27;t mind this...

Mid-table Atletico MG hosts second-last Fortaleza in Brazil. Both teams are actually in decent form considering their league positions. Atletico are 3-1-1 in their last five, winning their last two games. This puts them second in the form table in the previous five games. Fortaleza are 1-3-1 in their last five, drawing three in a row. 

Atletico are a far better side at home, with 30 points at home compared to 13 away; They&#x27;ve also got a +10 goal difference at home compared to an even one away. 

Fortaleza are one of the worst teams in the league away from home this season, with 9 points in 15 away games and a -15 goal difference. Compare this form to 21 home points in 17 games.

Fortaleza will also be without Matheus Pereira, who got a red card late last match. He&#x27;s been in and out of the team, but if he&#x27;s not starting, is usually one of the first off the bench and will be missed. 

All in all, while there&#x27;s not a lot on - I think Atletico should win this at home and the $1.61 price works for me.</td></tr>

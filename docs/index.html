Last Pick: Leandro Riedi ML vs Zsombor Piros (-145, 1 unit): Push

Tennis | Itajai Challenger | 9:00 AM EST 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Thiago Seyboth Wild vs Adolfo Daniel Vallejo | **Seyboth Wild to win 2-0 at +175. 1 unit.**

Write-up: Riedi unfortunately got hurt again, and was forced to retire from the match. It seemed like most people got their bets voided, which is why I am tracking it as a push for my record. However, feel free to let me know if your bet was resolved as a loss, or you think I should track it differently. I would rather have a record that underestimates my success than one that overstimates it. 

 Thiago Seyboth Wild is no stranger to the big stage, having broken out with a shocking five-set win over Daniil Medvedev at Roland Garros 2023 and beaten top 30 players like Taylor Fritz, Lorenzo Musetti, and Karen Khachanov. A string of poor results in 2025 saw him pushed out of ATP events and into obscurity on the Challenger Tour, so he will now look to rebound in 2026 and get closer to his peak ranking of No. 58 in the world. A title here in Itajai, where he has the home crowd behind his back, seems like the perfect way to kick off that rebound. Seyboth Wild is yet to drop a set in this tournament, spending just 5 hours, 48 minutes on court (compared to Vallejo&#x27;s 6 hours, 35 minutes). He also has earned a strong average performance rating in his matches (7.47 vs 7.05). This trend continues even when adjusting for # of points played in each match (7.46 vs 7.00). Seyboth Wild also has a higher average rating in 3 of 4 categories (serve, forehand, backhand), while Vallejo narrowly edges him on return. This is despite Seyboth Wild only making 54.1% first serves (62.3% avg), while Vallejo has made 58.0% (64.2% avg). Seyboth Wild has played 6 (5 singles + 1 doubles) on Center Court, while this match will take place, while Vallejo has played 3. I expect Thiago&#x27;s aggressive game to be firing from the start, and while Vallejo has enjoyed quite strong form on the Challenger Tour as of late, these feel like the conditions for Seyboth Wild to capitalize. The weather conditions are expected to be hot and humid, but pretty standard for this location, and I wouldn&#x27;t expect that to have a huge effect on the match. The main reason I&#x27;m going for Seyboth Wild 2-0 instead of his ML is that both of these players are big hitters, and this feels like a match where one of them builds confidence early and takes over. Of course, I think that player is more likely to be TSW, and I also felt like he looked a bit better in the defense and touch departments in the semifinals. I also would trust Seyboth Wild&#x27;s fitness and focus a bit less in a tight third set, and so I&#x27;d rather buy into the outcomes where he dominates at a much better price.</td></tr>

Mechelen vs Westerlo, over 3.5 goals @ 2.5

Mechelen vs Westerlo shapes up perfectly for over 3.5 goals. Mechelen’s home matches are often goal festivals, with constant pressure, wide play, and multiple scoring options. Westerlo struggle defensively against high-tempo sides and usually concede early, which opens the game even more. Once Mechelen get ahead, they rarely slow down, and Westerlo’s willingness to attack can easily push the total into a high-scoring outcome.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: LA Rams vs Seattle Seahawks/ Seahawks ML (-138) 3u/ Odds Via FanDuel


Write up: Let’s get back in the win column. The Rams have been on the ropes twice and narrowly escaped defeat against 2 teams that aren’t in the same world as Seattle right now. This is a huge moment for Macdonald and the Seahawks team to return to greatness. Last time they played, Seattle’s offense exploded late despite the defensive shortcomings early on. This defense has looked about as great as you can ask for these last few weeks. Allowing just 9 points to the Niners in 2 games. This will also be a complete home field takeover, given that the rams don’t really have that many fans, and it’s of course in Seattle. Puka was extremely limited last week against a mediocre Bears defense. I expect Seattle to at least slow him down just enough to win this football game. Stafford has also looked a little shady this last month or so. With all things considered, I see Seattle winning this game and advancing to the Super Bowl. Let’s go!! Lmk if you’re tailing, thanks everyone

**Odds:** \+190

**Write Up:** Ohhhh yeahhh we are onto winning ways. Palmeiras looked sharp and converted their chances nicely to see the game out at 3-1, with the high pace of the game it was a breeze for corners, totalling 11 by the close of play - if you took the regular line like I mentioned well done or if you bought down appreciate the tail - either way we cashed!

On to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>todays pick</mark>, their H2H have given us goals for both sides 7/9 matchups; whilst the cards has gone under 5/last 6 for Brentford and 6/last 7 for Forest. Brentford currently sit 8th and Forest in 17th, Nottingham have the quality to score just not seeing results currently, as for Brentford they are in good form consistently finding goals with Thiago upfront being a huge contributor to this. I expect Forest to be wanting to stay clear of the relegation zone and want to put up a fight against a mid-table team. The referee for this match, Samuel Barrott is averaging 4.1 yellow cards this season, and due to the style of football both teams play I expect 2-3 cards but no more. I&#x27;m liking my odds for these, you can also take these as singles if you would like.

I was also leaning towards an NFL <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> but being a Seahawks fan I steered clear, lets hope both the championship games are a good watch! Have a wonderful day folks, lets make some money.

REASONING/PROJ. ANALYSIS: D. Maye has been sacked 57 times this season.

He&#x27;s a bright young star, but he holds the ball a bit too long &amp; doesn&#x27;t have the quickest release. As opposed, Allen is one of the stars of the formidable Bronco defense &amp; he&#x27;ll be facing Wilson (one of the least effective offensive lineman for the Patriots). Furthermore, he&#x27;ll (mostly) be coming from the left side which also sets him up perfectly.

Middelfart are the underdogs <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, so it&#x27;s not a big problem that they changed coach recently with someone that generates less corner. Silkeborg so far averaging around 9.80 total in the Danish league, at home jumps to above 10.

Yeah, I feel much more confident in Oviedo&#x27;s ability to keep the scoreline respectable. This team, while being rock bottom doesn&#x27;t really ship a lot of goals, and here&#x27;s a fun stat for you: **50% of their games from Nov 3rd til Jan 4th ended 0-0 (4 out of 8 games played).** Crazy run.

__Event:__ NFL: Patriots @ Broncos 3pm EST

__POTD:__ Rhamondre Stevenson o49.5 rushing yards (-115), 4.6u to win 4u

__Write Up:__ The The New England Patriots (16-3) are traveling to Denver to take on the Broncos (15-3) in the AFC Conference Championship, with the winner earning a ticket to the Super Bowl. In last week’s win against Buffalo, Denver became 12-2 in 1 score games this season. However, QB Bo Nix fractured his ankle ending his season. He will be replaced by backup Jarrett Stidham, who will be playing in his first game this season. He will be come just the 7th QB to start in the playoffs after not starting in the regular season, with the previous 6 having just a 1-5 record. Stidham has just 4 starts in his NFL career with just a 1-3 record. In his career, Stidham has a 4.1% interception rate on 197 passes. That ranks 90th/102 QB’s whove thrown 150+ passes Stidham entered the NFL. But he’s even worse when pressured, completing just 40% of his passes for 5.8 yards per pass &amp; a 20.5% sack rate opposed to 70.7% of his passes for 8.1 yards per pass when not pressured. Now he faces a scary Patriots DLine that has a 52.1% pressure rate so far this playoffs, after a 40.3% pressure rate this year (7th but injured &amp; now healthy). The Pats D has allowed just 6.4 yards per pass (6th) this year, but in the playoffs vs Justin Herbert &amp; CJ Stroud they have only allowed 4.8 yards per pass &amp; a 50% completion rate. A huge part of that is they just got back a healthy Christian Gonzale who is one of the best DB’s in the league. With Gonzalez on the field, the Pats D has allowed just an 83.4 QB rating, a 62.8% completion %, 6.0 yards per pass, &amp; a 4.1% TD rate. With him off the field, those #s move to a 100.2 QB rating, a 69.9% completion %, 7.8 yards per pass, &amp; a 4.9% TD rate. Stidham will have his hands full vs this defense. But even with Nix Denver’s offense ranked just 16th in points per drive (2.09) &amp; 19th in success rate (41.5%) &amp; punted as much as any team in the league. They punted on 39.3% of possessions (28th), failing to get a 1st down on 38.3% of them (29th). The Pats D has allowed just 1.67 points per drive (3rd) &amp; has given up points on 30.8% of opponent possessions (3rd). This playoffs they have allowed just 1 TD on 24 possessions. The Pats are going to want to play a slow tempo game, not make any mistakes, &amp; run the ball. Especially with the defensive minded Head Coach in Mike Vrabel.

Pats QB Drake Maye has been sacked 10 times for a brutal 13.9% sack rate, fumbling 6 times this playoffs. Maye’s 57 sacks this season is the 2nd most in the NFL. The Broncos are 3rd in the NFL in pressure rate (41.8%) &amp; lead the NFL in sack rate (10.1%). With the Pats having a defense that is scorching hot facing a backup QB &amp; Maye struggling with pressure &amp; fumbles, the conservative defensive coach in Vrabel is going to want to put the ball on the ground. Especially with a in RB Rhamondre Stevenson who is playing the best football of his career right now. __Stevenson just became the FIRST player in the Super Bowl Era, over ANY 6 game span, to have 400+ rushing yards, +7.0 yards per carry, 4 rushing TD’s, 200+ receiving yards, +11.0 yards per catch, &amp; 2 receiving TD’s. Since Week 16 he’s gone for 402 rush yards, 4 TDs, &amp; a league-best +194 rush yards over expected. He’s has 11 explosive runs in that span, more than he had through the first 15 weeks. This led him to rank 5th in the NFL in Explosive Run % (6.9%).__ But things have flipped in the postseason. Stevenson has 26 carries for 123 yards (4.7 yards/carry), &amp; 7 catches for 86 yards. While Henderson has just 21 carries for 52 yards (2.5 ypc), 2 catches for 7 yards. Last week vs the Texans who have one of the best run defenses in the NFL, Stevenson had 16 carries &amp; played 40 snaps compared to Henderson’s 25, &amp; that includes an entire quarter where Stevenson was out with an eye injury. Stevenson has been much harder to bring down as well. He has the most missed tackles forced in the playoffs (10). In the regular season Stevenson averaged 2.75 yards after contact per run (5th among RB’s) compared to Henderson’s 1.91 (42nd among RB’s ). Stevenson also averaged 0.23 missed tackles forced per run (5th) compared to Henderson’s 0.13 (33rd). In the receiving game, Stevenson is clearly the preferred option. Henderson only has 3 TOTAL catches in his past 5 games &amp; is a poor pass blocker. Stevenson has gone 7 straight games with at least 2 catches &amp; is one of the best pass blocking backs in the NFL. Stevenson has out touched Henderson 33-23 this postseason &amp; that number will shift even more vs a tough Broncos defense that has allowed 4.5 yards/play (2nd), &amp; 1.68 points per drive (4th), &amp; has a 62.9% success rate (2nd). However, on the ground the numbers for Denver have actually been pretty poor towards the end of the season. Denver ranked 6th in the NFL EPA/rush allowed through Week 10. But they fell to 15th in that same metric in the background half of the year. Since Week 12 they are allowing the 12th most yards/carry (4.51), &amp; are rank in the bottom 10 of explosive rush rates &amp; success rates allowed. They just gave up 117 yards on 24 carries to James Cook on the Bills last week. __The Broncos have been particularly poor against man &amp; gap rushing concepts, ranking bottom 10 in both ypc (4.51) &amp; success rate. Since Week 12 they’ve given up 5.3 ypc to runs specifically between the tackles, 3rd worst in the NFL. New England runs these concepts at the 3rd highest rate in the NFL. Stevenson ranks #1 in the NFL in rushing yards over expected on runs between the tackles. Stevenson on man/gap runs (Last 7 Games): 62.8% Success Rate, 6.95 YPC, 4 TDs. All rank #1 in the NFL.__ The Broncos allowed 50+ yards to James Cook (117 yards), Travis Etienne (50 yards), &amp; Josh Jacobs (73 yards), all of which are elite gap runners. Vrabel is going to attack this weakness.

Stevenson has hit 50+ rushing yards in 5 of his last 6 games, &amp; with a rushing attempt line at 12.5 (also love the over on that), you can count on him to average at least 50+ yards per carry. The only way the Patriots lose this game is by turning the ball over. With Maye having 6 fumbles in 2 playoff games &amp; now facing the pass rush in the league, Vrabel is going to have to run the ball to slow this defense down. Especially as the Broncos defense’s weak spot is on the ground in the gaps. I think Rhamondre eats here.

We have a great match here between a rising American and a former major champ. Tien has had Meds number in the past, but I think this match will go Meds way. 

This is a very high number for 2 players that I expect to be breaking serve often this match. I think Medvedev got his early round potential upset out of the way against Maroszan and should come into this match focused. Tien has upset Meddy multiple times, but this match Tien will not be considered as much of an underdog. 

If Tien comes out really hot I expect Meddy to fold after playing a 5 setter and the games to go under. If Meddy is playing well I also expect this match to end quickly to go under 40.5.</td></tr>

Write-up:

I was initially looking at Atalanta -1.5, but ended up taking win &amp; over 1.5. Feels like the safer play and less risk if it’s a tight game.

Atalanta have been in decent form lately… won 3 of their last 4 and only conceded 1 goal in that run. At home they usually control the game and create enough to score more than once.

Parma on the other hand struggle a lot going forward. Only 2 goals in their last 4 games, and one of those came when the other team had two red cards. Most games they just sit back and don’t offer much.

This line covers most scores I’m expecting 2-0, 2-1, 3-0, 3-1 etc.
Only real danger is a boring 1-0, but Atalanta usually don’t stop at one goal vs weaker teams, especially at home.

Not trying to overthink it… better team, better form, home game, low scoring opponent. Simple play with decent value.

Good luck to anyone riding with me on this one, hope it lands 🤞</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Alexander Bublik 🇰🇿 ML vs Alex De Minaur 🇦🇺 3 units to win 4.1U @2.37 (Bet365)

I’ll start off by saying that if you’re looking for a lock then this isn’t one. However, for this price? Yes please. Obviously for some safety you can take the games and set handicaps but I just think the straight ML is simply better value. 

Bublik has been on a tear this year, making his top 10 debut and going 7-0 for the season, clinching the title in Hong Kong with a straight set victory over Musetti. He’s hardly recognisable from the inconsistent player he was just a year ago and his ranking will only increase with little points to defend until the clay season. Major lifestyle as well as playstyle changes have shown a really serious face to Bublik who hasn’t dropped a set so far at the Open, confirming his excellent form. He’s one of the best servers on tour and hits incredibly hard off both wings whilst also having the ability to possess incredible variety in his game to disrupt rhythm. Sascha genuinely has extraordinary talent with all the tools to succeed at the highest level and with both confidence and consistency it can be really hard to find the means of beating him. With how good his serving is I believe that he will have more chances on De Minaur’s return games as opposed to the opposite despite his “just” good return game, as a result of ADM’s “just” good serving. 

Let me reiterate that this will be far from a walk in the park but should really be priced closer to a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>’em in my opinion. De Minaur is the No. 6 and whilst he has some incredible qualities about him also comes with limitations. Higher floor than Bublik, lower ceiling. ADM performed well in his opening three rounds but I feel like the first set against Medjedovic (which the Serb won in a tiebreak) will be closest to the level Bublik will bring, Hamad having as usual tired out after a huge hitting set. The demon is arguably the best counterpuncher and mover on tour who loves to grind down opponents with his defensive skills which on paper would frustrate Bublik’s hyper-aggressive game. It produces some insane levels of consistency against worse opponents but the lack of raw power and of an offensive game leads to the Aussie losing almost every time he faces a better opponent, which I believe to be the case on form personally. He’s 0-13 against Sinner whose power overwhelms De Minaur every time they face and this version of Bublik will have a similar effect. Now I’m not comparing Sascha and Sinner per-say as Bublik does fold earlier in rallies but it’s the stylistic comparison that can be made. Whilst ADM may put loads of balls back to force the Kazakh to play an extra shot, often deep, and increase the chance of missing which could very well lead to an error-prone performance from his opponent on a bad day, the sheer speed that Bublik can consistently put on a ball may very well lead to him taking the upper-hand in exchanges on a good one. Based on form, there is no reason to believe he will be in a bad day. Sascha won both their encounters last year, including a battle back from 2-0 down at the French Open on his least favourite surface. This promises to be a big battle on Rod Laver Arena so make sure to get the popcorn out. BOL !</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>Record: 3-2 Event: Big Bash League Cricket Scorchers v Sixers

Time: 7:30pm AEDT

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Steve Smith over 31.5 runs

Odds: $1.9

Write Up: Taking this play for the 4th time cause it’s too low of a line for such a world class player. Genuinely can’t see it not hitting. It’s landed in all of his Big bash games this league apart from one when he finished with 19 not out due to rain ending the game short. Smith’s form at the moment is undeniable. His last 5 matches he’s gotten: 65,37,54,100,19 not out. His only threat in my opinion is Jhye Richardson who should only bowl maximum of two out of the first 4 overs. After having a not so good outting while fielding in the second innings last game, the competitive nature of Smith will be on show in the grand final. 
Best of luck if tailing!</td></tr>

Really interesting play here, but I absolutely love it. Since coming over from New Orleans, he has gotten a carry in 7 out of 10 games and last week in their first playoff game, he got 2 carries. He also returned a TD last week. Now, the Seahawks are out Zach Charbonet. It seems unlikely to me that he wouldn’t get any work in the run game, especially with how well he has played since coming over. In their week 16 shootout game, he got a carry and took it 31 yards

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Map 1 - Over or Exactly 31:30 Map Duration 2-Way (1.83) 2u to win 1.66u**

**Start Time:** 17:00 KST, \~8 hours from posting

**Writeup:** Last matches of LCK Week 2 and it starts with a good one!

T1 have been tested on every series so far. They are still undefeated in matches but they have had to work for their victories. Domestically they have not been the strongest in the last few years and it&#x27;s showing. T1 are very beatable.

FearX on the other hand have been one of the biggest surprises of the first two weeks. They are punching way above their weight class, and are finding ways to win despite being behind. Their most recent test did end in an 0-2 defeat, but that match line does not paint the whole picture. They were competitive against Gen.G, the best team in the league, and they should&#x27;ve won at least one game.

Both teams have some of the slowest average map durations in the league. T1 average 33:02 per game, on Map 1 they average 32:20. FearX average 31:54 per game, on Map 1 they average \~33:40. T1 are the favourites here but they have naturally slow tendencies; leaning on strong fundamentals and game management. FearX on the other hand try to push the agenda early, targetting botside to get Diable ahead. FearX have a relatively hard time converting early leads so they tend to slow it down until the midgame as well.

The key here will be the botside. FearX send a lot of attention that way, securing the early game and dragon count. T1 can be a bit psychotic at times, but when they are behind they let the opponents dictate the pace and force them to play perfectly to win the game. If they don&#x27;t, they will snatch the victory away through sheer will. If FearX can get Diable ahead, and secure a few dragons, the over will be a breeze. Even if T1 get ahead early, FearX have shown they can stay and prolong games. I don&#x27;t expect either team to get an insane lead early that snowballs out of control. Should be an exciting series.

**NFL - Los Angeles @ Seattle, 6:30 PM ET, FOX**

***Kyren Williams o65.5 APY (-120) 2.29u***

We go back to an old friend for championship Sunday in Seattle as the Seahawks host the Rams with a spot in the Super Bowl on the line... With all the talk about the Seahawks 2 headed running game being slashed down to one, **LA have shown their own two headed attack is leaning one way themselves**.

We are going to challenge the best run D in the NFL - again. We are going to keep our faith in Kyren - again. I have to say, I’m no expert on line balance, but this number is genuinely 5/6 yards lower than I anticipated it would open at, and it has creeped there. **Personally I will be playing this as high as 75**.

The seasons work speaks for itself: **65 all purpose yards in ALL BUT ONE game this season. He had 95 on 23 touches last season, 96 on only 13 touches in week 11, and 85 on 26 touches 5 weeks ago**.

*His rushing floor has been 46 yards which is low for this range*, but as I’ve emphasized a few times over the last few weeks he’s naturally become a part of the receiving game. **He’s had over 15+ receiving yards per game &amp; 21 total targets in the last 5 weeks**. If Seattle DO show their run D card, Kyren is still showing himself as an option in Staffords progressions

If the Rams are winning, they are going to have to run the ball… if the Rams are losing the game, they will need to keep Kyren an option to keep Seattle guessing… basically either way **I can see Kyren easily getting 20+ touches tonight**.

Which means - once again - We’re going to fade the Corum effect. **He only had 6 touches last week**, and has been shaky in his on ball output when he’s gotten them in recent weeks. Playoff time means teams will rely on what they have faith in - **Blake hasn’t hit the ground running now in a few weeks**, as it feels like his inclusion into the overall game plan depends on how he starts. **As a result has clearly shifted into RB2 territory**. He’s still a threat to us, but it doesn’t feel as direct anymore.

I feel like I’m repeating myself as alot of these details and stats have remained the same as the weeks have gone by. **Kyren has been a huge winner for me this year away from Reddit, to the tune of 91%**, let’s hope we can get one more.

Last play review:

***Fulham/Brighton BTTS (-155) 1.5u*** ✅

(Game went to script essentially, a touch late to get there but it really never was in doubt. Good to get back on track, and cheers to these guys for an entertaining, parlay smacking game on the side of things)

**Write Up:** Nothing is falling our way at present unfortunately, Ballard had a great chance early and just missed the target. West Ham finally started defending and kept him at bay the rest of the game. Great day in the Soccer thread, but we keep falling short on the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>.

I&#x27;ve taken Morgan Gibbs-White a few times with good success. He is the #10 for Forest and likes to take shots on. With Wood still out, he&#x27;s the team&#x27;s penalty taker and usually the captain. He had a tough game in Europa mid week, while I played his SOT there as well, which cashed in the first 10 minutes, he missed a penalty and wound up with 3 SOTs in a big 0-1 loss. I see him coming back for blood <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> and taking his shots to make up for the mid week match. 

I also like this because Igor Jesus is still questionable, and with limited other options there&#x27;s a non-zero chance they throw MGW back up front as the striker. If they put on Big T or their new signing Lorenzo Lucca, I still expect MGW to take on plenty of shots as neither have had many EPL minutes.

Game against the Broncos at 3:30

Don&#x27;t overthink this one. The Patriots are almost back to the Super Bowl. Stevenson has hit this in five straight, and I expect they&#x27;ll rely on him heavily with Henderson struggling to be productive. The Broncos play a lot of man defense and blitz as much as anyone in the NFL (were leading the league late in the season with this). I expect quick throws and check downs from Maye. I look for the Patriots to capitalize on a mistake or two by the Broncos and jump to an early lead. They won&#x27;t milk the clock early on, but slow meticulous drives to wear out the defense which favors more running back touches. Denver defense again the run (3.9 yards per carry for runbingbacks) is good, so I don&#x27;t want to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> just the rushing prop as Stevenson has only gotten than three of the last five.</td></tr>

Last pick:Lamelo Ball over 6.5 assists, easy win, no sweat 


Event: Patriots @ Broncos 


<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Treveyon Henderson over 8.5 carries (-130)


Write Up: If this looks familiar, it&#x27;s because this was my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> a week ago on this exact same total. Same reasoning applies here, only moreso than last week because the Broncos are starting a backup QB. New England will most likely be playing with a lead, so they&#x27;ll be running the ball at least as often as they usually do. 


Henderson averages 9.5 carries per game, but in the last 12 that average has jumped to 10.5. He&#x27;s cleared the 8.5 total in 11 of his last 12!


There was clearly a preference for his counterpart Stevenson last week against Houston, but the Patriots like to run the ball, especially with a lead, so there are plenty of carries for both of them, as we saw last week. Henderson has been the preferred back this year (180 vs 130 carries), but even if those percentages reverse again like last week, NE should be running enough to get Henderson double digit carries again. 


Denver does have a great run defense, and they allow only the 9th most rushing attempts per game with 24.2. A big part of that is playing with the lead though. In their 3 losses, they allowed 29 carries per game, and I do expect this to be a loss for them. The Denver defense is good, but the Houston defense was better than Denver, and they didn&#x27;t have any issues falling behind so much that they had to abandon the run. I&#x27;m picking carries instead of yards to account for the possibility that NE hands it off many times in a row just to bleed the clock. Those runs are usually for 1 or 2 yards. 


Even if Stevenson gets most of the carries again (though he&#x27;s averaging 2.5 fewer carries this year than Henderson), I don&#x27;t think Henderson has any problems hitting his total again.


The other thing to note is that despite 50 more carries than Stevenson, he has only 1 fumble all year compared to Stevenson&#x27;s 3. So if it comes time to milk the clock, ball security isn&#x27;t an issue for Henderson.


Patriots most likely win, so they won&#x27;t be below their run attempts average from playing from behind, and if Henderson gets even a third of those 29 carries, he hits his over. Most importantly of all, again, 11/12 over this line, so I&#x27;m comfortable going back to the well. If Houston at full strength couldn&#x27;t hold back Henderson from getting his carries, neither can Denver with a backup QB.

Ajax take care of Volendam 2-0 and another <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> is a winner. It was tight but we keep winning.

2 winning days in a row too, this weekend is going extremely well. 

Let&#x27;s keep riding this momentum.

**Write Up:**

For <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> I am going back to the dutch league once again. It has been good to me so far and giving it some extra attention is the right thing to do and keep the streak alive.

Telstar are 8-2 with o2.5 goals and BTTS at home. 9-1 in BTTS by itself.

In 10 games they have a record of 1-4-5, scoring 17 goals and conceding 22 times. They attract goals at home and this match will be the same.

AZ Alkmaar away from home are 6-4 with BTTS and o2.5 goals. Only slightly favored for my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>.

In 10 games AZ Alkmaar has managed a 4-1-5 record. Scoring 14 and conceding 16 times.

Earlier this season the game ended 2-1 in favor of AZ. I can see the same happening <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Chance of more goals is higher than less goals too.

Telstar need every point to avoid relegation whilst AZ are in the race for top 3/4 and football in Europe next season.

This will be an open game and the streak will continue another day. It has been a very good weekend so far, time to end it on a high note too.

• Model says Seattle ML is at 55% 

• EV better betting 100$ = 8-11$ for this play

• I have never done a bet like this before, but the main reason for doing this is because of the history between these two teams: When you look at the L10 matchups between the two, 2 games have been won by 10+ while 8/10 have been within 10 points - The last two matchups, this year, have ended with the two following scores: 38-37 &amp; 21-19 - these two teams always play each other well and close, and I expect the same here tomorrow - On top of those H2H stats, this game is for all the marbles, NFC Championship - stakes will be a lot higher in this game than any other - I lean Seattle in this matchup. Any time Seattle is at Lumen, that gives them a small advantage, aka the 12th man - I feel like we don’t need to go into a lot of detail here about these two things: Seahawks defense &amp; Rams offense - Seahawks have one of the best defenses in the league, while the Rams have one of the best offensives in the league - This Seahawks offense is ranked 3rd in PPG while the Rams give up an average of 20.2 PPG - Seahawks D is #1 in the NFL in PPG on defense, while the Rams are #1 on offense for PPG - Unlike the 49ers vs Seahawks game, I don’t think Seattle’s D will be able to perform as good as they did against the 49ers here, where they themselves won Seattle that game - Between Mcvay, Stafford, Puka, and Adams, I see the Rams getting there’s regardless - but Seattle slows them down just enough - The one downside to this bet, is our man Sam Darnold - part of sits here and thinks about his playoff performances and how you can’t trust him, and the other part of me is thinking, well you have to give him the flowers where they are due, he has had a good year - Even if Seattle turns the ball over 1-3 times, their defense should still be able to limit the Rams offensive output - The stats and data point to a close matchup here, my gut tells me this comes down to a FG - again, if you cannot place this bet, please check the comment section for 2 alternatives

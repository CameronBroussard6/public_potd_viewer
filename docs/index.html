Last Pick: Chelsea ML vs Leeds

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: Over 2.5 goals, Villa v Arsenal 

Sport: Football, Premiership

Reasoning: Arsenal’s defensive absences plus Villa’s front-foot home style make this too open to stay under imo added to the mid week fixtures being played. Both sides arrive creating high-quality chances consistently. At evens I’m seeing this is a price above fair value.

Saturday’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> - Manchester City win and over 2.5 goals -155 (1.55u to win 1u)

Man City should handle business here, as they are -390 on the 3 way line. This is really a bet on how many goals they can score. Man City’s totals are higher than 2.5 goals in 4 of their last 5 and by themselves, they are averaging over 2 goals a game. I think they get 3 here. 

Good luck!</td></tr>

Event : Germany Bundesliga 🇩🇪

RB Leipzig vs Eintracht Frankfurt

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> : BTTS + Over 2.5 Goals @1.7 for 3u

Leipzig are second in the Bundesliga with 26 points and are a strong attacking team who will score multiple goals at home, while Frankfurt are 7th with 21 points and have a positive goal difference showing they score consistently whenever they play. Both teams have the quality to break through each other&#x27;s defenses because Frankfurt will not sit back defensively away from home and will try to win the match, meaning Leipzig&#x27;s attack will find space and Frankfurt&#x27;s attack will create chances as well. Leipzig have been in excellent form winning most of their home games and Frankfurt have scored against even tough opponents, so expecting both teams to score is very realistic and has happened in most recent meetings between these two clubs. The over 2.5 goals requirement is almost guaranteed because this is an open attacking match where both Leipzig and Frankfurt will try to win.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> 12/5/25: 2 leg parlay - Alabama +7.5 alt. spread &amp; Indiana +10.5 alt. spread (-112 FanDuel)

Event: Georgia @ Alabama 2:00MST &amp; Indiana @ Ohio St. 6:00MST

Write Up: It&#x27;s conference championship weekend and it&#x27;s going to be an exciting day watching these teams face off in these winners take all matchups.

With the first game on my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> I have Alabama covering the spread within a single possession touchdown in which I believe is a very winnable game outright for Bama. They have already beaten this Georgia team earlier in the season in a close game, away in Athens and I&#x27;m predicting this one to be a very close one as well. Both teams rank very similarly in offensive and defensive numbers this season, with the exception of the Bulldogs having an elite top 10 run defense. Even then, the Crimson Tide is more known for their passing game and I don&#x27;t believe the run game to be much of a factor for them coming into this game. Alabama is 8-3-1 against the spread this season and are 9-0 in their last 9 SEC championship appearances. This game has all the makings for a down to the wire finish in what feels like a coin flip matchup.

With my second leg I have Indiana covering within 10.5 points in this clash between the 1st and 2nd ranked teams in the nation, with what really feels like a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> em matchup. This matchup features the nation&#x27;s best scoring defense (7.8 PPG allowed) against the second best scoring offenses (44.3 PPG). While the Buckeyes are favored and have a 30-game winning streak against Indiana, the Hoosiers have an elite rushing attack and I believe they can control the clock and keep the Buckeyes offense off the field to keep this game within striking distance. So far this season Indiana has performed well against the spread with a 7-5 record and I believe they will be able to cover this line as well at a neutral site that is one hour north of their home stadium in Bloomington.

League - Prem

Game: Aston Villa VS Arsenal 

Time: 7:30 pm EST

**-----------------**

Villa are currently on fire with 5 wins in a row. I see them struggling to keep constant pressure on this Arsenal side, but more than enough to see us cover here.

With Ariel demons, Saliba, Gabriel, and Mosquera out tomorrow, Arsenal will struggle to defend those dead balls into the box as well as they normally do. Don&#x27;t see Villa getting too much space in the box which will naturally force them out wide and into corner opportunities. Wingbacks will have to adjust to the changes, which will cause more errors, leading to set-piece play.

**In Villas&#x27; last 10 Prem games, they&#x27;ve averaged 5.1 corners per game with this line hitting in 8/10 games (80%).**

**Anyway BOL!**</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Arsenal Over 4.5 Shots on target @ 1.83**

**Arsenal and Villa kick off an amazing Saturday of football with the early kickoff.**

We have an unstoppable force VS an immovable object here, Villa are unbeaten in their last 5 games, while Arsenal are currently on a 17-game unbeaten run.

I&#x27;m expecting a lot of pressure here from Arsenal tomorrow, considering the severity of the game. 3 points before the rest of the league kicks off is a statement that needs to be made. Arsenal have currently covered this line in 9 out of their last 10 games.

**Away from home, Arsenal have covered this line in 4 of their last 5 away games:**

**4, 7,  8,  5, 7**

Our player didn&#x27;t show up to play. Every point that needed a bit more endurance was getting sent to the net and the first serve percentage was around the mid 40s. The opponent was at a good level but this play was lost from the start with how Parks showed up yesterday.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** **Korpatsch vs Friedsam - Korpatsch ML @ 1.80**

Korpatsch has been showing up at a good level in this tournament and this play isn&#x27;t influenced by the fact that she was able to beat Parks playing at 30% of her level but by the fact that Korpatsch has been playing solid tennis and increasing her serve percentages as the tournament goes on. Friedsam is aggressive but struggled a lot against Sonmez in the last round, where she could have easily been knocked out of the tournament. I feel like there will be a lot of baseline rallies in this match and I favor Korpatsch to win this. These two faced each other in this tournament last year, with Korpatsch winning 2-0

Good luck!</td></tr>

Back after a long break, <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> i have a 2 leg parlay with BTTS+O2.5 in both games. Lets start with the first one, Stuttgart and Bayern. The monsters from Münich are very good this season, but they have not been flawless. They have conceeded in all of their last 6. They have cleared the O2.5 line in every single game this season except for one, which finished 2-0. Meanwhile Stuttgart have scored in every single home game this season and have hit O2.5 in 13 of the last 13 H2H with bayern. Next up we have a similar story in Barca. They are looking excelent this season, with an insane attack but also a subpar defense. They have conceeded in every single away game except for their first against mallorca this season, and scored in all of them except the one at Stamford Bridge. Betis have scored in all but 1 home game the whole season and we expect a lot of goals here. Barca has covered O2.5 in 17 straight games and i dont see it stopping <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Lock these plays in and lets cash together.

Event: NCAAB |  Iowa State @ Purdue | 12.00PM EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Over 150.5  @1.8 1u to win 0.8u

Write Up:  
 

im on the OVER 150.5 in Purdue vs iowa State, and it makes way too much sense when you look at how these two teams actually play. Purdue’s offense is one of the cleanest in the country efficient, well-spaced, and always generating high-quality shots inside or kick-outs. They’re averaging high-80s because they don’t waste possessions, and against Iowa State’s pace they’re going to get even more opportunities than usual. Iowa State doesn’t exactly slow the game down either. They’re sitting in the mid-90s per game because they run, attack early in the clock, and force a tempo that most teams struggle to match. Add that to Purdue’s tendency to play up to the pace of aggressive teams, and you suddenly have a game that’s naturally trending toward the mid-150s without either team needing an outlier shooting night.

 This matchup isn’t about whether one side clamps the other  it’s about two high-powered offenses trading efficient possessions, fueled by tempo and ball movement.</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>**Record:** 30-16-1 (+12.43u) 

**Last:** (CBB) Tennessee -6.5 (1u) - L

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** No. 2 Arizona (-7.5) vs No. 20 Auburn

**Start Time:** 10:00 PM ET (ESPN)

**Odds:** -120 (FanDuel)

**Units:** 1U

**Reasoning:** You’d be hard-pressed to find a team with a better resume thus far than Arizona.

After opening the season with an impressive 93-87 victory over then-No. 3 Florida, the Wildcats (7-0) also added wins over then-No. 3 UConn (71-67) and then-No. 15 UCLA (69-65). The team was just as impressive in its other four outings, winning by an average margin of 32 points. 

Conversely, results have been all over the map for Auburn to start the season.

The Tigers (7-2) opened the season with a scare against Bethune-Cookman, needing overtime to escape with a 95-90 victory as a 24.5-point favorite. The team rebounded to taken then-No. 1 Houston to the wire in a 73-72 loss before getting flat-out embarrassed against then-No. 7 Michigan, 102-72. Since then, Auburn has seemingly turned things around, shooting 60.8% from the field (56.7% from three-point range) over its last three halves, including a 55-point second half to knock off then-No. 14 St. John’s 85-74. 

However, don’t expect that offensive prowess to continue Saturday night.

Despite ranking quite impressively thus far—27th in offensive efficiency (1.195), 35th in scoring 87.9 PPG), 43rd in field-goal percentage (49.2%) and 121st in three-point shooting (35.1%)—the Tigers have only faced two defensive units that rank Top 75 in defensive efficiency. In those two games (Houston, Michigan), the team shot a combined 44-of-120 from the field (36.7%). Look for it to be another frustrating shooting night against a stifling Arizona defensive unit that ranks 24th in defensive efficiency (0.908), 41st in scoring defense (67.0 PPGA), 56th in opponent field-goal percentage (40.5%) and 168th in opponent three-point shooting (32.7%). 

On the other end of the floor, look for the Wildcats offense to take whatever it wants.

Through seven games, the unit ranks 12th in field-goal percentage (51.8%), 33rd in offensive efficiency (1.183), 37th in scoring (87.3 PPG) and 64th in three-point shooting (37.2%). That could be a cause for concern for an Auburn defensive unit that ranks just 131st in defensive efficiency (1.012) while also ranking 79th in opponent field-goal percentage (41.5%), 153rd in opponent three-point shooting (32.4%) and 167th in scoring defense (74.4 PPGA). Look for the Wildcats to take advantage on the break, where they rank 27th in fast break points (16.3 PPG; 93rd percentile) while the Tigers rank just 202nd in opponent fast break points (11.1 PPG; 45th percentile). 

The battle on the glass should prove to be a major X factor in this one.

Arizona dominates the boards on both ends of the floor, ranking 15th in total rebounding (42.6 per game), 20th in offensive rebounding (12.6) and 26th in defensive rebounding (27.0) while ranking 3rd in opponent defensive rebounding (17.1), 15th in opponent total rebounding (29.7) and 90th in opponent offensive rebounding (8.1). Meanwhile, Auburn ranks 46th in offensive rebounding (23.9), 58th in total rebounding (39.3) and 112th in defensive rebounding (23.9) while ranking 52nd in opponent defensive rebounding (19.9), 105th in opponent total rebounding (33.7) and 243rd in opponent offensive rebounding (9.8). To add insult to injury, the Tigers struggle to defend the paint, ranking 144th in points in the paint allowed (30.9 PPG; 61st percentile). That will be a major issue against a Wildcats offense that ranks 3rd in the category (46.6 PPG, 99th percentile). 

Taking care of the ball will also be crucial for Arizona.

Thus far, the team has struggled to play clean basketball, ranking 192nd in turnovers per possession (17.4%), 199th in opponent steals (7.0 per game) and 224th in turnovers (12.9). Although Auburn ranks 51st in steals (8.6), the team only ranks 122nd in turnovers forced (13.2) and 136th in turnovers forced per possession (18.0%). This could go a long way in deciding if the Wildcats can cover the number. 

Trust Arizona to show out in front of the home crowd.

BOL if tailing, and as always please do so responsibly. One bet should NOT lead to a crash out.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: CBB St. Bonaventure ML vs. Buffalo / CFB Texas Tech ML vs. BYU (2.50$ TO WIN 1.85$)**

Write up: This is not a model play FYI - this is a personal bet.

• ⁠Buffalo has put their name on the map this year because for the first time ever, they are 8-0 - they had two good wins, Depaul &amp; Vermont

• ⁠This is MID-MAJOR basketball; anything can happen of course. I believe St. Bonaventure is MILES better than UB, but because of the rivalry and them being on the road, I believe this is why the line is lower than it should be 

• Buffalo have 3 guys, Freitag being their #1, the Wisconsin transfer - if Bonaventure can hold him to less than 20 points, I believe they have a big chance of winning


• Bonaventure is deep, playing around 8-10 per game - the bench guys have come up clutch for them when they needed too, and their bench is pretty darn good for being a mid-major program - between Buddy Simmons, Frank Mitchell, Lonati, Charles, Big Joe, and Marshall, Bonaventure have the weapons to beat up on Buffalo


* I do not see anyone stopping Bonaventure&#x27;s big, Frank Mitchell, and if they do, Bonaventure has enough fire power around him to win them the game - if Bonaventure can slow Buffalo&#x27;s scorer&#x27;s down just a touch, they will roll
* The model is projecting Texas Tech to cover, so I added them as the ML 2nd leg - Bonaventure is only -4 favorites so their ML should be in the 200&#x27;s something

Let&#x27;s keep rolling.

BOL!

FYI, this match is Wednesday in Australia, but it’s Tuesday night in the U.S., so you’ll have to get in quick.

Borges has a 2-0 ATP record against Jordan Thompson. He made it to the 4th round of the Australian Open in 2024 and the 3rd round last year, so he has been here before and has a good opportunity to match the points he earns here last year. I like this matchup and spot in the tournament for him.

I’m pairing this with Tiafoe, who is going up agaisnt Comesama. He hasn’t had a ton of success at this tournament in the past and only had a 10-15 ATP record on hard court in his career.

Good Luck!</td></tr>

* Still very early in the LPL split so hard to go off specific stats about kills, this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> is 50% gut feeling/instincts about what I know about the players and 50% based on early indications I&#x27;ve seen from both teams matches both so far in LPL and at Demacia Cup 2025.
* Bulldog to me is just a better mid liner then Tangyuan, despite his struggles in Korea, bulldog got to play against all of the best mid laners in the world, chovy, faker, showmaker, zeka etc. He was consistently a very high ranked and highly touted mid laner who was mostly set up to fail on his team in Korea. Since moving to LPL he has a nice roster with a very aggressive jungle in Croco. He has looked much better so far, still a bit passive in losses, but has looked much better with Croco and been playing very well in wins overall
* Tangyuan on the other hand really hasn&#x27;t impressed me from what I have seen, his tape isn&#x27;t great, he hasn&#x27;t looked great in lane across the board, he had decent showing at Demacia Cup but nothing that blew me away
* LNG are coming into this match at -240 favorites, in most 90%+ of cases it feels like the winning team is going to have the mid lane with higher kills, so their already feels like some inherent value at -160 with them being -240 to win the match. On top of this, Bulldog has a decently higher DMG% and better laning stats overall as a player. 
* While small sample size, Bulldog is averaging 3.5 kills per map this split which is 5th most amongst mid laners while Tangyuan is averaging 2.5 kills per map the 3rd lowest of active mid laners
* Think this meta fits Bulldog&#x27;s champ pool extremely well, think LNG are going to take this one down, have felt really good about this LNG roster since it was announced and I think they are going to move to their 2nd win tonight</td></tr>

Last pick: Anthony Edwards over 3.5 3PT (pending) 


Event: Pacers at Celtics 


<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Aaron Nesmith under 15.5 points. (-130)


Write Up: I had to double take on this one because the line seems bonkers. Nesmith has only covered this total in 2/L14 games. He&#x27;s been missing some games, but in those last 14 games he&#x27;s played, he&#x27;s been getting mostly full minutes. 


He did put up great numbers at the beginning of the year, but it&#x27;s been a while since he&#x27;s regularly been in double digits. Even if you factor in the earlier games though, his season average is only 13.5. I just don&#x27;t see many players going over their averages AT Boston, ones of the top defenses in the league. His last game against Boston he only got 6 points in 32 minutes of action. And that was at home. 


It seems crazy to me to say someone will go a full 2 points over their season average and a full 5 points over their last ten games average on the road against a top defense like Boston. 


Maybe Vegas knows something I don&#x27;t, but I&#x27;m betting against him having one of his best games in months against Boston.

**Football | UEFA Champions League | 04:00 AM (GMT+8)**

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Chelsea Vs Pafos - **Chelsea Win to Nil @ 1.85 (Melbet)**

**Write Up:** Chelsea welcome Pafos to Stamford Bridge knowing that control and discipline should be enough to secure a positive result. They come into this match with strong attacking numbers in the competition, while also showing improved game management against lower-ranked opposition. Pafos arrive after mixed European performances that have exposed their limitations against elite sides. Although they can stay compact for periods, the step up in quality and tempo makes this a very tough assignment, especially away from home.

Chelsea’s Champions League campaign has been solid, with 3 wins, 1 draw and 2 losses, scoring 13 goals and conceding 8 (2.17 goals per game), leaving them 13th in the League Stage. Recent form across all competitions is mixed (2W, 2D, 2L), averaging 2.17 scored and 1.50 conceded, while at Stamford Bridge they’ve gone 1W, 1D, 1L in their last three with 57% possession. Historically, home advantage is a major strength as Chelsea have won 68% of their last 40 home matches, are unbeaten in 34 of those, and have kept 15 clean sheets in their last 31 home games in this competition.

Pafos’ recent Champions League matches show how tough this level has been for them. Away from home, they were beaten 2-0 by Juventus and suffered a 5-1 loss to Bayern Munich, games where their defence struggled once the pressure kept coming. Those results highlighted how vulnerable they can be when faced with fast, aggressive teams.

Their better performances came when they managed to slow the game down, like the 1-0 win over Villarreal and the 2-2 draw with Monaco. However, against high-intensity sides on the road, Pafos have found it hard to create chances consistently. When they don’t take the few opportunities they get, they often end up under pressure and exposed once they go behind.

Chelsea’s recent Champions League results show a team becoming more balanced. After a tight 2-1 away loss to Atalanta, they responded strongly at home with convincing wins, including 3-0 against Barcelona and 5-1 over Ajax. Even the narrow 1-0 win against Benfica highlighted their patience and control, rather than a need to rush attacks. Chelsea have scored in each of their last five matches and have kept clean sheets in two of their last three home games. While conceding on the road remains a concern, their defensive setup at Stamford Bridge has looked far more solid and dependable.

Chelsea should be well placed to claim a comfortable win here, especially at home where they have shown strong control and an ability to limit chances against less attacking sides. Pafos’ recent away defeats to Juventus and Bayern Munich highlight how difficult it has been for them to break down top-level opposition, which makes a Chelsea clean sheet a realistic outcome.

While Pafos have competed well against respected European teams this season, a trip to Stamford Bridge looks a step too far. Even with rotation, Chelsea should have enough quality to exploit Pafos’ defensive issues and keep themselves firmly on track in the push for a top-eight finish.

Event: CBB | Western Carolina @ Mercer (7 pm EST) | 🏀

*Recap: Back-to-back-to-back shit picks. You should absolutely fade me at this point. Derrick White missed his first seven shots, then finishes the game 1-for-11 from the floor and 0-for-6 from 3. He even threw in a missed free throw for good measure. Talk about ice cold. He got nine boards and five dimes, but couldn&#x27;t throw it in the ocean. Onward...*

First, this is a two-unit play - my first since starting this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> experiment. I feel like I gotta press a little with this terrible recent run. (Degenerate move, right? I&#x27;m just sayin&#x27;, you should fade me) Second, this is 100 percent a trend bet.

What if I told you the best NCAA team against the spread hails from Macon, Georgia? Know this: Mercer (12-7) is 14-2 against the spread. Vegas has been underestimating them all year. Mercer&#x27;s opponent tonight, Western Carolina (6-11), is 5-10 ATS. This game marks just the third time in 10 years that Mercer is at least a 9.5-point favorite against the Catamounts. The other two times? The Bears covered. Mercer was a 10.5-point favorite on March 1, 2025 and eked out a cover (81-69). This season, WCU is 2-6 ATS when it&#x27;s been an underdog of at 9.5 points. The Catamounts&#x27; only covers were Georgia (+32.5 - lost by 30) and Chattanooga (+16.5 - lost by 8). Furthermore, WCU is 2-8 ATS on the road. Meanwhile, Mercer is on a four-game win streak, and they&#x27;ve covered the spread in five straight games.

Even better, Mercer is 5-0 ATS at home! Not only are they covering, but they are crushing expectations. On average, Mercer is clearing the home spread by 8.3 points. The Bears have averaged 104 points over their last three home games - a 38-point win over The Citadel (Mercer was a 15.5 favorite), a 12-point win over Wofford (Mercer was a 4.5 favorite), and a 10-point win over UNC Greensboro (Mercer was a 5.5-point favorite). Overall, Mercer is 8-0 at home. Meanwhile, WCU is 3-7 straight up over its last 10 games. Mercer ranks third in the Southern Conference in offensive efficiency. WCU is ninth out of 10 teams. KenPom has Mercer&#x27;s adjusted tempo rated 71st - 58 spots ahead of WCU. The Bears simply have the pace, better shooting, and better passing numbers to get it done against WCU. They also rank 39th in the NCAA in steals. WCU already gives it up (249th in the NCAA in turnovers). Between the opportunistic defense and the faster run of play, I see Mercer getting enough extra possessions to cover.

KenPom has this as an 81-71 win for Mercer, and an 81 percent chance of winning. KenPom also rates WCU&#x27;s defense at 304th while Mercer&#x27;s offense is 100th. Two units down. Give me the hot hand. Give me Mercer, at home, to cover yet again. Plus, there&#x27;s a ton of incentive. The Bears are tied for second in the SoCon, just one game back of ETSU. Let&#x27;s Macon this a good bet and snap a three-day losing streak.

Good luck and Godspeed!

<tr><td class='post'>Record 6-2 

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: SGA over 29.5 and New York Knicks ML**

I like this spot for SGA when Jalen Williams is out as he becomes the number 1 option and there is not going to be any hockey passes. For example I mean if someone is hounded maybe SGA will have to pass it off to Jalen and they make a play through that, for example SGA doubled passes to Jalen/Isiah Hartenstein who will hockey it off to Holmgreen or a shooter. With him out and potentially Caruso, the only real play maker is Ajay Mitchel who could definitely be doing this exact scenario. But it&#x27;s more so when Ajay Mitchel is benched, I&#x27;m not sure who else would be able to make a play. 

The Bucks currently are also one of the worst defensive teams and are bottom 3 in points allowed to PGs. I&#x27;m not too concerned about a blow out as OKC struggles on the boards and suck at guarding threes which is what all these Bucks players do besides Giannis. Obviously I could be wrong and it&#x27;s a case of them hitting or missing all their shots etc but I give a blow out chance maybe a 30 percent chance. As when your NBA champions it usually makes all teams lock in when they have to play vs them. More so I think the effort will be a lot higher then OKC tbh however their defense scheme of swarming could lead to them turning it over a lot.

Analysis would be SGA has hit 30 Points in 17/20 games without Jalen Williams and his last 2 games in 2025 was 22 minutes 34 points and 34 minutes and 31 points. I think the main concerns are double teams but even then the Bucks have been fouling a lot it seems to me. And this man loves to get to the stripe.

Knicks im taking as ML because currently they are so bad that they are literally talking about trading KAT and I really do not see them trading him when Brunson took a pay cut for him lmfao. Brunson was also pretty rusty and I&#x27;m fairly sure he rushed back when he was still injured.

Honestly you could take SGA as a straight at 31.5 if you&#x27;re not a big parlay kinda guy which I get as well. Or you could also change the Knicks ML as they have been pretty stinky.</td></tr>

Writeup: Aubameyang has registered seven goal contributions across his six appearances in the Champions League this term, including netting three goals. He’s achieved this tally from 17 shots in the competition, working out to an average of 2.89 shots per 90. Aubameyang has had 2+ shots in four of his last five Champions League appearances, managing eight shots in one of these games. Aubameyang scored twice from eight shots in Marseille’s most recent home game in the Champions League, as they claimed a 2-1 win over Newcastle

These odds need shopping, so if you dont find it, 1+ SoT is at around 1.5 to 1.6 odds, which i would say is still decent shout out

Event: TNT Tropang Giga vs.San Miguel Beermen | 6:30 AM EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: San Miguel Beermen -2.5 @ 1.80 (5u)


Write Up:

This spread feels too short for the most dominant team in the league. TNT is always dangerous with their guard play and pace, but they simply don&#x27;t have an answer for June Mar Fajardo down low. When the game slows down in the 4th quarter, SMB’s ability to dump it into the post generates high-percentage shots, while TNT often lives and dies by the three. San Miguel has the deeper bench and the championship pedigree to handle big games. I expect them to control the rebounding battle and wear TNT down physically.

**---**

We’re going full 180 on this one, backing Barcelona and Slavia here to cover the corner line. With Barça sitting in a dangerous 15th place and only two games left, they need to push from the opening whistle for all three points and goal difference.

Slavia have enough pride to hold their own at home, but that likely means a low block and defensive doubling, which should naturally produce corners.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Moises Caicedo 1+ SOT (+105) 1 unit to win 1.05 units

**Write Up:** Well we had half the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> right, over 3.5 goals hit. Haaland didn’t show up. He whiffed a few great chances where he normally finds the back of the net. The Rodri red card didn&#x27;t help either. 

Back to my picking roots here as we take another Chelsea midfielder to land a shot on target. Chelsea host Pafos, the 2nd place team in the Cypriot First Division (Cyprus) in the UEFA Champion&#x27;s League. This will be Chelsea&#x27;s first UCL match under their new manager, and the club would love a win here to pull themselves into the top 8. Chelsea have all sorts of illnesses and injuries going on, so as always **please consider waiting for lineups if your book does not void for players not starting.** However, I do believe Caicedo will feature with Enzo questionable after reportedly playing their weekend match very ill and James reportedly nursing another injury. I also expect Palmer to be rested here for this heavily rotated team. 

Missing many key players, Caicedo will likely be asked to play further forward than normal. Coach Rosenior has also been pushing all of his midfielders to push forward. Caicedo is typically a more defensive midfielder, which gave Enzo room to roam. Again, I&#x27;m expecting this to change for this match much like the position we saw him play against Fulham after the early red card, where he had 2 SOTs playing 10v11. The other reason I like this play is that Caicedo has been known to pull the trigger on long shots from distance, usually pretty accurately. The fans also encourage this, and I expect him to take a bit more shooting risk against a team Chelsea should beat. 

Pafos allow the 8th most SOTs in the UCL, averaging 6 per game. Interestingly enough they allow the most shots per game (21). An extreme example, Bayern Munich on the road at Pafos had 15 SOTs on 26 shots. Juventus at home took 25 shots. Pafos tend to run a low block and encourage shots from distance, this is where I expect Caicedo to find his shots. This should be teed up perfectly for Caicedo to land at least one SOT. 

BOL and happy Wednesday!</td></tr>

I’ve been around long enough to spot these games early. Al Khor always try to play, even when they shouldn’t, and that leaves space everywhere.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> just keeps on hitting. From 1-8 to 7-9. We are on a roll and are officially in the green. I still have a ton of faith this year and am looking forward in sharing it with you fine ladies and gentlemen. 

All 3 goals hit very late in the match but a win is a win. Nailbiter wins are as sweet as heartbreak losses are bittersweet. 

Sadly I wasn&#x27;t able to watch the game myself as I had date night but coming back to a win is always welcome. 

**Write Up:** 

A 3U play and we&#x27;re going all the way to Azerbaijan for it. 

Just like yesterday I am of the opinion that both teams are playing for something here. 

Qarabag is very decent at home in the Champions League this season. Scoring twice in all 3 home matches but going 1-1-1 overall with 6 goals scored and 6 against. 

They will fancy their chances vs a &quot;weak&quot; Eintracht Frankfurt. 

Eintracht Frankfurt has gone 0-1-2 away in the Champions League this season with 2 scored and 7 against. 

With 4 points out of 6 games they may seem eliminated but here is why I think they will act like they still have a chance. 

Their schedule so far has been a single win vs Galatasaray, a draw vs Napoli and losses vs Atletico Madrid, Liverpool, Atalanta and Barcelona. 

A lot of big dogs in Europe whilst their remaining 2 matches are against Qarabag <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> and Tottenham at home. 

They require a win here to keep their CL dream alive. 

The 2-7 goalscoring record might not look promising either but in the Bundesliga their 10 away games saw 50 goals with a 23-27 split. 

There is insane potential in this match and I expect another success.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Slavia Prague +1.5 Asian Handicap, +105, 4 units

**Write Up:** We&#x27;re coming right back to take another hit at Barcelona while they&#x27;re vulnerable. They head into what promises to be a tough game against the Czech side, Slavia Prague, on the back of a **tough defeat** to a midtable Sociedad team, and without **Yamal, who&#x27;s suspended** for the clash, as well as a questionable **Raphinha, just coming back from injury**. **Cancelo is also not registered** for the Champions League.

*Slavia Prague might not be doing amazingly well in the Champions League this season,* but they&#x27;re a team more than capable of causing an upset against a shaken up Barcelona that can&#x27;t catch any rest. They&#x27;re still **unbeaten in their domestic league,** which *admittedly isn&#x27;t nearly as strong as the Spanish one,* but it still features very respectable teams that produce players that then go on to play in the big leagues for big money. They&#x27;ve **scored over 2 goals a game (41 in 19), while conceding at a rate of less than a goal per game (16 in 19),** proving just how stable they are on both ends of the pitch. The same absolutely cannot be said for **Barca, as their defence routinely lets them down** and this has been especially apparent in Champions League this season as they&#x27;ve already dropped **points in three games,** meaning they have a measly **win rate of just 50%.** On the Czech side, Provod has been Slavia&#x27;s main man this season, notching up **15 G/A in 26 apps,** and he&#x27;ll be looking to torment the shakey Barcelona defence. Remember the name.

Having said all that, I still think *Slavia need a bit of a helping hand* and that&#x27;s where the AH comes into play. We&#x27;re making sure the bet wins even in case of a narrow loss, and while I think Barcelona are definitely capable of beating Slavia <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, I just can&#x27;t see them winning by more than a goal away from home. Let me tell you, these Eastern European sides are on a different level when a big team shows up in the Champions League, being able to grind out results at home time and time again. A low scoring draw seems like the most likely outcome to me, so you can also experiment with that. It seems like last weekend was the weekend of underdogs and the start of the week seems to have followed this trend, with teams like Manchester City, PSG, Napoli, Bayer Leverkusen, Dortmund all being shocked by weaker teams on paper, and I think Barcelona are next to follow suit. The Dro drama really doesn&#x27;t help them either. Confidence is high so I&#x27;m laying four whole units on this play. BOL and may the best team win ☘️🫡</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>**Record:** 39-18-1 (+22.32u) | L5: 5-0 (5W)

**Last:** (CBB) Michigan State -10.5 (1.5u) - Pending

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** (CBB) No. 7 Nebraska (-11.5) vs Washington 

**Start Time:** 9:00 PM ET (BTN)

**Odds:** -110 (DraftKings)

**Units:** 1.5U

**Reasoning:** They say all good things come to an end. But as far as Nebraska’s unbeaten season is considered, that conclusion won’t be coming on Wednesday night. 

The Huskers (18-0) have easily been the story of the season. Not only is the team’s 18-0 start the best in program history, its 21-game win streak is the longest active streak in the nation. Not to mention, this is already a battle-tested Nebraska squad that has captured five Quad 1 wins—tied for fourth nationally—and five Quad 2 victories. 

But it’s not just that the team is winning games, it’s how it’s doing it. 

The Cornhuskers are flat out dominating opponents. The team has seven victories by 19 points or more—including its last two against Oregon and Northwestern—and has now covered in each of its last four games by an average margin of +13.75 points. In fact, in games with a spread of -13.5 or less, Nebraska is 9-1-1 ATS. 

The team can thank a suffocating defense for much of that success.

Through 18 games, the Cornhuskers rank 5th in opponent field-goal percentage (38.8%), 14th in scoring defense (65.3 PPGA), 15th in defensive efficiency (0.931) and 52nd in opponent three-point shooting (30.7%). Furthermore, the team has held 12 of its 18 opponents to under 1.0 points per possessions. But Nebraska really seems to get an additional spark when playing in front of the home fans, ranking 3rd in defensive efficiency (0.826), 3rd in opponent field-goal percentage (34.6%), 4th in scoring defense (57.8 PPGA) and 40th in opponent three-point shooting (28.2%) in 12 home games. That could prove devastating to a middle of the pack Washington offense that ranks 89th in scoring (80.1 PPG), 96th in offensive efficiency (1.102), 157th in field-goal percentage (45.1%) and 312th in three-point shooting (30.7%). Not to mention, the team averages just 75.5 points per game on 42.1% shooting (29.9% from beyond the arc) away from home. 

Unfortunately, the Huskies (10-8) might find themselves undermanned on the other end of the floor, as well. 

Thus far, Washington ranks 87th in opponent three-point shooting (31.7%), 107th in defensive efficiency (1.018), 110th in opponent field-goal percentage (43.2%) and 149th in scoring defense (74.0 PPGA). That should provide a dangerous Cornhuskers offense—38th in offensive efficiency (1.160), 58th in field-goal percentage (47.4%), 65th in scoring (81.4 PPG) and 91st in three-point shooting (35.5%)—plenty of openings to pounce. Furthermore, this is an offense that seems to be gelling as of late, averaging 83.3 points on 50.9% shooting (43.8% from deep) over its last three games. Junior forward Pryce Sandfort (16.7 PPG) has been leading that charge, averaging 25 points on 57% shooting over the last two games. 

But the X factor in this one will come down to turnovers. Or lack there of.

On the season, Nebraska has played some of the cleanest basketball in the country, ranking 4th in turnovers (9.1 per game), 8th in turnovers per possession (12.9%) and 8th in opponent steals (4.9). Believe it or not, over the team’s last three games, those numbers have free-fallen, dropping to 6.3, 9.8% and 2.7 respectively. Against a lesser-talented Huskies defense (272nd in turnovers forced) that will need to rely on creating turnovers to keep this close, that should prove to be the nail in the coffin. 

Trust the Huskers to keep on rolling.

We are talking about two teams that belong in both of the biggest offensive leagues in the world, both the EPL and the Eredivisie. Curiously enough, I found that in the last 5 games in UCL that both included an Eredivisie team and an EPL team, BTTS and O 2.5 has hit in all five games. I also believe this is a bet that revolves around if PSV can be competent enough vs a superior team from a superior league. They scored twice vs Atletico de Madrid, four times vs Liverpool, and a whopping six times vs Napoli. I consider all of those teams to be better than Newcastle nowadays. 

BOL and tail responsibly, as always.

Pafos have covered this line in 4/6 games away in the CL, with 17, 10, 9, 17, 7, 12, considering they didn&#x27;t face very strong sides, only Juve where there were 17.</td></tr>

**Write Up:** Back at it <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> with probably one of my most confident plays since I started posting <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>, hence the increase in units.    
    
This horse ROYAL RENDEZVOUS is a star in the making and its first 2 starts have been huge. First up with no market expectation, it sat worse than midfield and unleashed a massive turn of foot to win softly on the line, beating a horse who came out and won its next start by almost 3 lengths.    
    
Last start was a horror watch. Forced back to last from a bad barrier, and had traffic problems in the straight until it was way too late. Still had the turn of foot to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> up really late and rattle off some seriously impressive sectionals to finish 4th, beaten just over a length. This race in particular was a strong Saturday class race containing some very good horses.    
    
We now go from an on pace bias track of Geelong, to a wide open Sandown that heavily favours our racing style, plus we get an increase of 200m. Drawn perfectly in barrier 4, I imagine D Lane just sits midfield or even a touch worse, and with the long straight we have ample time to unleash our run down the middle and get over the top.    
    
I’m very big on sectionals/race splits and I can’t begin to describe how big this horse’s 400-200 and last 200m splits have been. To be running home this fast is the trait of a well above average horse, and I think up in distance + a more suitable track, RR is set to explode here. GL!

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** ATP: Aus Open - Tomas Martin Etcheverry H2H v Arthur Fery $1.68 3U 12:00PM AEDT

We backed Etcheverry in Round 1 against Kecmanovic and he now plays a less polished player in Arthur Fery.

Fery has had a pretty easy run into the Open only facing one top-100 opponent in Cobolli. Cobolli was pretty average at the United Cup and was suffering from diarrhoea apparently in the match. Wont read much into it.

Fery is known for his agressive baseline play but he lacks a serve that delivers punch. His 1st serve win %&#x27;s are only slightly higher than his second. The problem with that is, he now faces a guy that was already a dominant baseline player with a huge first serve that he wins on average 75%+ of the time.

Etcheverry has played 5 top 100 players to start the year and his service game has been solid winning 74% of 1st service games and 57% of second service games over that span against opponents much better than Fery.

It&#x27;s difficult to see where Fery has an advantage here given Etcheverry is a natural clay court player who has developed significantly on hard courts i.e. he knows how to construct a point in rallies and break down baseline players (again, Fery&#x27;s biggest strength).

Only reason this isn&#x27;t a 4U or 5U play is that Etcheverry has gone the distance in his last 3 games, including the 5 setter against Kecmanovic.

As always, bet this on a book that pays out the winner on retirement and voids bets on the retiring player.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Daniil Medvedev 🇷🇺 -6.5 games handicap vs Quentin Halys 🇫🇷 5 units to win 4.2U @1.83 (Bet365)

Yes I know I’m betting on Medvedev in a grand slam match. He went an atrocious 1-4 in slams last year and his only win was against some guy ranked outside the top 300. But as they say it’s new year new me for Daniil. The former word No. 1 and three time finalist at the Australian Open finally sacked his coach after eight years together after the US Open and both his results and performances have improved since then. He won Almaty at the end of last year and  comfortably won Brisbane to start off his 2026. I feel like he’s getting closer to his best in terms of his baseline skills and is FINALLY starting to come to the net and finish points early. Medvedev’s ability to turn defence into offence is a joke which makes it very difficult to break him down. To be honest his first round was fairly unconvincing despite the straight set victory but to me it seemed more like a mental barrier from last year’s nightmare and he really grew into the match as it went on, applying more pressure to De Jong and limiting unforced errors. I expect him to carry on playing looser and continue his good form now that he won that. So what’s the one problem with Medvedev? His second serve is really bad. I mean seriously bad (as good as his first serve is) which caused him to break down when serving for the match twice against De Jong.

Not to worry though, I introduce Quentin Halys the third worst returner on the ATP tour (according to the return quality stats) just ahead of Mpetshi Perricard and Opelka so the main issue is out of the way. The No. 83 can produce some good tennis at time but his low margin big hitting game causes huge periods of inconsistency. One week he was taking Rune to a fifth set at the French Open and the other he was on a 9 match losing streak losing to Bellucci 4 and 2. To be fair he’s had a pretty good start to the season going 7-2 including qualifiers and crushed Tabilo in round 1. So you may wonder why the handicap, well the match-up is simply the worst possible for Halys. His game is primarily driven through his excellent first serve + one combo but Medvedev’s comically deep return position and quality nullify this. As soon as a rally starts to be imposed (far from his forte) the errors will start to leak against a human backboard and his lack of movement exposed by one of the best movers on tour. Halys struggles in the physical matches and when every point will start to feel more and more like a grind, Medvedev should start to easily pull away. The only way he can keep this match close is if his first serve percentage stays high (8th best 1st serve% won on tour, 70th 2nd serve% which shows the disparity) as he will be crucified on second serves by the Russian. It was only 56% in round one and against the 5th best 2nd serve% returner that is a death sentence. 

Halys easily lost in his two matches over top 40 opposition (4,2 in both) this year and lost by the same score last time he faced Daniil on hard courts. They also faced last year on grass where Medvedev won against 2,5. If you had asked me to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> the worst opponent for Halys in the ATP I toughest probably have said Medvedev which is why I like this play. BOL !</td></tr>

Write up: 11 straight W’s in a row, just wow, this run has been so much fun, and I hope you all are enjoying it as much as I am - Model has this as the highest confident Edge % and EV % for the day. Will add some personal information in this write-up as well.

• ⁠Model has Syracuse -2.5 at 55%

• Model projects Syracuse ML at 58% 

• EV better betting 100$ = 10-11$ for this play

• Before anyone says something, yes I’m aware, Syracuse just lost to Boston College - I believe Syracuse has a home edge in this one - they seem to play their best ball at home, and to be honest, they look a lot better at home, some games being night and day different - Syracuse is 9-2 at home this year, while VT is only 1-2 on the road, with their only road W being @ South Carolina (10-8) - In VT’s two road loses, SMU (buzzer beater) &amp; Wake Forest, they played well &amp; lost close games in both - While Virginia Tech’s offense is a high scoring one, I think Syracuses top 40 defense, top 30 at home, can slow them down a touch - Syracuse averages right around 80 PPG at home while holding away teams to just under 70 PPG - Syracuse covers at home at a nice percentage of 63%, which is important to note, regardless of their record - A fun statistic that stands out in this one is VT turns the ball over around 11 T/Os per game while Syracuse defense forces roughly 14 turnovers a game - VT shoots a whopping 48% from the field in the ACC, but when they are playing on their home court - this number drops down to 42% during road ACC games - Surprisingly, Syracuse averages almost the same amount of points scored in both halves as VT (38-40PPG per half) - I like the chances here with Syracuse’s home court advantage, them coming off a brutal ACC lose, and them playing their best ball in the dome.. Syracuse -2.5 to hopefully continue our win streak

Last POTD: 🏀 Tennessee -6.5 (-110).

Writeup: So Michigan State was able to blow out their opponent, but Tennessee couldn’t even win. Really rough couple of weeks for us, hoping to turn this around

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: 🏈 George Pickens longest reception over 25.5 yards (-115).

Game starts at 8:15pm EST. Bet 2.25U

Writeup: For Thursday Night Football, we have the Detroit Lions hosting the Dallas Cowboys. Both of these offenses are incredibly explosive, with the Cowboys offense being on fire recently thanks to being one of really only 3 teams in the NFL who have 2 star WRs on the same team. While CeeDee Lamb was the main beneficiary of this offensive success last week, George Pickens has actually been the one who I’ve found to be more impressive over the last month. Pickens has hit this number in his past 3 games, and Lamb has hit this number in 4 of his past 5 games. While it may feel like a coin flip as to who to select, the selection comes down to defensive matchup. The Lions have been playing a lot of man defense this year, and George Pickens is averaging twice as many yards per play as Lamb against man coverage. Additionally, the Lions have been one of the worst defenses in the league against explosive plays, and have given up a reception of this yardage every single game this season. While I do think the Cowboys can keep this game close, I think there is a good chance that the Lions have gotten a wake-up call and realize they need to play at an even higher level to make it into the playoffs. They could have a decent lead in this game, thus causing the Cowboys to throw even more and giving us more opportunities for Pickens to catch a reception of 26 or more yards.

Remember to only bet what you can afford to lose, and BOL!</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Dallas Cowboys ML (+140) 3u

Write up: Take this with a grain of salt as I am a Lions fan so could potentially be over dramatic, but I feel pretty good about this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. 

Yes, the Lions are at home, and yes, Dan Campbell hasn’t lost two in a row in years. However, I feel pretty confident that this Lions defense won’t have many answers for this red hot Dallas offense and I don’t think the Lions currently have an offense that is at a level where it can bail them out against good teams. 

No stats here, but I know from watching that the Lions play A LOT of man coverage and currently aren’t getting home at all with their pass rush. Couple those two features with the fact that they have to find a way to shut down Pickens AND Lamb AND all the other Cowboy weapons makes it hard to believe the Cowboys dont put up 30+ points. Also, the Lions number one cover corner just got placed on IR and their all pro safety has been out for a handful of weeks and won’t be returning tomorrow. 

On offense, the Lions have an O line that is currently serviceable in run blocking, but not so much in pass blocking. They have a QB in Goff who has little to no ability to make anything happen without a clean pocket, are missing their top 3 tight ends, and might be missing a couple of O linemen AND Amonra. 

Again, maybe I see more of a dumpster fire than a non-lions fan would, but really the only way I see the Lions pulling this one out would be behind another 250+ yard performance from Gibbs which I am not going to be putting money on. 

BOL to all bettors!</td></tr>

Event: Cowboys @ Lions 6:15MST

Write Up: The playoff race is getting tight and these two teams are still searching for their spot into the NFC. One team is trending upwards and the other heading the other direction. I know a lot of people will be looking to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> up all of the wide receiver props this game which I believe will turn out to be good picks in what has the makings to be a high scoring offensive affair. But Javonte Williams has certainly found his stride in the Dallas backfield this season and I believe he has a big game upcoming this week. 

Javonte Williams is a true workhorse, he currently ranks 1st in the league in snap share with 52.2 snaps per game. He currently averages 16.5 carries per game with the highest YPC average in his career (4.8).

Although the Lions have been a top ranked run defender throughout this season, they have been leaky in their last 3. Over that span they have been allowing 131 yards average per game and over 52% of their opponents offensive snaps were runs. 

Williams has hit the over in rushing yards in 9/12 games this year and I predict with his usage alone he will clear this line.

Are the Cowboys are good? We’re expecting a lot of points here in this one (Dak Prescott o1.5 passing TDs is -181). I like one of those to go to Pickens. The Lions play a lot of man defense, which you gotta like if you’ve been watching Pickens this year.

Write Up:

We’re back at it after Manchester City couldn’t get the job done, bringing the record to 1-1. For <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today’s pick</mark> I’m heading to the Netherlands again, where the numbers point strongly in one direction: goals.

De Graafschap’s last four away games have been absolute chaos, producing 19 goals in total. That’s an average of 4.75 goals per match, with over 3.5 goals cashing in three of those four and both teams scoring in all four. Their away matches are wide open, full of chances, and usually turn into end-to-end football.

Vitesse at home follow the same pattern. Three of their last four home games have also gone over 3.5 goals, and BTTS landed in three of them. They’ve been leaky defensively but dangerous going forward, exactly the type of matchup that fits perfectly with De Graafschap’s high-tempo away style.

With both teams consistently producing high-scoring games and both conceding regularly, this has all the ingredients for another goal-heavy affair.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Bayern +6.5 (1.53)
Units: 3
Write up: Saw this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> a while ago, and i feel it is a very good one, here&#x27;s why.
Partizan is currently facing a very tough time in it&#x27;s history, Zeljko Obradovic resigned a few days ago (those who don&#x27;t know a Partizan and Europe Basketball coach legend) after a disappointing set of results. Partizan have not yet found a new coach, and if i remember correctly the new interim coach will be Mirko Ocokoljic, one of the staff of Zeljko&#x27;s time in Partizan.

Now, Partizan is playing at home and shock therapy proved to be very effective in european basketball, i don&#x27;t feel it is going to be as effective as always. Firstly, Partizan didn&#x27;t get any new players, Carlik Jones is still injured, and the only one who can be a replacement for him is a 36yo Nick Calathes... 

Second, Partizan fans are currently very hostile to both its club president, and their own players, one for getting rid of their best coaches in their history, and the players because of their non-commitment in their way of playing. Frankly i expect a very hostile arena, which will probably not be fully sold out, which will lessen the impact of home advantage.

Now, i think this sits on the shoulders of Bayern to not be completely shit, and that&#x27;s why i gave Bayern a sizeable 6 point lead because even if somehow Partizan starts playing better immediatly, which i don&#x27;t feel like it will happen, i think Bayern can keep it close or to say Partizan will beat itself to death( note 25:0 series against Panathinaikos, 16:2 against ASVEL, and 20:0 against Monaco).

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Jared Goff O249.5 Pass Yds @1.8 1u to win 0.8u

Write Up:  
 

Listen, I’m not saying Jared Goff is suddenly turning into peak Marino, but the man’s been dealing this season like he’s trying to get a Christmas bonus early. He’s averaging around 252 yards per game, which means this 249.5 line is basically the sportsbook saying, “Yeah, let’s hope he has an off day.” Cute.

And let’s talk matchup,  the Dallas Cowboys pass defense has been more generous than a grandma on thanksgiving , they’re giving up about 251.5 passing yards per game, which is literally above the line we need. So unless the Lions decide to turn into the 1985 Bears and run it 45 times, Goff is gonna have opportunities. Volume is there, matchup is there, and the man loves a clean pocket like he loves a good play action rollout.

Plus Goff already cleared this number in 7 of 12 games this year. That’s 58% and now he gets a defense that lets opposing QBs move the ball like a morning traffic jam. One or two chunk plays to whoever’s healthy, and suddenly you’re staring at 260+ yards before you can say “Cash me out.”

So yeah, Goff over 249.5 isn’t just a bet. It’s a polite handshake between him and the over column. If he doesn’t hit it, I’m checking the Wi-Fi, because something glitchy had to happen.

__POTD:__ *Same Game Parlay:* George Pickens 60+ receiving yards &amp; Jameson Williams 60+ receiving yards (-120), __5u to win 4.17u__

__Write Up:__ Couldn’t let 2025 end without a __5u MAX bet.__ The Dallas Cowboys (6-5-1) are traveling to Detroit to take on the Lions (7-5). The Lions are coming off a 24-31 loss to the Packers at home on Thanksgiving, their 3rd loss in their last 5. Dallas is coming off a 31-28 win over the Chiefs also on Thanksgiving, extending their 3 game win streak, with 2 straight wins vs last year&#x27;s Super Bowl finalists. The Cowboys defense has been atrocious, but their offense has been one of the best in the NFL. __Dallas is averaging 29.3 points per game, 2nd best in the league.__ Against another high powered offense in Detroit, the Cowboys should put up more big numbers.

This Dallas offense is coming in hot, scoring 24+ in 3 straight games, including two 30+ point games. Their high scoring has come from the elite trio of QB Dak Prescott &amp; WR’s George Pickens &amp; CeeDee Lamb. __Dak has been slinging it, averaging 8.7 yards per pass (2nd in NFL). That’ll continue vs a Detroit defense that’s allowed the 3rd most yards per pass in their last 3 (7.9 yards) &amp; have given up the 3rd most yards per pass (11.9) this year.__ But not only has Dallas been throwing the deep ball a ton, they’ve also been doing so efficiently. __The Cowboys lead the league in EPA as a passing offense (117.8). Detroit is last in the league in EPA as a pass d over the last 4 weeks (-37.1).__ Dak has thrown for 300+ yards in back to back weeks vs stout defenses in the Chiefs &amp; Eagles. He has thrown multiple passing TD’s in 7 of his last 9 games. He’s avg the most passing yards per game in the NFL (271.8), while also being the only QB with over 300+ completions. His 75.3 QBRating leads the NFL. Their offense has ran the ball at low rates this season. The Cowboys rank 26th in run play % (40.5%). They’ve averaged just 1.62 yards before contact (7th worst), while Detroit has been decent allowing around the league avg at 1.76 ybc. When the Cowboys have had success on the ground it has come from Zone concepts with a 51.8% success rate (7th), compared to Gap runs that have a 44.3% success rate (28th). The bad news for Dallas is Detroit is the 3rd in the NFL at defending Zone runs, allowing just 3.47 YPC (3rd) &amp; a 41.1% success rate (3rd). Dallas is going to air it out a ton this game, as the Lions have been getting burned by the deep ball lately. __Detroit gives up the 2nd most explosive passes (20+ yard passes) in the NFL (5.7%). They’ve allowed 41 catches of 20+ yards, &amp; 6 of 40+ yards. Since Week 10, when defending passes of 20+ Air Yards, Detroit has allowed: 17.6 yards/attempt (31st), 137.1 passer rating (32nd), 52.0% completion % (31st), 3 pass TDs (32nd), &amp; a -1.12 EPA/dropback (32nd).__ An even crazier stat I found myself going through every single Detroit Box Score in their last 20 games dating back to last season: __The Lions have allowed a 30+ yard reception to a receiver in TWENTY straight games dating back to Nov 2024 when the Jags failed to do so. Detroit has allowed 24 plays of 30+ yards, 2nd most. Dallas has 25 plays of 30+ yards, tied with Lions for most in NFL. The Lions gave up huge gains the last 2 weeks, allowing a league high 17.1 yards per completion to Winston &amp; Love.__ They specifically got torched on passes down the sidelines. Love went 12/19, 165 yards (8.7 YPA), 4 TDs, 130.5 passer rating. Winston was 16/24, 364 yards (15.2 YPA), 2 TDs, 137.5 passer rating. Love’s 4 TDs are the most in a single game on sideline passes over the last 4 seasons. Winston’s 364 yards are the most in a single game on sideline passes over the same span. Cowboys WR George Pickens owns the sidelines. Pickens has had 78+ yards in 7 consecutive games. Since Week 4 he is averaging 108 receiving yards/game. He has the 2nd most receiving yards in the NFL with 1,142 yards. The Steelers traded Pickens this past offseason, their entire WR core has just 1,082 yards. Since Lamb came back from injury, he has tied Pickens in target share (27.8%) with 39.2% of the air yards (10th most) in that span. But where Pickens has excelled the most has been against man coverage. __The Lions are playing man coverage on a league high 40.8% of passing plays. Pickens has 14 receptions of 20+ yards vs man this season, most in NFL (next highest 9). He has 504 rec yds vs man, (next highest 321). Pickens has been targeted on 35.3% of his routes for 4.96 yards per route vs man. CeeDee Lamb averages just 2.44 YPR, as he’s more of the zone threat. When Detroit is out of man, they run single high safety 61.4% of plays, 3rd highest. Pickens has 27.7% of targets &amp; 47.9% of the air yards vs single high coverage.__ Dak excels against man too, ranking 9th in completion rate (59.8%) &amp; 6th in yards per pass (8.0 Y/A). Dak &amp; Pickens are going to connect a ton, &amp; Pickens could clear 100 yards for 3rd time in 4 games.

I’m running out of room but Jameson Williams is now the #1 receiver in Detroit as the Lions will be without star WR Amon-Ra St Brown &amp; TE Sam LaPorta. St. Brown left the game last week vs Green Bay after one drive with a sprained ankle. __Williams stepped up &amp; had a career high 37% target share (4th in NFL), had a 1st Read % of 28.6%, &amp; caught 7/10 targets for 144 yards &amp; a TD.__ That is the highest target share in a single week of his career &amp; something St. Brown has only had 4 times in his 5 year career. He led the NFL in receiving yards last week &amp; had the 2nd highest PFF grade among WR’s (91.2), &amp; that was against the 4th best pass defense in the league (GB allows 284 pass yds 4th). Now he gets one of the worst pass defenses in the NFL this week. __The Cowboys have given up the most passing yards in the NFL (3,234). They’ve allowed 168 receiving yards per game to receivers (4th most).__ Dallas has had a great run defense since acquiring Quinnen Williams on the DL. __Over the past 3 weeks they’ve allowed 3.3 YPC to RB’s (3rd) &amp; allowing 0.33 yards before contact (4th). Detroit ranks 27th in rushing success rate (38.1%).__ Detroit is tied with Dallas in plays gaining 30+ yards on offense (25) &amp; I expect them to air it out.

These offenses rank 2nd &amp; 3rd in scoring, while each pass d is weak. Detroit had its best games following losses this year, scoring 52, 44, &amp; 34 points. Dallas has scored 57.25 more points than their projected totals, 2nd in NFL. These defenses rank 27th &amp; 30th in red zone TD conversion %. This will be a shootout. 

Pickens has 68+ in 10/11 games. Williams has 66+ in 5/7 games &amp; all 5 were with Amon-Ra on the field.

__George Pickens 60+ receiving yards &amp; Jameson Williams 60+ receiving yards__

Premier League 

Newcastle United Vs Tottenham Hotspur 

Newcastle win and over 1.5 goals 

(1.90) 3 units ✖️

A disgusting bad beat. Newcastle the much better team creating plenty of chances and bossing possession. They took the lead twice , and in the 95th minute Tottenham CB Romero scored his 2nd with a bicycle kick, completely ridiculous, 2 shots on target both going in for Tottenham, what can you do.

Premier League 

Manchester United Vs West Ham 

Manchester United win &amp; Bryan Mbuemo to have a shot on target.

(1.80) 2.5 units

Manchester United host West Ham, United much improved this season, particularly at home , winning 4 from 6 home games, dropping points to Arsenal on the opening weekend, and very unlucky not to get something against Everton.

Cunha is expected to return to the attack, he&#x27;s been a great addition, great at carrying the ball forward and creating chances, taking some of the creative pressure off Fernandes.

Mbuemo has also had a great impact, **he&#x27;s had a shot on target in his last 7 league games in a row** for United, and against a team like west ham he should get alot of shooting opportunities.

West ham are without their best midfielder in Paquetta, after his ridiculous red card against Liverpool, a big loss for them as they don&#x27;t have alot of debth on the bench for that position.

I expect United to bounce back at home here, Fernandes Chuna and Mbuemo should all start and they have too much attacking quality for West Ham imo.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Bayern Munich -2 vs. Köln @ 1.91 (5u)

Write Up:

Gonna keep it simple <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> and hammering the one of the best team in the world to cover a spread.

I’m taking Bayern Munich -2 because they are in video game mode right now. They just destroyed Wolfsburg 8-1 this past weekend. Their offense is clicking perfectly with Harry Kane and Olise scoring for fun, and they are averaging nearly 4 goals per game.

On the other side, Köln is struggling bad. They are winless in their last 5 league games and have conceded a goal in 11 straight matches. Their defense is leaking, and they already lost 4-1 to Bayern in the Cup earlier this season.

Bayern is fresh off a blowout, fully healthy, and chasing records. Köln is just trying to survive. Expecting another comfortable multi-goal win here.

Let’s get that bounce back. BOL!</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>POTD Record 20-20 (-0.44u)
January Record 5-7 (-2.46u)

Tuesday’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> - Dallas Stars ML -110 (1.1u to win 1u)

Wednesday’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> - Senators vs Rangers o5.5 goals -120 (1.2u to win 1u)

We have a matchup of backup goalies with a total at 5.5. For the Rangers, I’m guessing it’s going to be Quick again for his 5th straight outing. If not, it would be their 3rd string Spencer Martin. Quick has given up 3, 4, 6, and 3 in his last 4 starts.

On the other side, Ottawa has been starting their backup Leevi Merilainen who has started in 9 straight games (tonight is his 9th straight). He has even been playing in back to back games. If Merilainen doesn’t make his 10th straight appearance on Wednesday, it would be Hunter Shepard in goal, who was called up from the AHL over the weekend. Merilainen has given up 3 goals in 4 straight starts and has a .854 save percentage in his last month. 

Good Luck!</td></tr>

Last pick: Julian Brandt 1+ Shot on Target stake returned (did not start)

Soccer | Bundesliga 🇩🇪 | FC Köln vs Bayern Munich
Date: 14 January 2026
Time: 20:30 (Amsterdam time)
<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Bayern Munich -2 Asian Handicap @ +100 (Bet365)
Stake: 2 units

Write Up:

Last pick didn’t get settled since Brandt didn’t start, stake back, and we move on.

I’m backing Bayern Munich -2 Asian Handicap away at Köln.

Bayern are on a completely different level compared to Köln and the recent form is scary. In their last five games they’re averaging 4.4 goals scored while conceding just 0.8. On top of that, they just sent a message this weekend by thrashing Wolfsburg 8-1 at home. When Bayern get rolling, games can get ugly fast.

Köln really struggle against top teams, especially defensively. They give up a lot of chances and don’t cope well with sustained pressure, which is exactly what Bayern bring for 90 minutes.

We’ve also seen this matchup recently. On 29 October 2025, Bayern went to Köln in the DFB Pokal and won 1-4, again showing how big the quality gap is.

Quick explanation of the line: Asian Handicap -2 means Bayern need to win by three goals or more for the bet to win. If Bayern win by exactly two goals, it’s a push and the stake comes back. Anything less and the bet loses.

You could wait for the line-ups in case Bayern rotate a bit, which is always possible with their schedule. That said, even if they do rotate, they still have ridiculous depth with players like Lennart Karl and Nicolas Jackson potentially coming off the bench. Just keep in mind that if you wait for line-ups, the odds will likely drop.

At +100, I’m happy to take this now. A 3-0, 4-1 or even bigger scoreline wouldn’t surprise me at all.

<tr><td class='post'>**Record:** 35-18-1 (+15.72u) 

**Last:** (CBB) Michigan State -6.5 (1.5u) - Pending

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** (CBB) No. 13 Illinois (-9.5) at Northwestern 

**Start Time:** 8:30 PM ET (BTN)

**Odds:** -102 (FanDuel)

**Units:** 1.5U

**Reasoning:** Superman has his kryptonite. Achilles has his heel. Illinois has… playing on the road at Northwestern?

Yes, the Illini (13-3) have posted an impressive 145-45 all-time record against their Big Ten foe. Sure, under head coach Brad Underwood, the team is 11-5 in the series. However, Illinois is just 3-4 over its last seven trips to Evanston, including dropping each of the last three. That includes a frustrating overtime defeat last season in which the team coughed up a double-digit lead late in the second half.

Fortunately, this year’s Wildcats (8-8) have made a living snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. 

In six of its eight losses this season, Northwestern has held leads of seven or more points with under 13 minutes to go. The proof isn’t that hard to find, as the team saw second-half leads disappear in each of its past three games against Minnesota (67-60 w/ 4:39 remaining), Michigan State (45-38 w/ 12:36 remaining) and Rutgers (65-59 w/ 2:33 remaining)—the Wildcats lost all three contests. With a March Madness bid all but gone, and staring down an 0-6 start to conference play, the team appears ready to be put out of its misery.

Look for a revenge-minded, lethal Illini offense to deliver the kill shot. 

Through 16 games, the unit ranks 2nd in offensive efficiency (1.234), 30th in scoring (86.0 PPG), 55th in field-goal percentage (47.7%) and 122nd in three-point shooting (34.8%). It’s become a game of “<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> Your Poison” for opposing defenses, as Illinois boasts four players averaging 12.4 points per game or better. That has disaster written all over it for a suddenly-reeling Northwestern defense that ranks 63rd in opponent field-goal percentage (41.6%), 94th in scoring defense (71.2 PPGA) and 113th in defensive efficiency (1.014). Not surprisingly, those numbers have ballooned to 79.0 points per game conceded on 47.6% shooting over the team’s three-game slide. 

Conversely, the Wildcats have the nation’s leading scorer in Nick Martinelli (24.1 PPG) and not much else. 

On the season, the team ranks 54th in field-goal percentage (47.7%), 67th in offensive efficiency (1.127), 100th in scoring (79.1 PPG) and 294th in three-point shooting (30.8%). Over the last three games, those numbers have dropped to 73.0 points per game on just 42.7% shooting (26.9% from beyond the arc). Things won’t get any easier against an Illini defense that ranks 20th in opponent field-goal percentage (39.5%), 34th in scoring defense (67.4 PPGA), 44th in defensive efficiency (0.968) and 66th in opponent three-point shooting (30.9%). The unit has been more suffocating as of late, only conceding just 58.4 points per game on a meager 35.2% shooting (24.3% from deep) over its last five games. 

Look for Illinois to impose its size advantage on Wednesday night.

Per KenPom, the team ranks 1st in average height and 4th in effective height. That advantage has been evident on the glass, where the Illini rank 9th in total rebounding (42.3 per game), 13th in defensive rebounding (27.2) and 20th in offensive rebounding (11.9) while ranking 8th in opponent defensive rebounding (18.5), 28th in opponent total rebounding (31.3) and 208th in opponent offensive rebounding (9.3). Furthermore, the team also ranks 16th in blocks (5.4) and 18th in second-chance points (15.3). That all adds up to what could be a long night for a Northwestern team that ranks 233rd in opponent second-chance points (11.8), 247th in total rebounding (33.6) and 288th in opponent offensive rebounding (10.2). 

But the X factor in this one might just be Illinois’ ability to get to the charity stripe. 

Thus far, the team ranks 28th in drawing fouls (20.6 per game). But not only that, the Illini makes good on those opportunities, ranking 4th in free-throw percentage (79.8%). That includes shooting 27-32 (84.3%) from the line over its last two games. Conversely, the Wildcats rank 229th in fouls committed (18.5). 

Look for Illinois to finally conquer its own personal House of Horrors and cruise by double-digits.

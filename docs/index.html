**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Győri ETO + o1,5 goals @ 1,75

**WriteUp:** It&#x27;s a Hungarian Cup game where arguably the top2 team (Győri ETO) in the hungarian 1st league plays with a team (Videoton) who is in the hungarian 2nd league near relegation spots. It&#x27;s also a traditional rivalry between the 2 teams so It&#x27;s a prestige match. Since ETO is just a much better team and they are playing at home + Győr has a shot to win this tournament so they will go all out. I think the odds are also mispriced and I don&#x27;t expect a close game.</td></tr>

Atletico Madrid 1X AND UNDER 3.5 Goals @ 2.65

Atlético Madrid are extremely strong at home and rarely lose big matches in front of their fans. Diego Simeone’s side are organized, disciplined and defensively solid, especially against top opposition like Barcelona. This fixture is usually tight and tactical rather than open and high scoring. With Atlético’s structure and game management, a draw or home win looks likely. Combining 1X with Under 3.5 goals fits the expected low-scoring, controlled battle perfectly.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Jazz Team Total o114.5

**Odds // Units:** FanDuel (-122) 2u

**Write-up:** If you don’t know, the Jazz lead the league in points scored at home, averaging 122 a game. Blazers rank 23rd in opponent points allowed on the road. Extremely high total as well, looking at 239ish. Two teams that tote the highest paces in the league in what should be a slugfest. At home, the Jazz have hit this line 19/28 times, and 3/3 since JJJ joined the lineup. On the flip side, the Blazers have allowed 115 on the road 17/26 times. If we look at the last 6 H2H matchups, the Jazz have scored 115 5/6 times, reaching 130 points in 3 of those games. The Jazz have covered in their last five games in general, while the Blazers have given up 115 in eight straight. The Jazz are coming into form as well, winning their last two games. They should’ve won against the Magic, as they were up 20 but sat all their starters in the fourth… JJJ has made a big difference for this team. Mark &amp; Nurk stay hot, and with Collier playing point pushing the pace versus a Blazers team that ranks 29th in transition defense, we cash again. Just based on the Home/Away splits, we have a 67%/-200 chance to hit. When these teams play against other bottom 50% of teams, we squeeze out to around 73%/-360. GL

**P.S.** forgot to mention on **back-to-backs at home, they are 6/6 - averaging 130.** Dropped 152 on the Pacers, 133 on the Rockets, and 127 vs the Wolves.</td></tr>

* Short writeup, ALGO are using two subs for this match, missing a crucial piece losing their AWPer and also using Dytor who hasn&#x27;t played a match with them yet
* Map 2 is Nuke, ALGO map <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, likely gonna struggle on T side with two subs and one first time, they don&#x27;t know the strat book and won&#x27;t all be on the same page on a pretty complex map

* Scr0b is out and Nukkye is AWPing in the place of him, he has the AWP in map 1 and is taking the place, this is a big deal as Nukkye is normally \~50% headshot and most awpers are between mid 30%-high-mid 20% headshot % when they are using the AWP meaning we see around a 20% drop in headshot overall

Match: Atletico Madrid v Barcelona &amp; Brentford v Arsenal

Time: 21:00 &amp; 21:00 CET

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Both Teams to score + Double Chance Arsenal or Draw (1.63)

Reasoning: 

Arsenal have been one of the most consistent sides this season, especially against mid-table opposition. Even away from home, they control possession well and create high-quality chances regularly. Brentford are competitive at home, but they’ve struggled for consistency against top-six sides. With Arsenal’s defensive structure and overall squad quality, it’s hard to see them losing this one. Double chance gives solid cover while backing the stronger side.

Whenever these two meet, it’s usually intense and high quality. Atletico at home are aggressive and create plenty of chances, while Barcelona’s attacking talent almost always finds a goal. At the same time, neither side has looked completely flawless defensively in big games. The arrival of Lookman and his speed + dribbling should trouble Barcelona’s high line. This is only the first leg of this cup tie but I think Atleti will try to get the maximum <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> at home before travelling to Camp Nou. With the quality on both ends and what’s at stake, both teams getting on the scoresheet looks very likely here.

Barca should win this relatively easily; the question is, if they can make the spread, their recent wins as well as losses were all by a small difference, except the loss against Olympiakos. They tend to play over games with fast tempo oponents, which is certainly Paris.

Event: Tennis Chennai Challenger 10:30 CET (starts in about 1.5 hours)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Bar Biryukov +1.5 Sets v Nagal @1.70

Write-up: Nagal looked exhausted in his last two Davis Cup matches and lost both of them. Then two days ago he played Gill who had his first hard court match in over a year and lost first set 6-1 after eventually winning in 3. This matchup was more or less favorable for Nagal who likes to play against heavy topspin, and that was exactly what he was getting since Gill is predominantly a clay courter. Now that&#x27;s not going to be the case against Bar Biryukov who hits hard flat shots and is generally more unpredictable with his shot selection. On top of that when his serve is on point he&#x27;s unbreakable. 
I&#x27;d take him to win outright but choose to be on the safer side this time.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Austin Reaves (LAL) UNDER 5.5 Assists (+105)HR 🕵️‍♂️🃏

Reasoning: While the public is chasing the &quot;No Luka = More Usage&quot; narrative, the Rat  Strategy and 2K Sim reveal a deeper deception. Every major analyst is screaming &quot;Over,&quot; yet the line has stayed sticky at 5.5 with juiced odds on the Under. I am fading the consensus and following the Cancer Moon intuition.

🕵️ Detective Clues: Evidence 1: The &quot;Scoring Vacuum&quot; Trap Without Luka, Reaves doesn&#x27;t just pass more—he shoots way more. In the simulation, he dropped 24 points but only 3 assists. Real-world data shows his PPG skyrocket to 36.2 without Luka. When a player enters &quot;Alpha Scoring Mode,&quot; they often develop tunnel vision, looking for the bucket rather than the open man.

Evidence 2: The Redick &quot;Defense First&quot; Mandate After allowing a catastrophic 84 first-half points on Tuesday, Coach JJ Redick has likely spent the last 48 hours installing a &quot;grind-it-out&quot; defensive shell. Expect a slower pace and fewer transition opportunities, which are the lifeblood of Reaves’ high-assist games.

Evidence 3: The LeBron &quot;Point Forward&quot; Hijack LeBron James is the ultimate stat-thief. With Luka out, LeBron often takes over the primary &quot;Quarterback&quot; duties to stabilize the offense.The 2K sim saw LeBron rack up 10 assists while Reaves stayed on the perimeter. If LeBron handles the rock, Reaves becomes a finisher, not a facilitator.

Scenario Playbook

Scenario A (The Ideal): Reaves comes out aggressive, hunting his shot early to fill the 30+ PPG void left by Luka. He finishes with 28 points and 4 assists as LeBron handles the playmaking duties.

Scenario B (The Grind): The game becomes a defensive slugfest. Both teams shoot under 44% from the floor. Assist opportunities are rare because nobody can buy a bucket.

Scenario C (The Outside Influences): Marcus Smart and Brandon Williams turn the game into a chaotic &quot;Guard War.&quot; Reaves gets trapped in double-teams and is forced to pass, but the Lakers&#x27; role players miss their open looks.

Scenario D (The White Flag 🏳️): The Lakers blow out the Mavericks early (who are missing Luka and Flagg). Reaves rests the entire 4th quarter, finishing stuck on 3 assists.

Scenario E (Cold Night): Reaves gets into early foul trouble trying to defend the Mavericks&#x27; backcourt speed or his &quot;conditioning&quot; limit keeps his minutes under 28. Scenario Proof: The 2K Prophet predicted a 24-7-3 line for Reaves. By taking the Under 5.5 Assists, we are betting on the &quot;Scoring Version&quot; of AR-15 that your intuition sensed. We are the &quot;Rats&quot; in the walls,</td></tr>

1. Thun hosts Lausanne. Thun is in 1st place in the tables, while Lausanne is 7th. Thun has 7W1D3L at home while Lausanne is pretty meh with 3W4D4L. In their last two H2H, Thun won one at home and lost one away because they got a red. More important - Thun has won 7 matches in a row. Also, I know someone else had Thun as their <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>, but I decided on this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> yesterday and was asleep when the thread was posted and I don’t want to force something I don’t like.

2. AGF hosts Midtjylland. Midtjylland has scored in their last 9/10 H2H except one time when they got an early red. AFG has BTTS L5/6 and O2.5 L6/6, while Midtjylland has BTTS L6/8 and O2.5 L4/5. I think they’ll manage a goal.

NBA | Lakers v Mavericks | 🏀  

3-14 and 0-7 from three from Deni here, shot his way out of the rotation at the end which is fully understandable. Tracking my bets it’s clear that betting points have been my worst enemy cause they forget how to shoot, nice lil streak ended. We move 

3 game slate &amp; also the last one before the all star break, hopefully we finish strong.

Luka is still out for the Lakers which is great for Reaves here to continue his playmaking production we’ve seen as of late. 8 &amp; 7 assists in his L2 games without Luka in 29 &amp; 24 minutes of action.

Without Luka &amp; 23+ minutes he’s over in 6/7 games this season avg 8.1 APG &amp; 11.9 potentials per game.

Has come off the bench these last 4 games as he’s working his way back to normal minutes and to the starting 5, but a clear pattern of progression in minutes has been shown. He logged 29 minutes last game after seeing 24 minutes in the game prior, so expecting 30+ minutes here is definitely realistic which is enough for Reaves to get it done with the usage he’s getting.

GSW and OKC are much tougher matchups for assists and as mentioned he’s had 8 &amp; 7 assists in those games, Mavs are a softer matchup in terms of assists to PG currently ranked in the middle. Mavs are ranked top 3 in pace this season which is another reason to back Reaves in this matchup. 

Will share the facilitating duties with Bron, but gets a lot of run without him aswell where he’s the guy to get everyone involved.</td></tr>

Stefanos Tsitsipas - Botic van de Zandschulp

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Stefanos Tsitsipas to win @ 1.55

Botic van de Zandschulp is a quality player, but his recent results have been poor. For example, last week in Montpellier he lost comfortably in straight sets to Humbert, a match in which he failed to record a single break. He hasn’t been particularly convincing here either, advancing past Pavlovic in the opening round but still conceding two breaks.


Stefanos Tsitsipas, meanwhile, has been playing well throughout the season and appears to be rediscovering the form that established him among the top players on tour. He enjoys indoor conditions and possesses one of the best serves in the game. In the first round, he delivered a commanding performance, defeating Rinderknech in straight sets while allowing only one break point and applying constant pressure on return during key moments.


Therefore, Tsitsipas enters the match as the favorite, and my prediction is a victory for him.</td></tr>

Darts is a precision sport, there are only tiny edges between the top top players, and a couple of missed darts because you were slightly more nervous than your opponent can be the difference between winning and losing a match.

We&#x27;re targeting the top defense in the EPL, which may seem counter productive, but we&#x27;ve had decent success with this type of play and the value is definitely there. Keep this in mind though if you decide to tail, Arsenal is a risky team to go against. 

Ouattara is a striker for Brentford, who joined the team this season from Bournemouth. He is in fantastic form as of late, scoring goals in his last 2 games and landing an SOT in each of his last 3 matches. With much of the defensive focus on Thiago, Ouattara has had more and more opportunities and is taking more shots. He has looked fantastic on the pitch, runs with a high motor, and is generally playing really well. I like him to continue his form and land an SOT here at home against Arsenal.

Young Boys got their goal at the end there thankfull. Moving on. 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>: Switzerland | Swiss Super League | 230pm Eastern | FC Thun vs Lausanne-sport | BTTS O2.5 goals 3U @ -105

FC Thun vs Lausanne-Sport sets up as one of those Swiss Super League fixtures where the statistical profile strongly supports a Both Teams To Score and Over 2.5 Goals wager. When analyzing this market properly, the key is not just whether goals are likely, but whether the data supports both teams contributing in a match that clears the three-goal threshold.

From a probability standpoint, recent modeling and trend data suggest that BTTS in this matchup lands around 65–70%. That number is significant because anything meaningfully above 60% indicates a consistent scoring pattern from both sides. Thun, particularly in home fixtures, have been involved in high-event matches. Their games frequently feature open play, transitional attacks, and defensive vulnerability. They not only score at a steady rate, but they also concede regularly, which naturally inflates BTTS probability.

The Over 2.5 goals angle also carries strong support. Combined goal averages in matches involving these teams sit above 3.0 per game across recent stretches. Projection models place the probability of at least three total goals around 60–65%. That means the match is statistically more likely than not to reach the required scoring threshold. Importantly, these two probabilities are not independent of each other. When Thun play open matches and concede while scoring, the overlap between BTTS and Over 2.5 becomes substantial. A 2–1, 3–1, or 2–2 type scoreline covers both legs of the wager, and those outcomes align directly with their recent scoring distributions.

Head-to-head history reinforces this outlook. Meetings between Thun and Lausanne have averaged above three total goals per match, with a majority clearing the 2.5 mark. Both teams have shown defensive instability in those fixtures, yet neither lacks attacking output. That combination—capable forward play paired with inconsistent defensive structure—is precisely what bettors look for when targeting BTTS plus Over 2.5.

When comparing these probabilities to the market price of roughly -105 (which implies about a 51% break-even probability), the statistical edge becomes clearer. If BTTS sits near 67% and Over 2.5 near 63%, even accounting for correlation between the two events, the combined outcome plausibly falls in the mid-to-high 50% range. That places it above the implied probability of the odds being offered. In betting terms, that gap represents positive expected value.

In summary, this wager is supported by three major pillars: consistent high goal involvement from FC Thun, Lausanne’s tendency to both score and concede, and historical matchups that trend toward open, multi-goal games. With projected probabilities comfortably exceeding the implied break-even mark of the odds, BTTS and Over 2.5 goals in FC Thun vs Lausanne-Sport stands as a statistically sound betting position.

The Bucks will be travelling to OKC to complete their back-to-back. These two teams played a couple weeks ago, with the Thunder walking away with a comfortable 20 point win on the road. Now they&#x27;re down SGA, but otherwise are regaining their health. Don&#x27;t be fooled by their recent losses to Houston and SA without SGA, as those are both elite western contenders, and the Bucks are nowhere near the same caliber. Before those two losses, they had won 7 straight without the MVP, covering the spread in the majority. The Bucks ran a short bench tonight in their win against the Magic, and needed a 34 point bomb from Cam Thomas to pull through. After all their healthy starters played 30 minutes tonight before travelling to an early OKC tipoff, I expect a sluggish start that the OKC defenders will feast on, fueling the crowd and an early lead for the Thunder.

​<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Arsenal ML @ 1.66 odds (5u)

​Write Up:

Arsenal is sitting at the top of the table and cannot afford to drop points if they want to hold off Man City. Their form right now is scary, they have won 3 straight games beating Leeds, Chelsea, and Sunderland without conceding a single goal. Their defense is arguably the best in the world atm, allowing just 0.72 xGA over their last 5 matches. With Viktor Gyökeres firing upfront and the midfield fully healthy, they are clicking on all cylinders.

​Brentford is coming off a chaotic 3-2 win against Newcastle, but don&#x27;t let that fool you, their defense is leaky. They have conceded more goals at home than almost any other mid-table team this season. Historically, the Gtech Community Stadium has been a playground for Arsenal, the Gunners have won 4 games in a row at this stadium.

​You have a title-contending team with the best defense in the league playing against a team that bleeds high-danger chances. We take the superior team to handle business on the road.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Atletico Madrid 0.0, +0.5 Asian Handicap, -111, 5 units

**Write Up:** Oh yes, Barcelona are meeting Atletico Madrid in the semi finals of this year&#x27;s Spanish Copa del Rey. This matchup rarely disappoints, with the most recent first leg in the cup (last season) ending 4-4 with **Barca infamously choking a two goal lead.**

Atletico Madrid&#x27;s league title hopes are more or less dusted and they&#x27;re not exactly one of the favorites to win the Champions League either, so they&#x27;ve turned all their focus on the domestic cup competition. With their main rivals, Real Madrid, already eliminated, the only team that realistically stands in their way to silverware, is Barcelona. The idea that they&#x27;re putting all their eggs in one basket, so to speak, is backed by their **quarter final performance, in which they thrashed a very strong Real Betis side 5-0.** On the other hand, **Barcelona are being stretched thin,** still fighting hard on all fronts, and **their Copa del Rey campaign has been unconvincing** to say the least.

Taking all of that into consideration, plus all the **injuries on Barcelona&#x27;s side** (Rashford, Pedri, Gavi, Raphinha and Christensen are all out, de Jong is now probable but he carries a knock), I can&#x27;t see Barcelona taking the control of the midfield this time around, especially **not on Atletico&#x27;s ground.** Atletico are going to have all the fan support behind them and should, at the very least, snatch a cheeky draw here. BTTS Yes is also a reasonable angle to take, though I don&#x27;t exactly expect a goal fest here, as there&#x27;s still a whole second leg left to be played after <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.

Write-up: No CLV on that play, but that&#x27;s about the only negative I can find, as Pieczkowski scored a nice 2-0 win.

Tommy Paul is one of the more consistent performers on hard courts, having recently made the fourth round of the Australian Open and lost to Alcaraz in a match that was closer than the scoreline makes it look. He has an excellent record on these indoor hard courts here in Dallas, having won the tournament in 2024 and lost to a red-hot Shapovalov in the semis in 2025. There were some concerns about how he would adjust to new conditions a few days after playing a Davis Cup tie against Hungary on clay. However, he managed to squeeze past Jenson Brooksby in R1 with a solid 7.51 performance rating, and he should be prepared for the second round now.

In comparison, Kecmanovic is a former top junior who never quite lived up to the billing, but has nevertheless managed to hang around the ATP tour for quite a while now. But Kecmanovic has had a really rough start to the season, going winless through four matches before scraping past Shimabukuro in R1 here (7.20). While that win may give him some confidence after a ton of tight losses as of late, his form simply doesn&#x27;t suggest that he can challenge Tommy here. Prior to this year, Kecmanovic had an 0-2 record in Dallas, and it&#x27;s been a while since he&#x27;s shown the ability to beat against top players on any surface. Both of these players tend to stick at the baseline, but Paul will have the advantage in the serve and backhand departments. In general, most players who beat Tommy have some sort of &quot;special sauce&quot; or variation in their game that disrupts his rhythm. Brooksby is one of those players, and is in slightly better form than Kecmanovic, so I&#x27;m surprised to see Paul be a slightly smaller favorite here. I like the home player to move on in straight sets and get one step closer to a potential second title here.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Gamba Osaka or Draw + BTTS:NO@2.69 (Betsmith) | **Stake: 1.5u**

**Write Up**:

I’m really not super sure about this game, but it definitely isn’t smelling of a lot of goals. Pohang Steelers ended the season with only 3 of their last 21 games seeing more than three goals… They also only scored in four of their last nine games and saw three wins from the last league games. It doesn’t look like they have lost any important players since last season.

Gamba Osaka has the benefit of having a competitive game under the belt in 2026, but it did end in disappointing fashion as they could not score against CIty rivals Cerezo, despite their opponent having player sent off in the 1st half. Gamba lacks a special player that can open things up when the opponent sits back and defends, it ended up just being a bunch of sideways passes outside of the box. 

Gamba with a new manager in both meanings of the word, as this is also his first professional manager job. I think he might be a bit more careful here and be happy enough with a draw in the away leg and do the job at home next week. I was originally going to do Gamba draw no bet, but the odds have been sliced too much. My guess is 0-0 or 1-0 for the guests.

Write Up:

Back to Ol&#x27; reliable. Arsenal. They need every single point they can get to keep their title dreams alive and with City only 3 points behind, Arsenal  have a fire lit up their arse. Brentford is a good opponent and will have some decent chances (which is why I took their corners) but in the end, I think Arsenal will be able to edge out a win.

Saka is injured so that&#x27;s an important thing to consider however, I think Arsenal can make do with who they have available rn.

I expect a similar setup here as a win tomorrow puts them in prime position to make the lead 9 by midweek, regardless of whether or not they win corners are key part of Arsenals game away from home this season and I see them utilizing them well to breakdown Brentfords structure.

AARHUS VS MIDTJYLLAND

Date: 12 FEBRUARY 2026 at 19:00

BET ON: Asian handicap- AARHUS +0.00

Odd: 1.89



\- AGF’s motivation edge in this first cup semi-final is grounded not just in form but in mindset. Jakob Poulsen has repeatedly stressed the importance of consistency, mental sharpness and belief in his press interactions — emphasising that his side must “play their game and stay focused for all 90 minutes” and not assume anything is won before it’s earned, even against elite opposition. This reflects a clear tactical identity: Poulsen’s 3-4-3/3-5-2 setup is built around controlled possession, progressive wide play and overloads in transition, which has historically allowed AGF to generate superior expected-goals metrics against Midtjylland at Ceres Park. Meanwhile, FC Midtjylland arrive weakened defensively, with key defender Mads Bech out 4–6 weeks, and additional players sick or doubtful — a major disruption to their back line stability. The Wolves’ coach and leadership have talked more about survival and managing energy than domination — an indirect admission that FCM might be cautious away from home and prioritise avoiding defeat to take a result back to Herning. Danish coverage has highlighted Midtjylland’s reliance on structure and set-pieces rather than fluent attacking play recently, especially when missing personnel, while Poulsen’s setup is proactively constructed to exploit those exact weaknesses. With AGF chasing a historic first cup win in 30 years and visibly buoyed by their resilient late victory over OB — where substitutes changed the game — the psychological and tactical groundwork strongly supports AGF avoiding defeat, making +0.00 a convincing angle going into this semi-final tie.

Event: ATP Rotterdam Round of 16 7:30 A.M. CST

ADM came out with a very tough R1 matchup here in Rotterdam against Arthur Fils but his overwhelming consistency and strong baseline game took care of business. In his next match, I&#x27;m expecting a pretty straightforward match here against a player well past his prime in Wawrinka. Not much of a H2H here with ADM winning the only meeting between these two with ease. This matchup took place in 2024 on clay where Stans game actually has been pretty solid but now, indoors, this should suit ADM much nicer. De Minaur has been playing exceptional tennis lately with his only loss in his last 8 appearances coming to Carlos Alcaraz. In the last two years in this event, his losses have came to Alcaraz and Sinner, which tells us he feels pretty comfortable in these conditions unless he is playing top class players, which Wawrinka is not anymore. Give me a straight forward win for the world number 8.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Todays pick</mark> goes to the Switzerland Super League, FC Thun (1st) face off against Lausanne (7th), Thun are the home team here with a total record of 7-1-3 (W/D/L) but most recently winning their last 6 home fixtures. On the other hand are Lausanne going 3-4-4, recent away form of 2-2-2. Thun are simply in too good form for Lausanne, only losing 5 of their 23 fixtures and with the home advantage, coming in on a 7 game win streak and Lausanne winless in 3 I think the quality gap will see Thun through for another 3 points. 

For the second leg O2.5 goals we have seen this in the last 7 head-to-head fixtures, Thun have seen this hit in the last SEVEN games. The away team have hit this 3/6 last matchups. Another good substitute for this line would be BTTS as Thun have gone 7/7 and Lausanne have gone 5/6 last fixtures, with 6/7 last head-to-heads. Given both of these lines have a good hit rate, in addition to both of their attacking form being relatively decent (despite Lausanne&#x27;s results) I do see both teams scoring and both of these lines clearing with somewhat ease. I&#x27;m going to go with a 2-1 Thun dub.

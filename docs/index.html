<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>‚≠êÔ∏è:üèàTulane ML/Ravens ML (-116) \[BallyBet\]

Start Time &amp; TV: 7:30 &amp; 8:15pm EST (ESPN &amp; Amazon)

Units: 2.25 Units

Reasoning: Going with a college football and NFL two legger for this Thursday night and well be riding with the Tulane Green Wave and the Baltimore Ravens. The Ravens will be getting back quarterback Lamar Jackson this week and this team is completely different with him under center so I am not looking into their record as they were ineffective with Cooper Rush as quarterback but last week they did find a win with Tyler Huntley as quarterback. My key factor in this Thursday night showdown focuses on the rushing offense and defenses of these teams. This Ravens rush attack is 8th in rushing yards per game with 134 a contest and averaging 5.3 yards a carry while the Dolphins are 23rd in the league averaging under 100 rushing yards per game while their rush defense is 28th in the league allowing 145 rushing yards a game so I think they will have their hands full with Derrick Henry in this one. I also like Tulane to defeat UTSA as they are a well put together squad that has two wins over power five schools, Duke and Northwestern. Texas San Antonio is coming off an ass whooping against North Texas where they lost 55-17. This weakness of this Roadrunners team is their secondary and I think Green Wave wide receivers Shazz Preston who averages 16 yards a reception and Omari Hayes will exploit this UTSA defense. Also quarterback Jake Retzlaff is dangerous on the ground and in the air as he has 1428 passing yards, a 6:1 touchdown to interception ratio and he averages 6.5 yards a carry and 8 rushing touchdowns to go along with that.

Prediction: 30-24 Tulane, 27-19 Ravens

<tr><td class='post'>POTD Record: 145-99 | Profit: +93.60u | ROI: 13.3%

Season Record: 5-3

¬†

Last Pick:¬†Zach LaVine (Kings) O21.5 Pts @ 1.85. 5U.

The 5 unit üí£ hits comfortably with LaVine getting to 30 pts. I‚Äôd suggested taking the Alt Line at 25+ for 1u, so hopefully some y‚Äôall tailed that as well. My last 5 streak up to 4-1, let‚Äôs keep it going.

¬†

Next <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:¬†**Giannis Antetokounmpo (Bucks) O42.5 P+R @ 1.82**. 3U play.

The Warriors have struggled against forwards because they simply don‚Äôt have size or strength to keep up with them. Giannis is in fantastic form and is over this line in all four games this season (45, 54, 51 and 51), including against more physical teams like Cleveland and the Knicks. I just can‚Äôt see a way for the Warriors to stop him with Draymond and Horford, and he should be able to get to the basket and the FT line at will, especially as the Bucks have an effective cast of guys to space the floor.



*This line is available on FD. The other books don&#x27;t have his player props yet but I&#x27;d play it to 44.5.*</td></tr>

I really wanted to hammer this as a trap game but even though I have seen a spark from Miami I worry that Lamar and Zay both from Florida are going to play this game harder for all the family and friends that will be there. Zay flowers without Lamar was able to go over 50 yds in every game without Jackson and so I feel safe with Lamar or heck Cooper throwing to him. As for Achane, Miami has really made him their number 1 especially with Hill out. He did good against two defenses that are able to stop the run including the falcons and browns and so I feel comfortable with him getting 40 yds.  Achane last game vs Falcons 67 yds rushing and 82 yds vs Cleveland despite Miami being blown out. So even if ravens do start pouring it on Miami will still be running through Achane. He has the 8th most rushing yds so far. Zay Flowers also has the 16th most receiving yards despite a transition in quarterbacks. I like both these players and have also noticed that Thursday games have been high scoring every week except for one game which was still over 30 points which isn‚Äôt a bad score either.

Big Men feast on the glass vs the Warriors. Giannis has been having a great year rebounding surpassing his like in 3/4 with 14, 20, 14, 8. The Warriors typically play smaller with Draymond at the 5, and on top of running a fast pace offense. This creates many rebound chances for big men such as Giannis. In the previous game, Zubac crushed his line of 9.5 rebounds with 13 rebounds. Expect a big night from Giannis here.</td></tr>

Struggling to shake this up and down record. I got this one wrong though, the game was a lot scrappier and docile than I imagined.

Ultimately we were unlucky not to land the bet with Brest hitting the post and missing a late header but it remained 1-0.

I‚Äôm going with a big units play here in backing Melbourne City to beat Brisbane away from home.

Brisbane have managed a 1-0 win at home against strugglers MacArthur and lost 2-1 to Wellington in NZ. Tbh I don‚Äôt see any of these teams making the finals.

Perth drew with Wellington the first game of the season so read into that form what you will. I‚Äôd probably take every City starting player if you match them up against Brisbane other than O Shea.

Melbourne have enjoyed a draw away from home and smoked Perth 4-0 in theiir last game, showing they were a class above.

Brisbane have managed under 40% of possession in both games and this will be no different.

Max Caputo is in scintillating form after reconnecting with the squad after the under 20‚Äôs World Cup. He has 6 goals in his last 4 games for Club and Country and with a maturing Mathew Leckie (former Bundesliga player) dominating the midfield, they are looking good for another push for the title.



**14 wins in 20 bets,** well done to any followers. No pressure whatsoever, but if you are willing, any help will go a long way.

-everything is bet to win unit amount-

Write up: we got a warriors team coming playing their 3rd game in 4 nights. Moses moody is gtd and would be a big loss with the way buddy hield is playing. Either way he‚Äôs got right thumb sorness which is his shooting hand. Moses is averaging 12 points on 21 minutes a game. Giannis is GTD but always is and is likely to play. Anyways the bucks are 10th in net and the warriors are 10th. The bucks are playing solid team basketball right now and get to stay at home again, Ryan Rollins is also a breakout star. I think Gianni‚Äôs has a big game as well in sheer size advantage alone over this tired team. We are getting what could potentially be the better team right now at home, as an underdog, and in a better situational spot. Not sketchy either cause warriors carry the public on name alone. Been a great start for me so far and I‚Äôm grateful to be able to write up sports bets every day I love the game and the hustle. Let‚Äôs get another on the board.</td></tr>

Net Units: +25.64

Yesterday&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Roma to beat Parma and u3.5 total goals. 3u @ $2.05 ‚úÖ

2-1 win to Roma.

Really happy with this one. They definitely made us sweat with the first goal in the 63rd minute.¬†

However, Roma scored twice and looked set to run out 2-0 winners. However, Parma scored late to get it back to 2-1... Which is basically exactly why we covered the Roma to win and 3.5 line. Just in case Parma scored a jammy goal.¬†

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Bangkok Utd v FC Samut Sakhon. Over 3.5 Goals AND KuPS to win v Gnistan. 3u @ $2.20

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Combining two legs here. If you&#x27;re not one to do that, I like the o3.5 for the Bangkok game, or KuPS -1 handicap.¬†

First up, we&#x27;re at the Thai FA Cup. One of the best teams in Thailand, Bangkok United, plays away to 3rd division FC Samut Sakhon.

Samut Sakhon are doing well in the third tier and are sitting in second place after four games.¬†

Bangkok United are second in the top division and in great form in both the league and in the Champions League 2, which is basically the Europa League of Asia.¬†

Plenty of these early cup games have crazy high scores, so I like the o3.5 and that covers us a fair bit.¬†

Along with that, we&#x27;re in Finland, where top of the table KuPS host IF Gnistan.¬†

Gnistan have struggled since the league split into the championship group, going 0-1-6.¬†

KuPS want to keep winning to maintain their lead at the top. There are only 3 games left, and a loss here could see them drop to second depending on other results.¬†

KuPS should win this.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>** Mboko ML vs Eala (-225) + Malik Washington 20+ yards receiving (-220) [+105] 3u

RAVENS @ MIAMI 6:15PM MST

Leg 1 - Eala has been in really bad form, losing 4 of her last 5, with the only win being a walkover retirement win in round 1. Mboko has looked sharp in the past few matches, winning 3 of her last 4, with that loss being to the wrecking ball Rybakina. Both young rising stars, but Mboko is better and should win.

Leg 2 - Baltimore gets torched through the air by wide receivers. Washington has cleared 20 yards in 3 straight, 30 in 2 straight, and his overall involvement has been climbing. With Tua looking great last week and Lamar returning, this should be a high scoring, competitive game. Dude will probably cash this on 1 catch vs the Ravens.</td></tr>

**Verona - Milano** üèê Italy - Superlega UTC 19:30

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **Verona -1.5 Set Handicap** @ 1.55 Betsson

Verona has made a flawless start to the 2025-2026 season. Winning both of its first two matches, they share the top spot with reigning champions Trentino with 6 points. The team demonstrated its fitness by defeating Piacenza 3-1 in the first week and Grottazzolina 3-0 away in the second. One of the key factors behind this success is the appointment of **Fabio Soli**, the coach who won the championship with Trentino last season. Under Soli&#x27;s leadership, Verona has built a squad that blends experience and youth. The signing of American **Micah Christenson**, considered one of the best passers in the world, has taken the team&#x27;s playing style to a whole new level. At the opposite end, they feature 23-year-old Brazilian talent Darlan Souza, while the remaining outside hitters include Rok Mozic and Noumory Keita. This squad structure clearly demonstrates that Verona is aiming for the top spot this season, not just the playoffs.

Milano, on the other hand, started the season with mixed emotions. They showed &quot;solidity and character&quot; by beating Modena in their opening match, but suffered a hard-fought 3-1 defeat against Piacenza in the second week. After this defeat, they are looking at the away game against Verona as a &quot;redemption&quot; match. Milano&#x27;s biggest asset is undoubtedly their Belgian captain, Ferre Reggers, currently the league&#x27;s top scorer. Reggers has scored a staggering 55 points in two matches, averaging an incredible 6.11 per set. His 27 points in the last match against Piacenza alone demonstrates his vital role for the team. Milano will aim to capitalize on Reggers&#x27; exceptional performance and return from their challenging away game against Verona with a point or points.

While Milano may have a scoring machine like Ferre Reggers, Verona appears to have a more balanced squad. Christenson&#x27;s passing ability and ability to effectively utilize multiple scoring options like Darlan, Mozic, and Keita will make things difficult for Milan&#x27;s defense. My <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> is Verona, given their chemistry with their new coach and world-class passer Christenson. I predict a 3-1 result.</td></tr>

*The Ravens‚Äô WR table shows they‚Äôre stingy on yardage but will concede volume underneath; multiple WRs (Odunze, Zaccheaus, Kirk) hit their reception lines.*

*Waddle leads the team in targets per route and yards per route vs Cover-1 and Cover-3, with a mid-teens aDOT that pairs with Miami‚Äôs quick RPO/crosser game.*

*With Tyreek out, Waddle‚Äôs career splits jump to \~6.2 catches and \~70 yards per game, clearing 5+ receptions in \~67% of those games.*

*In his last game against the Ravens two year ago, Waddle came down with 11 receptions off of 19 targets. Easily the most on the season by a mile and Tyreek Hill was also on the field during that game.*

*On the defense side, the Ravens are top-tier in Cover-1/3 usage and tilt throws outside more than to the slot (Wide Tgt % &gt; Slot Tgt %), which favors Waddle‚Äôs perimeter snaps.*

*Even if Baltimore limits explosives, those looks force Tua to the underneath/out-breaking answers that feed Waddle.*

*With a spread greatly favoring the Ravens (+/-7.5) and the 4th highest game total of the week (+/- 50), expect the Dolphins to throw to their #1 option early and often as they attempt to stay in this game.*</td></tr>

__Event:__ NFL: Ravens @ Dolphins 8:15pm EST

__POTD:__ Jaylen Waddle o62.5 rec yards (-115), 3.75u to win 3.26

__Write Up:__ A couple of struggling AFC teams kick off Week 9 of the NFL as the (2-5) Baltimore Ravens travel to South Beach to take on the (2-5) Miami Dolphins on Thursday Night Football. Baltimore snapped a 4 game losing streak as they took down the Bears 30-16 at home on Sunday. This week they get back star QB Lamar Jackson who has been out since Week 5 with a hamstring injury. As for the Dolphins they destroyed my Atlanta Falcons on Sunday 34-10 after losing their 3 previous games. Their offense was rocking, which was much needed as it started to get scary in Miami.

Miami lost star WR Tyreek Hill for the season after his knee exploded in Week 4. WR2 Jaylen Waddle stepped into the WR1 role, &amp; he has absolutely dominated. Waddle had a huge game last week, catching 5 of 6 targets for 99 yards &amp; a TD. He had a 43 yard TD which he had 30+ yards after the catch. He had the 3rd highest air yard share Jaylen Waddle, 73% air yards share in Week 8. __Since Hill‚Äôs injury, Waddle has had at least 95 yards in 3 of those 4 games.__ Excluding the game against the Browns (horrible weather), he has been on fire:

24% target share

101 yards/game

4.1 YPRR

31% first read

He has had a huge amount of air yards as of late. __He leads all wide receivers in share of air yards (53%). Waddle has had receptions of 46, 45, &amp; 43 yards in those games. In his last 11 games without Tyreek, Waddle has 70 catches, 919 yards &amp; 7 TDs for an average of 6.4 rec &amp; 84.5 yards. He&#x27;s also averaging 8.4 targets/game &amp; he&#x27;s scored in 7 of those 11 games.__ His Yards After Catch has been insane. __Waddle is averaging 9.9 YAC, most in the NFL.__ He runs 10 yard slants &amp; just takes off at lightning speed. __He was clocked last week at 21.35 mph on his 43 yard TD, 3rd fastest speed in Week 8. He has averaged 16.8 yards per reception (268 yards/16 catches) since Week 4, 6th best of 41 qualified NFL WRs (League Avg: 12.7.)__ Now, Waddle gets his easiest matchup since Tyreek went down. 

The Ravens have had a really bad defense so far this season. __Baltimore ranks 30th in the NFL in EPA/Play allowed (0.148). Their pass defense has been poor ranking 28th in EPA/Dropback allowed (0.21) &amp; they have the 6th worst Dropback success rate allowed. Baltimore ranks 31st in turnover margin (-6).__ Last week the Ravens got torched by a pair of Bears WR‚Äôs. __Rome Odunze had 7 catches for 114 yards, DJ Moore had 73 yards on 4 catches. Both going over Waddle‚Äôs receiving line this week.__ But wasn‚Äôt the first occurrence of WR‚Äôs doing well vs the Ravens. __Baltimore has been getting lit up by WR‚Äôs all season, allowing the 3rd most receptions per game (14), the 9th most receiving yards per game (159), the 8th most yards per target (9.0), &amp; the 3rd most TD‚Äôs (10).__

The biggest reason their defense isn‚Äôt doing well is because QB‚Äôs are getting tons of time in the pocket. Baltimore has has a tough time generating pressure. __The Ravens rank 29th in pressure rate (27.1%).__ A key change they have made over the past 2 weeks to help with pressure is they are now deploying 3 safeties as part of their base defense. They are using Kyle Hamilton as a Swiss Army knife alongside Alohi Gilman &amp; rookie Malaki Starks. Hamilton has been all over the field. He played 18 snaps in the box on Sunday, playing linebacker on 19 snaps. He played another 24 snaps at slot corner &amp; 2 snaps out wide at corner. Hamilton rushed the passer on a season high 8 snaps. This was all to fix their pressure issues. But doing created a lot of space out wide for Bears receivers as evident by Odunze &amp; Moore‚Äôs stats. The Dolphins Defensive Coordinator Anthony Weaver actually came from the Ravens last year. He &amp; Ravens Defensive Coordinator Zach Orr coached together as assistants, so Weaver will know Orr‚Äôs gameplan &amp; schemes very well. As bad as Tua‚Äôs been this season, the Dolphins are going to actually be able to pass on this weak pass defense. But Tua wasn‚Äôt that bad this past Sunday.

Tuaturndaballova bounced back from a nightmare outing in Week 7, connecting on 20 of 26 passes (76.9%) for 205 yards (7.9 Y/A) &amp; a season high 4 TD‚Äôs Sunday in Atlanta. Now Tua gets to go back to Miami off a good game, &amp; he is a much better QB at home. Tua‚Äôs biggest thing is he is a first read guy. He focuses on that read &amp; struggles if he has to make a 2nd read. __Tagovailoa is averaging 8.3 yards per pass attempt on his first read throws compared to 6.4 yards per pass when he is moved off his first look.__ This is why Tyreek Hill had so many big games. Now Waddle is his 1st read guy. __Since Hill‚Äôs injury Waddle has been targeted as the 1st read on 31% of Tua‚Äôs dropbacks.__ But it‚Äôs not all Tua‚Äôs fault, Miami has one of the worst offensive line‚Äôs in the league. Their line has been so bad added a 6th offensive lineman last week, &amp; it actually worked. This shouldn‚Äôt be an issue this week vs a Ravens DLine that has had trouble pressuring QB‚Äôs. The Ravens may have had defensive issues, but Miami has had just as much. 

Miami has had major defensive troubles. __The Dolphins are currently 27th in the NFL in EPA per play allowed (0.114).__ They also have had trouble getting to the QB. __Miami ranks just 22nd in pressure rate (33.7%) even though they blitz at the 5th highest rate (33.1%). Only 40% of their blitzes generate pressure (22nd). When Miami has failed to get pressure, they have allowed a 79.3% completion percentage, worst in the league. Even when the Dolphins have gotten pressure, they have allowed a 58.3% completion percentage (30th) &amp; 7.5 yards per pass (31st).__ That‚Äôs going to be a problem vs the Ravens offense now that Lamar is back. Jackson‚Äôs return is a significant boost for the offense. __Baltimore was averaging 6.5 yards per play (best in NFL) when Lamar was on the field at the start of the season. Without Lamar they avg just 5.1 yards per play (24th in NFL).__ He is coming into the game with a hamstring injury, but if he doesn‚Äôt have any restrictions he‚Äôs going to run all over them. __The Dolphins have allowed a league high 4 rushing TD‚Äôs to QB‚Äôs &amp; 180 rushing yards on the season.__ The Ravens are going to score a lot of points this game. As bad as the vibes are surrounding Miami in bulk, they have found a way to score 21+ points in 6 of their last 7 games, with that performance in the rain in Cleveland being the exception. It‚Äôs also worth noting that the Over is 26-6 since 1983 in games with totals of 49.5 or higher involving a team that has lost 4 or 5 of its last 6 games &amp; 2 teams with winning percentages between 25% &amp; 40%. The average total points scored in that betting system is 60.8 points per game.

With the Ravens favored by 7.5 points, Miami should be trailing, which means a pass heavy game script, &amp; plenty of chances for Waddle to break one deep.

Went about how I expected it to. I was slightly worried that Vacherot would smash him in 2 after watching the first couple games, but Rinderknech recovered well. The first set went to tiebreak, and Vacherot choked it away. In the end, he was the better player though, like in their first encounter, and won a deserved, tough-fought match (6-7), (6-4), (6-3).

**Marshal @ Coastal Carolina 19:30 EST**

**Ravens @ Dolphins 20:15 EST**

All my picks so far have been exactly +200 odds. I‚Äôll continue to share plus odds picks that I‚Äôm confident in, as I have the most success with this method, and it‚Äôs going well so far on here. This one is a bit lower at +162.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

**Malik Washington 25+ receiving yards (-136) write up**

Washington‚Äôs role has expanded in recent weeks, clearing 30 receiving yards in each of his last two games while his snap share has surged from 44% three weeks ago to 64% and 62% in the past two.

Last week: 4/5 for 36 yards. Prior: 5/8 for 30. Trend‚Äôs clear ‚Äî more targets, more opportunity.

Baltimore is not good vs the pass and has a problem with slot receivers in particular‚Äîwhich I‚Äôll expand on more.

Marlon Humphrey was once a great cornerback. Just last year he was elite. He was a feisty lockdown corner that could shadow top receivers and hang with the best of them. A Gandalf corner as I like to call them: ‚ÄúTHOU SHALT NOT PASS!‚Äù

Nowadays, he‚Äôs more like Santa, and Malik Washington might be the primary beneficiary of his generosity tomorrow. 

He plays 63% of snaps as the scb. While he is ‚Äúonly‚Äù targeted on 17.8% of routes run, which is high, but not egregious, he is at the bottom of the barrel statistically in most of the productivity coverage stats. He gives up a lot of production. The stats don‚Äôt lie, this year has been a major regression season.

He‚Äôs allowing 52 ypg, 9.8 YPT, and ranks bottom-10 in most coverage stats (PFF grade 45.4, #109/113). 

Washington runs 52% of routes from the slot, so he‚Äôll see plenty of Humphrey.

The rest of the Ravens corners and secondary as a whole are nothing to write home about either. They‚Äôre the 2nd worst defense against WRs in terms of fantasy points allowed and they give up the 9th most yards to WRs.

Notable primary slot Wide Receiver lines against the Ravens:

Amon-Ra St. Brown - 7 / 77/ 1 (pre-game O/U 72.5) ‚úÖ

Khalil Shakir - 6 / 64 (pre-game O/U 47.5) ‚úÖ

Christian Kirk -  4 / 64 yards (pre-game O/U 36.5) ‚úÖ

DJ Moore - 4 / 73 (pre-game O/U 42.5) ‚úÖ

JuJu Smith-Schuster - 4 / 36 / 1 (pre-game O/U 14.5) ‚úÖ

Jordan Whittington - 3 /23 (pre-game O/U 12.5) ‚úÖ

That‚Äôs a clear rate in 6/7 games. I couldn‚Äôt find exactly who the primary was for the Browns so it could be 7/7.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

**Marshall -2.5 @ Coastal (-194) write up**

I don‚Äôt bet CFB often, but I stumbled across this game while browsing the ESPN app looking for my next victim, and it jumped out. Right off the bat, just looking at the previous games for both teams, Marshall seems to have much more impressive results despite both being 4-3. 

For instance, they beat Old Dominon 48-24 two weeks ago, and Coastal Carolina got absolutely dog walked, 47-7, by Old Dominion the week before that. Maybe the Old Dominion players partied all week, drunk off their victory against CCU, and got smashed by Marshall because of that, but more likely it‚Äôs a sign that Marshall is a cut or two above Coastal, I would think.

Looking at the stats of the QB for Marshall: Carlos Del Rio-Wilson, he looks really good. 1,131 yards passing with 12/1 TD/INT and a team high 347 yards rushing with 4 TDs. He‚Äôs a transfer and didn‚Äôt even start the first game of the season too.

Coastal Carolina has had some major quarterback problems this season. They benched their starter in week 2 after he threw 3 picks and then benched their replacement quarterback last week after he filled in with 447 passing yards and 3/3 TD/INT since then. Their latest quarterback, Samari Collier, will start this game. Maybe the third time‚Äôs the charm. 

He had a pretty good debut start in their win last week vs Appalachian state, but this guy‚Äôs a senior, 2 year JUCO transfer, who‚Äôs mobile but very much unproven.

Marshall‚Äôs QB Del Rio-Wilson is elite through the air and elite on the ground. He didn‚Äôt have a single interception until last game, and he‚Äôs averaging 293 total yards and 3.2 TDs per game since becoming the starter.

Big advantage for the Thundering Herd.

Marshall‚Äôs top wide receiver, Demarcus Lacey, has 35 / 484 / 4 on the year. Coastal‚Äôs top WR has 19/158. Lacey has more yards receiving than any of Coastal‚Äôs quarterbacks have passing.

Pretty primitive analysis, but compelling to me nonetheless. I don‚Äôt think home field advantage will make up for the deficit in quality between these two teams. My gut tells me Marshall will win on the road here and maybe stomp them. 

Teased down from -6.5 to -2.5 for extra safety, as Marshall has had 2 of their last 3 games decided by exactly 3 points (both in 2OT). They‚Äôve had 12 days off since their last game though, and will be well rested and ready to lay a beatdown on their enemy.

My <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> is combining these two alts to fit with my high odds strategy, but you can of course <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> to just tail one or the other, and the standard lines for both picks also seem good to me.

Last Pick: Dylan Dietrich ML vs Jay Clarke (+135, 1 unit): Win

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Rinky Hijikata vs Mats Rosenkranz | **Hijikata ML at -153 (DK). 1 unit.**

Write-up: The odds movement before the match was pretty wild, as things even swung in Clarke&#x27;s favor at one point. However, Dietrich closed at around +110 and played a very strong match. 

For <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, I&#x27;m sticking with Charlottesville and going with Rinky Hijikata to defeat Mats Rosenkranz in the second round. Hijikata is one of those guys who never really looks to be dominating his opponent, but always manages to score enough wins throughout the season to stay in the Grand Slam main draw range. He tends to perform fairly well indoors, as a strong net game makes up for a lackluster serve and fairly standard baseline game. His first-round match against clay-courter Matias Soto was tougher than expected, but he actually didn&#x27;t play badly, earning a 7.04 performance rating.

Meanwhile, Mats Rosenkranz has a more traditional indoor game - he&#x27;s a big lefty server that likes to take it to his opponent in rallies. However, he doesn&#x27;t really have the same consistency from the ground as Hijikata, and I feel that his approaches to the net can be a bit too lumbering when facing a speedster like Rinky. He got a decent first-round win over Andres Martin, but I still don&#x27;t feel that he&#x27;s in quite the same weight class as Hijikata. Looking at some common matchups, they both played Patrick Kypson indoors recently; Hijikata closed at around even money, while Rosenkranz was a 3.10 underdog. Rosenkranz was also priced similarly to this match in the first round against Martin, but I don&#x27;t feel that Andres is at the same level as Hijikata, as he&#x27;s more of an outdoor player and hasn&#x27;t scored any big wins recently. Teelo&#x27;s model supports the idea that there&#x27;s a gap in form between these two players, as it gives Rinky a 70.3% chance of winning this one (60.47% implied). 

Overall, I think Hijikata should be a bigger favorite here. This won&#x27;t be pretty, but he&#x27;s the more consistent player by far, and I simply see a bit of a level gap here. Some books have a worse price on this, but I would take it down to around -165.

should&#x27;ve taken it when it was o21.5 yesterday oh well

**Writeup:** Its been a while since Likely and Lamar have both been healthy and playing together. Last time it happened was week 4 for a whole 2.5 quarters until Lamar was taken out of the game. Now Likely did get 0 receptions that game but as mentioned, Lamar was not in the whole time and it was Likely&#x27;s first game back from  a fractured foot from over the summertime.

As Tyler Huntley clearly does not care much for Likely given he has 26 yards from 5 receptions over the 3 games they&#x27;ve played together, we&#x27;ll be looking at 2024 stats. Leaving out playoffs (which would make all these stats better mind you), Likely has been average 3.5 targets with 2.6 receptions, 29.8 receiving yards, and 11.4 Yards Per Reception per game. It&#x27;s clear that he&#x27;s got some good chemistry with Lamar.

Another aspect I want to look at is offensive snap share percentages. Aside from week 4 (where he played 45% of all snaps) and week 7 where I could not find data, Likely has played over 50% of the offensive snaps in each game.

Now let&#x27;s look at the Dolphins. They&#x27;ve given up the most fantasy points to Tight Ends this season. Opposing TEs have an average of just under 11 yards per reception (450 yards from 41 receptions). Dolphins also play zone nearly 70% of the time vs man, which Likely seemed to do better in last year. All these factors add up to what should be an explosive game to get Likely really going this season

Lamar is back and you know he‚Äôs going to be ready to go. 

Before he was hurt, he hit 36 yards in 2 of 4 games. 

The dolphins rank 28th in rush yards allowed per game. Cleveland and Detroit were the 2 that held him under. They rank 9th and 4th against the run respectively. 

The dolphins let Fields go off for 81 yards on 7 carries. Maye had 31 yards on 10 carries. Indiana Jones had 26 on 7. 

Lamar has hit 36 rush yards in 5 of 7 career TNF games. 

I also really like the value of Lamar ATTD at +160 so I‚Äôll be on both. Have to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> 1 though so give me the rush yards.

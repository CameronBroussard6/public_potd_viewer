**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Hawks vs TWolves: TWolves over 120.5 points (1.7)**

* TWolves averaged 120 points/game in December, Hawks averaged 127 points/game in December.
* Hawks are among the top 3 fastest-paced teams and among the bottom 10 weakest defenses.
* <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s NBA is primarily about entertainment - at least until the playoffs. People want to see a show, and no matter how important the game is for either team, most of the time, before the new year, we get to see a lot of points. 
* TWolves points vs. top-paced teams: 136 vs. Bulls (#2), 137 &amp; 120 vs. Jazz (#4),
* These are two teams that play well offensively, but the Hawks have major defensive problems.</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>💎<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: 🏈 Texas -6.5 spread
Odds: -122 on FanDuel

🏈Citrus Bowl, Michigan vs Texas, 3 pm ET 12/31/25

Record: 11-11
Net Units: -2.30 Units

Explanation: I’m not really worried about Texas, even with a lot of players opting out like Wisner, Moore Jr, etc.

Michigan has had a whirlwind of chaos recently with the firing of their head coach Sherrone Moore. Texas is going to be likely more poised, and with Michigan under change, I wouldn’t be surprised if they just resort to their typical run-first offense. Once Texas’ defense sniffs that out and gets good defensive reads as the game goes on, I see Texas slowly coming away with this game.</td></tr>

Sport NCAA Football


<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Ohio State team total (over 101.5 rushing yards)(-114 FD)


Write Up: OSU has averaged 162 rushing yards per game throughout the season. They should be in control of this game early and be relying on the run gun heavily. Yes, Miamis run defense is one of the best in college football but so is OSUs offensive line. In the one score games Miami has played in the opponents are averaging 110+ rushing yards. 

BOL!</td></tr>

It assigns ELO ratings to players and projects a win chance based on the combined ELO ratings of the players on each team. TeamReddit is projecting a 62% win chance here which creates value here on the ML.</td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>

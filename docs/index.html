Last POTD: **Midtjylland Over 3.5 team corners @ 2.00 1.5U (Bet365)** ✅️

Well, they end up getting 6 corners. I knew all they needed was a first-half goal push.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **Josh Hart RA Over 12.5 @ 1.74 2U** (Bet365)

**NBA | Bucks @ Knicks** 

J Hart has been quite consistent with playmaking and rebounding when he is given 30+ minutes. And this game will be quite important for the Knicks to clinch the group stage of the NBA Cup. So there will be a lot of playmaking. Knicks also have a good FG% in their last 10 games, with almost 50% of the attempts being on the basket(good for assists). Now analysing Hart stats without OG Anunoby (Should increase his usage and rebound):  
vs MIA: 5R+9A (14 RA)  
vs DAL: 10R + 5A (15RA)  
vs ORL: 5R + 2A (7RA)  
vs BKN: 12R + 7A (19RA)  
vs CHA: 8R + 7A (15RA)  
Hit 4/5 of the O12.5 RA

I was originally planning on taking KAT&#x27;s rebound over, but it is too inflated. Hart has the second-best defensive rebounding record in the Knicks.  Bucks are among the top teams to allow rebounds, so that&#x27;s an extra information to make the probability of this bet more hittable. GL 🍀.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: ADO Den Haag -1
+105 @bet365

Write Up:

ADO Den Haag is on fire and are on their way to promote back to the Eredivisie where they belong. In their last 4 games they average 2.8 goals. They have only lost once this season, drew once and won the 14 other games and top the league with 43 points.

They visit VVV Venlo, who have only won 1 game in their last 5 and lost the other 4. Over their last 5 games they average 0.6 goals, but concede 2.0. They have a lot of issues scoring and concede a lot against mid tier teams with more than 1 goal, that happened 3/5 last games. Now they are playing the best team in the league which are relentless.

Last season in May ADO Den Haag won 1-7 in Venlo.</td></tr>

Event:  **NCAAF - Georgia @ Georgia Tech, 3:30PM ET**

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:  **Georgia -13.5 (-120) 1.2U**

Write-Up:

I know that the initial reaction to this line is that the Yellow Jackets should be able to cover 14 points, they are ranked as the 23rd best team in college football. However, they have not had to play a team quite like Georgia yet. 

The Yellow Jackets just had a home game in Georgia against a Pittsburgh team and quickly showed up that when it matters most and the CFP is on the line, they are not up to the challenge. They ended up **losing that game by 14 to a Pitt team** that just got smacked by Notre Dame. Now they go up against this Georgia team that has finally hit their full stride with a **35-3 win over Charlotte** and an impressive **35-10 win over #10 Texas** at the time.

I expect this Georgia team, who might as well have home field advantage in the state of Georgia, to lay 21+ point win against the Yellow Jackets. 

Let&#x27;s continue this streak, huh!

First post on this thread

Game: Lakers - Mavericks 🏀

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Max christie Over 10.5 points (-132 fanduel)

Reasoning: He’s facing his former team, which ranks 28th in the league at defending spot-up shooters, exactly where Max Christie gets most of his scoring opportunities. He also performs significantly better on the road, averaging 15 points away from home if you exclude the Minnesota game, where he struggled in limited minutes. 

Last season, he scored 10 and 11 points in his two matchups against the Lakers, so if you prefer a safer option, you can take his line at 10+ points for a smaller payout.

To sum it up: he has scored at least 9 points in every game this season except one, he’s in a strong matchup, he tends to play better on the road, and he’s going up against his former team. To me, this looks like an easy over, the books are simply undervaluing Max Christie.</td></tr>

9:40 PM EST

Write Up: In this matchup of the NBA cup, the struggling Kings travel to face the struggling Utah Jazz. I was thinking about taking Jazz ml, but I like this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> more due to the fact that Lauri never lets me down. He’s been a little cold as of late which I like because he’s due for a good game, the Kings are also very small in size at the moment, Sabonis is injured and the Jazz have a big lineup compared to them. I expect Lauri to dominate no matter who’s guarding him. I’ve had the hot hand since starting my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> journey and I don’t expect it to stop here.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: Getafe Most Cards v Elche 

Sport: La Liga 

Reasoning: Getafe <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> up more cards than almost anyone in the league, averaging noticeably higher bookings than Elche, and their low-block, foul-heavy style under Bordalás always inflates their card count. Elche dominate more possession, which forces Getafe into repeated defensive actions, so the most likely outcome is Getafe finishing with more cards.

Last 10:💰✖️💰💰✖️💰✖️✖️💰✖️

Last POTD: 🏈 Chiefs vs Cowboys under 52.5 (-110). ✖️

Writeup: 3rd quarter of the game is what I was expecting for around 3/4 of it, unfortunately too much offense in the first half to try to make this plausible.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: 🏈 Eagles team total under 26.5 (-113).

Game starts at 3pm EST. Bet 3U

Writeup: For the Black Friday game, we have the Philadelphia Eagles hosting the Chicago Bears. In all honestly, I’m all in on the Bears on this one. I think they have a real shot to win this game. I love Bears +7 in this spot, but we are going to deviate slightly with the same thought process as the market is pretty split on the spread, but there is massive support on the total under. 

The Bears offense looks as good as it has all season. They are firing on all cylinders and looks like the have a legitimate game plan and vision, both with the run and the pass. With that being said, the Eagles defense also looks as good as it has all season. This is going to be a huge battle, strength on strength.

The big difference will be the Eagles offense against the Bears defense. The Eagles offense has no vision, no cohesion, no identity. The fact that Saquon Barkley has shown such little explosion this season is insane. With this, the Eagles WRs, who have a top 3 1-2 punch at the position in the league, have been wildly inconsistent to the point that Devonta Smith is taking over as the WR1 in recent weeks. To top it off, Jalen Hurts has not been playing good football. Put all that together and add on the fact that the Bears are getting back their top defender in Jaylon Johnson, and this spells trouble. 

Game script is going to be huge in this one. The Eagles are going to need to find a way to play while having the lead and start running out the clock in the 4th in order to feel even somewhat comfortable. If they start playing from behind, it may start to spiral out of control. In either scenario, I think the Bears defense, who has been top 10 all season, keeps the Eagles in check throughout the game and limit them under 26.5 points. 

Remember to only bet what you can afford to lose, and BOL!</td></tr>

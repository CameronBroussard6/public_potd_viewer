Net: 5.08u

Past <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Giannis o51 PAR

Recap: It was for the best maybe that Giannis didn’t end up playing since he likely would’ve been on some form of minutes restriction. Not really too sure, based on how the Warriors played, we didn’t need Giannis to win that game. Either way, a push is not bad. We live on to another day.



Game: Celtics @ 76ers 7:00pm EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: VJ Edgecombe 22+ asts, -115, 2u-&gt;3.74u

Reasoning: VJ Edgecombe has been lighting it up this season and has been playing crazy minutes. After a bit of a rough last game for his early standards, I expect him to have gotten the reps in now with Embiid who is slated to play against the Celtics. His poise on the court seems like he’s a growing and learning player, I expect him to want to focus on getting Embiid involved as well as being able to score well himself. In addition, VJ might be able to cash this line himself off of just points. He’s fighting for a strong ROTY campaign and I don’t suspect him to have 2 bad games, especially the confidence of knowing he can and have torched the same defense previously.</td></tr>

**Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>** - Malik Washington 25+ receiving yards (-136) + Marshall -2.5 vs Coastal Carolina (-194) | (**+162**) (**3 units**) ❌

Coastal Carolina’s third string quarterback Collier turned out to be a hell of a lot better than expected. Marshall kept getting 10 point leads and then giving up touchdowns to Collier, who kept CCU nipping at their heels. It was looking good at the start of the 3rd quarter with Marshall up 27-17, but CCU struck back quickly to make it 27-24, and from there, Marshall’s high powered offense responded by absolutely imploding. Four drives in a row went comically wrong, with their star QB throwing fumbling once (for his first lost fumble of the entire season) and then throwing 2 interceptions on back to back drives (DOUBLE the amount he’s thrown the entire season) before fumbling AGAIN on the fourth drive to make it 4 turnovers in the blink of an eye (what the actual fuck). Coastal capitalized on that chicanery and it was over. ❌

Malik Washington was quiet in the first half, only getting 8 yards on 1 catch, but the Dolphins fell behind 28-6 shortly in the 3rd and were forced to play catchup through the air in the 4th, creating a positive game script for the dolphins receivers. He finished with a season high 48 yards. ✅

Doesn’t matter because Marshall lost though.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>** - **Fernandez ML** vs Cirstea (-191) &amp; **Lauri Markkanen 30+ PRA** (-202) |**+127**| **3 units** | draftkings 

——————————————————

**Hong Kong WTA 8:00 EST**

——————————————————

**Jazz @ Suns NBA cup group play - 22:00 EST**

——————————————————

With this high plus odds strategy, we only have to win around 45-50% of our bets to make a nice profit in the long run, so it’s very important that I don’t let a single loss, or even multiple in a row, deter the process. Gotta stay psychologically strong. 

——————————————————

**Fernandez ML vs Cirstea (-191)**

Leylah Fernandez is in excellent form at the moment. She started her Japan tour off with a title earlier this month — winning the Osaka WTA. 

In the Osaka WTA tournament, Cirstea had the misfortune of having to play against Fernandez in the semifinals. It was a three set victory for Fernandez, who showed great grit in the final set, coming from behind 3-1 in the final set to win comfortably in the end.
6-1, 2-6, 6-4

Quick breakdown of the statistics from it:

Total points: Fernandez 81 — Cirstea 71.
Winners: Fernandez 33 — Cirstea 21.
Winner ratio: 41% vs 30%.
Breaks: Fernandez 6/10 (60%) — Cirstea 5/5 (100%) (Fernandez had twice as many break chances).
1st serve in: 74% vs 56%.
1st-serve points won: 58% (33/57) vs 50% (21/42).
Aces / DFs: 1 / 2 (Fernandez) vs 4 / 0 (Cirstea).

Fernandez hit more winners and earned her winners at a higher rate, reflecting sharper shot selection and cleaner execution. That gap is something that usually holds up in repeat matchups unless the opponent radically adjusts.

The break disparity and conversion efficiency is a key thing to note here. Fernandez created double the break chances, with 10 to Cirstea’s 5, but only converted 60% of them compared to 100% for Cirstea. She left plenty on the table. Even converting at just 60%, she broke serve more often. If she maintains similar pressure, and statistically, she should, we’ll likely see a more decisive scoreline this time.

Cirstea once again finds misfortune on her side, getting paired with a superior opponent who will send her packing. 

After Leylah’s title win in Osaka, she performed well in Tokyo, beating the Greek Tank Sakarri. She lost in the next round to world #6 Rybakina, but there’s no shame in that.

She’s bounced back in Hong Kong, playing peak tennis at the top of her game, already having dispatched #167 Wang and #44 Lys as if they were amateur rec league players: (6-1, 6-4) then (6-4, 6-1). 

Cirstea has won against #96 Galfi and #86 Tomljanovic, but she dropped a set in the latter, has not looked as good as Leylah, and has given no indication that their rematch will differ in result.

Another reason I like this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, is because Leylah has an excellent track record here in Hong Kong — making it to the semifinals in 2023 and winning the whole thing last year in 2024. She clearly has an affinity for these courts, and I am confident in predicting a win. 

——————————————————

**Lauri Markkanen 30+ PRA (-202)**

Lauri Markannen has cleared 30 PRA in every game so far this season and he and he got 68 PRA with 51 points on 34 shots vs the Suns in their last matchup, just a few days ago. That one went to overtime, and I don’t expect a duplicate performance, but he has a taste for their blood now and is likely to attack them hard again in this NBA cup group play game.

Started with 3 assists in the first half but only managed to get 1 in the 2nd half, overall a bad read my bad .. we move 

First games of the NBA cup is here, should mean teams going harder at it a with every point mattering.

JB is over this line in 3/5 games this season avg 5.6 RPG and 11.2 rebound chances per game. He’s gone over in 5 straight games against the 76ers including 1/1 against them this season where he had 6 on 11 rebound chances. Some of those overs against the Sixers were with Tatum aswell so without him he should get even more chances to get it done.

Feels like I’m repeating myself but with how opposing teams guards Embiid and with how he plays, he draws the bigs out leaving tons of weak side rebound opportunities for the wings where Jaylen should eat.

Has gone over in 3 straight games against Embiid with 6, 6 and 7 boards, Tatum played in two of those games. Without him there’s even more responsibility for JB to fight for the rebounds.</td></tr>

**Last Pick:** **Tulane @ UTSA | College Football | Totals Over 53.5 (-123)**

**Write Up:** Solid win from yesterday&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. Solidifying the o53.5 before heading into the 4th quarter felt good. For Friday&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, I&#x27;m looking at the College Football lineups and will be targeting the C-USA matchup between Sam Houston and LA Tech.

Neither of these teams boast a great record in conference play, especially with Sam Houston sitting last in conference with an 0-7 overall record. Evaluating scores; Sam Houston averages 14 offensive points per game on the road while their defense allows 43 points per game. Compared to LA Tech, who averages 31 offensive points per game at home while their defense allows just 14 points per game.

Louisiana Tech lost 28-27 in Overtime to Western Kentucky in their last home game. Despite the offense having little issues moving the ball and staying neutral in the turnover margins for the game, the team came up short. The Bulldogs starting Kicker DNP in Tuesday&#x27;s game and the Bulldogs likely wished he had. They ended up missing two field goals in the duration of the game, the last one being the game winner. Drew Henderson will be back in action for Friday&#x27;s game, and LA Tech is going to be looking to bounce back with a win before heading on the road again. I&#x27;m taking the Over in this match up.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Borussia Dortmund U5.5 team corners vs Augsburg 5U @ 1.80 (Bet365)

Write-up: Really good win to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> up from Motherwell, who dominated Dundee with some brilliant football at times. They took the lead just before the half through Maswanhise and doubled it towards the end of the match with Watt scoring. On the cards front Hendry picked up a booking in the 63rd with nothing after that with only 9 fouls conceded.

After two very mixed seasons (for their standards) where they finished outside the top 3, Dortmund are slowly rediscovering some consistency under Kovac and are playing some nice transitional football. They defeated Frankfurt on penalties in the DFB-Pokal a few days ago and are 4th in the league - 2 points off second after some tricky opening fixtures to start the season. On the other hand Augsburg finished 12th last season, comfortably avoiding relegation  but find themselves in 15th spot right now after a poor start to the season. Under former Bayern player Wagner they have developed a counter-attacking style similar to Dortmund. At home, Augsburg have averaged 5.2 corners won over their last ten with 3.8 conceded whilst on the road BVB have averaged 4.1 won over the same period. That gives me 4.2 corners for Dortmund even by applying pressure as they are the better team.

That gives this play a 75% chance of winning with some very good value at stake. This line cleared in last year’s fixture and in 9/10 of both BVB’s last 10 away matches and for Augsburg’s opponents at the WWK Arena. BOL !

PSV face Fortuna in what could be an open match with goals expected. PSV’s attack has been strong recently, with three of their last six games going over 3.5 goals. They dominate possession and create plenty of scoring chances, especially at home. Fortuna can sometimes defend deep but also struggle against fast, attacking teams like PSV. If PSV start well and take control early, the game could see several goals again. Over 3.5 goals looks possible considering both sides’ recent trends and PSV’s attacking form.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Larger write-up coming...   
  
This is a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> for a few different reasons. But it boils down to two things that compound into one another. 

1. I think bookies have really struggled with what to make of Coventry so far. I feel like odds have been off for a while - which is fair to a degree, this has been pretty unexpected. It&#x27;s tightened a bit in the last few weeks, but still some caution. 

2. Wrexham, imo, have been overrated in the odds in a large percentage of games. 

Add these two together, and you get pretty good odds. It was at $1.91 but it changed in literally the ten minutes it took me to write this up. It might shorten again.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Al Hilal O1.5 Goal Vs Al Shabab + PSV Vs Sittard O2.5 Goal ( -167 ) 3u to win 1.8u

Write Up

Al Hilal come in as clear favourites. They have one of the best attacking records in the league and strong home performances. Theyve been in great form lately, creating chances nonstop and usually finding the net at least twice in most games especially at home.

Al Shabab’s defense hasn’t exactly been solid either, so unless they suddenly tighten up, Al Hilal should have enough quality to put in a couple of goals.

Onto next <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> I think the over 2.5 goals in PSV vs Sittard has a good shot. PSV almost always play attacking football, especially at home , they press high, create a ton of chances, and usually score two or three on their own.

Sittard might not be a top team, but they can sneak in a goal if PSV relax a bit at the back. So even if PSV run away with it, something like 3-0 or 3-1 feels pretty realistic.</td></tr>

**Slepsk Suwalki - Trefl** 🏐 Volleyball Poland Superliga UTC 19:30

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **Trefl +1.5 Set Handicap** @ 1.56

Yesterday Verona did not disappoint and won 3-0. 🎯

Let&#x27;s start with the odds shown for both teams. Trefl should be the favorites, even slightly. This is because the balance of strength currently favors Trefl Gdańsk. They started the season with a 3-2 win over Barkom Lwów, with MVP Tobias Brand (New Transfer) scoring 23 points. In week 2, they lost 2-3 away to Asseco Resovia in Rzeszów, making it 1 win and 1 loss in the first two matches. The on-field backbone (setter, hitter, and libero) is more established, and there&#x27;s more depth. The transfer window was a productive one for Trefl. High-level &quot;winning profile&quot; additions: Experienced/effective players like Tobias Brand and Piotr Nowakowski directly boosted the quality. Aliaksei Nasevich (OPP): He sprained his ankle in a league match on October 26th and was substituted. It&#x27;s uncertain whether he&#x27;ll be ready for the away game against Suwałki.

Ślepsk Malow Suwałki lost 1-3 at home to Resovia and 0-3 away to Jastrzębski Węgiel in Week 2; they opened the season 0-2. The long, 33-31 victory in the third set came in the Jastrzębie match. A major summer overhaul: two new setters (Kamil Droszyński, Karol Jankiewicz), midfield reinforcements (American David Smith, Jan Nowakowski). Captain Bartosz Filipiak has been extended; he remains the team&#x27;s primary scoring option.

Trefl has looked competitive and productive in two matches, while Ślepsk struggled to create sets against two strong opponents. Trefl&#x27;s core is ready for the season opener. Trefl&#x27;s wing/backline is capable of holding sets inside and will give their all to win this match.</td></tr>

PSG take care of business but unfortunately our second leg gets voided due to an eye poke and is considered a no contest which means it should be void on every slip. Technically still made .34 units off of it even with the void so we&#x27;ll just count it as a win, unfortunate though because it was looking like a good fight.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s match: LA Tech vs Sam Houston State (CFB) 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: LA Tech -14 Alternate Spread (-142, Fanatics)

If your book does not have whole number spreads you must calculate it yourself using a run line calculator with -14.5 and -13.5  (https://zcodesystem.com/runline\_calc/)

Back to fading my favorite team <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, Sam Houston State is still winless in 7 games and they are coming off a bye week so the last time they played was the last time we faded them against UTEP. If we take a look at similar opponents these two teams have faced this year we can see that there is a clear talent gap here because LA Tech is actually blowing out the teams that are blowing out Sam Houston.

Sam Houston vs WKU 24-41 Loss

Sam Houston vs NM State 10-37 Loss

Sam Houston vs UTEP 17-35 Loss

LA Tech vs WKU 27-28 Loss

LA Tech vs NM State 49-14 Win

LA Tech vs UTEP 30-11 Win

As you can see LA Tech has covered the  spread against all teams who covered the spread against Sam Houston except against WKU. Admittedly LA Tech has not been in good form, they closed against Kennesaw State as a -5.5 favorite and against WKU as a -6 favorite and lost to both outright. They got destroyed by Kennesaw State 35-7 but performed much better in their loss against WKU in the second half which I&#x27;m hoping carries over to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. They were trailing WKU 20-7 but then held WKU scoreless in the second half and was able to force OT which they lost. I think this is a good bounce back spot for LA Tech who are basically the better team everywhere compared to Sam Houston, personally taking -14 for a two touchdown cushion which would be a push but I also like -16.5.

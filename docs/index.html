Teams: TYLOO vs. paiN  
Time: 2:00 AM EST.  
  
**Writeup:**

* Jamyoung is averaging a .69 KPR L3 months, with a .71 KPR in the last month 
* DGT is averaging a .65 KPR L3 months with a .61 KPR in the last month
* paiN should <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> Nuke, their best map and one they beat TYLOO on 13-6 in the previous match between the two
* Despite TYLOO&#x27;s struggles, they beat Vitality badly yesterday on the map and have been putting a ton of work into this map behind the scenes. Even if they don&#x27;t take the map outright, I think we see a much closer game overall. Of TYLOO&#x27;s recent 4 Nuke games, they have upsets against Vitality/FaZe and a 13-11 loss against 3DMAX who are another fantastic Nuke team, I think they are a better Nuke team then they showed against paiN
* DGT has struggled on Nuke heavily, especially recently, DGT is averaging a .54 KPR last month on Nuke, a .59 KPR L3 months, and a .64 KPR since joining paiN overall. Solid drop off especilly considering the strong results paiN have showed on this map, meaning the drop is even more substantial
* Jamyoung has maintained strong Nuke stats throughout the last year despite TYLOO&#x27;s struggles on it as a team. He is averaging a .71 KPR L3 months on the map, a .81 KPR L6 months and a .81 KPR in the last year as well on the map
* DGT will start on T side, since joining paiN he has had solid T side numbers compared to most players but still weaker then on CT side by a slight margin averaging a .63 KPR average on T side Nuke
* JamYoung will start on CT side, in the last year he has averaged very strong CT side numbers averaging a .80 KPR on CT side, but is quite good on T side as well giving him a strong balance overall
* Last time they faced h2h, DGT beat Jamyoung on Nuke 11-9 in kills, this was despite a paiN 13-6 win. On top of this, Jamyoung has played 21 maps of Nuke in the last 12 months, against paiN was the only map he has ever dropped single digit kills</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Mbappe to score anytime vs Ukraine 3u at $1.57

I got this at $1.61, and it&#x27;s already down to $1.57 at the time of writing, which is about 4 hours before the post goes live. 

It&#x27;s an important game for France, so I&#x27;m expecting all the big guns to come out. 

If Mbappe plays for France recently, he scores. In his last two international windows (3 games) he&#x27;s scored three and assisted two. 

One of those goals was the away game vs Ukraine. 

Mbappe is also the penalty taker, so that will be another way he can score. Always nice to have the pen taker when picking a scorer. 

Like I said before, it&#x27;s an important game for France... There is only 3 points separation between France and Ukraine and a five-goal difference... So a loss can really make things tight, where a win can secure qualification.

France won&#x27;t want to mess about here.

If the $1.57 isn&#x27;t to your liking, I also don&#x27;t hate Mbappe and Olise both to score or assist at $2. </td></tr>

<tr><td class='post'>**Record:** 11-6

**Net Units:** \+4.72

**Last Pick:** Josh Jacobs O68.5 Rushing (-112 on DK) 1u to win 0.89u ✅

**Todays Event**: 🏈 NFL Thursday Night Football Jets @ Patriots 7:15 PM CST🏈

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Todays pick</mark>**: Mack Hollins 40+ Receiving (+104 on DK) 1u to win 1.04u

**Writeup:** Mack just came off a crazy 106 yard receiving game against Tampa bay and cleared this number in 3/5 of his last games. His average sits lower than the line at 32.2, but since week 5, he&#x27;s been seeing more usage, averaging 1.8 targets with 1.4 receptions weeks 1-5, meanwhile weeks 6-10 having 4.8 targets with 3.8 receptions. While his target share has been low at only \~12% in 2025, Kayshon Boutte has been ruled out, along with TE2 Austin Hooper, which will pump his numbers up, with the potential to be WR2 behind Stephon Diggs

While Hollins is versatile and can play generally well in both, he tends to do better in zone coverage which is what Jets run about 2/3rds of the time. Not only that but the Jets do worse against outside receivers  Jets also allow 8 yards per target to opposing receivers. Another thing to note is that outside Cornerback Azaraeye&#x27;h Thomas has been ruled out for this game, allowing for easier matchups for our outside receivers, and makes it less intimidating as the jets hold the 8th best pass defense.

The last bit of info i&#x27;d like to add is that this is a Thursday night divisional game, if I was superstitious, i&#x27;d say something about the last 3 snooze fest primetime games. The lines are heavily in Patriots favor, yet recently (post Tom Brady Patriots), Jets mostly have been able to keep the game within 1 score, with November 24th of 2021 being the last time Jets lost by more than that 1 score. If this is potentially a trap game, there could be a larger chance for more passes, and more to our boy Hollins.

BOL to anyone tailing!

**Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Morgan Gibbs White 1+ SOT (-110) ✅️

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s Event:** UEFA World Cup Quals | England vs Serbia (11:45 AM PST)

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Elliot Anderson 1+ SOT (+110), 1 unit to win 1.1 units

**Write Up:** Hello again friends! We&#x27;re back after a few days break with some world cup qualifier action where we&#x27;re into the last two games of the group stage. In case you can&#x27;t tell by now, I love SOT plays. They&#x27;re quite fun to root for while watching a match. Our first two plays both hit within the first 3 minutes of their respective games, great start to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>! I was waffling here between this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> and England 3+ goals, but landed here because this one could be a slog. England have qualified for the world cup, so this is technically a meaningless game for them. But England boss Thomas Tuchel wants his side to continue to gel and build momentum. He also loves himself some Elliot Anderson. Anderson has played nearly every minute for England since his first cap with the senior squad in September. Anderson also fits the mold for my favorite kind of player to back, scrappy hard working midfielders who like to take long shots. We&#x27;re getting good odds here because Anderson has only recorded a SOT for England in 1 of 4 matches. But in his last match against Latvia, he took 5 shots. While none of those found the target, the uptick in shot attempts are promising as his confidence builds and he cements himself in England&#x27;s midfield. 

Now to Serbia. They currently sit 3rd in the group, 1 point behind Albania. Serbia needs a point here to stay alive in qualifiers. I expect them to park the bus and invite shots from a distance, as they won&#x27;t win a high goal shootout with England. This is Anderson&#x27;s shooting range and I fully expect him to find the target here, if not the back of the net. 

BOL!</td></tr>

Both sides arguably with not much at stake here as Italy have a slim to none chance of overtaking Norway, whereas Moldova cannot advance anymore. Moldova at home though to get just 2 corners, when they got 6 in the reverse matchup seems great, so far with 6 games played Moldova covered this in all but 1 game away vs Norway. At home, Moldova got 6 vs Norway. Moldova have also previously gotten at least 2 vs Romania in a friendly very recently and vs Poland. Italy have given up 2 or more corners in 5/6 games during the group stage. Simply expect the home side to show a respectable performance and get at least 2 corners here.</td></tr>

Event: NFL | Jets @ Patriots ( Divisional Matchup )


<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Hunter Henry Over 33.5 Rec Yards @1.83 2u to win 1.66u


Write Up:  


Hunter Henry will see an increased role in the Patriots passing offense because Kayshon Boutte (hamstring) will not playing and Austin Hooper (concussion) are on limited minuts vs the Jets . Maye has been leaning on short and middle reads, especially to his TE which Henry already averages about 3.8 receptions and 44.9 yards per game with him.


Austin Hooper’s absence removes the team’s TE2 and a reliable underneath target. That means Henry should get nearly all tight end snaps.


Kayshon Boutte missing will hurt their WR core, so the Patriots may funnel more targets toward Henry . Also The Jets this season allow tight ends to average about 42.6 receiving yards per game when being targeted. </td></tr>

Last 5 &gt;LWWWW // Profit: €3,577.04

I was initally going to stay away from <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, since I find predicting cup games way tougher. Anyway, this one is an interesting one. OGC Nice are technically done, they cannot qualify anymore for the Europa League. I&#x27;ve looked at their Instagram and found out that atleast 80% of the normal selection are not traveling. This makes it a B maybe C team against a full men&#x27;s team of Ludogerets, whom are looking for a win to get qualified.

Further, Nice are very bad on the road. they have currently lost 3 out of 3 away games in Europe. Ludogerets at home have been okay, with a 1-1-1 record and managing a win against LaLiga team Celta. The only worry for this game is that Nice recently changed their coach, which makes the form of a team a bit less influential. Still though, with the team being mostly youngsters <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, I do not expect they can put up a fight against Ludogerets.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: Porto -1 and Over 0.5 Goals In The 1st Half Between Both Teams vs Rangers

Competition: Europa League

Sport: Football

Odds: 4/5

Reasoning: Porto have a clear incentive to push the game early with top-8 qualification on the line, and they’re at home against a Rangers side that’s injury-hit, short on depth, and managing minutes with domestic fixtures ahead. That early pressure raises the probability of a first-half goal, and once Porto get in front, the quality gap and Rangers’ weakened defensive rotation make a second goal far more likely than a controlled 1-0.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: (NBA) Oklahoma City Thunder -5.5 vs Minnesota Timberwolves (-132) (9:40 PM EST)**

Reasoning: Thunder are on the road taking on the T-Wolves. Thunder is without a doubt the better team talent wise as well as offensively and defensively. They are 1st in the west at 38-10 on the season and more importantly 17-5 on the road. The question here is that the Thunder just lost Jalen Williams (16.8 PPG) to injury which would be a setback for a lot of teams however the Thunder arguable have the most depth in the league. You can even make the argument the Thunder are better without JDub as well. Don’t forget Williams misses the first 19 games of the season and the Thunder went 18-1 in those games and looked basically unstoppable. That said, SGA will carry more weight with Williams out tonight and I’m fine with that. SGA can go off against anyone and Holmgren is still anchoring that elite defense. Give me the reigning MVP and the Thunders depth to cover 5.5 points against the Timberwolves tonight.

Game: Ludogorets Razgrad v OGC Nice

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Ludogorets Razgrad to win - 1.72 (Bet365)

Write Up:

*Last bet cashed in 35 mins (2 Goals Ahead). Love a sweat free bet.*

This one should be pretty straight forward. Nice is already out of the competition and will probably have the focus set on stopping their rapid decent down the Ligue 1 table (2W - 1D - 7L in last 10 games). This contrasts with Ludogorets who are 2nd in their League and need a win <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> to keep their Europa dreams alive. I expect them to bring their A+ game.

  
Other fun stats include:

\- Nice has lost every away game in this Europa Campaign

\- Ludogorets has lost only 1 which was to Real Betis, a really strong team in the competition

\- Nice have conceded 2+ goals in their last 3 away Europa games

\- Ludogorets has scored 3+ goals in 3/4 of their home games.

Midtjylland failed to secure their spot in the top eight last week as they were held to a 3-3 draw against Brann, leaving them with work to do on the final day to seal a top 8 place. 

They take on a Dinamo Zagreb side that have plenty to fight for as they look to secure a top 24 finish and get through to the playoffs. . Zagreb’s games in the Europa League this season have been very high scoring, with 26 match goals across their seven games in the competition 

Zagreb have seen 3+ goals in six of their seven matches in the Europa League this season, with the exception of their 1-1 draw with Malmo.  With both sides having something to fight for, i expect goals to flow &amp; hoping for an o2.5. Probably a 2-1 or 3-1 is my guess

&quot;The Phoenix Suns found a way around their guard shortage in a victory over Brooklyn on Tuesday.

They went right to the paint.

Center Mark Williams scored a season-high 27 points in a late comeback win, and it wouldn&#x27;t be surprising if the Suns used a similar strategy when they host the East-leading Detroit Pistons on Friday.

Williams was 13 of 16 from the field Tuesday, also both season highs, and the Suns scored 72 points in the paint while compensating for the absence of starting guards Devin Booker and Collin Gillespie, as well as potential starter Jalen Green.

The Pistons have won six of seven and nine of 11, with four wins in that run coming by four points or less.

Pistons center Jalen Duren had 16 points and 18 rebounds in the first meeting with the Suns, when Williams had five points in 22 minutes.

Booker is not expected to play Thursday, and Gillespie (hand) and Green (hamstring) are questionable.

Jalen Johnson 10+ rebounds (-140 on Fanatics) three unit play (all my others have been two so far). Hawks vs Rockets at 8:10


Since Trey Young was traded, Jalen Johnson is averaging 10.9 rebounds per game. He is averaging 11.3 in his last ten games. 

8.8 of his 10.6 rebounds a game are defensive. Most of his rebounds are outside the paint or in transition, which is not where Sengun typically collects his. He usually grabs rebound around the rim. The Rockets do lead the league in offensive rebounding, which is why I expect Johnson to be extra aggressive on the boards because that will be a focal point to them winning (limiting Rockets offensive boards). So to connect the dots, if he plays his normal game (collecting rebounds outside the pain and in transition), but is also spending some extra time crashing the boards to limit second chance opportunities, I think his potential rebound opportunities are higher than normal. 

Rockets are on a back to back with all their main starters playing 36 minutes late last night. They have to travel and play at Atlanta. This line has already moved from -130 initially to -160 on some.</td></tr>

Event: 8:00PM EST

Reasoning: FAU just played Memphis on January 11th and won by 11. FAU shot a solid 51% from the field and out rebounded Memphis 46-29. The negative of that game was the turnovers and FT%. FAU had 15 turnovers and shot 11/16 from the line. Despite the turnovers and FT% from last game they still managed to win by double digits, clean that up and this should be a no sweat. Sure Memphis is at home in this one, but to give this value to a team who just beat them by 11 a couple weeks ago is unreal. I will gladly take this price for FAU to get an “underdog” road win tonight.

But I&#x27;m still rolling the dice with him. It&#x27;s very rare to get plus odds on a player who&#x27;s averaging almost a point/game.

Gost has been extremely productive this season, with 32 points in 35 games. His advanced metrics among qualifying D-men is phenomenal: Gost ranks 5th in XGF/60 and unlike freaking Zegras, *2nd* in actual GF/60.

The nice thing about Carolina has a very deep line relative to the league. They have 9 players with at least 10 goals (most in NHL), so that means Gost doesn&#x27;t have to play with the top line to produce (although it would help).</td></tr>

**Write up:**

Hope no one’s heading into the Celtic vs Utrecht fixture expecting fireworks, you might want to brace yourself for a bit of a defensive stalemate instead. Utrecht’s European campaign has been very unremarkable having only found the back of the net three times across seven matches, and with their elimination already confirmed, the motivation to break a goal drought at a Celtic Park is likely at a low. On the flip side, Celtic is navigating a significant injury crisis at the back with key figures like Carter-Vickers and Alistair Johnston sidelined, which usually forces a manager to prioritize a touch of a safety first approach rather than an all out offensive. Expect the Hoops to focus on a professional, disciplined clean sheet to secure their progression, while a struggling Utrecht team who haven&#x27;t scored a goal in their last 180 minutes of football, struggles to offer any real threat, making a &quot;both teams to score&quot; outcome feel like a fair long shot tonight. Can’t deny the odds for what I believe to be a good chance. BoL</td></tr>

**Write-up:** oooh this is juicy. I’m feeling pretty confident about this play. Durant has been logging a ton of minutes this season, which is especially true in his last few games. Steven Adams suffered a season-ending injury, which has pushed KD to play 39 minutes a night. Insane volume. We’re going to take his points + assists here as he has covered 27 out of 43 games this season. However, when Adam doesn’t play, this jumps to an outstanding 10 out of 12. In one of those games, he played the Grizzlies and shot an awful 5/18 - 28% with no free throws. In another, he played the Spurs and finished with 25 pts+ast, where he only shot 12 times, a season low. 

Without Adams, KD is looking at 19.5 FGA per game. In the majority of those games, he is shooting 46% or better. He is also looking at 10 potential assists per game, while averaging 5.5. Versus the two teams he failed to cover his 29.5 pts + ast line, he got revenge in his last two games, going 35 against the Grizzlies and 30 against the Spurs. KD has been on an absolute tear since December 1st.

KD is getting a much softer matchup tonight on a back-to-back. KD has covered in every back-to-back this season without Adams. Hawks rank 28th in points allowed to the small forward position; for reference, the Spurs rank 2nd. KD is the iso god. Hawks get obliterated in iso matchups, ranking 28th. KD is getting 50% of his points from isolation buckets, free throws, and spot-up shooting. Hawks rank 13th in defending spot-up shooting this season. This is where KD thrives. Versus teams that rank 13 or better in defending spot-up shooters, KD has covered in 15 out of 17 games. With one loss coming all the way back in Nov. 3, and the last versus the Kings, where he finished at 29 pts+ast. KD wants you to guard him. KD wants to pull up and shoot it in your face. The slim reaper is extremely tall - taller than the entire Hawks starting lineup. I think KD has even more incentive to score now, since he is inching closer to MJ’s scoring record every day. 

Hawks are ranking 2nd in pace this season, and KD has covered every game all the way back to Dec. 1 versus teams that rank 10th or better.. loves slowing down fast pace teams. Hawks are allowing the 23rd most assists and 20th most to small forwards. KD has been torching mediocre transition defenses lately as well. Everything points to him having another monster game and a cover. 

This leads me to a max bet. Even if he somehow doesn’t cover tonight, I believe the value here is highly worth the risk. The minutes will be there, and the majority of shots will be KD’s. Spread sits at -3.5, favoring the Rockets. It should be a close game, considering the Hawks just took down the Celtics last night as well. 

Good Luck, fellas!</td></tr>

This <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Braga ML + Bologna ML (+130)

Writeup: Barca continued the trend of not keeping a clean sheet 😭😭 though I mustn’t laugh since I’m a Madrid fan.

Going simple with this one, both braga and Bologna have something to play for. Braga fighting to keep top 8 spot and Bologna for a tiny tiny chance to make it to top 8 since qualification is already confirmed. Bologna may rest key players seeing that they’re playing last place Maccabi Tel aviv who’s managed to only get 1 point from a 0-0 draw with palinthakos, but maybe they may bring out their full squad on purpose. Im more afraid of their game in hopes of Bologna not rotating heavily. Braga visits go ahead eagles in Netherlands? Where they’ve went unbeaten in all away games with 2 wins 1 draw against nice and Celtic which are teams who are considerably better than eagles (don’t let that Aston Villa win fool you).</td></tr>

NBA | Timberwolves v OKC | 🏀  

Slow start but Harden gets it done despite the blowout, we move.

Ran Ant’s RA last time these teams met and it cashed with no sweat at all, the rebounding numbers does stand out a bit more tho so im leaning more towards that. Has crashed the glass in every matchup against OKC as he isn’t defending the high usage guys like Shai or Jdub leading to more weak side rebounds where he’s feasted.

Since 2024 (Playoffs included) he’s over in 10/L11 against OKC, including 2/2 this season with 8 &amp; 12 rebounds where’s he’s avg 15.0 rebound chances. Has cleared this line in 4 straight games now aswell, with the latest one coming against the Mavs.

OKC are bottom 4 in rebounds allowed to SG’s this season and bottom 7 in rebounds overall.

Great spot for Ant to continue the trend in a matchup he loves, def a good ladder spot.</td></tr>

For the first time in the open era, no women in the Australian Opens semi finals has yet to drop a set, meaning throughout the whole competition they have won every Match in straight sets (2-0). Even with the quality of both the players, I still believe this match to be no different. Seems to be a common theme leading up to the semis with many recent matches ending in straight sets almost as if whoever gets the leg up on the first, also takes the second.

As for the Aces, Elena is an elite dominate server averaging 7 Aces per match. In 2025 she became the first woman in nine years to exceed 500 aces in a single season, shouldn’t be a sweat.

Start Time &amp; TV 7:00 &amp; 8:30pm EST (ESPN+)

Units: 3.5 Units

Reasoning: For <mark style='background:#fff59d'>todays pick</mark> of the day we will be going with a college basketball two legger between the Lipscomb Bison (14-7) against the Jacksonville Dolphins (8-13) in this Atlantic Sun conference matchup and the Southeast Missouri State Redhawks (11-10) against the Western Illinois Leathernecks (4-17) in this Ohio Valley conference matchup. First of all, this Lipscomb squad has been lights out in conference play so far as the Bison have got off to a 7-1 in Atlantic Sun play while the Dolphins have struggled in conference play with a 3-5 record against Atlantic Sun opponents. These Bison hold an advantage over the Dolphins in points scored per game, field goal percentage, free throw percentage, three point percentage, three point defense, team rebounding, blocks per game, steals per game and turnovers limited on the offensive end per game. These two team have met before at the Bison had a convincing 76-57 win over the Dolphins and the Bison held the Dolphins to the least amount of points given up to a division one school all season so I think this Bison squad matches up well against Jacksonville and they will be able to have repeat success against them. I also like adding Southeast Missouri State to this slip because the Redhawks have demolished the Leathernecks by 23 points earlier this year and because the Leathernecks are one of the worst basketball teams in all off division one college basketball. The Leathernecks have not beaten a division one team in regulation all year with their only division one win coming against North Dakota in overtime and this team ranks near the bottom of division one in points scored per game, field goal percentage, free throw percentage, steals, blocks, RPI rating, NET rating and KenPom rating so I like fading this terrible basketball team. That being said, I think both of these team should be able to handle business in their respective matchups.

Prediction: 77-71 Bison, 79-68 Redhawks

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Tyrese Maxey u3.5 threes (-121); 1 unit to win 0.82 units

Write Up:  
Since Oubre&#x27;s return from injury (8 games since and including January 7), Maxey has gone under this line 6/8 times.   
Maxey is there primary creator and will get his three point attempts; he averaged over 8 attempts per game over the previously mentioned 8 game stretch. However, as bad as the Kings always seem to be, they do a pretty good job of preventing faster, shorter guards from making their threes thanks to the energetic ball chasers they have on the team (Westbrook, Schroder, Keon Ellis, Nique Clifford).  
Something to note is that high volume 3 point makers have gone over this line: Curry, Donovan Mitchell, and Anthony Edwards. This is the reason for the lower risk I put on this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, but I still like it. Unlike the others, Tyrese Maxey is a much more willing passer and has to be with Embiid looking as good as he has recently.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>**: IEM Krakow Paravision vs Aurora 

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Paravision ML | 1U | -159  BetRivers**

**Reasoning**: Paravision is one of the most disciplined teams in counter strike. They make for a bad matchup for most teams especially a team like Aurora.

In November on LAN Paravision beat Aurora 13-11 on Overpass. Since then to start the year Aurora was played 3 best of 3’s going 1-1 against GamerLegion and beating HOTU. Meanwhile Paravision won Blast Bounty beating #6 Spirit, #3 Falcons, and #1 Falcons.

Both teams have added a new player since their last meeting. For Aurora soulfly has a 0.98 over 8 maps while Zweih for Paravision has a 1.14 rating over 15 maps. It is a small sample size and soulfly has plenty of time to turn it around, but so far he is struggling and I expect that to continue against tough competition at his first big lan.

For the map pool Aurora perma bans Ancient while Paravision perma bans Nuke. From there Paravision has an immediate weakness they can punish. Aurora plays little Inferno and is 0-3 over the last 3 months. Paravision holds a better win percentage than Aurora on every remaining map except Overpass which Paravision already beat them on. The only wildcard in this is the return of Anubis with map changes that we have yet to see. Either way I believe Paravision has a clearer path to grind out a victory.

EVENTO: (NCAA) Memphis vs Florida Atlantic 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Under 151.5 -118 NoviBet 

please ignore my english, i’m not very good at it, maybe) summary:

this game sets up much tighter than people usually expect, which is why the under makes sense. neither team plays at a consistently fast pace. memphis can run in short stretches, but against disciplined opponents they tend to slow things down. florida atlantic is even more deliberate, taking care of the ball, using the shot clock, and avoiding forced transition plays.

defensively, both teams know how to disrupt rhythm. memphis raises its intensity at home, applies pressure, and forces opponents into late, uncomfortable shots. fau is solid on defense, with good help coverage and strong perimeter control, limiting easy baskets and second-chance points.

offensively, neither side relies on pure volume. fau spreads the scoring, while memphis can be streaky, often going through long scoring droughts when their first option is taken away. add in the competitive nature of the matchup, which usually leads to a more physical, half-court game.

with fewer true possessions and a high chance of low-scoring stretches, the overall setup points toward a lower-scoring game, making the under the side with the strongest value.</td></tr>

Game/Event: Counterstrike 2 (CS2) | IEM Krakow |

\-Continue to find misplaced lines daily, and this one is no different. Cairne was a huge prospect from Inner Circle in tier two CS scene in 2025 averaging a .77 KPR and getting the call up to NIP

\-As we continuously see, people struggle once they get called up in almost all cases because their roles change and the teams are no longer being played around them specifically, they must also learn new strategies and sometimes even communicate in different language

\-Cairne has only played two matches with NIP so far but in those matches he has averaged a .64 KPR in tier one so far. This is a -.13 KPR drop from tier two stats. On top of this, he had one huge map but if you factor that map out which looks like an outlier, he is averaging a .55 KPR in tier one

\-NIP <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> their map 2nd based on current odds, they normally go to Nuke as their <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, they may alter from this as they have lost two in a row however I would still predict they stick with it as Passion UA are not a good Nuke team at all but other maps could be possible as well

\-Cairne has struggled in two main areas so far in the team, T side and Nuke specifically. On Nuke Cairne is averaging a 0.43 KPR overall, -.22 KPR from his averaging and he has really struggled on both sides of the map dropping 7 and 11 kills in his two maps played on Nuke so far. His second area struggling is T side. While he has put up great CT averages with a 0.79 KPR, he is struggling massively on T side averaging a .49 KPR.

\-Since NIP <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> the map, they will start on T side as Passion UA will get side choice, this is going to give us a big advantage once again. Taking Cairne .64 KPR, it would take \~26.5 round for him to hit the over, with the max regulation being 24 rounds. Huge value spot for a line way too high</td></tr>

I often have more than one two leg and so far those are proving to be more successful than the ones I am posting, <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> curse? (I kid this is all for fun).

ANYWAY onto todays, quick and simple Bologna face Maccabi Tel Aviv. Simply put MTA are not doing well, they are dead last in the league going 0-1-6 (W-D-L) and have a massive goal difference of -17. I can&#x27;t see them beating Bologna who are mid table at 15th and have qualified for the round of 16 knockout phase - despite this I do think Bologna put their better foot forward and still will be too much for MTA especially when they now have nothing to play for. Bologna are too much for a very poor MTA side that have proven they are not the same quality as their opposition in the league this year.

Aston Villa/Salzburg is at Villa park, an absolute fortress of a European ground. AV average 10 corners per game at home (for both teams), they have seen u10.5 corners 6/last 7 games and Salzburg have gone under this same line 4/last 5 games. I do think that this is a game that will be won or lost in midfield, given AV&#x27;s injuries I do think there will be some rotation - HOWEVER it is important to know that both midfields posses the quality to counter and seek out breaks. This being said I like it for more open play shots and less corners and set pieces. Lets hope that these streaks continue and it is a good game either way.

Hawaii is also top 30 in defensive efficiency, while UC Irvine is 216th in offensive efficiency. Both teams have a mediocre shooting percentage, average rebounding, average free throws, etc. I expect UC Irvine to create some turnovers however, and with their average pace of play, I expect only an average number of points off of said turnovers. UC Irvine has been playing better recently, but is one of the worst teams while playing at home. Hawaii has been playing worse recently, but plays better away. All in all, expect a lot of mediocracy. The books already have this as a low total, but I like it even lower. If I had to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> a side, give me UC Irvine +1.5, but I like the under more in this one.

Sticking with unders as playoff-bound teams are ramping up defensive intensity in pursuit of seeding. I think this line is a bit inflated due to both teams averaging very high ppg on the season, but both teams&#x27; scoring has fallen dramatically more recently, with already good defense picking up.

OKC ranks #1 in fewest opponent ppg on the season (107.6) and slightly better over the last 3 (105.0). MIN is ranked 11th on the season (114.1) but even better than OKC over the last 3 (99.7). There was an outlier in there with the Wolves playing one of those games against a GSW team with no Curry or Butler, but overall they are a good defensive team, and elite defensively at home on the the season overall (109.0 opponent ppg).

Both teams have also been scoring below average over their last three games, with MIN ranking #27 (103.7 ppg) and OKC ranking #23 (106.3 ppg). Of note, in OKC&#x27;s last game against the #28 defense (Pelicans), Thunder only scored 104.

MIN will also be playing the 2nd of a B2B so fatigue may limit their pace.

Lastly, both prior matchups were under this line, totaling 219 and 218.

**Write Up:** I’ve been waiting for this horse to pop up on debut and here he does on Thursday night at Paky, unfortunately it seems everyone else in the whole world has too, because the opening price of $2.40 is well and truly gone.     
      
This horse was absolutely strangled in its latest trial, and cruised past all of the horses in the heat bar EUROCANTO, a stakes winning 2yo. Now the even better part of this trial is that 2 of the other 4 horses were also in said trial, so on that basis we’ve easily got them covered. Both horses were under a lot more pressure and struggled to match motors with us. The other two horses also have raced each other and I’m not sure they showed enough there to be winning tonight.     
     
We’ve been a bit tardy away in both jump outs, however in a 5 horse field even if we’re last we won’t be too far away. Pak has been playing a little off-fence lately, so sweeping down the outside isn’t a disadvantage, and that’s exactly what we did in our trial.     
     
Edit: Adding on that the trainer was on radio this morning and said he’d be very disappointed if this horse didn’t win tonight. If the horse wants any chance of making the Blue Diamond field (one of 2 big 2yo races) in a couple weeks time he must be winning tonight.

**Write Up:** 

**Celtic VS Utrecht | 21:00 GMT +2**

* Celtic have won the 1st half in 9 of their last 10 games
* Utrecht have lost at halftime in 3/3 Europa League away games 

To understand the Scottish league, all you need to know is that since the 84/85 season only Rangers (18 times) &amp; Celtic (22 times) have won it. To further expand on this the last 13 of the last 14 league titles has gone to Celtic! So when they suddenly find themselves eight points of Hearths in 1st place and fail to qualify for the Champions League against a team close to the Chinese border, things aren’t great. When you then also as manager starts bitching about the management it’s just over.

So in comes Martin O’Neil as interim manager and he wins every league game and knocks bitter rivals Rangers out of the League Cup to make the finals.

Then they hire their new guy who is going to instill a new vision for the team and really change the way the club plays… They have decided on Wilfred Nancy, who is unproven in European football and what proves to be the most evident of all, he has no big club experience. 

His first game in charge is league leader Hearts and Celtic not only fails to make any ground on them, they lose 2-1 at home! He followed that up with 3-0 beating at home again against Roma and then lose 3-1 in the League Cup final against bottom of the table St. Mirren. At this point the crowd has turned properly on him. He somehow survives a couple more games until he loses 3-1 at home against bitter rivals Rangers and finally gets the sack.

So in comes Martin O’Neil for a second time and instantly beats Dundee United 4-0 at home, a club Nancy lost 2-1 against a couple weeks ago. Celtic failed once again to beat Hearts last weekend as they took the lead twice against them away, but a red card made things very hard and it ended 2-2. Celtic also drew 2-2 against Bologna last midweek in the Europa League, but that was a pretty good performance as they played for 60 minutes with a player less. 

Utrecht had an amazing last season that saw them finish 4th in Eredivisie, but they are currently 11th in the league and have only seen 1 win from their last 14 games across all comps. Their Europa League dreams are dead after only one point earned and three goals scored in seven games… Celtic on the other hand needs a win here to progress. 

O’Neil in his two periods in charge has seen 

* First periode in Charge 6/8 1st half wins
* Second Period in charge 5/5 1st half wins 

This should be an easy enough win for the host which the odds reflect and doing it by halftime as they usually do should also be very possible.

\++++

**Midtjylland vs Dinamo Zagreb | 21:00 GMT +2**

* No team has seen more goals in their EL games than Midjylland &amp; Dinamo Zagreb who both have seen 26 goals from seven games.

We are going with the over this time after the spectacular fail last time around when I was tempted to take the under 3 goals line and was met with a crazy 3-3 draw against Brann. 

Midtjylland&#x27;s chances of finishing top in the Europa League table is more or less gone now after last round&#x27;s result, but they still need to fight to secure a top 8 finish. Dinamo Zagreb with a massive win 4-1 over Romanian FCSB saw them more or less secure a spot in the top 24.

The host will still miss their top scorer for this game, which is unfortunate, but they showed against Brann that they do have other players that can contribute with goals. Dinamo are playing really well in the league at the moment after being a bit off the pace at the start of the season. 2-1 or 2-2 is my guess for this game.  </td></tr>

Nice are already out of the competition, however they get a great matchup here that just allows goals to anyone, Nice most recently beat GA Eagles 3-1, and have hit btts in 2/3 away games in the Europa League, failing to score only on Porto who are a very hard matchup. Nice should have enough chances here as the hosts will push for the win and Nice themselves also very rarely see clean sheets.</td></tr>

ASTON VILLA VS SALZBURG

Date: 29 JANUARY 2026 at 21:00

BET ON: BET ON: Both teams to score- Yes

Odd: 1.71



\- Despite Aston Villa’s plans to rotate heavily and rest key men in midfield, there are strong strategic reasons why both teams are likely to score. Manager Unai Emery has openly confirmed a midfield injury crisis, with Youri Tielemans out for around two months, John McGinn sidelined for six to eight weeks and Boubacar Kamara ruled out for the season — forcing Villa to adjust their core structure and bring in reinforcements like Douglas Luiz and Amadou Onana to compensate. Emery repeatedly stressed that the club wants to win this match to secure a top-two finish and home advantage deeper into the Europa League, and that every player must be ready to compete in a demanding fixture, showing how seriously Villa value goals and control of the game despite rotation.

\- On the other side, RB Salzburg enter this game in must-win territory if they want to keep their slim hopes of reaching the playoff places alive — a motivation that Austrian media and club insiders have emphasized as a driving force behind their approach. Salzburg sit outside the qualification spots and know a defeat could end their European journey, so there is inherent pressure on coach Thomas Letsch and his troops to play aggressively and create chances rather than sit deep. Salzburg showed attacking intent in their recent 3-1 win over Basel, with young attackers like Kerim Alajbegovic on form, and Austrian reports stress the belief in collective belief and willingness to go for goals here.

\- Tactically, this sets up a game where Villa may be slightly more open than usual due to forced midfield changes and rotation, while Salzburg are likely to attack from the front knowing that only goals keep them in European contention. Combine that with Salzburg’s tendency to concede more on the road in Europe and Villa’s historical tendency to score at home even when rotated, and both teams finding the net becomes a realistic and compelling outcome.</td></tr>

The Blues have the second worst goal difference in the league, and if you watched their first game in December it was a thrashing, the Blues won 6-2. I doubt that&#x27;ll happen again and will motivate Florida to leave a statement in St. Louis. Even if the Blues can make it to OT, they are 1-9 in OT. Not a good team. I&#x27;d <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> a player SOG prop but with all those injuries....I don&#x27;t know.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> also didn&#x27;t hit. PSG were the way better team but didn&#x27;t manage better than a draw. 

Europa League will cheer me up. I&#x27;ve found a few gems that I love. 

**Write Up:** 

Celtic are looking to secure their spot in the top 24 to continue in the Europa League. FC Utrecht are already eliminated from contention and will aim for a good result against Heerenveen instead. A game vs a direct rival for chasing european football next year. 

Celtic are 1-0-2 at home so far with losses against strong opponents AS Roma and SC Braga. Away they&#x27;ve won their game against Feyenoord, a team from the Netherlands who are a definite step up from FC Utrecht. 

FC Utrecht, as mentioned, won&#x27;t care about a good result as much as Celtic do. 

Going 0-0-3 away from home and 1-3-5 away in the league. Winning only once in 12 away games will not give them the confidence they&#x27;ll desperately need

Celtic went 1-0 up against Bologna in their last game, received a red card, went 2-0 up before being outmatched in the second half due to being down to 10 men. Ending the game 2-2 and missing out on important points. 

Those points will be secured <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> in convincing fashion. 

So far I&#x27;ve had 1x5U play and 2x4U plays. All have hit so far and I&#x27;m confident in keeping that 100% alive.

Tennis | Quimper Challenger | 9:50 AM EST (estimated)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Pavel Kotov vs Remy Bertola | Kotov ML at -154 (DK). 2 units. 

Write-up: Happy to get a win in the midst of some rough form. Neither match was quite as straightforward as I expected, but neither player actually faced a set point. 

Feels weird to go with this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, as I actually faded Kotov in the opening round of qualifying. That was his first match of the season, and I wasn&#x27;t particularly confident about his fitness coming in. He didn&#x27;t play great tennis in that match, but it was enough to win, and he has steadily raised his level since then. Do I think his movement looks great? Not really, but the courts here in Quimper are playing fast enough that his strong serve and overall talent pay dividends. In the last round, he closed at a really short price (around +130) against Mark Lajal, one of the better indoor CH players out there, and scored a three-set win. 

In comparison, Remy Bertola&#x27;s first-round win over Mannarino would have looked really nice...about three months ago. The 37-year-old Frenchman has experienced some severe backsliding to start the year, and the market has reflected that. Even still, Bertola closed as a significant underdog despite having a dominant indoor win on the record last year, when Adrian was actually playing solid ball. I believe a significant factor in this price was Bertola&#x27;s poor form to start the year, including a first-round ITF loss as a 1.1 favorite and winning just three games against Kukushkin in Glasgow. Speaking of Kukushkin, Bertola was around a 2.7 dog in that matchup as well, while Lajal played Kuku recently and was a 1.4 favorite. If you compare the odds, Kotov&#x27;s price in this one doesn&#x27;t make a ton of sense: the market seems to be valuing him higher than a player who closed as a much bigger favorite than this against Bertola. Keep in mind that all of the matches mentioned were played indoors.

On top of the odds seeming off, Kotov had a higher performance rating in the first round (7.34 vs 7.14). Bertola has a solid serve for his height and a creative game, but I think his one-handed backhand could cause issues here. Kotov has a solid career record against one-handers, including wins over Stan Wawrinka and Lorenzo Musetti; while Bertola can certainly generate some pace off that wing when he strikes the ball clean, Kotov&#x27;s reliable backhand stroke, which almost comes off as &quot;pushy&quot; at times, can be an effective counter. Overall, this is starting to feel like the right setup for a breakthrough run from Kotov, and I don&#x27;t see Bertola taking him down here. As a result, this is my first 2-unit play of the year.</td></tr>

Kairat scored at the last second to ruin the streak

Valur vs Grotta, over 5.5.goals @ 2.4

Valur are heavy favorites and usually play with high tempo, especially against weaker opposition. Their attacking depth and pressing style can quickly open the game and lead to multiple goals. Grótta tend to struggle defensively and often concede heavily when facing top teams. If Valur score early, this match could turn into a one-sided goal fest, making over 5.5 goals a high-risk but attractive option</td></tr>

**Diving into ML <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> and were looking at 2 sides that are oh so close to achieving automatic qualification (top 8) but the only thing standing in their way is an underperforming opponent at home. Only 3 points separate 4th from 18th and these sides are going to take full advantage of the final day being at home. Stuttgart are 2 points of Qual while Porto are just one spot off but a draw is not safe at all.**

**9.Porto VS 31.Rangers**

* Porto are currently unbeaten in their last 11 games with 10 W, 1D, 0L games
* Porto have won all 3 games at home in the Europa league this season.
* Porto have played 12 Home games this season and have a record of 11 W, 1D, 0L.
* Rangers have only won 1 game so far in the Europa league, drawing 1 and Losing 5.
* Rangers have lost all 3 Away games they&#x27;ve played in the Europa League so far.
* In each of these away games they conceded a minimum of 2 goals each
* Rangers are in good form in the Scottish league but its evident the European opponents are just a step up to them
* Rangers with 4 points are already disqualified from the competition and cannot proceed

\---

**13.Stuttgart VS 24.Young Boys**

* Stuttgart have won every home game in the Europa league this season with all their dropped points coming away from home. Simply a confident home side that gets a big boost from the crowd
* Stuttgart have played 13 home games in all comps this season and have a record of 10 W, 1D, 2L.
* Keep in mind that both their losses at home this season have come against Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich. Other than that they&#x27;ve only dropped points in 1 home game all season and it was a draw.
* Young Boys are currently on a 7 game losing streak.
* YB have played 3 away games in the EL this season losing 2 and winning 1 against 29th placed FCSB.

\---

**Expecting both sides to push for automatic qualification and nothing less than all 3 points tomorrow as even a win may not be enough, goal difference may have to come into play which is even better in our case**

**Nothing expected, everything appreciated!**

‎**Writeup** :

‎First off, Lyon are absolutely flying right now. They&#x27;re sitting pretty at the top of the whole Europa League table with a perfect record in most spots **18 points from 7 games**, best defense in the comp (only 3 goals let in total), and they&#x27;ve been on this mad winning run. Their last Europa League away was a clean 1-0 at Young Boys, and domestically they just slapped Metz 5-2. At home in Groupama? They&#x27;re beasts strong attack, Tolisso and Lacazette types banging them in, and that backline is rock solid. They want to lock in that top seed for the knockouts, no messing about. **They also have won 8 match in a row**

‎PAOK? Yeah, they&#x27;re buzzing too on a 7 game unbeaten streak or whatever, smashed Betis 2-0 recently, and they&#x27;ve got goals in them (15 scored already, second best). But look closer: their away form in Europe this season has been shaky. They&#x27;ve only got one win on the road from a few games, and when they face proper quality sides away, they leak. Facing the league leaders who concede almost nothing at home? Nah, that&#x27;s a tough ask. Greek sides can be brave, but Lyon at home in a must-win vibe for top spot is different gravy.

‎so much value this odds in the world.

‎Fingers crossed it lands easy tomorrow. Up the Lyon! 🍻

**Start Time:** 17:00 KST, \~8 hours from posting

**Writeup:**

DN SOOPers (1-3) are lacking in firepower. All of their players are just about outside of their primes and they are simply regressing. This roster five years ago would&#x27;ve been legit, but the next generation are already making waves and these old fellas aren&#x27;t cutting it. They&#x27;re second last in their group and only marginally better than HANJIN BRION who have ZERO match wins.

BNK FearX (2-2). What more can I say about this team that hasn&#x27;t been covered in previous POTDs. I&#x27;m loving how this team is right now and their playstyle. They can play slow, turn up the pace, and challenge the top teams all in one. They&#x27;re playing great League of Legends.

Coming into this match, I fully expect FearX to take Map 1, and it&#x27;ll just come down to the manner in which they execute. Just like most games, FearX will most likely make early game plays botside to give their star player Diable a lead. If they can end the first 10-15 minutes of the game ahead, DNS will have a tough time breaking through the line to destroy towers.

In order for the tower handicap to win, FearX must destroy six MORE towers than DNS. In all losses, DNS average -7.14 tower difference, meaning they destroy seven LESS towers on losses. In all wins, FearX average +5.4 tower difference, meaning they destroy five MORE towers on wins. FearX&#x27;s schedule has been really rough and a lot of their wins are from behind so this number should be higher based on their ability.

In losing efforts, DNS aren&#x27;t staying in the game and taking these towers which speaks to their lack of ability to claw back deficits. On the other hand, FearX likes to take the game slow from winning positions, which includes slowly breaking down the map and taking towers. If FearX gets ahead, I suspect they&#x27;ll smash the over easily. If it&#x27;s close, I expect FearX to play it slower and still comfortably hit the over. And if they&#x27;re behind, I&#x27;m not convinced in DNS&#x27; ability to get snowball a lead so they won&#x27;t destroy too many towers before FearX fights back. BOL!

**Start Time:** 9:00 PM ET (FS1)

**Odds:** -108 (DraftKings)

**Units:** 1.5U

**Reasoning:** No hurdle has proven to be too tall for this year’s Illinois squad. 

Lost senior guard Kylan Boswell to a broken hand? Junior Andrej Stojakovic responded with a career-high 30 points in a commanding 89-70 victory over Maryland. Down 11 to then-No. 4 Purdue—which started 14-of-18 (77.8%) from the field—on the road? Freshman Keaton Wagler took the reins, pouring in an eye-popping 46 points on 13-of-17 shooting to help pull off the 88-82 upset. Now, off the high of that victory, and with a Sunday road trip to No. 5 Nebraska looming, surely this has all the makings of a letdown spot?

Meh. Trap game, smap game. 

The Fighting Illini (17-3) might very well be the best offense in the country right now, ranking 1st in offensive efficiency (1.247), 25th in scoring (85.5 PPG), 65th in field-goal percentage (47.1%) and 68th in three-point shooting (36.0%). The team leads the nation in adjusted offensive efficiency (130.5), owning what currently stands as the highest offensive rating in the history of the kenPom era (since 1996-97). Furthermore, Illinois seems to feed off the energy of the home fans, averaging 90.3 points on 49.1% shooting while boasting a +24.1 scoring margin in 11 home contests. That’s very concerning for a middle-of-the-pack Washington defense that enters ranked 80th in opponent three-point shooting (31.7%), 108th in defensive efficiency (1.020), 118th in opponent field-goal percentage (43.3%), 140th in scoring defense (73.3 PPGA). 

Unfortunately for the Huskies (11-9), they lack the kind of offensive firepower to keep up. 

Through 20 games, the team ranks 97th in scoring (79.0 PPG), 101st offensive efficiency (1.100), 162nd in field-goal percentage (44.9%) and 288th in three-point shooting (31.4%). Although the Illini don’t boast elite numbers defensively—25th in opponent field-goal percentage (40.4%), 41st in scoring defense (68.3 PPGA), 68th in defensive efficiency (0.997) and 77th in opponent three-point shooting (31.6%)—the team does step it up against sub-par offensive units. In nine contests against opponents that rank outside the Top 100 in offensive efficiency, Illinois has conceded just 63.1 points on a porous 37.3% shooting from the field (29.6% from beyond the arc). That includes allowing just one opponent to top 40% shooting and holding all but three to 65 points or less. 

But if the Illini want to cover the double-digit spread, it’s imperative that they continue their dominance on the glass.

On the year, Illinois ranks 7th in offensive rebounding (12.2 per game), 11th in total rebounding (41.6) and 17th in defensive rebounding (26.4). That includes holding a double-digit rebounding edge in each their last three games. However, if there’s one downside, it’s the team’s tendency to cough up second-chance opportunities to opponents, ranking just 194th in opponent offensive rebounding (9.2). This is an area Washington will look to pounce, as the team ranks 44th in offensive rebounding (11.0), 49th in total rebounding (38.3) and 65th in defensive rebounding (24.3). Limiting the team’s impact on the glass will be critical for the Illini. 

All things considered, look for Illinois to put it together on both ends of the floor for a convincing victory.

Write Up:

The stakes here are massive. Both rosters are desperate to reach the Grand Finals because neither team has qualified for a major event yet, and losing here means waiting months for the next opportunity. Nobody is rolling over or calling GG early with their season on the line.

If you look at the rosters, this is basically a SEA All-Star match. On one side, you have the PlayTime veterans (Gabbi, Armel, Kuku, DJ, Akashi). On the other side, Nemesis is absolutely stacked with firepower (23savage, Mac, Jabz, Q, Jaunuel). When you have this much talent and this much desperation on the server, sweeps are rare. Nemesis has the raw carry potential with 23savage to take over a game, but PlayTime’s shot-calling usually drags matches into the late game where things get messy.

Both teams are prone to clown fiestas and throwing leads. I expect them to trade games, with the veterans stealing one and the young guns taking another, forcing a decisive Game 3.

BOL.

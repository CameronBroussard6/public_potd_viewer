Overall: 2-0

Last Pick: Below average performance from van Gerwen, but he got the job done in a 6-2 win against an abysmal display from Rock. ✅

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Gerwyn Price ML vs Johnny Clayton @ 1,62

We have another Thursday and with that another Premier League Night.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> I am going to back &quot;The Iceman&quot; against &quot;The Ferret&quot;. Gerwyn Price&#x27;s performance has been really impressive in 2026, he was the winner on Night 2 last week, including a 6-5 win against Johhny Clayton in the semifinals. 

And as if confident and well playing Price wasn&#x27;t already a very difficult beast to beat, when you look at their last 20 H2H matches, Price leads an impressive 16-4, and he is currently on a 10-match win streak against Clayton. 

I do think Clayton is competitive against many players in the Premier League, but Price is statistically a better 
player (Averages 98,34 vs 96,51 and Checkout Percentage 43,2 vs 42,44 in the last 12 months), and he has been a nightmarish matchup for Clayton for the past 3 years, so unless Price has an off day, this one should also go his way.

**Write up:** Going with a bit of a boom horse here <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> in TRAPPER JOHN. On debut this horse was backed off the map from about $6.50 down to $3 fave right before the race jumped, and produced a massive turn of foot to come from last and get right over the top of them all. The sectionals this horse closed in was ludicrous and the market definitely knew what was going on with this horse to confidently back it in so late.      
       
We’re again racing over the 1000m, and with a predicted hot tempo with 3/4 leaders engaged, I envision a pretty similar picture to last start, with us smoking the pipe out back, before exploding down the middle of the spacious Pakenham circuit.       
       
The form out of our debut race is also on fire. The horse we beat in HEADBANGER came out and won by 8 lengths, and the 3rd horse BEL MEYZAAN won by 2.75 lengths sitting last and 3 wide. Simply put, this just adds more merit to our already great performance.      
       
I would’ve loved getting up to the 1200m here, however the expected pace of the race is what draws me to this as a good bet. I think if we can just angle of the inside at some stage and build our revs we should be right. GL!</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: __Devin Booker 25+ Points @1.76 (Bet365) 1U__

NBA | Suns v Spurs | 🏀  

We’re back as the all star break now is over, let’s carry the momentum going forward.

Lines have been up for quite a while now so lines are heavily bumped, still like this alt spot for Booker here for a playable price.

Booker gets a nice matchup here against the Spurs with Dillon Brooks being suspended for this one, meaning a big usage boost for Booker.

Over in 5/6 without Brooks this season avg 32 PPG with the sole miss being against the Clippers where he dropped 24 but only had 1 FTA, expecting him to be more aggressive and get to the line way more than that. He’s avg 22.7 FGA per game without Brooks compared to 18.2 on the season.

1/2 vs Spurs this season, 24 points with Brooks playing and 28 without him playing..

Spurs are allowing MOST midrange points in the league where he gets 24% of his buckets from, they’re also allowing most pull-ups in the league where Booker does work aswell.

Booker will have a big role and spike in both usage and FGA as he’s their primary scoring option, especially in this one &amp; I don’t mind backing someone like Booker in such a spot.

Don’t mind 25.5 if this line isn’t playable price for you, still really like this spot.</td></tr>

Both sides very vulnerable in defence. Although the two sides played out a 0-0 draw in the league phase, things were pretty different back then with Bologna at home and with a red card. Bologna have one clean sheet in Europa league away games and it was vs Maccabi who were out already + weak. Brann at home have been good btts wise, with notable btts hits vs Bodo, Viking, Midtjylland. Bologna have struggled for clean sheets in the league as well, with 2 clean sheets, 9 btts hits in 13 away games. If we exclude the Fenerbahce game with a very early red card for Brann, they have scored in last 11 official home games at home.</td></tr>

**Odds:** **+154**

**Write Up:** Nice one, Slessor sees the match out at 5-6 in favour of Zhao. AC draw out the game thanks to a second half goal. Nice little cash for you guys, lets keep the ball rolling now. Have a great day folks!

First and foremost we go to the WTA Dubai where Pegula (ranked 5th) and Tauson (ranked 15th) are facing off. This is their first matchup, so no previous head-to-head data to work from. Based off **singles outdoor hard** information we can see this: Tauson owns a 7-3 record in her last 10 since 19th Jan, going 3-2 in the last 5, with wins in the last 3 - Pegula comes into this fixture going 8-2, 4-1 in the last 5. Many of Pegula&#x27;s most recent wins are coming from players under ranking 20 (3 of the last 5 she has beaten were ranks 60, 20, 17 and 6) all in straight sets, losing to rank 3 Rybakina. Tauson has not faced a player in the last 5 games under the rank 30. Now, this information itself is not indicative of future results, based off recent opponents, ranking and form I see Pegula winning this one, maybe not in straight sets like most her wins as I think Tauson keeps it close but she can see it out.

Rugby League World Club Challenge is for leg two. Since the start of 2025 Hull own a home record of 13-2, Brisbane have an away record of 8-6. It must be said that Brisbane do look to be favourites with good reason, but they have not played a game this year yet. Hull have played two, both away with a 104-0 win at Lock Lane and 19-18 shock loss at York. Brisbane&#x27;s forwards tend to win the collisions, gaining more ground after contact - with this also comes an advantage in territory pressure and scoreboard results. Hull tend to struggle against strong rotation in the middle and ruck speed is an issue - BUT I do think the extra games, the home advantage, the travelling team coming from Australia to the UK (different environment, weather, grounds etc.) can force the game to be close even with the Broncos being strong favourites. I think they can keep it within +12.5, feel free to buy down to +14.5 or +16.5 if that makes you more comfortable.

Last Pick: Zhizhen Zhang +3.5 games vs Jakub Mensik (-120, 1 unit): Loss

Tennis | ATP Doha | 12:40 PM EST (estimated) (estimated)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Jannik Sinner vs Jakub Mensik | Mensik +5.5 games at -105. 1 unit. 

Write-up: I have to admit that I was totally wrong there. Zhang didn&#x27;t necessarily play badly, but Mensik was excellent. I don&#x27;t think too many people tailed though, because my post didn&#x27;t appear until a few hours before the match due to automod issues. I&#x27;m always willing to admit when I had the wrong read on a player&#x27;s form, and I&#x27;m actually backing Mensik <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. 

Interesting match between Sinner and Mensik here, as it&#x27;s actually only the second time Sinner or Alcaraz has met one of the three players in the younger generation (Fonseca, Mensik, and Tien), with the first one being Sinner&#x27;s 6-2, 6-2 win over Tien in last year&#x27;s Beijing final. However, Mensik has already shown that he&#x27;s not afraid of the titans of the game, having beaten Novak Djokovic in last year&#x27;s Miami final and taken a set off him the year before. A lot of comparisons have been drawn between Mensik and Alexander Zverev, who is widely regarded as the best player to never win a Grand Slam - they both have strong, high-percentage first serves, questionable second serves (Zverev has improved on this quite a bit), elite backhands, and powerful, but error-prone forehands. Indeed, Zverev has generally played tight sets against Sinner if you ignore one drubbing at last year&#x27;s Paris Masters. However, one distinguishing factor I see between Mensik and Zverev is mentality. Even at 20 years old, Mensik seems to be willing to be aggressive on big points, to have the composure to truly take down his idols and not just come within a few points. He also tends to stay focused even when he&#x27;s down in a set, so I would trust him not to start throwing away service games even if Sinner secures an early break. 

The serve is Mensik&#x27;s biggest weapon, and he showed it in his first two matches here (8.3 and 8.4 serve ratings). In comparison, Sinner maybe hasn&#x27;t been as dialed in on return as usual (7.5, 7.6), and failed to cover this spread in R2 against an out-of-form Alexei Popyrin. The conditions here in Doha are often viewed as quite slow, but I would say that the courts themselves are actually medium-speed. The variable desert winds and low humidity are the real X-factors that can make life tough for big hitters, but conditions have been quite mild so far, and that should continue tomorrow with highs of around 26 degrees celsius, 7 mph wind, and 30% humidity expected tomorrow. Mensik already played on this center court in the first round, and the crowd is honestly pretty nonexistent, so I don&#x27;t expect him to have any trouble adjusting to the moment. I don&#x27;t expect him to break Sinner&#x27;s serve, but Sinner&#x27;s forehand hasn&#x27;t been quite the weapon we&#x27;ve seen in the past this year, and I expect Jannik to be tinkering with his game a bit in lower-tier events like this one. I&#x27;m not concerned about whether Mensik can hold up on the backhand wing, but the only question mark is whether his forehand breaks down. Honestly, though, all aspects of his game have been firing this year, and he&#x27;s already won a title and made the second week of the Australian Open. My only concerns about him in the second round were physical due to his injury layoff, but those are mostly gone now after seeing how he performed. I think this spread is a bit wide, and I expect him to cover it.

**Event:** UEFA Conference League, Drita v NK Celje, 3:00 pm EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Drita +0.5 Asian Handicap, +100, 5 units

**Write Up:** Been a while since we&#x27;ve done a more obscure matchup, but I&#x27;m loving the look of these odds. Celje were without a doubt the greatest underdog story last season, reaching the quarter finals of the Conference League and only narrowly losing to Fiorentina on aggregate in what was their first ever European appearance. In the process, their midfielder, Seslar, set the record for the most assists in the competition&#x27;s history. Super impressive stuff. A lot of that success has to be credited to their manager, **Albert Riera, who is now no longer at the club,** having recently taken over Frankfurt midseason. This is going to be a **huge blow for Celje,** who have already dropped some points in the league immediately after his departure.

Not only that, but they&#x27;ve **sold their best striker,** Kovacevic, to Ferencvaros. For those unaware, Kovacevic was at one point **the most in-form striker in Europe,** bagging goals for fun. For a short period of time, he even had more than Kane and Haaland *(granted, he played in a weaker league, but it&#x27;s still nothing to scoff at).* They absolutely haven&#x27;t found the replacement for him yet.

I think the odds just haven&#x27;t updated yet and don&#x27;t reflect the sheer drop in quality that Celje now possess after losing one of the most talented managers in Europe rn, as well as their main attacking output. *Drita are still a slight underdog,* but these odds for what is essentially a DC are too good to pass up on. They&#x27;re very **defensively sound,** and neither team is going to push too hard in the first leg. **Celje are playing away from home,** so their main goal is coming out of this game undefeated. Everything is going my way atm so I&#x27;m going in with 5 whole units. Feeling a low scoring affair here, so Under 3.5 goals sounds good if you want to ramp the odds up even further, but I&#x27;d just stick to the outlined <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> personally. BOL and let&#x27;s enjoy an exotic football matchup ☘️🫡</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>**Record:** 0-0

**League/Event:** NBA – Detroit Pistons @ NY Knicks (4:30pm PST)

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Mitchell Robinson 7+ rebounds (-164 on DK)

**Wager:** 5 units 🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀

Here we have a chance to buy low on this line, likely due to Robinson’s below-average rebounding (6) in his most recent game and way below average (3) in the prior game vs. Detroit. It seems reasonable as Detroit is a top rebounding team that ranks #5 in fewest RPG allowed to opponents.

However, Detroit will be without their first and second center, Duren and Stewart, due to suspension, moving Paul Reed to starting center position. Robinson, coming off the bench, will therefore be matched up against either 4th-string center (Tolu Smith) or a small-ball lineup with no true center. Either case should prove a favorable matchup for Robinson.

Better still is homecourt advantage, where Robinson’s rebounding average is much higher (9.7 home vs. 8.5 away).

And in 22 home games this season, **he is over this line in 20/22**. In both of the two misses, Robinson was in the starting lineup, which brings down his rebounding numbers. In <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>’s game, he will be in his natural role coming off the bench, backing up KAT instead of playing alongside him. When coming off the bench in home games this season, **he is over this line in 14/14.**

The odds aren’t all that juicy but the line is well-supported this season in this spot.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Sweden vs Switzerland 8:40am EST (Olympics/Women&#x27;s Hockey)  

Under 4.5 goals (+105) 

Went from +135 yesterday to now +105 <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. I watched both women&#x27;s semi-finals and boy oh boy was that painful to watch. Plenty of broken passes, low danger shots and messy plays that resulted in no real offensive chances. Felt like I was watching AAA junior hockey. Switzerland had **8 shots** against Canada(I know Canada is on another level). They literally could not generate any offense except on their lone goal. They scored by the way only 1 goal in every game since the start of the quarterfinals so their offense is not good at all. What they do have however is great goaltending in Andrea Braendli. She kept Canada to 2 goals only with 44 saves. She did the same against Finland the game before with a shut-out with 40 saves. So I expect her to be solid in a game for a medal. Meanwhile for Sweden, they put up a good fight vs USA with 23 shots but team USA is simply the best women&#x27;s team in the world right now. What I&#x27;m looking at though is the Swedish goaltender. Before the USA game, Sweden had only allowed 2 goals **in the whole tournament**. Their young goaltender is playing solid and honestly even during the USA game she did the best she could with some big saves but team USA is just too good right now. With the game being this important I expect a low score again tomorrow and their goalies to be solid for the chance to win a medal. Last 3 games for Switzerland went under the 4.5 goals line. For Sweden, before the USA game, their last 3 games were also under the 4.5 goals line. In other words, BASED ON THOSE PAST GAMES AND NOT MY HOCKEY EXPERT ANALYSIS, I feel like with the bronze medal on the line they both will be playing great defensive games like they both did for the whole tournament which worked really well for them until they met the powerhouse that are Canada and USA.

Vikingur Reykjavik vs KR Reykjavik, Over 4.5 goals @ 2.71 (2u)

At 2.71, I really like the value on over 4.5 goals here. Vikingur at home don’t change their style, they attack, press high, and create chances in numbers. Against a team like Reykjavik that usually leads to an open game. Vikingur are deadly when there’s space and can easily score two or three themselves. If this turns into a back-and-forth battle, five goals is very live at this price.</td></tr>

We’ve been absolutely cooking this DreamLeague with a 23-8 run. Huge thanks to everyone tailing the heat.

PARIVISION has been a revelation this tournament. With Puppey’s veteran coaching and their new offlaner, they are sitting pretty at 7-1 at the group stage. Meanwhile, Yandex has been a disaster, struggling at 1-7. They just dropped a map to a Tier 2 Chinese stack and practically have one foot out the door. Mathematically, Yandex needs to win 4 maps in a row just for a *chance* at tiebreakers. The motivation gap here is a canyon. PARI is playing for top seed, while Yandex looks like they’re already checking out of their hotel and some possible EPT points xd. This is as close to a &quot;lock&quot; as you get in Tier 1 Dota.

The gap between Tundra and Execration is just too wide. Tundra is a legitimate contender for the Grand Finals and has looked clinical in their macro play. Execration, on the other hand, has been the group’s punching bag, losing every single map except for their series against the bottom-tier NA squad. I believe both these matches have over an 80% chance to hit. BOL

Update; Many people asking why taking such low odfs of double chance and not take Pari ML. This is a Bo2 dota 2 game and in bo 2 games “draw”’ is a very likely outcome. Pari ML is 2.25 makes the parlay too risky for a 5 unit bet. Pari DC is simply a “ lock in” bet.</td></tr>

Four matches played this World Cup at Chennai and in only one match less than 320 runs were scored.

Four t20 internationals were played before this and all of them went above 320.

Team winning the toss will bowl first. My only fear is Afghanistan winning the toss, bowling first and getting Canada out early.

If you want better odds, you can go for over 329.5 @ 1.85.
I’m being cautious because I want a win in my record.</td></tr>

TeamReddit is projecting a 62% win chance here which creates value here on the ML.</td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>

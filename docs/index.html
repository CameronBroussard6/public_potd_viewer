**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Elliot Anderson 1+ SOT (+110), 1 unit to win 1.1 units

**Write Up:** Hello again friends! We&#x27;re back after a few days break with some world cup qualifier action where we&#x27;re into the last two games of the group stage. In case you can&#x27;t tell by now, I love SOT plays. They&#x27;re quite fun to root for while watching a match. Our first two plays both hit within the first 3 minutes of their respective games, great start to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>! I was waffling here between this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> and England 3+ goals, but landed here because this one could be a slog. England have qualified for the world cup, so this is technically a meaningless game for them. But England boss Thomas Tuchel wants his side to continue to gel and build momentum. He also loves himself some Elliot Anderson. Anderson has played nearly every minute for England since his first cap with the senior squad in September. Anderson also fits the mold for my favorite kind of player to back, scrappy hard working midfielders who like to take long shots. We&#x27;re getting good odds here because Anderson has only recorded a SOT for England in 1 of 4 matches. But in his last match against Latvia, he took 5 shots. While none of those found the target, the uptick in shot attempts are promising as his confidence builds and he cements himself in England&#x27;s midfield. 

Now to Serbia. They currently sit 3rd in the group, 1 point behind Albania. Serbia needs a point here to stay alive in qualifiers. I expect them to park the bus and invite shots from a distance, as they won&#x27;t win a high goal shootout with England. This is Anderson&#x27;s shooting range and I fully expect him to find the target here, if not the back of the net. 

BOL!</td></tr>

Event: Soccer/Football, [World Cup QUALS] Moldova Vs Italy


<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Moldova over 1.5 corners @ 1.72 - 3 Units


Both sides arguably with not much at stake here as Italy have a slim to none chance of overtaking Norway, whereas Moldova cannot advance anymore. Moldova at home though to get just 2 corners, when they got 6 in the reverse matchup seems great, so far with 6 games played Moldova covered this in all but 1 game away vs Norway. At home, Moldova got 6 vs Norway. Moldova have also previously gotten at least 2 vs Romania in a friendly very recently and vs Poland. Italy have given up 2 or more corners in 5/6 games during the group stage. Simply expect the home side to show a respectable performance and get at least 2 corners here.</td></tr>

Event: NFL | Jets @ Patriots ( Divisional Matchup )


<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Hunter Henry Over 33.5 Rec Yards @1.83 2u to win 1.66u


Write Up:  


Hunter Henry will see an increased role in the Patriots passing offense because Kayshon Boutte (hamstring) will not playing and Austin Hooper (concussion) are on limited minuts vs the Jets . Maye has been leaning on short and middle reads, especially to his TE which Henry already averages about 3.8 receptions and 44.9 yards per game with him.


Austin Hooper’s absence removes the team’s TE2 and a reliable underneath target. That means Henry should get nearly all tight end snaps.


Kayshon Boutte missing will hurt their WR core, so the Patriots may funnel more targets toward Henry . Also The Jets this season allow tight ends to average about 42.6 receiving yards per game when being targeted. </td></tr>

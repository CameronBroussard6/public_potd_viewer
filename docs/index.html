POTD Record: 2-2 | Last Five, New —&gt; Old: WLWL-

Net Units: +-0

Last Pick: ✅ Los Angeles Chargers -3.5 (-110) – 2 units

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s Matchup: Tampa Bay Buccaneers (5-2) @ New Orleans Saints (1-6). 4:05pm ET. 

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: Tampa Bay Buccaneers –3.5 (–110) — 2 units**

Here’s Why:

- The Buccaneers (5–2) come as the superior team and will certainly bounce back from a humbling road loss against the NFC North powerhouse Lions. According to game previews, this is a key bounce-back spot before their bye week.  

- The New Orleans Saints are very much in “rebuild mode” at 1–6, with  Spencer Rattler holding a career record of 1-12 as a starter. ONE win. TWELVE losses. 
  
- While the Saints have earned some praise for being “competitive” this season, the reality is their foundation is shaky—offensive line issues, young QB, limited depth—which suggests they’ll struggle to cover these seemingly generous spreads.

- Head-to-head history also leans the Bucs’ way: Tampa has won five of the last six meetings, showing they match up well.
————————————

FINAL THOUGHTS: -3.5 feels like free money. -4.5 feels very generous. I think the Saints get routed, have a fire sale before the trade deadline to dump the older guys, and go maximum rebuild. 

BOL!

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>** Bijan Robinson 70+ yards rushing (-320) + ATTD (-225) [-135] 3u

The Dolphins defense is absolutely atrocious vs the run, allowing the most rushing yards to running backs per game at 128.29 YPG.

That’s bad news for them going up against possibly the best running back in the NFL, Bijan Robinson.

He had cleared 70+ yards on the ground 4 straight before last week. His lone misses have been against good run defenses (49ers last week 85.71 YPG allowed and Bucs week 1 78.43 YPG allowed). The dolphins are a far cry from that, allowing about 50 more yards per game. Bijan should run wild on them and hit 70 at least. Quinshon Judkins just scored 3 TDs vs the Dolphins last week. Robinson has scored in 4/6 games this season and should get at least one against this abysmal defense. The falcons are favored, so the game script should be favorable for getting carries, yards, and TD opportunities.

Michael Penix Jr is unlikely to play, so Kirk Cousins will start. Teams generally rely more on their bell cow RBs when the starting QB is out, so it may help the bet a bit, but probably won’t impact it too much. Either way, I think Bijan will have a field day against this awful run defense.</td></tr>

CIN Bengals -6.5 vs NY Jets @ -105 at 4u

Writeup:

Bengals offense looked good last week with Flacco under center. WR Chase and Higgins are getting fed and won’t be facing Jets’ Sauce Gardner due to injury. 

Fields is coming off of a terrible performance last week, so it’s hard to see how he’ll be a big playmaker even against a Bengals D that allows a lot of points. 

Jets are also down Garrett Wilson, their top receiver. TE Mason Taylor is “likely to play”, but is dealing with a quad injury. 

Plus Bengals have home team advantage. I honestly think this spread should be set at -9.5. Gonna place some ladder bets all the way up to that.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Over 2.5 Goals @ 1.67 (Betano) – 1.0 Unit 

Write Up:
This is one of those Eredivisie fixtures that just screams tempo. Twente at home have been consistent going forward all season — they average around 1.75 expected goals per match and play with width, fast overlaps, and a front line that moves the ball quickly through the half-spaces. They’ve scored in every home game so far.

Ajax are still what they’ve been all year: chaotic, entertaining, and fragile at the back. Their matches average 3.6 total goals, and they’ve hit Over 2.5 in 8 of their last 10. Defensively they remain inconsistent — their back four has changed multiple times in recent weeks.

Twente also like to push numbers forward early, which fits perfectly against Ajax’s high line. Both sides rank top-4 in xG per 90 in the Eredivisie, and neither keeps many clean sheets.

I’d price this total closer to 1.60, so with 1.67 still available it’s enough for me to get involved. Two teams that can’t help but go forward — should be a fun one to watch.</td></tr>

NBA: Celtics v Pistons, 0610 AEDT

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: 1U Payton Pritchard O1.5 free throws made (FTM) @ $1.83, (-120 American odds), B365 

Write Up: Pritchard lines have intrigued me this season as a starter spot has opened up for him, after being a reliable 6th man. Holiday, Porzingis &amp; Tatum are gone. So I have been looking for value on his lines, and think I’ve got one in a niche market. Now, this is not free throws attempted (FTA), but FTM - both markets lines are 1.5, just the odds of FTA are $1.57, a lot less than the $1.83 for the FTM, and he is a career 85% FT shooter. 26 cents on the dollar for that level of accuracy just shouts value to me - we’re going to have a higher chance of long-term profit by betting the FTM market. He’s currently in good FT shooting form, shooting 16/17 this season including pre-season, and covering this line in 4 of the 5 games. 

The other factor that made me look here is the Pistons FT conceded. After giving up 32 to the Bulls, they went one better &amp; gave up 48 to the Rockets!! 48! Only 2 out of 14 players across those 2 games with 10+ shots (in Pritchard territory of ball handling &amp; shooting) have not shot 2+ FT. Between Cunningham, Duren, Holland, Thompson, Stewart, Robinson - they have a half dozen players who can put the Celtics in the bonus early in quarters, can swipe on an arm when in the paint, and they’re all in-your-face defenders so we’re a chance again at playing the hand tap rule on 3 point opportunities. 

The other side of this bet is that it only takes 1 miss for him on 1 set of FT’s without returning to the line, and he still retains his career average due to a much larger sample size (volatility always an issue with these sorts of markets). He’s not as an aggressive a player as a Brown or White can be, so that may also hurt his chances as they could draw the fouls.</td></tr>

Tennessee Titans @ Indianapolis Colts  
4:25 pm EST - 26 October 2025  
—  
Leading off the late-afternoon window — the upstart Indianapolis Colts hosting the lousy Tennessee Titans. This might be my favorite total on the board. I think this game has sneaky Cam Ward potential written all over it. I like the over.

The Colts are a machine right now. You feel like they’re good for thirty points every week. The total’s 46.5, and I really like it. What would it take to cash it? A 31–17 final? That’s right in line with the 14.5-point spread — and I’m not laying two touchdowns in the NFL.

Could the Colts hang forty if they’re locked in? If Cam Ward tosses a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>-six? Yeah, it’s all sitting there for you. Jonathan Taylor’s good for a thirty-yard house call at any moment.

And Tennessee? They were grotesque last week against the Raiders. But a nothing-to-lose attitude can cut both ways — you might get points by risk or by blunder. Any time the Titans are in the mix, there’s a chance you end up wearing the poop-emoji sticker on your forehead.

Could it be 31–3 Colts and you’re sitting there going, “How the hell did we do that?” Absolutely. But I still like it. I wouldn’t take it north of 47 — but give me the over 46.5 on the total.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Todays Pick</mark>:** Leverkusen - Freiburg **Over 2.5 Goals**


**Odds:** $1.80


**Wager:** 1 unit 


**When:** 6 hours from post


**Why:**


Leverkusen vs Freiburg has the vibe that there should be plenty of goals. Leverkusen score with ease right now, but they play like defense is optional, and to be fair, thats probably true, as they win games by outscoring their opponents. Freiburg aren’t exactly parking the bus either tho they usually find a way to grab a goal, or a couple, even if they end up losing. Between Leverkusen’s attack flying and Freiburg’s tendency to get involved in end to end games, it’s hard to picture this one being a snooze fest. Feels like one of those matches where you blink and it’s already 2-1.


Backing that up, both teams have been consistent in games where goals flow freely, both teams have scored in 9 of Leverkusen’s last 10 Bundesliga matches, and in 13 of Freiburg’s last 16. That’s a strong indicator of open football and plenty of chances at both ends. Even though Leverkusen have won four of their last five, they’re not keeping many clean sheets on the way, they just tend to outscore whoever’s in front of them. When you put those stats together, the Over 2.5 <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> feels like the obvious. It’s not just a hunch, the numbers fully support it.</td></tr>

On the home side we got Cercle Brugge. At the moment, they&#x27;re in the relegation zone. They got 11 points after 11 matches, which is not great. But they have been scoring. They scored in their last 7/8 matches, with a total of 15 goals.

▫️ LAST PICK: Bruno Guimaraes saves our money and gives us a push. Not the desired result but better than a loss. Love my Asian Handicaps but sometimes pushes happen. 

▫️ Thoughts: Arsenal racked up a nice 4-0 win against Atletico Madrid at home. Gyokeres played great and found not only one but two goals, his first scored in quite sometime. Hopefully this will build his confidence. Arsenal has been playing great at home too with their worst result so far being a 1-1 against Man City. They got 5 goals against Leeds and 3 against Forest. They&#x27;re also averaging 1.9 goals a game on average. Palace may have looked a bit relaxed in the conference league and they somehow managed to lose 0-1 against a Cypriot team at home (no hate on Cyprus) but in the Prem they&#x27;ve been pretty good. They&#x27;re averaging 1.5 goals a game and have racked up 2 goals in many of their games. Arsenal and Crystal Palace are both london based teams, and they really show it when they play against one another. Arsenal last 4 games at home against Palace has resulted in this line being covered every time, and two of those results where 2-2 draws including the last game played in April of this year. Mateta has been on fire so far this season, and I feel that Eze will want to turn up big time against his former team.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Bijan Robinson 90+ rushing yards (Bet365 1.83 odds)

Coming into this week with a loss against the 49ers last week, Atlanta is playing at home again facing the Miami Dolphins. Bijan is going up against the worse rushing defense team in the NFL the Miami Dolphins. The Dolphins have allowed the 3rd most rush attempted to RB and have given up the most rushing yards to RB this season. Miami defense allowed 5.2 yards per rush attempt which results an average of 159.3 rushing yards per game to their opponent, dead last in the NFL. With a weak run defense like this Bijan will definitely feast against them, especially coming off a loss with only 40 rushing yards against the 49ers.

Next <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **Cole Anthony Under 11.5 Points** (-108 on Fanduel) Bet 1.5u to Win 1.39u

Cole Anthony was on a heater logging 23 points off the bench Friday against the Raps, but my analysis reveals a critical pattern that strongly favors the under here.

Throughout last season Anthony’s next game following 20+ point outings saw a significant scoring decline. **Out of his major 20+ point performances last season, Anthony averaged just 13.5 PPG the following night, indicating a clear regression pattern.** This trend suggests we could expect a sharp drop off from his 23 point explosion. He is on a new team this season but within a similar role.

The Cavs ranked 8th in defensive rating last season, currently 7th this early season. When Anthony is on the court he’s likely to be guarded by Lonzo, in which he’s decent with defensive guard assignments.

If Kyle Kuzma is ruled out with an ankle injury, Anthony could see increased bench minutes. However even with extended playing time the Cavs perimeter defense should suppress his efficiency on top of my main thesis of his regression after a big night.

If tailing, only risk what you can afford to lose! Best of luck family!

Evento: (NFL) Bengals vs Jets (11:00am CST)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Bengals -6 (-115) Playdoit (20% BANK)

Analisis: The matchup between the Bengals and the Jets clearly favors Cincinnati to cover the -6 handicap. The Jets come into this game in a critical situation, winless on the season and missing several key players that heavily impact their performance. Their top wide receiver Garrett Wilson and star cornerback Sauce Gardner are both out, leaving the team without its main offensive weapon and best defensive player in coverage. Quarterback Justin Fields returns as the starter, but his performances have been inconsistent, marked by turnovers, sacks, and difficulty sustaining drives. Without his WR1 and behind a struggling offensive line, the Jets’ offense is very likely to stall again.

On the Bengals’ side, even though Joe Burrow remains out, the team reacted quickly by signing veteran quarterback Joe Flacco, who brings experience, defensive reading, and clock management. His presence stabilizes the offense and reduces the kind of mistakes that cost Cincinnati close games earlier in the season. The Bengals’ defense has also shown improvement, generating consistent pressure and establishing a more balanced attack with their running game, allowing them to control tempo and wear down opposing defenses.

Playing at home further strengthens Cincinnati’s edge. The Bengals have been significantly more efficient at home, and against a limited opponent like the Jets, their control of possession, yardage, and scoring should be evident. With New York’s defense weakened and its offense unable to consistently produce points, Cincinnati’s advantage in talent, quarterback stability, and overall form make the -6 spread a realistic and well-supported play. All indicators point toward a comfortable Bengals win by at least one full possession.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Caleb Williams OVER 33.5 longest pass completion  (-112 FanDuel) 3 units

Write Up: Caleb Williams over 33.5 longest completion prop is one of the most enticing bets for me heading into Week 8 of the NFL. Williams has cleared the 33.5 yard mark in three of his last five games completing passes for 37, 65, 29, 55, and 26. His deep ball accuracy has been better this season. Under offensive coordinator Ben Johnson, the Bears have leaned into a more vertical offense which better aligns with Caleb’s arm and mobility. He’s averaging 7.3 yards per attempt and ranks top 10 in air yards per throw, showing a clear willingness to push the ball downfield.

The matchup against Baltimore further boosts my favor of this prop hitting. The Ravens have allowed the second-most explosive pass plays (20+ yards) in the league through seven weeks and are giving up an average of 260.3 passing yards per game. Their cornerback unit has struggled with communication and blown coverages. Particularly on play action and off script scrambles - two areas where Williams thrives. With Rome Odunze and DJ Moore stretching the field and Caleb’s ability to extend plays, I like this setup for at least one deep shot to connect.

Expected outcome: 42 yards Touchdown to DJ Moore (DJ Moore’s longest reception line is way lower at 17.5 longest but I like the idea of having Rome and Zaccheaus as insurance)</td></tr>

**Summary:** Mönchengladbach received a red card early in the match, they held on for a very long time but as soon as Kimmich scored the 1-0 the resistance was mostly done, and luckily for us there were 2 more goals after that. Trabzonspor very solid again, 2-0 win making this parlay a hit!

SUPER SUNDAY! On a Sunday like this one with big games in every competition I find it hard to find bets that I am completely confident in. Hence why we&#x27;re lowering to 2 units <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.

**Arsenal v Crystal Palace:**

After Arsenal trashed Atletico Madrid who are usually defensively solid I see them putting 2 past Palace.

I don&#x27;t think Palace is a bad team at all and with a win and a draw to Liverpool &amp; Bournemouth this season I didn&#x27;t feel confident enough to put Arsenal to win here. Although they might just do that.

**Hearts v Celtic**

Whereas usually Celtic and Rangers battle it out for the first spot. That is very different this season with a very solid Hearts team that are top of the league without a loss, having already faced Rangers. With Rangers having a bad season that doesn&#x27;t say too much this time around. But honestly, Celtic aren&#x27;t having the best of times either. With only scraping 1 win out of their last 5 (92nd minute winner), they aren&#x27;t playing well at all. Because the bookies still class Celtic as favourite here, there is value in a Hearts win or draw bet. Therefore I don&#x27;t have to risk a Hearts ML bet here but I might as well have as I still see them as the favourite here.

Packers have been average just over 26 points per game with the Steelers averaging 25. Steelers have been giving up some major yardage this season. With deep threat Watson back, along with Kraft and Doubs who have been really shaping up this season, the Packers are looking good to get a few scores. On the flip side, Steelers have home advantage with Rodger playing his former team. WIth a tough run defense from the packers, Steelers will be using weapons like DK Metcalf who&#x27;s been averaging nearly 70 yards a game, or screen passing to Gainwell.

**Write Up:** Long time lurker, first timer poster here. I&#x27;ll just preface this by saying I know I&#x27;m not the best capper in the world, but hey, a 1.2% ROI is still plus money at least.

  
Let&#x27;s start with Dak. He&#x27;s gone over in 4/7 games, missing the over in 1 game by 3 yards and hitting in back back. We all know he has great weapons in CD, Pickens, and Fergie, but what really excites me is this Broncos D. Yes they have Surtain, and yes, they&#x27;re the 6th best in the league and only allowing 180 passing yards per game, but let&#x27;s breakdown those 7 games:

Against Bad QBs:  
Cam Ward - 112  
Justin Fields - 45  
Jake Browning - 125

Against Good QBs:  
Daniel Jones - 316  
Justin Herbert - 300  
Jalen Hurts - 280  
Jaxson Dart - 283

Against bad QBs, they&#x27;re averaging 94 passing yards given up versus 295 against good QBs with good QBs going over in all 4. This defense is getting gashed and Dak, the league&#x27;s second leading passer, is a good QB. Take the over.

  
And what do I really have to say about Bijan? He leads the league in yards from scrimmage per game at 152 and is going up against the league&#x27;s worst rushing defense in the Dolphins. I don&#x27;t really care who&#x27;s in at QB, I&#x27;m trusting the talent here.</td></tr>

Haaland has been on a tear since the start of this EPL season. Out of the 8 games so far, he’s scored in every game but one. He’s scored 11 goals from 8 games in EPL and 4 goals from 3 UCL games. 

Haaland did have a mid-week game but expect him to start. I’m placing a unit on this bet purely based on the run Haaland’s had this season, he’s a prolific striker who’s not only in the right position, but has strength and speed over 90% of the league’s defence.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Mjallby to win and u3.5 v Norrkoping 3u $2.50

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Mjallby are the darlings of Swedish (and to a degree, world) football at the moment. The tiny team from an even smaller town clinched the Swedish title away from home in their last match. 

Mjallby have been great this season, going 20-6-1 in their 27 games so far. 

Their performance has been on the back of their league-leading defence, having conceded only 17 goals in 27 games. While they&#x27;re not at the top in clean sheets, they&#x27;ve only concealed more than a single goal twice this season (one was day one of the season, and the other was in May). So they are known to give little away. 

Now they go back home in their first game after being crowned champs and host 13th placed Norrkoping, who sit just outside the relegation spots in a 16-team league. 

Norrkoping obviously need points here to help secure their safety, but I think Mjallby will be too good at home. Especially when you consider Norrkoping have only won 3 away games all season, and two of those were early on.

Motivation after winning the league is always an issue, but this will be the first home game since, and you want to celebrate with the fans.

While I&#x27;m thinking almost everything points to a Mjallby win here, I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;ll be a big score. Only 5 of Mjallby&#x27;s 20 league wins this season have cleared the o3.5 goals threshold, and the last of those was early August. 

And only six of their 27 total league games this season have had more than 3.5 goals scored.... 3 of which were in their first 5 games this season. 

If you want to be safer, you can find Mjallby outright at over $1.50 in most places, but I&#x27;m confident enough in the game going under 3.5 goals.</td></tr>

**Writeup:** *JK Dobbins has been a bowling ball this season, clearing this line in 86% of games (6/7) with an average longest rush of 22 yards per attempt.*

*Enter the Cowboys. Backfields this year have averaged \~103 rushing yards on 22–23 attempts (4.61 YPC) against them, allowing chunk-yardage efficiency.* 

*This has allowed every high useage back to cover this line this season:*

*Rico Dowdle - 15 Longest Rush Attempt*  
*Breece Hall - 22 LoR*  
*Josh Jacobs - 19 LoR*  
*Saquon Barkley - 16 LoR*

*Stylistically, this sets up for Dobbins. He’s a decisive, one-cut runner—hit the landmark, stick your foot in the ground, and go. Against Dallas’ front, that cutback lane shows up a few times a game.*

*The Cowboys’ run metrics are solid snap-to-snap, but they allow above-average yards after contact and have coughed up explosives when backs get through the first wave. That’s Dobbins’ wheelhouse.*

*With a realistic 12–16 carries in a neutral script and the way Dallas has given up sporadic gashes to RBs, you’re live on every early-down touch.*

*Dallas looks sturdier against zone than they do against man/gap concepts, where higher yards per carry and a bump in explosive rate is allowed. Dobbins favors in gap runs, having 59 carries there compared to the 44 zone carries.*

*Dobbins is a perfect fit for those gap looks: downhill, decisive, and a strong finisher through the second level. One clean B-gap crease on GT counter or duo, and you’ve got the one play you need to clear 15.5.*</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Josh Jacobs - Most Rushing Yards in the game (Fanduel, -145, 3 units)

Reasoning:

Steelers rank 18th in terms of rush yards per game with 115.8 allowed, Packers are 2nd with 76.5

Add in that the Steelers use a true platoon with Warren and Gainwell (and occasionally Kaleb Johnson), while the Packers have a true bellcow running back in Josh Jacobs.  Warren went off last week so his over/unders should be up a bit, adding to our odds slightly, but it was vs Cincinatti&#x27;s putrid defense.

Ranking 18th Jacobs averages 69 (nice) yards per game

Warren ranks 27th at 62.5 yards per game after an extreme outlier week.  Prior to that it was 44 yards per game.

Gainwell is mostly just a receiving back

La Liga 

Real Madrid vs Barcelona: Real Madrid ML @1.9

Both sides come into this Clásico with flaws, but the difference is simple: Real Madrid’s weaknesses are far less damaging. Barcelona are still missing key finishers like Lewandowski and Raphinha, and their current front line can be very wasteful.

I think madrid has been defensively the much better side with huijsen and militao being in good form. Also the keepers are a big mismatch, missing joan garcia is a big problem for barcelona. 

If cubarsi and garcia start as the projected lineups suggest, then i think mbappe will feast. This is the type of game where araujo should start and christensen if he is fit. 

All things considered, with the home advantage and Mbappé in top form, I see Real Madrid as clear favourites for this one.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:**  Man City Win or Draw &amp; Real Madrid vs Barcelona Over 4.5 cards @ 1.80 (Usual 3 units)

**Leg 1**:  Man City Win/Draw vs Aston Villa

City visit Villa Park stadium as strong favorites after beating Villareal in Spain midweek in Champions League competition, while hosts Villa are licking their wounds after heading to the Netherlands only to lose to the Go Ahead Eagles, also for Champions League.

Aston Villa sit 12^(th) in the table right behind Brentford and Newcastle but slightly ahead of Brighton, all teams which had fairly decent performances <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> upsetting the likes of Chelsea and Liverpool.  This league can and does surprise as the level of competition is very high, and City is no stranger to the occasional upset.  However, City have lost only once in their last 10 matches and seem to have found their stride with Golden Boot favorite Haaland scoring 11 of their 17 goals this season.

City are currently 3^(rd) and can ill afford to drop points as they are within a match of catching Arsenal for the lead.  No major injury concerns to report for either side. 

There is no question Man City is the better squad and I am backing them to not lose.  As usual taking the better team and the odds are not terrible either.

**Leg 2**:  El Clasico - Real Madrid vs Barcelona – Over 4.5 Cards

One of the most anticipated rivalries in the sport.  This one in particular should be quite “caliente” with plenty of fouls and cards to go around. 

* Since 2024 they have played 6 times, of which Barcelona has won the last 4 in a row, 2 of which were at Real Madrid’s Bernabeau Stadium by scores of 5-2 and 4-0.  Those 2 matches had 7 and 10 cards each.
* Of their last 6 H2H matches, there have been an average of 6.6 yellow cards per game and a total of 4 red cards on top since 2024.
* In the last 4 meetings between these 2 there have been at least 7 cards per match.
* Since 2024 no match has had less than 5 cards.

To say Real Madrid is pissed and insulted in an understatement after getting embarrassed in front of their home crowd in such fashion.  They are currently league leaders atop of the table with Barcelona trailing in 2^(nd) place just 2 points behind.  This adds another dimension to the match as the winner also becomes the league leader.

There are plenty of reasons and ways to see that the animosity shared by these two Spanish giants goes beyond just bad blood due to sport.  There is historical context that goes along, but we will not get into that now.  If the previous stats are any indication of how this game will be played, I expect war on the field.  4.5 should be an easy cover.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Crystal Palace U2.5 team cards vs Arsenal 3U @ 1.72 (Bet365)

Write-up: Pretty unlucky loss but we’ve been on the other side of this quite a bit recently so I can’t complain, it was bound to happen. As expected it was a battle between the two with Bencic coming out on top in three sets. 2 double faults in the first set followed by another 2 in the second necessitated none in the third from Kenin. Unfortunately she waited until the last game of the match at 5-2 to DF a fifth time. 

We should be in for an entertaining game at the Emirates as this is a fixture that has historically brought goals aplenty, ending 2-2 and 1-5 last year. Arsenal are top of the league at the moment and have established themselves as the best defence in the world only conceding 3 all season. Meanwhile after a very promising start to the season, winning the Community Shield after the FA Cup last season, Palace are winless in their last three. Referee of the day Thomas Bramall is amongst the most lenient referees in the league averaging 4 booking points per match. Meanwhile, Palace have received an average of 2.25 yellows per match this season. What really amazed me while analysing this match is the fact that this line has been cleared in the last 22 matches between the two sides, dating back to 2014. That is honestly quite absurd and though doesn’t represent a whole lot of a deal, shows that despite being a “London derby” tensions usually remain low, which should help with decreasing bookings. Using all factors I get a mean of 1.90 bookings for Palace.

That gives this play an estimated 68% chance of winning. By building in the H2H I would give it closer to a 73% chance of winning (1.70 bookings). BOL !</td></tr>

I will be back to normal now and try get a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>potd</mark> out every day, anyway Haaland had me sweating after the first half but he cleared this line and more and the statistics still stand. 7 in a row, let&#x27;s come back with a bang and keep making money. 

TODAYS BET 

EVENT/S = Arsenal VS Crystal Palaca

PARLAY BET =  Arsenal to win Second half and Viktor Gyokeres to have over 0.5 shots on target @2.07

UNITS = 3U to Profit 3.21U

SUMMARY =  I looked at a lot of games and a lot of players, even looking at the NBA which I am also a big fan of but statistically and for value I have decided on Arsenal. Arsenal have won every second half this season aside from 2. Their win against United earlier in the season had a second half with no goals and the wonder free kick Conceded against Liverpool from Szoboszlai. I actually see Arsenal winning both halves after a strong performance last time out against Atletico Madrid I think their form will be too strong and the fact they are a team that closes out games is a good sign, Crystal Palace form isn&#x27;t too relevant here but they haven&#x27;t been great recently, they do score goals but their 2nd half stats are far too inconsistent to hold any relevancy to me. Now onto the second part of the bet, Gyokeres has been a pretty average striker for majority of the season so far but he had a really good game against Atletico Madrid bagging 2 goals for himself. He has hit one shot on target in every game this season apart from 3. The game against city that ended 1-1, the loss against Liverpool previously mentioned and the opener against Man United. Every other game he has hit 1 shot on target if not more. I feel like he scores in this game but getting value for 1 shot on target is even better. Let&#x27;s make it a winning return and 8 wins in a row. 

If my picks help you and you&#x27;d like to show your appreciation a thumbs up is perfect, if you&#x27;d like to tip which is never expected but always appreciated and does help motivate me for the research here you go.  [Anything Helps ](http://Paypal.me/smoothsailinnomore)</td></tr>

Last 10: 💰💰💰✖️✖️💰💰💰✖️💰

Last POTD: 🏈 Oronde Gasden II 25+ alt receiving yards + Under 52.5 alt total points (-139). 💰

Writeup: Gasden is going to be legit in this league. Not only did he hit his actual line of 44 yards but he hit the 60-100 range I mentioned in the last writeup. The under got a little squirrely at the end with LA having a chance to score a touchdown late, but they were stopped for a field goal. 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: 🏈 Jonathan Taylor under 20.5 Rushing Attempts (-114)

Game starts at 4:25pm EST. Bet 2.75u

Writeup: Going for a non primetime game this weekend as we are once again going with a Colts bet. We are taking the under on JT&#x27;s rush attempts, and this is actually because I continue to have a positive outlook on the Colts. They are going up against the Tennessee Titans, who are probably a bottom 3 team in the NFL. The spread for this game is Colts -14.5, and I like the Colts with their points in a decisive victory. Over the course of the season, JT has been averaging 18.5 rush attempts and has only gone over this line twice. Over the last 5 weeks, Jonathan Taylor has been under this line 4 times. Those 4 games were ones where the Colts were up big by the 4th quarter, and they would pull JT to rest him in the 4th because he wasn&#x27;t needed in order to win. The one time he went over this line, by 1 rush attempt, was against the Cardinals. This game was won by the Colts by only 4 points and came down to the wire - JT was needed all game. The second game where he went over was against the Broncos - another close game. You see the pattern? If we follow the trends here, JT and the Colts will have yet another effective game where JT will not need to run much, and he could once again get pulled early. There are still games in the 5 game stretch where he wasn&#x27;t pulled and still stayed under this line, so don&#x27;t worry about that. The last time the Colts played the Titans, JT only had 17 rush attempts. If the Titans defense manage to stop JT on the ground, this only helps us. The Colts are genuinely playing for the Super Bowl - if they can rest their stars, they will whenever they can. JT does not need to and will not go over 20.5 rush attempts in this game.

Ajax have allowed a combined 11 goals in 3 CL games as well, so can&#x27;t see Twente not scoring here, on the other hand, Twente have had pretty high scoring games at home, where they allowed multiple goals to weaker sides (2-1 vs Heracles, 3-2 vs Sittard, 2-2 vs Breda and also to stronger such as PSV 0-2).</td></tr>

Analysis was spot on here and it felt good after I had started to question some of my judgement. Max Caputo scored a double to put City up 2-0 within the first half, putting us in a comfortable position.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Football - A-League - Brisbane Roar v Wellington Phoenix - Under 2.5 Goals - $1.90 - 1.0 Unit - *starting in roughly 2 hours..*

Brisbane will travel to Wellington for their second game of the season. The catch is that Wellington have just gone to Perth and back (15 hours of flight time), so they are more likely to be affected if anything.

Brisbane enjoyed a 1-0 win at home to Macarthur in their first game, and only registered 6 shots, creating 1 big chance, with 36% possession of the ball. But what’s impressive was their ability to shut them out as the Roar were playing with 10 men from the 58th minute onwards.

Wellington managed a 2-2 draw with Perth away from home. Perth conceded 4 to City yesterday and were looking quite amateur, so the Wellington result doesn’t read so well considering they only managed 0.78xG for their 2 goals.

I believe Brisbane will take the safe approach here, as they don’t want to drop any points after a strong start. I expect them to have more ball than last game but Wellington may struggle to break them down resulting in a low scoring game. If Brisbane get a lead they will try to manage the game and inevitably park the bus.

This fixture has hit the under 2.5 goal line for the past 5 matches and the last time it produced more than 2 goals was back in 2023. They both lack natural goal scorers and only averaged just over a goal per game each last season.

I do have a slight concern about their defensive records from last season, so I’m keeping it safe with a 1 unit play.

\*If anyone needs help finding the bet can always reach out

\*\*Will have some ML/other plays up in the esports channel for those interested

**Writeup:**

* Ag1l has been playing great for SAW averaging a .74 KPR in the L3 months with a 51.3% headshot in that time
* Veto should be straight forward here, while it would normally be messy (both teams perma ban the same map), we have seen 3DMAX time and time again ban Mirage, even against teams who also perma ban Mirage. They have a 100% first ban rate of Mirage, and last time they played SAW (Feb 2025), they banned Mirage first. SAW should ban Inferno, it is their worst map by far and one 3DMAX are dominant on
* SAW have first <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> in this series, I&#x27;d be really stunned to see them go anything but Nuke as their first <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. 3DMAX weren&#x27;t known as a great Nuke team earlier in the year but recently have been red hot on the map. Their winrate has climbed and they have begun first picking the map with a 65% winrate on 17 maps played with most of these games being against tier one teams which is very impressive.
* Despite this, SAW have a 92% winrate on Nuke and are on a 10 map winstreak on the map, they are so dominant and so good at this map that even teams that don&#x27;t normally first ban Nuke have started to ban it against them. They first <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> this map in 59% of their matches which is an insanely high amount and for good reason.
* Ag1l leads SAW on Nuke, this is his best map by far on the roster. He is averaging a .85 KPR in the L3 months on Nuke (+.11 KPR) over a strong sample of rounds, and a .81 KPR in the L6 months on Nuke (+.10 KPR) on the map overall. Not only is it a GREAT map for KPR/his overall kills, but his headshot number is also fantastic on this map. His headshot % goes up to 58.7% in the L3 months (+7.4%) and 59.3% in the L6 months (+9% overall).
* Ag1l is 14/16 hitrate on Nuke (both misses being at 6 headshots), needs \~11-12 kills to hit this line with a kill line currently at 13.5/14.5</td></tr>

__Event:__ NFL: Bucs @ Saints 4:05pm EST

__POTD:__ Chris Olave o59.5 rec yards (-115 on FD), 3.6u to win 3.13u

__Write Up:__ The (5-2) Bucs are traveling to New Orleans to take on the (1-6) Saints. The Bucs are 3.5-point favorites &amp; the total is set at 46.5 points scored. The Saints give up a ton of points. __The Saints have trailed for 88.6% of their offensive snaps, highest rate in the league. They are allowing 2.45 points per drive (28th).__ This is going to lead to a ton passes from the Saints offense, especially since The Bucs are one of the most pass funnel defenses in the league.

__The Bucs rank 4th in rushing success rate allowed &amp; EPA per rush allowed.__ They have only allowed one 100 yard rusher this season &amp; limited Saquon Barkley to 43 yards on 19 carries, Christian McCaffrey to 54 yards on 17 carries, &amp; Bijan Robinson to 24 yards on 12 carries. In their last 3 games they’ve given up the 3rd most passing yards per game (284 ypg). Teams would much rather pass facing that elite run defense. Tampa also blitzes  a ton. __The Bucs blitz at the 6th highest rate defensively (36%) &amp; they generating pressure on 53% of their plays (5th highest). Saints QB Spencer Rattler has actually done well when facing pressure, completing 58.1% of his pass attempts (5th) averaging 7.1 yards per attempt (8th). When facing a blitz, he has completed 70% of his throws (5th) for 7.3 yards per attempt (15th). The Bucs are allowing 7.7 yards per pass attempt (26th). Who has Rattler thrown to on blitzes? Saints star WR Chris Olave. Olave accounts for more than 50% of the team’s receiving yards, has a team-high 40% 1st read target rate, &amp; averages 0.85 points per route run on blitzed dropbacks. Opposing offenses use play-action at the lowest rate in the NFL vs. TB (19% dropbacks). Which is significant because Chris Olave averages 0.46 points per route run with &amp; without play action. Consistent production compared to the Saints WR Rashid Shaheed who averages 0.93 points per route run with play action and 0.26 without it.__ And by points I mean fantasy points, odd stat but I thought it was an interesting add. In the past few weeks Rattler &amp; Olave have connected a ton. Olave has been used on some deeper routes. __After averaging under 10 yards per catch in every game over the first 5 weeks, over the past 2 weeks, he has had 98 receiving yards in consecutive games.__

__Weeks 1-5: 1.4 Yards Per Route Run, 8.8 yards Average Depth of Target, 35% air yards, 36% endzone targets__

__Weeks 6-7: 3.5 YPRR, 15.5 aDOT, 45% air yards, 100% endzone targets__

The cause of this has been Rattler is starting to air it out more. __In Weeks 1-5 Rattler had an aDOT of 7.4. Weeks 6-7 his aDOT has risen to 10.2 aDOT.__ This has led to a ton of utilization for Olave. __Olave ranks 2nd in the NFL in targets with 68 targets. In the last 2 weeks, Olave is the #4 WR in Fantasy Life’s Utilization Score for the season, No. 7 (83).
And now this week he&#x27;s going against the Bucs, who have been dominated by every mid-sized perimeter WR1 they&#x27;ve faced. Week 3 Garrett Wilson went 10/84/1 receiving on 13 targets, Week 5 JSN went for 8/132/1 receiving on 9 targets, &amp; Week 6 Kendrick Bourne went for 5/142/0 receiving on 9 targets. Part of this is because the Bucs offense has done so well you have to pass to keep up. __The Buccaneers have turned the ball over on 5.2% of their drives, the 4th lowest rate in the league. Tampa Bay has scored 8 TD’s from outside of the red zone, 2nd in the league. Now they face the Saints that have allowed 6 TD outside of the red zone, most in the league.__ The Bucs defense allows I ton of explosive throws. __They given up 25 passes for 20+ yards (3rd most) &amp; 4 passes for 40+ yards (7th most).__

The Saints have lost 2 pieces to their run game with Kendre Miller &amp; Erik McCoy ruled out &amp; they are dogs playing in a dome. Rattler has the potential to throw the most passes of his career, against a blitz heavy defense. Olave will eat.

Real Madrid vs Barcelona

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> : Real Madrid to Win or Draw + BTTS @1.76 for 4u

Real Madrid are top of La Liga with 24 points and have won eight straight home matches at the Bernabeu, while their only loss all season was 5-2 to Atletico Madrid, showing they are very hard to beat especially at home. Barcelona have big injury problems that will hurt them badly, missing key players like Raphinha, Dani Olmo and Robert Lewandowski. Furthermore, Barca manager Hansi Flick will not be at the touchline due to the red card in the last match and therefore cannot give instructions during the match. Real Madrid also have few injuries, but players including Trent Alexander-Arnold, Dani Carvajal and Hujisen will be available for the el classico, and their attack is deadly with Kylian Mbappé scoring in eight straight games before the Champions League and having 10 goals in 9 La Liga matches. 

The both teams to score part is almost guaranteed because the last six El Clasico matches produced 33 total goals, and Barcelona have conceded in their last six matches including a 4-1 loss at Sevilla, while Real Madrid&#x27;s defense is also weak without their main defenders. With both teams needing to attack and both having defensive problems due to injuries, this match should have plenty of goals from both sides while Real Madrid&#x27;s home advantage makes it very unlikely they will lose.

Last pick: Brentford vs Liverpool (BTTS &amp; Over 2.5 goals @ 1.83) ✅️

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>: Real Madrid vs Barcelona (BTTS &amp; Over 2.5 &amp; over 1.5 goals in the 2nd half @ 1.75) 🍀

Another day, another Moist Conflict! Our bet went through in the first half, 39 minutes was all it took. It ended up 3-2 to Brentford. On to the next one, with the biggest football match in the world, El Classico.

Tomorrow’s El Clásico at the Santiago Bernabéu is the best spectacle football has to offer, and this edition is loaded with narrative, stats and two teams desperate to attack from the outset. Real Madrid arrive as league leaders with 24 points in 9 matches, while Barcelona trail closely with 22 points, making this a true top-of-the-table clash where a win would create daylight in the La Liga race. The numbers behind this fixture are staggering: the last six El Clásicos have averaged over 4 goals per game, with both teams scoring in every clash, remarkably, none of those matches ended goalless at half or full-time. The “BTTS &amp; Over 2.5 Goals” angle has landed repeatedly, and five of the last six encounters saw at least two goals after halftime as both teams emptied their tanks chasing results late on.

Recent H2H backs this up: Barcelona triumphed 4-3 in their most recent league meeting, and also produced a 5-2 win and a 3-2 cup final thriller earlier this year, while Real have netted in 14 of their last 15 matches in all competitions. Kylian Mbappé, leading the scoring charts with 10 goals in just 9 league matches, is historically devastating in this fixture, scoring 11 times in 8 previous El Clásicos. Barcelona’s attack has also been rampant, under Hansi Flick, they average 3.3 goals per league match this term, and star men Lewandowski, Raphinha and Yamal (Lewandowski and Raphinha will not be playing this match due to injury) have each contributed over 10 league goals already.

For the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>: Both Teams To Score &amp; Over 2.5 Goals &amp; Over 1.5 Goals in the 2nd Half, paying 1.75 is exceptional value considering these performances. Only two of the last ten meetings have stayed under 3 goals, with the majority featuring a frantic second half as both sides chase the result. The refereeing tends to let the game flow and, crucially, attacking players on both rosters are in peak form. The quality of this rivalry demands a big show, and the stats almost guarantee it: goals, drama, and a fast, open game from start to finish. Backing this with odds at 1.75 stands out as a strong value bet for tomorrow’s main event.

Let&#x27;s cash it!

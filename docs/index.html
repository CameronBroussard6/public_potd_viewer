<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:  8. SAMARELLE - WIN - $2.60 (Betting 2 units)
Write Up: Going with a real quality filly here <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> who is resuming for her 2nd preparation in SAMARELLE. It’s debut campaign saw it run really well in all 3 starts, culminating in a 2nd placing in the Reginald Allen to the eventual Carbine Club winner (big 3yo races).

The break in between preps has seemed to do wonders for this horse, as she’s looked to come back impressively based on the two trials this time in. We draw barrier 5 and get the best jockey in the world on top, so I’m fairly confident we’ll end up with a grouse spot in running, probably the 1-1.

We have a dominant ratings profile over the rest of the field, however I am cautious that the rating came in our grand final as opposed to first up, but with the expected improvement I can forecast a similar number here.

As I go down the list of opposition, I can <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> many holes in them. SIGNOR TORTONI, our main market rival, has trialled the house down either side of its first up run, but that run was absolutely awful, finishing dead last. I can’t possibly trust that horse currently. CLEAR PROOF and KILBRANNAN are going well but they’re definitely not up to the class of our horse. That leaves SNITZEL DANCER, who hasn’t done much at the trials but showed its class last prep, however we comfortably had its measure when we matched up.

Game/League/Time: League of Legends (LOL) | LPL | 6:00 AM EST

**AL:**

* AL has been very dominant this split so far, especially in map 1&#x27;s, 6-2 record overall on the season while facing all of the other best teams in China, in my opinion they are the best team in the LPL still and without them
* They are 7-1 in map 1&#x27;s so far this split and have been on a very good run of form overall
* They are on a 5 match win streak overall

**WBG:**

* WBG have been for the most part very average, 4-4 record overall, 0-2 against BLG but have had really good success against JDG with a 2-0 record against them and seemingly match up well against certain teams and bad against others
* They are 3-1 in their last 4 matches but they are coming off a 2-0 against a cold slumping BLG roster 

**Head to Head:**

* AL beat WBG in their first match of the split in a relatively one sided 2-0 with both games being U 33 minutes in game time overall
* Individual player h2h&#x27;s are very favorable for AL. In the last two years: 
* Flandre is 4-0 in matches against Zika
* Tarzan is 3-0 in matches against JieJie
* Shanks is 5-2 in matches against Xiaohu

&gt;The Olympics begin tomorrow and curling will start with the mixed doubles discipline. Canada are 12-1 this season and their first opponent is the youngest and least experienced team in the field, Czechia. Canada are 9-0 against teams outside the world top 25, covering the -3.5 spread in all but two of those matches. Czechia are 24-11 this season, 1-2 against elite teams like Canada. They did not cover +3.5 in either of those two losses. Canada won 10-4 in the only career match between these two teams.

**Odds:** \-115 (Betano)

**Units (to win):** 3.45U to win 3U

**Reasoning:** Both teams off a back to back, but very different situations. Nuggets will be without Jokic coming off his injury, while the Knicks are currently putting BTA to the Wizards and should be able to converse their guys for tomorrow. Nuggets played great without Jokic, but the Knicks have absolutely turned their season around and are riding a 7 game winning streak. Knicks have performed very well in the h2h recently, a trend we can expect to see to continue.</td></tr>

Event: BLAST Slam | Tundra vs. Yandex

Time: 7:00 AM EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Tundra ML @ 1.8 odds (5u)

Write Up:

OG delivered exactly what we needed with that aggressive start. Now we’re rolling those winnings right into the next slate to get back to even.

We’re going with Tundra ML.

If you saw my last post, you know Yandex absolutely killed our parlay last time. They looked disjointed and totally lost on the map. I’m not trusting them with my money again until they get on the same page.

On the other side, Tundra has historically owned this matchup. They have an 8-4 record against Yandex all-time, and they usually dismantle teams that play loose. Getting Tundra at 1.8 odds is honestly a steal they are just the more disciplined team atm. Yandex might have Watson and Saksa, but they aren&#x27;t playing like a unit rn.

BOTH TEAMS TO SCORE IN THE SECOND HALF @ 2.5

PSV face Heerenveen in the KNVB Beker with both sides aiming to reach the next round. Cup matches are often cautious early, with more risks taken after halftime. PSV usually raise intensity in the second half at home, while Heerenveen have enough attacking quality to respond. As the game opens up, chances should arrive at both ends.

Just like Tottenham, Albacete looked to be down and out with Barca being much closer to the 3rd goal than they were to their first, but they pulled one back before almost completing a generational comeback, but it was cleared off the line. Sadly, I didn&#x27;t get the full satisfaction of seeing Barca getting knocked out, but it does mean the bet still hit, which is all that matters at the end of the day.

**Event:** EFL Cup, Manchester City v Newcastle United, 3:00 pm EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Newcastle Win or Draw, +105, 1 unit

**Write Up:** Manchester City gave us a nice win in our most recent fade and I&#x27;m repeating the process here. They once again looked dreadful in that second half against Tottenham, showing they really do **struggle to beat their bogey teams** and that they far too often **take their foot off the gas** after going up.

Newcastle are not only a bit of a **bogey team** for Man City, but also **take this cup more seriously** after not really being in contention on the other fronts. They&#x27;re trailing on aggregate, so I&#x27;m expecting them to come in **all guns blazing** to try and cut the deficit, and I can see them nabbing a draw or a narrow win, *which ultimately isn&#x27;t going to be enough to see them through,* but should be enough to secure another win on the board. They&#x27;re a physically **strong, well organized** side that can cause a lot of damage to **City&#x27;s lacklustre backline** even on their good day, let alone in the form they&#x27;re in at the minute. Because of that, I logically also like the look of the BTTS Yes if you want to sprinkle something extra on this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. Just a unit on this one as I&#x27;m saving the big bucks for the classic Barcelona fades. BOL and let&#x27;s keep the cup madness rolling ☘️🫡</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Antoine Semenyo To Score or Assist (+105) 1 unit to win 1.05 units

**Write Up:** Maybe I should only play Enzo Fernandez for my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>. That was our 8th win playing Enzo for the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>, every one of those was plus money other than one. The game played out much as expected, with Chelsea having the majority of possession and Arsenal playing defensively. Enzo came through for us again in less sweaty fashion as he lands an SOT before halftime. Gotta love it!

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> we&#x27;ve got the last semi final for the EFL Cup as Man City host Newcastle. City is already up 2-0 on aggregate here. This should be an even more open game as Newcastle need to score at least 2 goals. We have cashed Semenyo a few times in the soccer thread over the last few weeks and I like him here again <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. His goal over the weekend was on a counter attack and I expect that to be City&#x27;s main threat <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. 

Semenyo has been on a tear since joining City, scoring a goal in 4 out of 5 games played. He has scored in two straight EPL games and also scored in this reverse fixture a few weeks back at Newcastle. I&#x27;m buying down the risk a bit here as ATGS is +190, since City have been moving towards a two pronged attack with Haaland and Semenyo up front. The two have had great link up play the last few games, so I love that we are still in plus odds and adding the option of an assist to cash.

Write-up:
I mean it’s Falcons, the worlds most well known team for delaying the game for no reason even when they are 20-30k ahead they really have a good understanding of the game and minimize mistakes by controlling the map and farming rather than finishing the game quickly or taking a 60/40 fight on enemy high ground. Besides that these two teams their latest encounters have all hit over the line, in Blast V in Novemeber last year their BO1 match lasted 56min , in Dreamleague in December their match lasted 46min for map 1. Not only this, Falcons played 4 games <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> and 3 out of 4 games hit over 40min , XG also hit this line in two games out of 4. Also it’s a morning match, as a gamer usually these players are night owls , when their match is at 9-10am they play very bad and make a lot of mistakes which causes the game to be longer.</td></tr>

**Bet:** [Maestrelli F.](https://www.flashscore.dk/spiller/maestrelli-francesco/jsdn0W9I/) to win at odds 1.53

**Units:** 1 Units

**Explanation:**

I see good value Maestrelli in this match. He had a solid run in Australia, qualifying for AO and won his first match against Erhard, who has been playing well recently. He is currently number 117 in the world and meeting number 306 in the world. 

Shelbayh made a good progression the last year but has not really shown a good form recently. Besides his match yesterday, he has not won a match since October last year and I believe this match is going to be a too big a mouthfull against a Maestrelli who has won 5 out of his 7 matches this year and played all matches on hard court (and one of the matches he lost was to Djokovic, which almost shouldn&#x27;t count as a lost match in this statistic).

I see a good value in this bet and good luck!

<tr><td class='post'>**Record:** 46-23-1 (+23.62u)

**Last:** (CBB) Indiana ML (1.5u) - Pending

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** (CBB) No. 10 Michigan State (-6.5) at Minnesota

**Start Time:** 7:00 PM ET (BTN)

**Odds:** \-112 (DraftKings)

**Units (to win):** 1.5U

**Reasoning:** Death. Taxes. Another Sparty donation?

There hasn’t been a lot of coin respecting going on when it comes to Michigan State as of late. That’s largely in part to some slow starts, as the team stumbled out of the gate in each of its two games last week against Rutgers and Michigan, trailing at the half by nine and 16 points respectively. But while a second-half surge helped the Spartans (19-3) outlast the Scarlet Knights in overtime, it was a case of too little, too late against the Wolverines. The loss snapped a seven-game win streak and dropped the team to 4th in the Big Ten standings.

But if there’s one thing head coach Tom Izzo knows how to do, it’s to bounce back: Michigan State is 31-13-2 ATS following a loss over the last five years.

However, don’t expect Minnesota to make it easy. Despite a 3-8 mark in conference play—and having lost each of its last seven games—the Gophers (10-12) have been a tough out in the opening half of games. In fact, the team has either led or been tied at the half in four of its last six contests. That includes being knotted up at 34 against then-No. 13 Illinois and leading 36-30 against then-No. 7 Nebraska. Elite defense has been the name of the game, as Minnesota ranks 10th in first half scoring defense (29.7 PPGA).

Unfortunately, that’s about the only positive the team can hang its hat on.

After a 10-5 start to the season, it’s been all downhill for the Gophers. Through 22 games, the team ranks 125th in field-goal percentage (45.5%), 163rd in offensive efficiency (1.064), 242nd in three-point shooting (32.7%) and 245th in scoring (71.8 PPG). Not the kind of numbers you want to bring into a matchup with a Spartans defense that enters ranked 8th in opponent field-goal percentage (39.1%), 9th in scoring defense (64.4 PPGA), 11th in defensive efficiency (0.928) and 40th in opponent three-point shooting (30.4%). The last time the team came off a loss, the unit limited USC to just 17 first-half points and 51 for the game on just 33% shooting (18% from beyond the arc).

Things don’t get any more promising on the defensive end.

On the year, the Minnesota defense can be described average at best, ranking 48th in scoring defense (68.8 PPGA), 97th in opponent field-goal percentage (42.9%), 102nd in defensive efficiency (1.020) and 195th in opponent three-point shooting (34.2%). However, over the last six games, the unit has been leaking water, conceding an average of 76.2 points on 46.2% shooting from the field (40.7% from long range). For a Michigan State offense that ranks 53rd in offensive efficiency, Wednesday night’s matchup could be like stealing candy from a baby. Especially with point guard Jeremy Fears Jr. (14.9 PPG, 8.8 APG) playing the way he has as of late.

Trust Sparty to bounce back convincingly.

Last POTD: Pending: 2 <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> Parlay: NBA Nuggets ML vs Hawks / CFB Boise State vs UNLV o48.5 (2.50$ TO WIN 1.91$)

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: CBB St. Bonaventure ML vs. Buffalo / CFB Texas Tech ML vs. BYU (2.50$ TO WIN 1.85$)**

Write up: This is not a model play FYI - this is a personal bet.

• ⁠Buffalo has put their name on the map this year because for the first time ever, they are 8-0 - they had two good wins, Depaul &amp; Vermont

• ⁠This is MID-MAJOR basketball; anything can happen of course. I believe St. Bonaventure is MILES better than UB, but because of the rivalry and them being on the road, I believe this is why the line is lower than it should be 

• Buffalo have 3 guys, Freitag being their #1, the Wisconsin transfer - if Bonaventure can hold him to less than 20 points, I believe they have a big chance of winning

• Bonaventure is deep, playing around 8-10 per game - the bench guys have come up clutch for them when they needed too, and their bench is pretty darn good for being a mid-major program - between Buddy Simmons, Frank Mitchell, Lonati, Charles, Big Joe, and Marshall, Bonaventure have the weapons to beat up on Buffalo

* I do not see anyone stopping Bonaventure&#x27;s big, Frank Mitchell, and if they do, Bonaventure has enough fire power around him to win them the game - if Bonaventure can slow Buffalo&#x27;s scorer&#x27;s down just a touch, they will roll
* The model is projecting Texas Tech to cover, so I added them as the ML 2nd leg - Bonaventure is only -4 favorites so their ML should be in the 200&#x27;s something

Let&#x27;s keep rolling.

BOL!

&gt; **Write Up:** This <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> is from my soccer model that I&#x27;ve been using for the past two years. It assigns ELO ratings to players and projects a win chance based on the combined ELO ratings of the players on each team. TeamReddit is projecting a 62% win chance here which creates value here on the ML.</td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>

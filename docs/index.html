Writeup: Sorry for the short notice. Regarding the first leg, both teams are of similar skill level, though the bookies are giving a slight edge to the Mongolian side. The ML feels risky, but i expect the series to atleast go to 4 maps or even 5, since neither team is at a level to blank the other. For the 2nd leg, DDP is in the form of his life,   has crossed this run mark in the past 4/5 matches + he needs to keep this performance to get selected to the national side. Will likely cross this, unless the pitch is utter crap or he has a stinker of a game.

Hope we slowly string up wins &amp; BoL

Sorokin will be back in goal tomorrow for the Islanders after being out with a lower body injury for the last 2 weeks. He’s had a good year so far (.910 save percentage and 2.55 GAA). The Islanders are underdogs at home, despite being 13-8-2 this year and they get their star goaltender back.

The Devils will be starting Markstrom most likely. He has been good over the last month, but this is still a matchup that favors the Islanders. Markstrom started against the Islanders on 12/23 and only allowed 2 goals on 25 shots. 

But the issue with the Devils is scoring goals. They are near the bottom of the league in goals scored per game and are going up against one of the best goalies in the league, and the Islanders are + money.

Good Luck!</td></tr>

• Duke UGH - as many of you know, I am a diehard Tarheel, so this bet hurts... Duke has not lost to Louisville in the last 7 matchups, and while yes, Louisville has been historically bad, I like this stat - Duke has one of the best defenses in the country, and while Louisville scores big and a lot at home, I think Duke has what it takes on the defensive end to slow them down - I think Duke is easily the better team overall, and I would like to think most people agree - I believe this line is set at +1.5 solely because of the home court advantage - If Duke was at home - I think they are -6.5 favs - Not many times a year do we get the opportunity to bet on a Top 10 team + the points - Duke is shooting a nice 50% from the field and has terrific defense - Duke is the better play, and I believe there is value in this bet - Give me the Blue Devils +1.5

**Sport**: Tennis 🎾

**League**: Brisbane ATP

**Match**: Dimitrov vs Carreno-Busta

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>**: Dimitrov -3,0 games @ 1,93



Odds here are reflecting lack of Dimitrov match shape as he only played Paris since he retired in that match in Wimbledon where he had Sinner on ropes. In that match in Paris I backed Dimitrov against Mpetshi Perricard and it was an easy win. However, he withdrew from the second round. It&#x27;s been more than couple months since them and I guess he is match fit. He should especially be match fit in his first match of the tournament/season, and I&#x27;m much more inclined to back him in R1 than later.



Carreno Busta played two Q rounds here, managing to win Bellucci in 3rd set tie breaker and then Cazaux retired in first set. Should be better prepared for conditions here, but quality difference at this age is bigger than ever and surface advantage should be huge. Odds are going down on Dimitrov, but since I expect him to cruise here I like this line. Dimotrov has a SF and a title here last couple of years.</td></tr>

Al wahda vs Bani Yas, over 3.5 goals @ 2.31

Al Wahda vs Bani Yas has goals written all over it. Al Wahda are strong at home, play attacking football, and rarely slow the tempo, while Bani Yas struggle defensively and concede plenty of chances. Both sides are capable of scoring, and with open play expected, this matchup suits a high-scoring game. Over 3.5 goals at 2.31 looks excellent value in a game that should be fast, aggressive, and full of chances.</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>**POTD Record:** 7-23-3 *Can you believe it, the curse is lifted at last and once again, it&#x27;s the AFCON that does it for us! Some luck finally came my way as Egypt scored first, but they were quickly stunned. The BTTS <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> that I suggested also came through for us. What a day, but now&#x27;s the time to build on this, and two hours later I&#x27;ve identified just the right match to get us over the line. Onwards and upwards, there&#x27;s still a very long way to go if I want to properly recover the good old bankroll*

**Last Five:** ❌❌❌❌✅

**Event:** Serie A, Pisa v Como, 9:00 am EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Pisa Win or Draw +100, 1 unit

**Write Up:** We&#x27;re backing the underdog again in the always unpredictable Serie A *(or rather, the only predictable thing about it is that the matches are going to be dry as hell).* On paper, Como’s league position and recent form make them look stronger, but there are some reasons as to why I think Pisa are getting something out of <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>&#x27;s game. Hear me out.

Firstly, Pisa are very tricky to play against, constantly suffocating the opposing forwards and **grinding out draws at home,** thanks to their physical and well organised defence. The narrative that Pisa are easily beaten ignores how hard they’ve made games tough at their ground. Despite flirting with relegation, they&#x27;ve proven they can absolutely grind out results as they&#x27;ve just earned an impressive 1-1 draw away at Genoa, and **five of their last six away trips have ended in draws or narrow results.** Their ability to keep matches tight makes them a strong <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> against a Como team that isn’t unbeatable. Frankly, I find this team overrated, the media and people genuinely seem to have inflated their value because of the vibes (Fabregas is the manager, they&#x27;ve signed well known semi washed players as well as a wonderkid in Nico Paz, the location is rich and aesthetic etc.) and the &quot;small club making it in the top flight&quot; narrative, even though they&#x27;ve spent crazy amounts of money for their size just to languish in upper midtable and be questionable in a match against Pisa, with all due respect to Pisa (I want them to do well as I&#x27;m backing them).

Yes, Pisa have struggled for goals *(only one scored in nine home league games),* but they’ve often frustrated opponents and forced teams to slow down the tempo. Against a Como side that has been more vulnerable on the road and **missing some key players** (more on that later), Pisa’s organised defence is there to limit chances and raise the likelihood of a draw or narrow win for the hosts. They generally concede fewer high-quality chances than raw tables suggest.

Next up is the H2H that includes several draws and tight contests. Pisa aren&#x27;t a side that would collapse against Como out of all the teams; past meetings have often been close. In the past **3 years, Como have only registered one league win against Pisa,** while two matches ended in a draw.

What also gives Pisa hope ahead of this clash is that Como&#x27;s key man, **Nico Paz is just returning from injury and therefore won&#x27;t be at 100%,** some minute management is also likely. The pacey **Assane Diao is also out,** as is Alvaro Morata, while Jayden Addai remains questionable. The Douvikas-Paz partnership has been fairly fruitful for Como this season and with the latter not being at full strength, Pisa&#x27;s defence shouldn&#x27;t be tested quite as much.

All in all, I think Como have just been punching over their weight class this season and they&#x27;re bound to drop points against a resilient side in Pisa, who will be looking to escape the relegation scrap in front of their diehard fans. The odds of +100 that cover a win and a draw are just too good to ignore here. I also like the BTTS No and the Under 2.5 Goals narrative if you&#x27;re up to some experimentation, *but I&#x27;ve just focused on match results after the Mozambique debacle*. Going with just a unit once again as I&#x27;m saving my bankroll for a huge play on Wednesday. BOL and let&#x27;s get a streak going ☘️🫡</td></tr>

**Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Jordan James 1+ SOT (+125) ❌️

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s Event:** English Premier League (Soccer) | West Ham vs Nottingham Forest (12:00 PM PST)

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Neco Williams 1+ SOT (+240) 1 unit to win 2.4 units

**Write Up:** Tough loss yesterday as James took 3 shots, two of which were very close to finding the target. He also logged an assist instead of shooting inside the box, which was not ideal for us. Still like the read and would play it again, just unfortunate luck this go around. We move on.

A proper relegation battle here as 18th place West Ham host 17th place Forest. Neither of these teams are good, but both desperately need a win here. Forest are 4 points ahead of West Ham in the League, a win for them brings them 7 points clear of the danger zone. Conversely for West Ham, a win here brings them within 1 point of the safe zone. Huge implications at this point in the season, as both teams are losing to every team above them. 

Neco Williams is the 1st choice fullback (plays both left and right) for Forest (and Wales). Yes, I&#x27;m playing another defender in a shot prop. This is another combination of current form and data. Neco has been in great form, landing a SOT in 4 of his last 5 matches including vs Man City who allow the 2nd fewest SOTs in the league. He&#x27;s also had 6 SOTs in his last 7 matches. Coach Dyche has been encouraging him to play further forward and take shots, and I expect that trend to continue here. 

West Ham conversely are the worst defensive team in the league. They have conceded the most SOTs in the EPL this season with 105, 2nd most shots in league with 300 (avg 15 per game), and the most goals with 40. They also look like a team defeated, giving last place Wolves their first win of the season over the weekend 3-0. In that match, they let in 9 SOTs. Interestingly, the entire back 3 for Wolves each got an SOT in that match. Backtracking one more game where West Ham hosted Brighton (who play a similar shape to Forest), West Ham conceded a SOT to each of the two Brighton wingers, including a goal. The point here is that West Ham are weak against fullbacks, that combined with Neco&#x27;s current form and playing further forward in a wingback-type role put this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> on my radar. 

**The odds are high on this for a reason, so mind your units here.** There&#x27;s always risk in these plays as the odds climb, but we&#x27;ve hit a +245 play before here when Woltemade cashed us with 2 SOTs, so they can hit and I love the value this one brings. 

BOL and happy Tuesday!</td></tr>

West ham are a surprisingly great corner generating team, averaging around 6 for them at home, covering in 9/10 home PL games, one miss vs Spurs, where they had a red card around the 50th min. Between them, this line hit last season twice, this season, it hit again in the reverse matchup with 7 for West Ham playing away @ Forest. Forest allow close to 5 on average when playing away as well. Forest have been carded in 9/10 away games this season with west ham at home averaging around 2 cards per game for their opponents.

Last Pick: Wu to win first set vs Marozsan (+110, 1 unit) ✅

Tennis | ATP Hong Kong | 5:00 AM EST (estimated)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Jan-Lennard Struff vs Botic van de Zandschulp | **Struff to win 2-0 at +175. 1 unit.**

Write-up: Jan-Lennard Struff comes into this first-round Hong Kong match in a strong position. He already won two qualifying matches against Zsombor Piros and Nishesh Basavareddy, which means that he should be more accustomed to these conditions than Botic. It was hard to find a streakier player than the German in 2025, but his highs, which included US Open wins over Holger Rune and Frances Tiafoe, were certainly high. One pattern, however, is that the faster the courts are, the better Struff&#x27;s aggressive shot selection and willingness to come to net work out for him. From what I watched of yesterday&#x27;s action, these courts seemed to be extremely quick, with big hitter Cilic scoring an easy win over the crafty Mannarino and most players performing well on serve. 

Meanwhile, I&#x27;m a bit less certain that Botic can take advantage of the conditions. Unlike Struff, he ended last year on a downswing, and it&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve felt as if he was fully committed to a tournament. I don&#x27;t doubt that Botic has the tools to be performing better, and the new year can always inspire fresh motivation, but I don&#x27;t think this is the tournament where he turns things around. In general, his heavy forehand is most effective on slower hard courts, and Indian Wells/Miami in March has historically been when he finds his stride. With that in mind, it&#x27;s hard to ignore Struff&#x27;s preparation advantage and strong qualifying performance to back someone who ended last year on very uncertain terms. 

Keep in mind that I like Struff&#x27;s ML as well if you can get it at -150 or better. This is my personal play simply because the odds are more favorable, and I think there&#x27;s a good chance that Struff can take control early and roll from there. There&#x27;s not really an inherent level gap between these players, so I wouldn&#x27;t feel confident in Struff coming back or outlasting in a third set if Botic does come in strong.</td></tr>

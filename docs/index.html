I am changing my write up as it seems to offend some people. 

I place bets. If you like to place bets you can follow. If you don&#x27;t like to follow, don&#x27;t. 

I hope that is simple enough. I also don&#x27;t do fancy write-ups like everyone else here because I dont have the time. 

IF YOU DON&#x27;T LIKE THAT, DON&#x27;T FOLLOW ME

I also don&#x27;t claim to be perfect or have a perfect model. As you can see from my record I have went on a few cold streaks. 

If you follow one of my picks and blame me for your loss, bad luck will follow you for eternity.

I used this sub thread two years ago to turn $10 into $1k while I was still in school and so thought I would comeback and attempt to return the favor. All my picks will likely be on tennis because that is where I have found the most success. Be warned I am not a professional better I have just used it to pay for my life as I get my university degree. I have made mistakes in terms of staking in the past and so I am reminding you all please do not ever go all in.

Anyways, the model suggests Chang should be priced in at around 1.05 and Anastasia at around 1.22, with not too much tennis at the moment I thought I would combine the legs to get almost even money play.

Since they are both women’s matches I would not recommend taking 2-0 as I have found they are often less consistent and so just simply combine the money lines.

**Write Up:** Been a huge believer in some of our top dogs in <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick of the day</mark>.  I decided I might join the parade.  Playing it safe here with my first <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>.  I believe Indiana covers at -7.5, they are the best team in the country, and they proved it at the Big 10 championship.  Cignetti has the boys playing inspired football; they had a week off to prepare for Bama.  Coaching is going to play a huge factor in this one.  Alabama has been in these moments before and knows what to do when the bright lights are on, but that&#x27;s if Deboar doesn&#x27;t get in their way, which I believe he will. Indiana will come out fast and want to prove they are the best team in the country; they will have their foot on their throats and won&#x27;t let off the gas.  Alabama has no business being in the CFB and was lucky to scrape a win against Oklahoma, who had that game in the bag.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Watford to win @ 2.2 (1 unit)

**Write Up:** Happy new year all I hope everybody had a good night and aren&#x27;t feeling too rough <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>... Let&#x27;s start 2026 with a win shall we?

For <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> we are in the Championship at Vicarage Road as **6th place Watford** face **15th place Birmingham City**. Watford are currently the **most in form team in the league** having **won 4 and drawn 2** of their last 6 games as they continue their quest towards the championship playoffs this season. The Hornets have **won 3 straight league games** for the first time since August of 2024 and have **lost just once in their last 12 games**. Importantly for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>&#x27;s game Watford are great at home sitting pretty as the **3rd best Home team** in the league. They&#x27;ve **won 7 of their 12** games at home this season **losing only 1** to **19th place Blackburn** **rovers** back in September. Away from home they&#x27;ve struggled much more picking up only 3 wins on their travels but they are leaning on their Vicarage Road success to carry them into the playoffs this season. At home Watford are scoring **1.67 goals per game** compared to their 1.17 whilst on their travels. They have conceded a nice **1 goal per game** at home with this rising to 1.42 away to showcase the difference in their home and away form once again. A long term positive trend is also on Watford&#x27;s side <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> as they have **won each of their last six home games against <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>&#x27;s opponents** with an **aggregate score of 12-0** (but personally the past is the past so take it with a pinch of salt). As far as team news goes Watford are doing fine without Doumbia who is away at AFCON and continue to play without forwards Vata and Baah.

As for Birmingham City they are the **2nd worst in form team** in the league at the moment picking up just **3 points from their last 6** games with **3 of those games ending in defeat** for the Blues. They recently beat Watford 2-1 on December 1st and since then have picked up **3 points from an available 18** as they deal with bad injury and suspension problems. Birmingham&#x27;s problems this season have been exclusively on the road as they are the **3rd worst Away team** in the league whilst being the **5th best home team**. On their travels the Blues have **won just the 2 games out of 12**, **losing 8**. In these games they have **scored a low** **8 goals** and **conceded a worrying 20**. This translates to **0.67 scored per game and 1.67 conceded**. When you compare this to their home form you see how much of a difference there is. Birmingham score 2 goals per game at home this season and only concede 0.92 which has led to them losing just the one game at home all season. The fact they are away <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> puts the game massively in Watford&#x27;s favour. As mentioned before **the Blues are without some key players <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>** with both Tommy Doyle and Christoph Klarer being unavailable <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> through suspension. The pair have each featured in nearly all of Birmingham City&#x27;s game this season. Furthermore, star left winger Demarai Gray is likely to be out <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> with a calf injury which is once again damaging to the away team as the forward has **9 goal contributions** this season for them.

This new years day clash is definitely leaning in Watford&#x27;s favour when you combine their impressive home form and even recent form overall with Birmingham City&#x27;s woeful away record and recent struggles. Whilst it won&#x27;t be complete domination from Watford I expect them to start 2026 off strong with a comfortable 1 or 2-0 victory <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> over their bad travelling visitors.

**NHL - Winnipeg @ Toronto, 7 PM EST**

*Toronto ML (-150) 1.5u*

Happy new year everyone, I hope everyone had a good one, I want to extend my love and gratitude to this entire community, I’m new here but I’m thoroughly enjoying the discussion and loving the commitment some folks here have to providing advice and just tracking plays. 

For <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> we genuinely no need or reason to over think it - Had a million plays lined up, CFP lines and props, NBA props, trusty weapons in the soccer bank, but then I checked the NHL schedule:

***“Oh shit, the Jets play again <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>”.***

Quick math: the Jets have **lost 16 of 19, and 7 of their last 10 to the Leafs**

Even though Leafs have struggled this season, they’re getting healthy and have **won 3 of their last 4**, the loss a 3-2 defeat to those red hot Red Wings who beat the Jets in our <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> last night

Now, we don’t wanna go too in depth on back to backs, and travel and all that, because Detroit and Toronto are closer than some cities north and south ends, but with the slump Winnipeg are in, the New Year’s Eve/Day cross border travel (If you’ve done it, you know), after losing a tough one the night before that we benefitted from - follow the adage: ***“Fade The Jets”***

Last play review:

NHL - Winnipeg @ Detroit

Detroit ML (-120) 1u ✅

(Early start by the Wings was all we needed - it was a much more tense game than I anticipated in the end. The Toews/Kane reunion took centre stage, so it was only right it was geriatric at times - *Unpopular opinion: I’m all for pro leagues taking holiday breaks, just saying*)

Wrexham AFC is usually a good bet for at least a goal in most matches they play, and they are coming up against a Blackburn Rovers team who are weak going forward with two goals in their last five fixtures.

Llanelli - Penybont, Over 3.5 goals @ 2.18

Llanelli against Penybont has all the signs of a high-scoring match. **Over 3.5 goals at 2.18** offers solid value. Llanelli like to play open football and often struggle to keep things tight, while Penybont are direct and aggressive going forward. Matches between sides like this tend to open up quickly. Once the first goal goes in, the tempo lifts, spaces appear, and chances come regularly. Four goals looks a realistic expectation here.</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>Last 5 &gt; LWWLL // Profit: €928.55

Watford @ 2.30 - €160.96

Watford are currently the 3rd best home team with a 7-4-1 record, into this match they are coming with a 3 game W streak and in their last 5 home games they have been unbeaten. On the other hand we have a struggling Birmingham who are winless in 6 and are amongst the bottom when it comes to travels. At the moment Birmingham are 2-2-8 on the road and have lost 4 out of their last 5 away games. 

On the H2H side Watford are 7-1-2 in the last 10 games against Birmingham and at home Watford are on a 6 game winning streak against Birmingham. All odds against them and <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> should be a repeat.

Game: Charlton vs Coventry, 3pm GMT

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Coventry to win (1u to win 1.86u on Stake)

Writeup: Coventry are the league leaders, yet their win price is nearly evens. WHY? The market is likely reacting to their 2-0 home loss to Ipswich on Monday and the fact that they haven’t won an away game in December (draws at Preston and Southampton). However, Charlton are in the middle of a deeper crisis. They’ve only won one out of their last nine matches, and also just suffered a heartbreaking 97th minute loss to Portsmouth, which leaves a team mentally drained.

Hence, in my humble opinion, Coventry to win at 1.86u odds is a good value play</td></tr>

Stockport match - They&#x27;ve scored in their last six games, scoring two or more in three of those. Northampton have managed just one clean sheet in their last 12 games

Watford match - These sides met at the start of December, with Birmingham winning 2-1. Birmingham have now conceded in their last 10 consecutive league games, while Watford have scored in their last 14 games.

The odds for over 0.5 in both matches was a little low, so going for the over 1 asian line, which gives money back with 1 goal scored &amp; profit for anything above

Sichuan Blue Whales - Fujian 🏀 China CBA ⌛in 1 hour

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **Fujia** \-13.5 @ 1.70

Sichuan, the home team, is facing a financial crisis. They only have one foreign player (Gorjok Gak), who joined on December 27th. This forces younger players to play. Coach Han Shuo says they&#x27;ve only trained with the new foreign center &quot;once&quot; and are planning to bring in another younger player. They are currently the worst-performing team in the league, with a 0-8 record and a -214 average.

Fujian&#x27;s defense is based on steals and pressure. They like to force their opponents into errors and score easy points in open court. When turnovers become chronic for Sichuan, the game quickly becomes unpredictable. Fujian&#x27;s approach of relying on pressure and steals to score runs is easily converted into direct points. Looking at Sichuan&#x27;s recent losses, double-digit margins have become standard (e.g., 51 points against Beijing, 36 points against Shanghai, 33 points against Ningbo). A -13.5 margin is even below Sichuan&#x27;s average loss margin this season; meaning that even if Sichuan plays its &quot;standard poor game,&quot; this handicap can be easily overcome. Fujian has an elite guard at the helm in Travis Trice, who is both a scoring and assist threat and can organize the team. Sichuan, on the other hand, is forced to rely on its domestic rotation and inconsistent young players. It will be an easy game for Fujian.</td></tr>

BTTS hit at their last H2H on 11/29. Derby County scored in almost all of their matches since September. Middlesbrough didn&#x27;t perform in their last 3 games so they will want to bounce back. They are the better team but I expect an open game with both teams pushing. Middlesbrough should win on paper but Derby County will be at home and as I said they are on an insane scoring run.

Brentford currently ranks among the highest in the league for BTTS at 66% with Tottenham being close behind at 61% while over 60% of both clubs’ matches have ended with over 2.5 goals scored.

Brentford is at home in this matchup where they have scored two or more goals in 67% of their home games.

It’s also personal on New Year’s Day between these two as Tottenham’s Manager, Thomas Frank, once managed at Brentford. He knows the grounds and will look to get the offense rolling as he tries to knock off his former club.

Reason • :
I was overthinking on this game for a under since both team have been defensive lately 
Over and under in team total point seems Like a toss up for me because i can only imagine these playing out 
1. “The  Shootout over game “ Nets fail to stop KD (30+ points again). Shit goes OVER ,Brooklyn plays with high intensity too . Game stays within 4-6 points; late fouling pushes the score over the 225.5 total.  

Number 2. The &quot;No-Big&quot; Scramble  aka Sengun &amp; Adams stay out.  Houston loses its defensive anchor. Nic Claxton dominates the paint for Brooklyn, and Houston relies solely on KD and Reed Sheppard&#x27;s shooting &amp; playmaking and making amen to shoot the ball. 3.The Defensive Grind | Nets&#x27; #1 December defense holds firm. UNDER ( low scoring game ) Brooklyn successfully slows the pace to the bottom 5 in the league. Houston struggles to find rhythm without Sengun&#x27;s post-playmaking. 4. The &quot;Blowout&quot; Cool-down ,Rockets lead by 20 in the 3rd. (UNDER because nets can’t keep up ) KD and the starters sit the 4th quarter. &quot;Garbage time&quot; with bench players usually results in poor shooting and a clock-drain, keeping it under the total. And i was doing my research ,expert bettors feels like Brooklyn nets may cover the spread since Nets in 7 of their last 10 game and 13 of their last 20 games.  

I have to go with Kevin Durant for assists because from a defensive perspective you don’t want Kevin Durant shooting the rock 
So the “Double-Team mindset” will come into play in the nets head cause that’s Kevin Durant 
“Y’all know who he is”. anyway the Nets have been the #1 defense in December. 
Their primary strategy against elite scorers like KD is to force the ball out of their hands. KD is currently being doubled on 27% of his possessions. Being 6&#x27;11&quot;, he easily passes over the trap to open teammates like Reed Sheppard or Alperen Sengun (if active). While everyone expects him to hunt for points (which he will), his veteran experience tells him to play the &quot;right way&quot; when the defense collapses. In his last 5 games, he has cleared this 4.5 line in 4 out of 5 instances, averaging 5.2 assists. 
Alperen Sengun is limited or out, the Rockets will use KD even more as a point-forward to facilitate the offense, rather than just a pure finisher. Houston goes Over 66% of the time on the road, and a close game (which the Nets usually provide lately) leads to late-game scoring bursts.  
Scenario solution 1. Brooklyn blitzes him to get the ball out of his hands, KD doesn&#x27;t force shots ,he passes. With the floor spacers Houston has (Sheppard, Smith Jr.), those passes turn into easy assists. The &quot;Trap&quot; actually helps us here. 

Scenario solution 2. If they don&#x27;t double him, KD will score at will. However, that gravity still pulls defenders in. KD is a high-IQ player; even in single coverage, he averages about 4-5 assists just by playing within the flow of the offense.

Risk factor If the Rockets are up by 25 in the 3rd quarter, KD might sit the entire 4th. He could get stuck at 3 or 4 assists simply because he didn&#x27;t play enough minutes. However, even in a blowout, KD usually gets his numbers early.

**Previous:**  Utah Team Total Rushing Yards Over 207.5 (vs Nebraska) – WINNING!

**Recap:**  It is so satisfying to find weird picks like this one based purely on math and have it come to fruition. Not much else to add.

**New Event:** Championship – Preston North End vs Sheffield Wednesday

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Preston North End -1 Asian Handicap @ 1.80 (Usual 3 units)

Preston North End (PNE) are currently 7^(th) in the table and a single point outside contention for a promotion playoff spot for the Premier League next year. This is a big deal and something the team is most definitely focused on and playing for in this match. A win will place them right in the fight for a top spot.

Their opponents, Sheffield Wednesday (SW), well, not sure where to start other than to say they are in last place in the league with -7 points (yes, less than 0) which is 28 points below the next team. SW are facing a major financial and ownership crisis that has thrown one of England’s oldest clubs into jeopardy. Let me enumerate the ways in bulletpoint fashion:

* **Financial Mismanagement** \-The club has struggled to pay players and staff multiple times throughout 2025 due to cash-flow problems. They missed salary deadlines 5 times which is a breach of English Football League regulations.
* **Sanctions &amp; Points Deductions** \-Because of financial breaches, SW were placed into administration (a formal insolvency process), which resulted in an automatic 12-point deduction. They were also hit with a further 6-point deduction for ongoing breaches.
* **Stadium Issues** \-The North Stand at Hillsborough Stadium was closed after urgent safety work was not carried out, costing the club significant match-day revenue and inconvenience for fans.
* **Transfer &amp; Registration Embargoes** \-Due to unpaid wages and tax debts, the club has been placed under transfer embargoes and registration restrictions, meaning they cannot sign new players freely.
* **Ownership Controversy** \-Thai owner Dejphon Chansiri’s decade in charge saw heavy criticism for overspending early on, then failing to fund the club properly in recent years. He was eventually banned from being involved with any EFL club for three years, and the club is now run by administrators who are trying to sell it.
* **Fan Protests and Morale** \-Fans have been protesting and even boycotting games in frustration over the mismanagement and financial instability under Chansiri’s rule.

Needless to say that PNE should win this match for so many reasons and SW should lose this match for many more reasons. If PNE wins by just one goal we get a refund.</td></tr>

Norton is under this points line in 9/12 games this season, the line has been bumped due to him scoring 15p off 7 FGA and 6 FT. The reasons he managed to get 7 shots and to the foul line is because Brisbane&#x27;s two imports were struggling bad shooting a combined 3/22 from the field, so he had to take over the offense. The poor shooting won&#x27;t happen again, so we can expect his usage to drop, along with the fact that a new import guard is hoping to be active and should steal some minutes and FGA off him.

With Leeds missing Joe Rodon and their last meeting ending 3–3, Liverpool’s attacking edge and home form point toward a likely home win by two or more goals.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Under 51 points, - 114 odds

Write Up: Looking forward to some good college football to end the year, and this game should be just that. These two teams are both in the top 10 for scoring defense. For Oregon, that&#x27;s not too surprising, as the B10 isn&#x27;t a high powered offense type league. But for TTU in the B12, that&#x27;s pretty impressive where everyone scores a lot. I&#x27;m liking the under here because both these teams have solid defense. Neither is particularly elite in the red zone on offense either, so I&#x27;m expecting some of the long drives to end in field goals. 

Full disclosure, both these teams are both also in the top 10 in offense, so this isn&#x27;t a slam dunk <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. TTU can easily score at will in the no defense league of the B12, so I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll find scoring as easy against good defenses like Oregon. Oregon has benefited from a somewhat easy schedule, and the few good defensive teams they&#x27;ve played, their offense wasn&#x27;t as powerful. I think both these offenses will be facing the best defenses (or close to it) either have seen all year, and more than 50 points just seems unlikely to me.

**Event:** EFL Championship, Bristol City v Portsmouth, 10:00 am EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Portsmouth Win or Draw +110, 4 units

**Write Up:** Bristol City are currently eighth in the Championship with 10 wins, six draws and eight defeats in the opening 24 matches. They enjoyed a strong festive period, claiming a 2-0 home victory over Middlesbrough before following it up with a 2-1 away win at WBA on Boxing Day. However, they were unable to extend that run in their final game of 2025, suffering a 2-1 defeat to Millwall. Langstaff’s late strike condemned them to a fourth loss in their last seven away matches, showing **they&#x27;re prone to collapsing late** when under pressure. They now return to Ashton Gate, where they have *lost just once in their previous four home games (W2, D1).* Fear not, though. Portsmouth have gained serious **momentum in their survival push** by taking **eight points from their last four matches.** After beating Blackburn Rovers, they drew with Derby County and QPR before **edging Charlton Athletic in dramatic fashion, with Min-hyeok scoring a 97th-minute winner** (the opposite of what Bristol City tend to do). Despite that positivity, *Pompey remain without an away victory in nine attempts and share the league’s worst away record, scoring just seven goals on the road* and **this is why the line is so inflated,** but all that is needlessly reactionary imho.

Despite Bristol City’s strong league position and home advantage, I still think backing **Portsmouth to win or draw** is the only right thing to do. While City sit inside the top half, their recent performances suggest vulnerability rather than dominance. They failed to build momentum after the festive wins and even at home, they&#x27;ve not been ruthless, **winning two and drawing one of their last four at Ashton Gate, but rarely putting opponents away early.**

Now, let&#x27;s take a look at the teams&#x27; profiles. Crucially, **Portsmouth’s defensive organisation and counter-attacking approach match up well against a Bristol City side** that prefers control and patience in possession. With **Bristol City missing several key options through injuries** (Mayulu, Vitek, McNally, Bird, Sykes and Williams), their ability to break down compact opponents may be limited. That opens the door for Portsmouth to frustrate, slow the tempo, and **exploit transitions or set pieces** (areas where they have been increasingly effective).

Taking into account Portsmouth’s improving form, fighting mentality, and Bristol City’s inconsistency against disciplined sides, this one feels far closer than the odds suggest. A gritty away performance could easily yield a point, and if the game opens up late, Portsmouth are capable of seizing it. For that reason, I&#x27;m going with a cheeky **Portsmouth win or draw**. Feeling a disruptive type of game, not too high scoring, but not super low either, so sprinkling an Under 3.5 match goals sounds good to me, as does a BTTS Yes, but let&#x27;s not make this any more complicated than it needs to be. I went in big on the final day of 2025 so it&#x27;s only appropriate to start the year off with a bang too - dropping 4 units on this banger.

Last pick: Chelsea vs Aston Villa BTTS=yes, 2u @ -143 ✅

**EPL: Liverpool to win against Leeds (Asian Handicap -1.0), 1u @ -110**

We need Liverpool to win by 2 goals or more for this bet to hit, if they win by a margin of one goal then the bet is refunded (void).

I like Liverpool for a number of reasons here, I think they are going to win this game and could make it comfortable:

\- Liverpool have had one more rest day than Leeds: they last played at home against Wolves on Dec 27th and won 2-1 whilst Leeds last played away to Sunderland and drew 1-1 on Dec 28th 

\- These two teams played on 6th Dec at Elland Road (Leeds&#x27; stadium) in a game that Liverpool were leading 2-0 and they dropped the ball to let Leeds back into the game which ended 3-3

\- Key personnel for Liverpool are starting to click as Liverpool find themselves on a 3W streak in the premier league and 4W streak in all competitions: In particular right back Frimpong has returned to the starting line up and got an assist in the last game against Wolves and Florian Wirtz scored his first goal from attacking midfield

\- Leeds are missing key defender Joe Rodon who has been one of the three central defenders who has played in every single premier league game for Leeds this season so Leeds will have to make defensive adjustments

Overall Leeds, despite finding themselves in 16th place, are not in bad form right now (unbeaten in 5 PL games with 3 draws and 2 wins) but they are playing with a shorter turnaround time for their second successive away game. Liverpool are on a nice run at the moment, they are building momentum and have the talent and firepower to win this game 2-0 or greater and that&#x27;s what we are betting on.

I’m loving UC Santa Barbara -4.5 <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.

This is a strong Big West spot where the favorite can actually separate, which matters a lot in this league. UCSB has the edge in guard play, ball security, and half-court execution. When Fullerton can’t speed teams up, their offense stalls which leads to long empty possessions and poor late-clock shots.

This projects as a controlled game where UCSB dictates tempo and consistently wins possessions. Not asking for a blowout, just clean execution over 40 minutes, which Santa Barbara is built to do here.

**Write Up:** Happy Thursday everyone and I hope you all are enjoying New Years festivities. After a day off, we&#x27;re back with EPL action as 9th place Brentford host 13th place Tottenham. All signs point towards this being a high scoring match, and we&#x27;re here for it. 

Richarlison has come into great form over the last few weeks. With 2 goals and 2 assist in his last 4 games. He also had two goals disallowed over the weekend due to offsides, so he has definitely been finding the back of the net. One of these matches was against Brentford a few weeks ago in the reverse fixture that ended 2-0 Tottenham. Richarlison has Tottenhams most goals on the year with 7, their 2nd place Goalscorer is their center back Van de Ven. Goals for Tottenham almost exclusively go through Richarlison. He has looked sharp and the stat sheet has been showing it. Much like our Calvert-Lewin play, this is a play to back an in form striker with great odds. 

Brentford have conceded the 9th most goals this season in the EPL with 24. They&#x27;ve only kept three clean sheets this season, and those were against Wolves, West Ham, and a very early match vs Bournemouth. Put in other words, they&#x27;ve kept one clean sheet in their last 11 matches, and that was against Wolves the worst team in the EPL. I do not expect Brentford to keep Tottenham out, and considering Richarlison&#x27;s form and the fact that he is the team&#x27;s leading scorer, I&#x27;m backing him to find the back of the net in this one.

Bouzas is the more complete and consistent player in this matchup. She has a clear baseline advantage, better rally tolerance, and more reliable shot selection, which is especially important on hard courts.

In United Cup matches, motivation is high and we usually see fewer “let-down” performances from favorites compared to regular tour events.

Bad beat where it appears we were on the right side of the bet but Hood was even better than anyone could have expected. 

Reasoning:

- Odds found at Bodog / Bovada
- Call me crazy but I’m going back. Hood proved in his game that he is capable of racking up these 180’s and in a longer game he will have well over double digits. 
- This is the quarters and with that this is a best of 9 so many more opportunities for either guy to comeback through 180 throws. 
- Gary Anderson has been throwing 180’s EVEN BETTER than Hood has so I’m expecting a ton out of him which should have this game going deep into the sets.

**Sunderland** has been a consistent goal-scoring team at home this season. In **9 matches so far**, they have scored in **all but one game**, totaling **16 goals** (an average of **1.78 goals per match**). Their most recent home games include:

* **3-0 win vs West Ham** – 10 shots, 5 on target, 36.8% possession
* **2-1 win vs Brentford** – 12 shots, 3 on target, 54.4% possession
* **3-2 win vs Bournemouth** – 12 shots, 6 on target, 42.8% possession

Even in draws (Aston Villa 1-1, Everton 1-1, Arsenal 2-2, Leeds 1-1), Sunderland consistently found the net, showing strong offensive consistency despite conceding goals in 4 out of 9 matches.

**Manchester City&#x27;s** away stats also support BTTS. They have scored in **8 of their last 9 away matches**, netting **18 goals** (average **2 goals per match**) and maintaining an attacking presence:

* **5-4 win vs Fulham** – 11 shots, 4 on target, 43% possession
* **3-0 win vs Crystal Palace** – 7 shots, 6 on target, 61.8% possession
* **2-1 win vs Nottingham Forest** – 16 shots, 5 on target, 65.9% possession

City has conceded in **5 of their 9 away matches**, showing vulnerability in defense, especially against high-pressing or counter-attacking teams. Sunderland’s attacking consistency, combined with City’s defensive lapses away, increases the likelihood of both teams scoring.

📊 **Key Numbers:**

* Sunderland: 16 goals in 9 matches, scored in 8 of the last 9
* Manchester City (away): 18 goals in 9 games, scored in 8 of last 9, conceded in 5 of 9
* Sunderland scored in all draws (4/4), City conceded in 5/9 away games

This bet combines Sunderland’s home scoring form and Manchester City’s away attacking efficiency with a higher statistical probability of both teams finding the net.

**HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!**

Hoping to start 2026 off strong with some new year prem games. Loving the value on this line considering the form Leeds have managed to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> up coupled with the fact they played 3 weeks ago in a match that ended 3-3 with Leeds 5 SOT. Now we&#x27;re in the reverse fixture and I&#x27;m expecting a similar performance. Also, with a terrible Wolves side putting up 4 SOT against Liverpool on the Weekend, I find it hard to believe Leeds won&#x27;t follow suit.

Ever since rumour came out that Daniele Farke&#x27;s job was under threat, Leeds haven&#x27;t lost a game. They&#x27;re unbeaten in 5 games (2 W, 3 D) and put up a great late performance against Mancity in a 3-2 Loss. 

**---**

**Leeds&#x27; SOT last 10 games: 6, 8, 4, 5, 5, 4, 5, 3, 2, 5**

* Leeds have hit over 2.5 SOT in 9/10 of their last games. 
* Line has hit for 8 games straight.
* Averaging 4.7 SOT per game (very good considering this includes 3 big 6 teams)
* Dominic Calvert-Lewin has scored for 6 games straight now (our best friend for this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>)

**---**

**Liverpool SOT faced last 10 games: 4, 4, 1, 5, 6, 0, 7, 6, 3, 8**

* Line has hit in 8/10 of their last games
* Averaging 4.4 SOT against per game
* In Liverpool&#x27;s last 5 Home games, this line has hit 4/5.

**---**

**After the 3-3 game between these sides a couple of weeks ago I see Liverpool looking to set things straight but with key players being unavailable, I see a similar story we&#x27;ve seen at Anfield this season. Dominate a section of play - the crowd gets anxious - the opponent gets a run of play - recycle. Liverpool heavy favourites but Leeds wont go down easy.**

Darts, 2026 World Championship 🎯

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Ryan Searle ML vs Johnny Clayton @ 1.73

Ryan Searle has been playing phenomenal darts and hasn’t lost a set yet during this tournament. That’s 14 sets won, 0 lost. Obviously, he played against worst opponents, but he’s been overclassing all of them so far. Expecting he’ll outclass Clayton again <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.

His opponent Clayton has been feeling a little off during this tournament and could be called lucky to even win against Harrysson in his last match. He hasn’t shown the level, form, or consistency of Searle yet. I’m happy we&#x27;re getting good odds and confident in taking Searle ML @ 1.73

BOL!

Edit: Kinda as I said, Clayton hasn’t shown the form or consistency this tournament and it showed again <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Searle wins with 5-2 and guarantees our win ✅</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>POTD Record 15-13 (+2.02u)

Wednesday’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> ❌ - Tampa Bay Lightning 3 way line +115 (1u to win 1.15u)

Thursday’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> - Washington Capitals ML +126 (1u to win 1.26u)

We don’t have any news on Ullmark yet. He was granted a leave of absence starting on Sunday and that’s the last we’ve heard. If he remains on his leave, then it will probably be Leevi Merilainen in goal. He has been abysmal for the Senators. I don’t see a world where the Senators can be favored if he starts.

Regardless of who the Senators goalie is, neither are on the level of Logan Thompson this year and the Capitals are the better team. The Capitals are in a little bit of a slump and they’re on the second half of a back to back, but they are the better team here and I like them at + money, even if we find out Ullmark is back.

Good Luck and Happy New Year</td></tr>

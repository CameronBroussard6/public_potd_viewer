<tr><td class='post'>POTD RECORD: 180-137

Season record: 17-14

Last POTD: __Scottie Barnes O13.5 RA @1.80 1U__ ❌

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: __Anthony Edwards 30+ Points @1.71 (BetMGM) 1.2U__

NBA | Timberwolves v Nuggets | 🏀  

Ends with 12 RA, would play Barnes in that matchup everytime so no regrets. We move

Merry Christmas to everyone, wishing a blessed day full of blessings. What better way to celebrate Christmas than to have some NBA action on this special day. Antman immediately stands out to me in this somewhat of a rival matchup and especially on this day. This’ll be his 2nd Christmas Day game in his career scoring 26 in his first one against the Mavs last year and im expecting a motivated Edwards here.

And here’s what Ant said himself: “

_It’s gonna be a night,” Edwards told Shams Charania of ESPN. “I’m gonna have 30 (points), for sure. I might have 40. But it’s gonna be a night.”_

I mean hard not to back Ant with this statement right? 

I’m definitely sold on Ant chucking in this one, with only 20+ FGA, Edwards is over in 10/14 games with five 40-point performances in that span. 

Despite only going over in 2/L5 reg season games against the Nuggets (two hooks on 29), the volume has been top tier having 22+ FGA in all those games.

Backing this Ant narrative play and im hoping he’s efficient, confident he’ll get his shots up just about making them.

Would play this up to 31.5.</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>POTD Record: 158-105 | Profit: +113.12u | ROI: 14.8%

Season Record: 18-9 | Profit: +25.86u | ROI: 29.1%

 

Last Pick: Toronto Raptors vs Miami Heat -4.0 @ 1.91. 3U. ❌

Just a really bad game for the Heat, none of their starters shot even 50%, and as a team they shot just 26% from 3.  Anyways, we move on because we have an amazing slate of games for Christmas Day.

 

Next <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **San Antonio Spurs +9.5 vs OKC Thunder @ 1.91**. 3U play.

It’s not every day you bet on a near double digit underdog to cover the spread, but this line feels disrespectful and not supported by form. The Spurs are at full strength, with Wemby having ramped his minutes up, and have multiple guys playing very well recently (Castle, Vassell, Keldon, Kornet etc.) and I won’t be surprised to see Fox and Wemby go berserk on this nationally broadcast game. The Spurs have literally beaten OKC straight-up twice in the past 11 days, and have won 9 of their last 10 games. OKC are the best team in the league and favorites for the title for a reason, but this line requires nearly everything to go perfectly for OKC and I think this young, energized Spurs team will bring it against OKC. Even if OKC win I think the game stays close.</td></tr>

<tr><td class='post'>**Record 6-4** (+3.94 Units)

Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: De’Von Achane 120+ yards Rush and Receiving +100 2U X

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** **Cowboys -2.5** and **Lions -2.5** **(-139) 5U**

Two games against two eliminated teams starting two terrible back-up quarterbacks.

Leg 1: Tale of two sucky defenses which would have made for a surefire shootout if either Jayden Daniels or Mariota were playing. Instead the commanders, injured beyond the pale, are forced to go with their third string veteran bench warmer QB Josh Johnson who, until last week, threw a sum total of 3 receptions since 2021. When he came in for the injured Mariota against the Eagles, he went 5/9 for 43 yards and an INT earning him a QBR of 5 (no like that’s an actual score a QB can get). It’s the Cowboys, so he may get in a decent drive or two – but given that Dallas is likely to put up 30+ against one of the worst defenses in the league save the Bengals, -2.5 should not be an issue.  

Leg 2: A must win for the Lions after a devasting loss where they had two game-winning TD’s overturned by OPI in the final 20 secs. They are now on the brink of missing the playoffs and need to win out. They come in banged up (Amon St. Brown nursing a knee injury, o-line and secondary bleeding) but still have Goff and Gibbs in an indoor stadium. What seals this game for me is Max Brosmer under center. Brosmer has been awful in the limited action he’s seen – avg 3.3, 5.8, 4.2 yards/attempt in garbage time. The only game he started was against Seattle where he threw 4 interceptions, was sacked 4 times, and earned a pathetic QBR of 5 (no like that’s an actual score a QB can get) on way to a 0-26 blowout loss (first shutout for Seattle since 2010 and first time Vikings failed to score in a game since 2007). So yea, He’s epochally bad. There is simply no way he is keeping up with a Lions team desperate to make the playoffs.

**Cowboys -2.5** and **Lions -2.5** **(-139) 5U** – BOL of Tailing!</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>**Record**: 20-11

**Net Units**: +8.01

**Last Pick**: Phillip Rivers 170+ passing yards (+120 on DK) 1u to win 1.2u ✅️

**Todays Event** 🏈 NFL 🎄Christmas🎄 Thursday  Football  @  12 PM CST 🏈 

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Todays Pick</mark>** Javonte Williams o73.5 rushing yards (-113 on DK) 1u to win 0.88u

**Writeup:** Cowboys face Commanders for a classic no stakes matter holiday beatup. Javonte Williams has been taken off the injury report for neck problems so it&#x27;s his time to shine.

Javonte is averaging 15.9 rushing attempts a game with 76.5 averaging rushing yards, for an average of around 4.8 YPC, with the Commanders defense allowing that exact YPC

Commanders have been awful, one of if not the worst rush defenses as of lately. Np wonder they are ranked 29th. Saquon rushed for 132 last week. Tyrone Tracy Jr for 70 two weeks ago. Aaron Jones for 76, held RJ Harvey to 35 but got destroyed by Achane and Gibbs the weeks prior. In the past 6 weeks, the RB1s average 95.8 rushing yards against the commies.

Cowboys are heavily favored to win this despite being on the road against a divisional opponent and having a bad defense Their line sits at a whopping -8.5, Vegas clearly expects a spanking here. Mariota is out putting in third stringer Josh Johnson who&#x27;s passing line sits at 178.5 despite going against such a mediocre defense.

This game should be over after the first half. Commanders season has been done for awhile, expect lots of rushing and more than likely boring Football. 

BOL everyone tailing, may those bets be cahsed to spend on some christmas/new year shenanigans, and be sure to spend some time with friends and family if you can!</td></tr>

Reasoning: game about to start in less than 2 hours. Im hoping for my 20th win. I would have pass for todays game but knowing my self i will just waste money on something. So as to discipline my self i better post and be tracked.. both players is really not impressive thats why the odds is just even but i think soha recent losses is a loss to real players also saw more early exits from sawant.. u follow ur units. Thread carefully and dont put anything big on this one..

Event: Panserraikos vs Levadiakos @ 11:00am (EST)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Levadiakos -1 = 1.09u at -109

Write up: Levadiakos has been playing solid, while Panserraikos has been struggling. This <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> mainly comes down to the consistency Levadiakos has been showing in league matches. Panserraikos has also ben consistent, but consistently showing bad form. Both teams don&#x27;t play for another 2 weeks after this which means each squad should be full strength. Levadiakos should dominate, the goal count is the only real question. I line this around -1.5, so when I saw the -1 spread, I had to make the play. 

Overall: I am extremely sharp in UFC, and recently over the past few months have been studying soccer, which has ben proving profitable so I figured I would start this up. If you have any questions, feel free to dm me or reply to this and I will be more than willing to chat. 

All plays will be to win a unit, so whatever the unit amount I risk, it will almost always be to win 1u. For people tracking picks, when you consistently bet 5u on a play, you should probably just increase your unit size. Ex: If my units are $1,000 but I am consistently betting 5u ($5,000), you should just increase a unit to $5,000. My unit size may increase, but I will almost always only be tipping a play to win 1u.

Odds: +105 on FanDuel
Wager: 1.5 Units

Record: 6-9
Net Units: -7 Units

Explanation: Napoli can beat Bologna on Monday in the Supercoppa final because over the league season and in this tournament’s semifinal, they’ve shown the more repeatable winning traits: chance control, defensive solidity, and higher-end match winners. 

In Serie A this season, Napoli has been operating at a top-of-the-table level (2nd on 31 points through 14 matches at 10-1-3), while Bologna have been very good but a tier lower overall (6th on 25 points at 7-4-4).   That gap matters in a one-off final because it reflects how often Napoli can impose a typical game script: steady territory, fewer mistakes, and fewer big chances conceded, and then let their attackers decide it, and we just saw that exact pattern in their 2–0 win over AC Milan, where Napoli struck through a high quality transition and a composed finish, then managed the match for the win.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Fulham v Nottingham Forest - BTTS &amp; O2.5 ( +130 on BetMGM, +125 on DraftKings &amp; Caesars) 

Write Up: Back again with my very sporadic picks. But I’m riding the trends I’m seeing. Fulham are at home and have been scoring plenty this year. They’ve got a goal in their last 7/8, and have conceded in their last 6/8. BTTS &amp; O2.5 has hit 5 in a row. Nottingham Forest have had quite a season, but they’ve had some impressive performances since Dyche has taken over, including a 3-0 win away at Liverpool. Forrest is a bit more of a wildcard in this bet though. They’ve seen O2.5 in their last 6/8, but BTTS has only happened in 2/8. Head-to-head, Forrest has allowed a goal in the last 7 meetings between the clubs. O2.5 has hit in 4/5. I think Forrest are finding their footing now with their newer manager, coming off a week’s rest after a 3-0 win against Spurs. I don’t think they go all game without a score.

Villa did as expected, not much else to say.

**Event**: English Premier League: Fulham vs. Nottingham Forest 12:00pm PST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>**: BTTS-YES (-134) 1u

**Write up**:

Fulham have had BTTS hit in 5/5 of their last games, hitting in 12/20 matches overall this season. On average in the Prem this season Fulham score 1.44 goals per match and allow 1.62 goals per match. I have no doubt Fulham can score at home as they&#x27;ve done so in 9/10 home matches across all competitions this season, and with the absence of Bassey and Iwobi I can see their backline not looking great. Fulham have allowed the opposition to score in 5/10 games at home WITH these key players. In the 5 games the opposition did not score at Fulham, they played against Bristol City in the EFL cup, Leeds before they found form this season, Cambridge in the EFL cup, Wolves (worst team in every top division in Europe), and Sunderland (a team not known for scoring many goals). Basically meaning the 5 home games this season they kept clean sheets were all against poor teams, excluding Sunderland.

Forrest on the other hand are very 50/50 in their matches with BTTS only hitting in 1/5 of their last games across all competitions. With that being said, Forest score on average 1.06 goals per game in the Prem and allow 1.56, so against a weakened Fulham I believe they can nab a goal at some point: especially given they just bagged 3 against Spurs. Forest are a team that really hates to find any kind of form: they lost 0-2 to Brighton, beat Wolves away 0-1, lost to Everton away 3-0, beat Utrecht 1-2 in the Europa League, and beat Spurs 3-0. Although most of their scorelines this season are 2-0/3-0 for them or their opposition, I truly do believe Fulhams absence of players can give Forest some opening at some point.

I&#x27;ll be completely honest and upfront, this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> comes much more from gut feeling than anything else. The stats don&#x27;t *really* show that BTTS will hit but given Fulhams superb ability to score at home along with their weakened backline against a Forest team who just bagged 3 against Spurs I can certainly see it happening. While I don&#x27;t consider previous matches as I am a firm believer that they do not reflect current games, BTTS has hit in 3/5 of these teams last matches against each other. I don&#x27;t really like most of the games for Monday and can&#x27;t seem to find superb value anywhere, that is reflected in the 1u bet. If you are a consistent tailer of my picks be warned to only bet the 1u unless you have another reason to believe this is a solid <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>.

Writeup: Brutal loss, the Steelers missing the field goal at the end of the game screwed us as the Lions were no longer able to force OT.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: 🏈 George Kittle over 66.5 receiving yards (-114).

Game starts at 8:15pm EST. Bet 3.25u

Writeup: For Monday Night Football, we have the Indianapolis Colts hosting the San Francisco 49ers. We’ll be focusing on the tight end for the Niners, who’s been an incredibly consistent focal point for this offense.

Kittle has shown remarkable consistency this season, having surpassed the 66.5 receiving yards mark in 5 straight games along with others. As the primary target in the San Francisco offense, he benefits from being utilized in various ways, including short routes, deep passes, and red-zone targets. He’s had a 25% target share in 4 straight games, and I expect a similar number against a Colts defense who’s poor against tight ends. Notably, they have allowed a lot of yards in the middle of the field where Kittle typically operates. With both teams eyeing crucial playoff positioning, the game is expected to be competitive, meaning Kittle may see increased targets as the 49ers seek to establish their offensive rhythm. Kittle has been getting around 75 receiving yards in each game that Purdy has started this season, and I expect a similar number in this one.

With the stakes high in Week 16, both teams will likely stick to simply exploiting weaknesses of the other team. Kittle’s ability to find soft spots in the Colts’ coverage can lead to big plays, especially if the 49ers utilize play-action effectively. Additionally, injuries in the receiving core could lead to an increase in Kittle&#x27;s target share, further boosting his yardage potential.

**Write Up:** Back in the green as Villa take care of business. Was a bit sweaty as both teams missed chances and gave up possession cheaply, but Villa come through for us either way. 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> we head to London for a bottom table battle as 15th place Fulham host 17th place Nottingham Forest. I actually really like props for both of these teams, despite their underperforming this season as a whole. They both concede a lot of corners and allow a lot of shots. Both of these teams have won 3 and lost 2 of their last 5 and are pretty evenly matched, I could see this match going either way. That said, I&#x27;m leaning a bit more on Forest due to recent form.

Milenkovic, aka the Serbinator, is one of Forest&#x27;s two big center backs. I&#x27;d argue their the best duo in the league. The 6&#x27;5&quot; tall Serb will be the tallest (non keeper) on the pitch <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. He is Forest&#x27;s main target for all things set piece and corner kicks, and this seems like a match where Forest will prioritize set pieces if they want to take anything from this tough away match. Keep in mind, **this is one SHOT, not shot on target**. While I like that too, the odds are way higher. All we need for this to cash is for the Serbinator to get his head on one ball aimed in the general direction of goal. 

These plays require patience, as we will only get a handful of chances for our guy to come forward, being a central defender and all. But I love the odds for this, as he has taken 4 shots in his last 4 games and will continue to be the main set piece target with Wood out. BOL and have a great Monday!</td></tr>

Big game for both teams, but the Colts are really on life support. With their schedule and their grandpa QB, they really are not likely to make the playoffs and I have to imagine some players on the team know that.

The 49ers on the other hand need could really use a win here to solidify a playoff sport, with their last 2 games being pretty challenging. They are the better team here and they should get it done.

In the 49ers 10 wins this season, 8 of them have a McCaffrey TD in it. Of course he can get this done on the ground or through the air and he has 14 total TDs this season in 14 games.

ATHL BILBAO VS ESPANYOL

Date: 22 DECEMBER 2025 at 21:00

BET ON: Over / Under team corners- ATHL BILBAO Over +5.50

Odd: 1.83



\- Athletic Bilbao over 5.5 corners is well supported by the game context and tactical setup. Valverde’s side come into this match highly motivated, knowing a home win keeps them close to the European places before a difficult run of away fixtures, something the coach has stressed in recent press conferences as a “key moment” of the season. With a patched-up defense due to multiple injuries and suspensions (Laporte, Vivian, Berchiche, Prados), Athletic are expected to compensate by pushing higher and controlling territory rather than sitting deep. Their attacking structure naturally generates corners: heavy wing play through Nico and Iñaki Williams, Berenguer, and overlapping full-backs, plus frequent switches of play against compact defenses. Espanyol, despite good form, are pragmatic away and happy to defend low with narrow lines, inviting pressure and crosses. This combination — Bilbao’s urgency, wing-oriented attack, and Espanyol’s low-block approach — strongly points toward sustained home pressure and a steady accumulation of Athletic corners, making over 5.5 a convincing angle.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Mo Salah to have 1.5 SOT v Zimbabwe

Odds: 1.83x (Bet365)
Units: 2 units (Remember always follow our units) 

Well, we’ve got to a point where we betting on AFCON and I don’t mind it at all. We was originally going to wait to see trends etc on goals. But this is too good to say no to. 

I’ll start this by saying I’m a massive Liverpool fan and have watched Mo Salah week in week out for the last 7 years and there is nothing this man loves more than a stat pad against a shit team and he needs it now more than ever, with all the talk going on his motivation will be through the roof. If there’s one thing I will say about Mo it’s that he is one of the finest competitors on the planet, he hates losing and he hates not playing even more, I think he’s going to be going into this Afcon with fire in his belly looking to bring Egypt the Afcon, all that said let’s look at some facts.

Mo salah averaged 1.77 SOT in the qualifying for Egypt and he didn’t even play 90 minutes in some of these games. He should definitely play 90 now, after being benched for Liverpool, in his first and only game back against Brighton he came on played 64 minutes and had 3 shots including a SOT. He’s hungry now, and what is better than playing against a RB who plays in the south african league and is definitely going to be on ice skates all game. A literal bum who is equalivant of 3rd division in england. 

This is the juicy part, Mo Salah is going to take every single free kick and penalty’s as usual. He has averaged 0.84 SOT on target in the prem while being shit too, and 1.43 in the champions league. Surely he is going to do this against a team who are ranked 129th in the world.
 
We really like this because of the revenge he wants, he’s got a couple of weeks now to be in AFCON and I could see him ball out in this whole tournament. There is a reason his odds are 1.44 for a goal or assist, and it’s because it is Mo Salah. Only negative, there isn’t a lot of stats to back this up from AFCON just because it is out of budget lmao. But Mo salah against a fella called Divine Lunga? If you’ve heard of him, I’ll personally take this reddit post down. (not actually cus we prefer to win money here)  
1.83x for Salah to have 2 shots on target is mental, and I see this done in 60 or less. Egypt will dominate and most of their play should work through Salah as Egypt don’t have many big players and they usually play around Mo, who thrives when he is the teams star (just look at Liverpool last season). We have only put two units on this based on there is no stats backing this up as of now, but it is a prediction and the odds are high because it is the first game. See this be the same odds next game for Egypt for 3+ SOT. 

Salah is well rested and well motivated and should be coming into this tournament with a revenge mindset, as mentioned there’s not many stats surrounding African football so tail with caution but we’re pretty confident this should come flying in. As always BOL!</td></tr>

Well it says here on their website that it’s the largest platform for table tennis development in Ukraine.

There’s no progression to a knockout, just a session winner where you can gain/lose ELO depending on how you perform. Osadychi is the favourite heading into this match and has cleared the line in his last 9/10 matches in this competition (90%). Meanwhile, Voinarovskyi has covered the under in his last 8/9 matches (89%). When looking at their H2H, 6/8 of their matches (75%) have featured under 76 points which is always a welcome addition.

Todays <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: **Athletic Bilbao v Espanyol: Espanyol DC + u4.5 goals @2.06**

Previous bet: Spurs got a silly red card, otherwise I think the game would have been 2-2 or even 3-3, but Spurs even after the second red kept pushing.

Espanyol come into this in strong form and look well positioned to avoid defeat. Athletic Club continue to struggle in front of goal, averaging just 0.4 goals per game despite decent xG numbers, which points to poor finishing rather than bad luck. Espanyol, meanwhile, are defensively solid, conceding only 0.4 goals per game and matching the league-average clean-sheet rate.

The model gives Espanyol a 31% chance to win, compared to just 19.5% implied by the bookmaker, making the away side clearly undervalued. When combined with the draw, the double-chance market offers strong protection and positive expected value.

In terms of goals, both teams average 1.4 total goals per game combined, with neither side showing a tendency for high-scoring matches. Athletic’s low scoring rate and Espanyol’s compact defence significantly reduce the risk of a goal explosion, making under 4.5 goals a very safe ceiling in this matchup.

Just to confirm, this will be Espanyol or draw and under 4.5 total goals in the match.</td></tr>

Loving the Monday prem recently and we’re running with Fulham vs Nottm Forest <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>

As an Arsenal fan, Smith Rowe has a place in my heart, but trust me when it comes to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>&#x27;s analysis, focus is on nothing but less risk, more profit.

Smith Rowe has been in fine form recently,  scoring 2 goals in his last 5 games. What we&#x27;re interested in is that he&#x27;s gotten over 0.5 SOT for 4 games straight and when you couple that with the likes of Iwobi and Chukwueze not available due to AFCON, this is where Smith Rowe gets his run of starts to shine. While those players are away, it&#x27;s good to keep an eye on his performances.

__Write Up:__ The San Francisco 49ers (10-4) travel to Indianapolis to take on the Colts (8-6) at Lucas Oil Stadium on Monday Night Football. The 49ers are coming in hot, having won 4 straight games all by double digits. They stand at 3rd in the NFC West, 1.5 games behind Seattle for the top spot. They currently own the 6th seed in the NFC playoff picture. Despite dealing with an endless amount of injuries, San Fran has a 98% chance to make the playoffs with a clear path to a 1st round bye. After Seattle beat the Rams on Thursday night, the 49ers can take the NFC&#x27;s #1 seed by winning their last 3 games. The Colts have also dealt with their fair share of injuries, but theirs have been a tad more detrimental. Colts QB Daniel Jones tore his ACL in Week 14 &amp; is out for the season. They were forced to turn to 44 year old Phillip Rivers who came out of retirement last week after coaching high school football &amp; made his first start since 2020. They somehow managed to only lose to the 12-3 Seahawks by 2 points. The Colts have now lost 4 games in a row since their Week 11 bye, going from AFC South front-runners to a team on the playoff bubble. They likely will need to win out just for a shot at the playoffs. That all falls on the shoulders of one of the best runnings backs in the league, Colts RB Jonathan Taylor.

Jonathon Taylor is the league leader in rushing yards &amp; TD’s this season, averaging 103 yards per game with 16 TD’s. He’s averaging 5.3 yards per carry, while also leading the NFL in Yards After Contact (1,060). He leads the league in EPA (21.48), resulting in the Colts ranking 1st in EPA as a rushing offense (19.5). JT has faced the toughest Strength of Schedule among RB’s in the past month. __In their last 3 games JT &amp; the Colts have faced 4 of the top 4 NFL run defenses in rushing yards allowed (starting with most recent): Seattle #4 (93.7 ypg), Jacksonville #1 (86.3), &amp; Houston #3 (92.7). Despite the brutal schedule JT averaged 23.6 carries for 82 yards. Only 3 opponents in the bottom 10 of run efficiency (Chargers 23rd, ATL 24th, Cardinals 25th). He averaged 153 rushing yards against those 3 teams. The 49ers rank 26th.__ Last week with 44 year old Rivers in his first start at QB, the Colts game plan was simple, feed Taylor the rock. JT had his second most carries all season with 25, going for 87 yards. He finally gets a breather this week vs a 49ers run defense that hasn’t been able to stop the run lately. San Francisco has suffered some brutal injuries on defense. They lost All Pro Defensive Captains Joey Bosa &amp; Fred Warner, as well as Rookie 1st round defensive lineman Mykel Williams. __With Mykel Williams on the field the 49ers allowed 3.99 yards per carry allowed &amp; a 45.2% success rate. Without Mykel Williams, the 49ers are last in success rate against RB runs (49.4%), allowing 5.0 yards per carry (29th) &amp; a run of 10+ yards on 11.3% of those attempts (23rd). They have allowed a first down or touchdown on 28% of those runs (31st). That’s music to JT’s ears who has a 9.56% explosive rate (3rd amongst RB’s with 200+ carries) &amp; has a 45.59% success (2nd among RB’s 200+ carries). San Francisco has allowed 130 total yards per game to RB’s over their past 5 games, &amp; that includes bad offenses in the Cardinals, Titans, &amp; Browns.__ In the past 2 weeks, they allowed 91 rushing yards to Quinshon Judkins (his 3rd highest this season) &amp; 104 yards on the ground to Tony Pollard last week (his 2nd highest this season). Both of those teams are in the bottom 4 in rushing yards per game. The Colts offensive line has been elite, allowing the Colts to gain 2.51 yards before contact (5th). The 49ers have allowed 2.02 ybc (22nd). 49ers coach is likely to stack the box vs a Colts offense with clear intentions of feeding JT. SF allows 3.61 ypc when stacking box (21st). The Colts average 4.77 ypc vs a stacked box (3rd). Not only do the Colts have an elite run game on offense, they also are elite at stopping the run.

The Colts have one of the best run defenses in the league, which has forced opponents to pass on them. __Opposing offenses run on just 38.86% of plays facing the Colts, 4th fewest in the NFL. They have allowed a league low 3.7 yards per carry this year, with teams averaging just 95.1 rushing yards per game. However, through the air teams have thrown for the 2nd most passing yards per game against them, averaging 247.6 per game.__ On the year, the 49ers are 4th in the NFL in passing averaging 246.1 yards per game. But they rank just 25th in rushing, with just 101.4 yards per game on the ground. Their focus will be to move the ball through the air this week. 49ers QB Brock Purdy came back from injury a month ago &amp; has had a +70% completion rate in 3 of the 4 games. Purdy had his best performance of the season last week, going 23/30 (76.7%) for 295 yards (9.8 Y/A) with 3 TD’s &amp; no INT’s against the Titans. His first 4 games back he has peppering his favorite pass catcher, Tight End George Kittle. Kittle caught 8 of 9 targets for 88 yards &amp; a TD on Sunday. __Since Week 8, Kittle has secured 41 of 48 (85.4%) targets. Kittle has a target share of 25% or more in 4 straight games, exceeding 67 receiving yards 5 games in a row. In his 4 games with Purdy he is averaging 8 targets &amp; 75 yards per game.__ Now he faces a defense that has had major issues stopping opposing TE’s all season. The Colts have given up 5th most tight end targets (8.64), the 5th most receiving yards to TE’s (66.29), &amp; allow 10.79 yards per catch. They&#x27;re also ranked #22 in DVOA against TEs this season. 49ers WR Ricky Pearsall is out this week as well. The Colts will stop the run, forcing Purdy to pass. He’s going to find his favorite guy multiple times this week.

JT should have 100+ rushing yards. Kittle should have 80+ receiving yards. I love both of their props separately, but I’ll gladly take them both with a little discount.

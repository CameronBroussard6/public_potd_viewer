Last 5: WWWWW League: Modus super series: George Killington - Steve Green

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: George Killington -1.5 handicap @ 1.91. 1u. Starts in approx 4 hours

Final day of the modus super series week 1. Out of the 6 players that will play <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, Steve Green is the worst player. Steve Green averaged 81.61 in 10 matches with a checkout percentage of 34.78%. Killington won group A with an average of 87.14 and a checkout percentage of 33.75% in 15 matches. Killington should have no problem beating Green and covering this handicap for us. It is a short format, only going to 4 legs, so only betting 1u.

Last Pick: Mist ML ✅️ || 1.0u at -128 || Mist at Rose || 3v3 Unrivaled Basketball

Mist took care of business and started the game fast taking a 15-3 lead. The team never looked back and shot effectively, posting a season high 57.6% FG shooting percent. Final score 89-71

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Laces -7.5 points || 1.0u at -113 on FD || Hive at Laces || 3v3 Unrivaled Basketball 8:45pm ET

Tonight&#x27;s action features two struggling sides Hive (1-4) vs Laces and Lunar Owls (1-4) vs Breeze. Neither ML odds are in range for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> so I&#x27;m looking to the spread. Breeze have -6.5 point spread against a Lunar Owl side that is coming off their first win with Diggins returning from injury. Laces have -7.5 point spread and I think is the better play. 

Hive average the lowest PPG at 64.2 and in their 4 losses, they have lost by 16, 11, 23, and 12. This team leads Unrivaled in blocks per game but otherwise there isn&#x27;t much to show for defensively. Opponents have 3rd best eFG% at 53.81% and 2nd highest PPG at 76.0. 

Laces come into this game averaging 3rd best 73.8 PPG and 2nd best eFG% at 55.0%. On paper, this offense matches up well against Hive. Laces generate 2nd most assists per game (13.0) and 2nd highest assist shot rate (47.79%). Laces are also tied for lowest opponent blocks per game at 1.80. Hive allow opponents 3rd highest APG (13.2) and 3rd highest assist shot rate (47.14%). Laces are middle of the pack defensively but do limit opponents to 67.6 PPG. If their offense gets into rhythm, Laces are nicely positioned to cover against a struggling Hive squad. BOL</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: **Wofford ML (+125 FanDuel) 1U**

Event: CBB | Mercer @ Wofford (11:00 am EST) | 

*Recap: Mercyhurst trailed by one at the half, but their ability to cover on the road showed through in the end. If you don&#x27;t like betting on middle-of-the-Northeastern Conference table 1 p.m.-on-a-Friday games, you don&#x27;t like pod racing.*

For the five people that will see this before tip-off....

I had a nice two-unit win betting the spread *with* Mercer three days ago. Here&#x27;s why I&#x27;m taking moneyline *against* them <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Mercer is 5-24 all time at Wofford, including 0-5 the last five trips to the Terrier Dome. Last season, the Bears lost by 20 at Wofford. This is a one-possession spread (2.5) between a pair of 13-7 teams. My thesis is that the best team in the nation ATS is going to struggle where they have always struggled - Spartanburg, SC. In fact, Mercer is 2-8 over its last 10 games at Wofford. These teams already played on Jan. 10, and Mercer took it, 109-97. But they needed an absolute outlier of a shooting night - 63 percent from the floor when they normally shoot 46 percent - to get there, and I don&#x27;t think they can do it again with the adjustments Wofford will undoubtedly make. For starters, Wofford will not put Mercer on the line like they did in the first matchup, where the Bears converted 27 of 31 trips to the charity stripe. For context, Wofford made 10 fewer free throws. The final margin? Just 12 points. It&#x27;s clear why the line is what it is <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. That&#x27;s why I think there&#x27;s real value in taking the moneyline at +125. Wofford has won six of its last eight, and the Terriers are 7-2 at home while Mercer is 2-4 on the road.

Good luck and Godspeed!

&gt;**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Team Scoffin ML @ 2.4

&gt;Team Scoffin are up against Team Kaufman tonight. Team Scoffin actually looked pretty good in their first match, despite the lop-sided result against the tournament favourite, Team Einarson. Horvey in particular was really good with her guard placement. This is a team that prefers to play an open style but we&#x27;re forced into a more precise game in draw one due to their competition and the score. They should be able to peel and simplify the game against Team Kaufman. Team Kaufman, on the other hand, did not look good in their loss against Team Armstrong last night. They struggled quite a bit with guard placement and anytime they needed to play a raise. Kaufman doesn&#x27;t have a great runback game which will hurt the team at this event. Skauge also has a weak takeout game. We&#x27;ve got great value on Team Scoffin tonight.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark> - English Premier League - West Ham v Sunderland - both teams to score -135 (1 unit to win 1.74) - 1U

West Ham haven’t kept a clean sheet in 20 matches. They’re struggling at the bottom of the table. Nuno Espírito Santo is a great manager and starting to get some results from squad. They have 2 wins in their last 3 matches but more importantly, 5 goals in those 3 matches. 

They’re up against a better Sunderland squad who could actually move in to the top 4 at least temporarily with a win <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Sunderland do have a solid defense, but don’t manage to keep a clean sheet as often as their goals allow would suggest (2 clean sheets in last 15 matches). They’re also without Xhaka in the middle of the field. He’s the captain and heartbeat of the team. They’ll miss his presence on the field. 

I think Sunderland still gets the win, but I don’t think they’re doing it with a clean sheet.

Reasoning: The Canadians are the fifth worst team in the league in allowing assists at 5.8 per game, and fourth worst in allowing them to right-wingers (Pastrnak&#x27;s position) at 1.5 per game. This season, Pastrnak has an assist in 14/23 home games, and seven of the last ten games overall.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Todays Pick</mark>: NCAA 1U Mercer -1.5(-118) @ Wofford
11AM Est Time

Mercer was able to beat Wofford by 12 points just two weeks ago. This one will be on the road so it will be even harder but I do think they are the better team. 

Mercer is in good form winning against the spread in 7 straight games. Also scoring nearly 86 PPG. Wofford has not been as hot and is 2-2 in the last four games. (Both against the spread and straight up) 
 
In close games teams look to put the ball in the hands of their top scorers. In this case Okojie(Mercer) and Holmes(Wofford). Difference between the two? Okojie is an 83% ft shooter while Holmes is 70%. If this is a close game decided at the line, Mercer is who you want to side with. 

Lastly, Mercers interior defense has stepped up big time on the road and is ranked 87th for points in the paint allowed.

City might be going through it right now… but this is the exact kind of game where they snap back into form and remind everyone who they are. 🔥

Wolves have looked better recently, but stopping City’s front line for 90 minutes is a different type of task. City has scored 2+ goals in 7 of their last 8 vs Wolves, that’s way too consistent to ignore.

**(EPL) Fulham - Brighton, 10 AM ET, Peacock**

***Both Teams to Score (-155) 1.5u***

After a couple losses, and a couple days off, I got 3 plays in 3 days warmed up for the masses. This new job is making it almost impossible to contribute to the community with any sort of genuine research, as is evidenced by my last two picks being rushed. 

*I emphasis to all of you guys who are new here tracking*: **DON’T RUSH A <mark style='background:#fff59d'>PICK</mark>,** ***JUST TO RUSH A <mark style='background:#fff59d'>PICK</mark>.***

So, without further ado, a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> with the bare minimal research: Fulham hosts Brighton in the Premier League, and we think both teams will find the back of the net.

**Fulham have had both teams score in 4/5 and 9/13, meanwhile Brighton have done the same in 5/6. H2H they’ve both scored 3 in a row and 4/5, including a 1-1 draw earlier this season**.

The parity of the Premier League makes this an intriguing one: it’s 11th vs 12th, but both teams could finish the day as high as 6th in a European place. **I expect both teams to go for it.**

**Brighton have scored twice in 3 of their last 6 away games**, showing a purpose to get forward on the road. **At home Fulham have scored &amp; are unbeaten in 4, but more importantly they’ve conceded in 5/6 at home**. They’re getting results but with leaky defense.

There’s some goal scoring form as well. On Fulham’s end **Harry Wilson has 3 goals and an assist in his last 4 matches, meanwhile Brighton’s last 7 goals were scored by different players**, showing everyone has an eye for goal.

It’s not the most gaudy form, but it’s enough form, with enough on the line, to have a goal fest on our hands.

Last play review:

Richmond -2.5 (-110) 1u ❌

Write Up: We&#x27;re again going to get some help from the notepad guy. Shoutout to u/Annual_Series_4124.

Rayo is hosting Osasuna <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. According to the notepad guy stats, Rayo has O4.5 corners in last 16/18 matches at home, and O4.5 SOG in last 14/16 at home. Osasuna has conceded in 14/15 away games, indicating they tend to let teams play around in their side of the match.

Looking at the current seasons averages, Rayo has an avg of 4.5 shots on goal per game and 6.1 corners per game. 

Some recent Rayo stats: 3 corners &amp; 4 SOG against Getafe, 5 corners &amp; 8 SOG against Elche, 8 corners and 7 SOG against Betis, 6 corners &amp; 5 SOG against Mallorca, 7 corners &amp; 3 SOG against Celta.

Looking at Osasuna, they seem to tend to concede corners and SOGs, conceding 6 corners and 5 SOGs in their last match which was against Oviedo.

The <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> only allows 2 parlay pieces, but I will be adding Rayo to score as a side bet for 2.25 and then play around a bit with some Rayo corner &amp; SOG ladders.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Song Yadong +3.5 -145 3 Unit bet

Not usually a fan of spreads in mma due to questionable judges but this price is too great to pass up on. O’Malleys a great lengthy striker who’s known as a sniper. I think most people see this as a great win position to get O’Malley back into contention which I agree with. What I disagree with is people looking at Yadong as a complete walk over. Although hes struggled with top level comp so far hes shown signs of belonging with Cory or Petr and even beat Cejudo. Yadongs never been knocked out in the UFC which makes me feel better about this going to decision. I think the 3.5 spread is super favorable because of the first round honestly. Yadongs won 8/10 of his last 10 first rounds losing 2 to Petr and Kyler Phillips. Most mma media gave Yadong that round over Petr and Kyler Phillips is a notorious one round Andy. I think Song can come out maybe land a takedown or ever get the better of some exchanges before Sean gets his timing down and cruises to a win. Seans rhythm must be very off considering his last 2 fights were Merab so those camps could neutralize the striking a bit. BOL everyone</td></tr>

Last: Bologna vs. Celtic 1@1.70❌

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>: Middlesbrough vs. Preston 1@1.53✅

A characterful victory and a promotion victory for Middlesbrough, who overturned Stoke away from home by 1-2. The first part of the match belonged to the home team, who also found a goal during this period (15&#x27;). Then, and gradually, Boro showed their quality and of course their metal as they not only returned in the 48th minute but also found a goal to overturn in the 59th minute. They then managed the lead excellently, with their task becoming easier after the 77th minute when Stoke had to play with ten men.

&quot;In the second half, we had a different mentality and turned the game around. We have to focus on ourselves. This period is difficult,&quot; said the visibly pleased coach Helberg, who sees that his team is resilient and has the metal capable of keeping it alive in the battle for direct promotion. They are in 2nd place, -6 behind leaders Coventry and +2 behind Ipswich. Their last three have ended goalless, while they have lost one of their last five at home (3-1-1).

Match News: Defender Bangoura is suffering from an injury problem. Jones Edmundson remain out. Lenihan is out for a long time.

A &quot;hands down&quot; home defeat for Preston, 0-3 to Hull. The visitors took the lead in the 33rd minute, while at a crucial moment (45th minute) Hull doubled their goals, thus gaining a strong lead in view of the continuation. Preston failed to react in the second half, with the final score being 0-3 in the 49th minute. The appearance and defeat in the home team&#x27;s camp brought a lot of nerves, with the prone Osmajic receiving a straight red card in the 90+5th minute.

&quot;The lack of discipline is completely unacceptable. Osmajic disappointed me. &quot;It may not have been worth it in <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>&#x27;s game, but we have three games ahead of us,&quot; said Heckingbottom, clearly showing his concern for the behavior of his player, who had just returned from another nine-game suspension a few weeks ago. Two consecutive defeats in the league without scoring, while the possibility of a home elimination in the cup by a team from a lower division (Wigan) could also be included in the conversation. The last four in the Championship ended with no goals.

Middlesbrough are coming off a win that could give them a boost ahead of the next round. Boro have reacted well after being relegated from the FA, unlike Preston, who have lost and are struggling in their last two games, with the team&#x27;s atmosphere not being ideal after their last game. The first reason is Middlesbrough, who seem more capable of continuing their campaign with a win.

5u to Win 4.2u


Write up: Paz has hit this in 6/6 of his last 6 Serie A games as a starter. He will hit this again. I have laddered him up to 5 Shots <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> as I usually do. Torino play a low block and look to counter. Paz is a phenomenal high presser and is a great shooter from distance; I expect him to have at least 1 SOT from outside the box due to how low Torino sit. If you don&#x27;t pay attention to tennis and/or don&#x27;t trust my judgement play Como ML with Paz 3+ Shots as they have been in great form recently. (Torino are decent off the counter though, and recently beat Roma 3-2 in the Coppa Italia and Como just lost to AC Milan 3-1 who implemented a similar counterattacking style.) As for Inglis v Osaka both have gone to 3 Sets in both of their Aussie open games so far, I expect this one to as well. Inglis is an Aussie and Osaka has been flustered, especially in her last game. This will easily go over 2 sets, or at least it should. If it doesn&#x27;t Inglis shouldn&#x27;t lose worse than 6-,3, 6-3. These are both relatively free picks IMO, take Paz 4+ Shots + Inglis to Win a Set for better value but I wouldn&#x27;t bet more than 2u on it.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Natalia Silva ml + Paddy Pimblett ml (-123) FanDuel 4u

**Write-up:**

**Justin Gaethje vs Paddy Pimblett**

Paddy is legit. People like to say he hasn’t fought anybody, or he doesn’t have power or this and that…same thing different fighter. Justin has an impressive resume, but he has said himself that this could very well be his last fight, or the coming to an end, and we know how those fights usually go. Paddy is absolutely huge come fight night. He is younger and will be able to take more punishment. Now I do believe Justin is a better boxer and I do expect him to hit Paddy with a few clean shots. Justin throws very hard leg kicks to the calf, and I suspect he will use that to time Paddies entries. He should throw some heat behind wide hooks or overhands. Paddy throws good kicks to the body along with the head. I think he can create his own opportunities and land a few clean shots himself, leading to a takedown. I suspect Paddy having a bit of trouble getting Justin down, but he will be levels above Justin on the mat. Paddy is a black belt in BJJ and Justin is a newb. Justin does have better wrestling. Anyhow, I see Paddy winning this fight ITD by submission. Five rounds to do it. 

**Natalia Silva vs Rose Namajunas**

Natalia Silva will be champion very soon. She is an extremely skilled flyweight. Her arsenal of legs kicks will overwhelm Rose in this fight. She has some of the best footwork I’ve seen inside women’s MMA. Silva controls space very well. These two have very similar styles tbh. They both like to play at distance and set traps / counter punch. It’s just that Silva is a few years younger and does it better. Thug Rose has been fighting for quite some time now, and her move up to 125 (flyweight) has her looking sluggish. It should still be a competitive fight, I just see Rose wearing the damage more as the fight lingers. She is tough as nails and will be an extremely hard out, type of fighter that dies on her shield. I see Silva winning this fight by control and prolonged damage for a decision win.

So happy UFC is back! BOL if tailing! Let’s get it 🥃.</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'><mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: (NCAAM) NC State -6.5 vs. Pitt

Start Time: 12:00 PM ET


Units: 2U


Odds: -110

Record: 0-1 (-2U)


Last Pick: Colorado Avs -1.5 ❌(yikes)

Reasoning:
Call me the fade king. 0-1 to start after dropping a 2U play, but I’m comfortable stepping back in here. I’ll own the bias since NC State is my team, but the matchup still checks out. State is coming off an impressive road win at Clemson, controlling the game late and shooting efficiently, a good sign for a road spot like this.

NC State has been the more consistent offense, averaging better shooting splits and creating easier looks, while Pitt has struggled to keep up with teams that can score in transition and stretch the floor. Laying points on the road isn’t ideal, but the recent form and offensive edge give me confidence.

Looking for a clean response. Go Pack!</td></tr>

To start my official pick of the day record I’m going with Stan +2.5 sets @ +110. Fritz should win 3-1 but he has not been the dominant player that he was a year ago. His 2nd serve % has dropped a lot overall and a seasoned veteran like Stan should take an early set off of him for it. Stan’s physicality will likely tail off late in the match but I’m confident he wins the first or 2nd set. BOL if tailing!</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: Sean O’Malley By Decision (+110) 3u To Win 3.3u

Write-Up: Another win and that’s 4 in a row! Let’s keep it going. UFC IS BACK! Sean O’Malley takes on Song Yadong on the Co-Main fight of the Event. Sean O’Malley is finally fighting again after coming off of back to back losses to Previous champion Merab Dvalishvili. Those losses were tough as Merab was able to hold him down and outlast him with his cardio but that’s not what we’re here to talk about. Sean O’Malley is taking a big drop in competition here fighting Song Yadong, as Song has only fought once a year for the past 3 years and his last fight was a pretty controversial one over Henry Cejudo who should have been retired a long time ago. Song’s last loss was to current champion Petr Yan where he got beat 2-1 in rounds and just got outstruck pretty easily. Sean O’Malley had a great fight against current champion Petr Yan a couple years ago, where he did get the decision win, although it was a very close fight and could’ve went either way. Sean O’Malley’s reach advantage and ability to go in and out of the pocket will give him a huge advantage as Song is more of a throw haymakers and pray guy. Sean O’Malley will be able to land many punches in volume and get out of the way and will likely play it safe as he just wants to secure a win by any means necessary. Given Song Yadong’s power, Sean probably won’t risk going for a big knockout as it could risk him getting knocked out himself. Even if Sean O’Malley goes out guns blazing beating Yadong up looking like he will get a knockout, I think it will still end up going to a decision, as Yadong is very tough, he’s never been knocked out in his UFC career. I believe Sean will be able to land a ton of strikes on Song Yadong, stay out of the way of his power, and he won’t have to worry about the wrestling takedown threat that caused him to lose to Merab Dvalishvili.

Take Sean O’Malley By Decision!</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: **Sean O&#x27;Malley ML + Jean Silva ML** 5u to win 5.21u


Imagine being in Sean O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s shoes for a moment. Just six months ago, he was the reigning champion, the vibrant &quot;Suga&quot; that everyone couldn&#x27;t wait to watch. But then, he lost his title, and suddenly, the highlight reels were all about someone else. In the cutthroat world of the UFC, you can go from being a superstar to an afterthought in the blink of an eye.

Now, his comeback isn&#x27;t just another fight; it&#x27;s the beginning of a new chapter in his story. His opponent, Song Yadong, is a fierce competitor, but this matchup seems tailor-made for O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s redemption. Yadong is known for his aggressive style, charging forward and trading blows, which is exactly what O&#x27;Malley thrives on with his pinpoint accuracy and significant reach advantage. The pressure is squarely on O&#x27;Malley; he’s the one who needs to prove himself.

I’m going with O&#x27;Malley to win here; this fight is a huge moment in his career. I believe Sean’s sharp counter-striking will give him the edge over Yadong’s aggressive style.


Jean Silva is an incredibly dynamic striker, known for his loose and creative style. Watching him play is a real treat, even if it sometimes leads him into some tricky situations. He keeps things interesting by switching from a tight guard to having his hands down, and he does this often enough to keep opponents guessing. Arnold Allen is going to be the toughest striker Silva has faced yet, but I still believe Silva will come out on top. I think his creativity, combined with his relentless pressure and the fact that Allen has had some time off, will really work in his favor. Arnold Allen will be the best striker that Jean Silva has fought, but I still think Silva wins. i thin his creativity combined with his pressure and Allen&#x27;s layoff will work well for him.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Novak Djokovic 🇷🇸 vs Botic Van de Zandschulp 🇳🇱 3 total sets 5 units to win 3.3U @1.66 (Bet365)

This play is essentially Djokovic 3-0 but the odds are the exact same on 365 so taking this instead in case Botic somehow wins 3-0 (like against Alcaraz in US Open ‘24) or if Novak retires down a set or two which God forbids that happens. But if the odds are better on Novak to win in straight sets take it. The price was slightly better when I wrote my write-up (@1.73) but this is where they currently are and I’d consider a fair price to be around 1.50 so there’s still a lot of value in this in my opinion.

Djokovic absolutely cruised past his first two rounds 3,2,2 and though were against fairly weak opposition in Martinez and Maestrelli he looked better than last year, where he reached the semis of all slams. His serving has been very strong but it’s his returning that has truly gone up a notch in my opinion after a drop in his return game last year that  caused matches to go one longer than thy should have. Limiting a big server like Maestrelli to just 55% first serves won is impressive and it seems like he’s found that groove that has seen him be the best returner of all time. In terms of conditioning which is often an issue at 38 years old, but he isn’t your average old man and has looked in great form, unlike US Open last year, still moving like the elite baseliner that he is. It’s obvious that this is one of his last chances to reach the elusive 25 grand slams, the hunger is present as always, and I expect him to sail through the tournament until reaching the big two of Alcaraz and Sinner. As a result, Djokovic knows he’ll need to be in top form to have a chance at defeating them so don’t expect him to drag out matches but instead expect a ruthless Novak to limit time spent on the court.

VDZ has also had a good tournament so far, dropping just a set in victories over Nakashima and Shang. However, the No. 75 is the epitome of inconsistency plus this represents a bad match-up for the Dutchman. Botic is going to need his first serve percentage to be unrealistically high to hold regularly as the 45% second serves points won against Shang aren’t going to cut it against Novak. Against the Serb who is an elite returner is going to cause longer rallies with deep returns quite regularly. In this scenario Djokovic will have the upper hand more often than not as VDZ’s game is more focused around keeping points shorter from the baseline before the errors start to creep in when rallies get longer and more pressure is applied which Nole is the master at. I struggle to see just where Van de Zandschulp keeps it competitive enough to win a set except maybe scamming a tiebreak but he should be getting overwhelmed in all sectors of the game for another routine Novak win on his march to the title. BOL !</td></tr>

This figures to be an extremely exciting match between 2 players who have looked fantastic so far. Both Ruud and Cilic have played respectable opponents in the first 2 rounds and have both cruised in straight sets.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Cristian Romero Over 0.5 shots@1.76 (7Red) | **Stake: 5u**

**Write Up:** 

* Romero has had at least one shots in 9 of his last 11 games
* Romero has had exactly 3 shots in his last three games (Which you can get 13x+ on)
* Burnley Averages 19 shots against at home 
* He did not take a shot in the opening game of the season when Spurs won 3-0, but in the past games against them he has managed so: *2(Both on target), 1(Scored), 2*.

The guy has been playing even more “aggressive” than usual and I’m not just talking about his tacking, but also about how many attacking runs he makes. He is even on back to back games with goals! Burnley is also averaging the 2nd most corners against, which suits Romero nicely.

Burnley are winless in 13 league games and they have conceded eight from their last four league games, but it could quickly have been way more with the chances Manchester United and Liverpool had in their last two games, where they combined gave up 61 shots! 

Spurs are not super hot at the moment either and the manager has been booed off a lot recently, it’s a  small surprise he hasn&#x27;t been sacked yet. But they did beat Dortmund 2-0 at home on Wednesday and a lot of the players had good performances in that game, which has helped the situation a bit coming into this one.

For me this is crazy value! He almost has to go off injured in the first 10 minutes for him not to have a shot in this game with the way he plays at the moment. 

Alternatively you can try him to have a shot on target for 5x and up at most places. </td></tr>

Bayern Munich vs Ausburg, over 4.5 goals @ 2.3

Bayern Munich vs Augsburg shapes up perfectly for over 4.5 goals. Bayern’s home matches are often goal festivals, with constant pressure, wide play, and multiple scoring options. Augsburg struggle defensively against high-tempo sides and usually concede early, which opens the game even more. Once Bayern get ahead, they rarely slow down, and Augsburg’s willingness to attack can easily push the total into a high-scoring outcome.</td></tr>

The Monaco game earlier is for sure going to give Madrid false confidence, but the thing is, Monaco played a very open brand of football that suits Real&#x27;s counterattacking playing style, and Kehrer&#x27;s generational stinker definitely helped. Not to mention, Mbappe was up against his former club that he knows perfectly well and always plays well against (he has almost a goal a game against them).

**Confidence: 80 %**

**Details : Premier League  - Man City VS Wolverhampton - 10:00 AM EST**

**---**

Home game after back to back humiliating losses, pressure will be on from minute one on this one. On top of that they have 0 wins in their last 4 Prem games and anything other than 3 points AND a performance will be underachieving here. One of City&#x27;s issues have been second half performances and unintentionally being a bit more pragmatic than intended, City will look to kill the game early and pin wolves to their own half. Now whether they&#x27;re successful pin them is one thing but the corners will flow regardless. 

Wolves come into this 5 games unbeaten so their defensive structure should irritate City enough to play for set pieces later in the half.

**Wolves have played 5 away games against the big 6 this season and this line has covered in 4/5 .**

* Teams/Time: Falcons vs. Vitality (CS2) | 10:00 AM EST.

Writeup:

* NucleonZ is called up on short notice from Falcons academy team to replace their star rifler kyousuke due to visa issues. He had very limited notice and has very little experience as a pro so far with only 160 rounds lifetime on HLTV. In academy so far he was the standout player for Falcons Academy but was mostly playing low tier two/tier three competition.
* Falcons are decent underdogs and should be bigger than this in my opinion. Vitality are on fire recently looking back to dominant form, this team without kyousuke is really going to struggle in my opinion to be competitive with such a hot Falcons team.
* Vitality projected to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> their map first, very likely that they <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> Inferno as their map choice in this series. If they don&#x27;t go for Inferno then I think Dust 2 makes the most sense but Inferno is a no brainer.
* Vitality were 5-2 h2h against Falcons in 2025 on Inferno, winning in rounds 87-69 in that time. Vitality are on a 4 map win streak on Inferno beating B8, NAVI, FaZe and GamerLegion on the map, a very impressive run of form. Inferno as said in previous write-ups has by far the least kills of any map in CS2 at the moment. Their is a ton of saving and this leads to much less kills then a normal CS2 map overall making it a great spot to target under.
* NucleonZ has one series on Falcons so far, in that series they won 2-0 against Liquid but looked very shaky overall. NucleonZ averaged a .55 KPR the lowest on the entire team despite the win. He also was taking anchor roles and playing bad spots on CT side which you can see with his .50 KPR on CT side. With a .55/.6 KPR that gives him between 11-13 kills in an average map and that is assuming they win it which I think Vitality will blow them out of the water on Inferno
* This line is set entirely off of his tier three/tier 2.5 stats against much weaker teams where he is the star on the team. This line is off by 3-4 kills in my opinion from where it should be on both maps, specifically going for map 1 though as he has 0 official games on Inferno as a pro, and of the two maps he has played on Falcons so far, Dust 2 was his weakest game, averaging a .48 KPR and dropping 10 kills in 21 rounds, despite Falcons winning 13-8

Note: Would ladder this if you have that option, 13.5 and 12.5 are very worth playing as well!</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:**  5. TOUCHDOWN $1.85 - WIN                                  
**Write Up:** <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s pick</mark> TOUCHDOWN comes here of a slight freshen and hence we come back in trip 200m to the 1600m. The reason for this is due to fires that ripped through their facilities, luckily causing no harm to the horses, however it means we missed a run the other week and have to shift back to this one.    
     
Regardless of this slight setback, TOUCHDOWN has still jumped out in between runs and did so very impressively, indicating he is going to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> up right where he left off tearing through the grades.    
    
The stable are very bullish about his chances and have likened him to MR BRIGHTSIDE, one of Australia’s best recent horses, and so far their high opinion has been right.     
     
This horse is extremely adaptable tactics wise, and can settle anywhere in the run and still be a major player. From barrier 4 I envision us either outside lead, or 1 out 1 back, both very advantageous positions on the Caulfield track.    
     
Our main danger YES I KNOW comes off 2 defeats to a horse called FIORENOT, a horse we comfortably handled a few runs back. YES I KNOW also backs up here after 7 days from a brutally run race, which is not a set up I like to follow.     
      
All in all I think TOUCHDOWN is better than this grade of race, and I don’t think the slight setback is enough to worry us here against limited opposition, especially since we ourselves are still very much untapped in terms of a ceiling. GL!</td></tr>

**Recap + overview(?):**

And another huge 4U win with the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>. Auxerre manage to barely keep PSG to a 0-1. But a win is a win.

Time for another one. I&#x27;ve been eyeing this one.

If you&#x27;re wondering about the huge unit swing. My 7 leg parlay of which one match got voided hit for 12.66U on top of the 3.8U from <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>.

Let&#x27;s keep riding the momentum.

**Write Up:**

&quot;Only&quot; 3U but I am confident in this one. Hopefully after my write up you&#x27;ll be as confident as I am.

Ajax have struggled earlier this season but ever since Fred Grim took over they have been more consistent with results.

Definitely not convincing but the results are there.

At home Ajax are 6-2-2 with a 17 scored and 9 conceded. Even with the bad start this is very solid. 

Away they are 3-5-1 with 20 scored and 17 conceded. This will be relevant for the H2H later.

FC Volendam at home and away are a completely different team. At home 4-3-3 with 16 scored and 13 conceded. Away from home they are 0-2-7 with 5 scored and 20 against

Earlier this season the reverse fixture ended 1-1. If you compare the away and home records this will be different <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.

FC Volendam did win their last 2 matches. Both games the opponent still outplayed FC Volendam stat-wise.

Ajax did play in the Champions League this week vs Villarreal but so far 2/2 home games after playing a CL game ended 2-0 and 2-0. Which covers the -1.5AH

I like the play and am excited to keep this insane run growing and more into the green!

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Danny Ballard 1+ SOT (+100) 1 unit to win 1 unit

**Write Up:** I&#x27;m back into fade territory as we had an absolute stinker of a match in Germany. There were quite a few opportunities for both sides, but we end 0-0. This one is on me, bad play, on we move. 

Back to our SOT plays as we see West Ham host Sunderland in the early match of the day. The books have finally caught on to center back SOTs against West Ham, as I was expecting this to be closer to +200, but we&#x27;re playing it anyways. West Ham concede the 2nd most SoTs in the league, behind Burnley. They also concede the most corners in the league, which allows our defenders to come forward. Last week they conceded a goal on three shots to Romero (Tottenham Center back), an SOT to Murillo (Forest Center Back) the previous week, and an SOT to all 4 Wolves defenders the week prior. They love to concede SOTs to defenders as they are not great in the air on defense. 

Ballard is a 6&#x27;2&quot; defender for Sunderland, he is one of their main targets on set pieces, and has had a great season. He is coming off a 2 SOT match vs Palace last weekend. He also scored a goal on 4 shots with 2 SOTs in the reverse fixture earlier in the season. While Sunderland plays significantly better at home, I like them to make this a tough match for struggling West Ham.

Friday’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> - ✅ Tommy Paul + Sabalenka win in straight sets

Saturday’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> - Machac +3.5 game spread -118 (1.18u to win 1u)

Saturday in Australia but Friday in the U.S.

Probably the best match of the day in terms of solid, evenly matched players. The one time these two have played before, Machac won easily. He’s looking to make his second consecutive 4th round at a slam and he’s always peformed best on hard courts. He’s going to be riding high with confidence having won 7 in a row (Won Adelaide)

Obviously he’s going up against a top 5 player in Musetti and there is a chance that he’s able to win the big points. That’s why I like the +3.5 game spread here. Good chance this is a 4 or 5 setter.

Good Luck!</td></tr>

**Last:** (CBB) Indiana -7.5 (1.5u) - ✅

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** (CBB) No. 16 Florida (-11.5) vs. Auburn

**Start Time:** 4:00 PM ET (ESPN)

**Odds:** -110 (DraftKings)

**Units:** 1.5U

**Reasoning:** They say revenge is a dish best served cold. But if it’s Auburn doing the serving, don’t be surprised if it’s a dish that gets sent back. 

While the Tigers (12-7) would love to get payback on Florida for last year’s heartbreaking loss in the Final Four, the team is simply lacking of many of the necessary ingredients. Not only is Auburn just 3-3 in SEC play, but the team is just 1-5 against teams currently ranked inside the Top 25. Furthermore, the team is just 1-3 in true road games and has lost 15 straight games in Gainesville dating back to 1996.

As for the Gators (14-5), it’s been quite the reverse of fortunes as of late. 

Following a 77-73 loss to then-No. 5 UConn, Florida fell to a surprising 5-4 through nine games. Suddenly, talks of a championship repeat were replaced with that of a championship hangover. Those murmurs only got louder when the team dropped its SEC opener to Missouri, 76-74, as 7.5-point favorites. 

Since then, flashes of last year’s squad that cut down the nets have been very much evident. 

Winning five straight in SEC play is already a tall task. But doing so against five Quad 1 opponents—including four ranked inside the NET ranking Top 50—is downright impressive. Not surprisingly, since Jan. 4, the Gators rank 2nd in the Barthag power ratings, per Torvik. It also certainly helps that the team has won 16 consecutive home games and 38 of its last 40 at the Stephen C. O’Connell Center over the last three years. 

On Saturday, expect Florida’s sizzling offense to lead the way. 

Through 19 games, the unit ranks 22nd in scoring (86.1 PPG), 40th in offensive efficiency (1.157), 100th in field-goal percentage (46.3%) and 348th in three-point shooting (28.6%). Over the team’s five-game win streak, those number have only increased, rising to 91 points per game on 49% shooting from the field (32.9% from beyond the mark) while ranking 2nd in adjusted offensive efficiency (133.8). That hot shooting should only continue against a Tigers defense that hasn’t played well all season—195th in opponent field-goal percentage (44.9%), 212th in defensive efficiency (1.065), 239th in opponent three-point shooting (35.0%) and 258th in scoring defense (78.0 PPGA)—and struggles even more on the road, conceding 83.9 points per game on a whopping 47.7% shooting (36.2% from deep). Not to mention, Auburn also ranks dead last in the SEC in opponent three-point shooting, allowing foes to connect on 38.8% of their opportunities from range in conference play. 

On the other end of the court, look for home court advantage to have a major impact.

On the year, the Gators defense has been solid, ranking 39th in defensive efficiency (0.968), 53rd in opponent field-goal percentage (41.6%), 102nd in scoring defense (72.1 PPGA) and 155th in opponent three-point shooting (33.4%). However, the unit takes its play to a whole different level in front of the home fans, ranking 16th in defensive efficiency (0.871), 22nd in opponent field-goal percentage (38.0%) and 50th in scoring defense (64.8 PPGA). That should present some difficulties for a Tigers offense that can hold its own—27th in scoring (85.4 PPG), 33rd in offensive efficiency (1.166), 82nd in field-goal percentage (46.7%) and 235th in three-point shooting (32.6%)—but takes a step back when playing away from home, averaging just 78.5 points per game on 42.0% shooting (29.4% from beyond the arc). Add to that, the team has converted just 10-of-57 (17.5%) opportunities from long range over its last three outings. 

The battle on the glass should be an X factor on Saturday evening. 

If Auburn has one strength, it’s the team’s ability to come away with offensive rebounds, ranking 13th with 12.1 per game. Unfortunately, Florida just so happens to arguably be the best rebounding team in the nation, ranking 1st in rebounding margin (+18), 1st in offensive rebounding (15.3), 1st in total rebounding (46.5) and 5th in defensive rebounding (28.1) while ranking 12th in opponent offensive rebounding (7.3), 13th in opponent total rebounding (30.7) and 21st in opponent defensive rebounding (19.5). The team put that on full display last time out, out rebounding LSU to the tune of 50-30, including a 24-7 advantage on the offensive glass that resulted in 21 second-chance points. Not surprisingly, the Gators lead the nation in second-chance points (17.5 PPG; 100th percentile). That could spell disaster for the Tigers, considering they rank 283rd in opponent second-chance points (12.2 PPG; 24th percentile). 

Expect Florida to romp in the Swamp.

Write up:  Model has this as the highest confident Edge % and EV % for the day. Will add some personal information in this write-up as well.

• ⁠Model has Florida ML at 68% 

• Model says Alabama should be -5.5 point favorites 

• EV better betting 100$ = 6-8$ for this play

• This statement may come back to haunt me here but I think Florida rolls in this one against Auburn - Florida is 9-0 this year at home, and in the last 5 home games, they have covered ATS - They have been battled tested throughout the year, and they have also beaten many good teams, the latest one being on the road at Vanderbilt, beating them 98-94 - The Gators are hot, rolling through their opponents in conference play, and it doesn’t stop against Auburn - Auburn is going to be Auburn, they are so inconsistent this year - I believe they are a good team, but do not have good depth - If Hall or Pettiford don’t go for 25-30 +, I don’t think they have enough fire power elsewhere to help lift them in games - Florida on the other hand have 4 guys who average above 10 PPG &amp; Klavzar who averages just under 10 PPG - Statistically Florida is better in almost every column, especially at home - they are in a nice spot here, riding a 5 game W streak

•First thing that stands out in the Alabama game is PPG and Pace of play - Alabama crushes Tennessee in both of those categories and it’s not even close - When I see stats like this, I always dig more into it because pace of play and PPG are huge in my opinion, because even if it is a “off” shooting night, the pace of play will still benefit the faster team, and will make up for the poor shooting - Alabama is top 3 nationally in both of these categories- Tennessee is not - Alabama averages 12.6 3PT FG% on the year, while Tennessee averages just 6.2 3PT FG% - If Alabama can keep it close with Tennessee in the rebound category, limiting Tennessee to a few OREB, they will control the game - Tennessee ranks in the top 5 when it comes to offensive rebounds, and that is the only concern - this will be a offensive vs defensive matchup in this one - Tennessee’s defense is actually pretty good if you dig into their stats, but Alabama’s offense, I believe it to much for the Vols in this one, especially with this game being played in Tuscaloosa

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Luka Doncic over 29.5 Points and Hornets ML** 

**(I think 32.5 is fair as 33.5 is more accurate however 32.5 feels much)**

Some bets you just have to take especially when it lines up well.

While the Don has gotten over being traded, does that mean he still doesn&#x27;t want to show up against this team? Hell no, he smashed his phone over this and wanted to continue being a Maverick. His last three games prove that his first game was 19 points, 15 boards and 12 assists but keep in mind that was when he was on an absolute stinker dropping below 20 points against Hornets and Jazz. The next two games when he was more established he dropped 45 and 35 points against Dallas.

I like this a lot because against the Clippers the Lakers showed a lot of heart and they lost, meaning they are in the zone. The opposite can be said for the Mavericks they are way over their head imo beating the Jazz twice without Lauri Markenen which is very impactful as they have only won once with him out and that was a 15 point comeback, beat the Knicks when they were going through their slump which they could still be in (knicks were so bad Brunson called for a players only meeting and trade talks began about KAT). And now they beat GSW without Jimmy Butler who is just as valuable as Steph due to the rotations, plus Kuminga got injured in 9 minutes and had 10 points. 

Also I want to say I think this because put in polite terms Max Christie is saying they cant guard me, players screaming and one and the fact they are very very active on the bench screaming.

The point is what happens a lot is teams develop an ego and gain confidence which is great, but they tend to relax and put their feet on the pedal. The opposite usually happens with a team that is hungry.

Keep in mind this could all be a stretch as these guys are roleplayers and young players who are hungry for it. (Brandon Willians, Ryan Nembhard,  etc). Also another reason this could be a stretch is due to the circumstances, Cooper Flagg wants to show up to say I am the new face of the franchise and Max Christie definitely wants to show up.

But tbh I feel like home court advantage isn&#x27;t really a factor here either, I expect a lot of cheers and Doncic Jerseys in this crowd as well. And remember this is one of the best scorers of all time, the only issue is whether he decides to assist instead but he can do both.</td></tr>

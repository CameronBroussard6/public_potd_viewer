**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Wolfsburg vs **RB Leipzig ML + Lyon ML** vs Nice (5u)

**Odds:** \+151

**Write Up:** Unfortunate misplacement of faith in the England rugby team, not the end of the world - such is betting, just a misread on my end apologies to those who tailed. Cardiff cleared their line though, good read for that fixture. 5 unit bet for this one and I would say I have \~80% confidence in this lay <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. 

First leg of the two is for RB Leipzig to take away the 3 points. So, Leipzig&#x27;s home record is currently 7-0-3 - Wolfsburg are 3-1-6 away. Secondly, head to head Leipzig have won the last 3 meetings (total record of 7-3 in favour of Leipzig in last 10). Current form for Wolfsburg is winless in 4 in the league. In terms of league standings Leipzig are in 6th, Wolfsburg are in 15th - one is fighting for champions league 3 points off 4th and the other staving off dropping into relegation spots. Leipzig are favourites to win here, in combination to current form, home/away form, squad depths and the motivations for both teams, Leipzig should win this.

Secondly is Lyon ML, they boast a 8-0-2 home record with Nice travelling to Lyon with a 2-1-7 away record. In their last 5 head-to-head games at Lyon the record goes 3-1-1 to Lyon, furthermore Lyon are 9-1 in their last 10 home fixtures (all competitions, only losing to PSG in November). While Lyon did have 2 red cards last fixture, they do posses decent enough bench quality and form to see this one through. League standings see Lyon in 3rd and Nice in 14th; Lyon are competing for a Champions league spot, with Nice mid-bottom table, giving them fuel for competing and taking 3 points away to extend their 2 point lead on Marseille into 5 points. It must be mentioned that Nice haven&#x27;t lost in 3 games - BUT two of these were draws and they are by no means playing quality football. Home form, motivation and Nice&#x27;s travelling form should see Lyon taking all 3 points.

**Games: Arsenal Vs Wigan - 11:30**

Arsenal are coming off a disappointing draw against brentford and will look to start some momentum with a big win at home tomorrow. Arsenals squad depth shouldnt cause issues in terms of quality against Wigan who have simply been poor in League One. Wigan have 6 losses in their last 8 games including a 6-1 battering by Peterborough who sit 10th in League one... that should really show how much their structure struggles at the moment.

Write Up: We’re going to go with Switzerland v Czechia for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>’s picks. Roman Josi is an NHL star. After the loss of Kevin Fiala I think we’re going to see Josi up his gameplay. Josi had 3 shots against Canada who are currently the strongest team in the tournament. He also had ~27 minutes of ice time. This matchup is going to be an important one that Switzerland is going to want to win so I’m sure we’ll see the top guys step up.

**Write-Up**:

This is a pure tempo play. North Texas is bottom-tier in pace (~61–63 possessions) and Temple isn’t much faster, so this projects as a half-court grind on both sides.

Both teams allow mid-60s per game, shoot in the mid-40% range, and neither plays with real offensive pace. Combined scoring averages land right around the mid-130s before even adjusting for two slow teams facing each other.

With projected possessions in the low 60s, this game likely lives in the mid-120s to low-130s unless shooting variance goes crazy or we get OT.

We keep the momentum after another green! Moving on to Rosario Central vs. Barracas Central.

* **Home Fortress:** Playing at the &quot;Gigante de Arroyito&quot; is a nightmare for any visitor. Central transforms at home, backed by one of the most intense atmospheres in Argentina.
* **Squad Hierarchy:** Rosario has a deep squad with high-level players and great experience like Di María and alejo Veliz. Their technical quality in midfield and attack is levels above Barracas.
* **The Visitor Factor:** While Barracas can be tough at their small stadium, they consistently struggle on the road, losing most of their tactical discipline away from home.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: **Denver-Omaha O159.5 (-108 DraftKings) 1U**

Event: CBB | Denver @ Omaha (1:00 p.m. EST) | 🏀

*Recap: Brandon Miller took 19 shots and made five. Unreal He finished with 16 points in 35 minutes. If he hits even 25 percent of the shots he missed, we clear the line. And after the 2-unit loss with UConn, I.... I needed to take a few days off after two beats in a row that just felt... icky. We move.*

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s reasoning:** Two teams will enter the arena. Neither will showcase any amount of defense. Combined, they&#x27;re scoring 161 points per game. But defensively... yikes. This is a bet that neither team will suddenly figure out how to guard, stop the ball, or otherwise protect the basket. Denver is allowing 81.2 points on the road, and Omaha is giving up 73.6 at home - although that number jumps to 76.5 for the season. Denver has been the number one over team all season - going 19-6 - which makes sense for a squad that is averaging 83.5 points - 44th in NCAA. Omaha is only 12-11 to the over, but they&#x27;re 5-3 to the over at home and they tend to get sucked into track meets. Case in point: on Thursday, Omaha (13-14) beat St. Thomas, 98-94. Omaha also beat Denver (13-14) two weeks ago, 84-82. BartTorvik is 60 percent confident in projecting this game to 163 points. KenPom sees it as an 82-81 win for Omaha. Haslametrics and Dunkel Index also project the over. And with a line this tight (-2.5), I think these teams will see all-out offense as the only way to a victory. 

I think Vegas is overvaluing the noon game scoring slump. Anecdotally, I expected a Penn State-Maryland noon game to go low earlier this season, and I was way off. But *those* schools play something at least resembling defense. Omaha and Denver flippantly do not. Both defenses allow opponents to shoot north of 53 percent overall and 56 percent from 2-point range. Yuck. Denver&#x27;s effective field goal percentage is particularly bad, ranking 331st. Their defensive efficiency is 346th. Omaha&#x27;s is 272nd. Go ahead. Line up a shot. It&#x27;s going in against either side. On the other hand, they can score at will. Denver is hitting 38.4 percent from beyond the arc (19th in NCAA), and their true shooting percentage is SIXTY percent! Omaha isn&#x27;t firing on quite the same level, but the Mavericks are netting 83.2 points per game at home.  Plus, Omaha has been hitting 7.3 points over their season scoring average over the last five games -- over in four of the five, so its not just one or two games. 

Look. Neither of these teams are winning the Summit League. This is a who-cares? Sunday noon game with a couple of .500 squads that want to shoot fast and refuse to play transition defense. Whoever wins will need every last point. It might even end on a flurry of baskets in the final minute, but I&#x27;m thinking we&#x27;re looking at the 160s and not the 150s. Omaha is averaging 81.6 points in its last five home games. Denver is averaging 83 points in its last five road games. Let&#x27;s root for another track meet. 

Good luck and Godspeed!

**Event:** LaLiga, Rayo Vallecano v Atletico Madrid, 10:15 EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Rayo Vallecano +0.5 Asian Handicap, +103, 1 unit

**Write Up:** I really don’t envy any team that has to play at Rayo’s ground. Rayo, the masters of draws, are extremely tough to crack at home, thanks to their **compact defence,** quick **transitions that are facilitated through the nifty midfielder Isi Palazon,** and last but certainly not least, intense backing by their fans. The ground has that **vintage South American feel** and it seems like a lot of teams just crumble there as of late. **Rayo already took points off Barcelona AND Real Madrid this season.** *They did narrowly lose to Atletico in the first fixture,* but even then they showed they can absolutely compete and nick some points off them at their own ground.

Not only that, but the **Atletico players are going to be a bit tired from the intense Barcelona game** just a few days ago, as well as mentally preparing for the reverse fixture. The league has already been effectively lost, so **they’re not going to put 100% of their effort into it,** unless the top 4 spot starts to look endangered. I expect Rayo to get out of this match alive and kicking. I think **Isi Palazon is going to have a big match** and help his team well in transition <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.

This bet is essentially a DC but my book offers slightly better odds on the Asian Handicap for whatever reason. For comparison, the DC is priced at -111. If you want to stack something on top of this play, you can go for an Under 2.5 goals - I’m very positive this hits. BOL and let&#x27;s try to enjoy some Simeone ball ☘️🫡</td></tr>

**Write-up:**  
This is the first game of the season for many players on both sides, so some early rust to be expected.

4/5 matches finishing **under** 40.5 points.

The Indigenous All Stars hold a slight edge in the halves and backline, while the Maori All Stars’ forward pack and bench rotation are stronger overall, in my opinion.

Expect a tight game built around field position and forward dominance. The number is slightly inflated for a preseason-style fixture, making the **UNDER 40.5** my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick of the day</mark>.

Event: T20 Cricket World Cup - USA vs Namibia

Bet: USA over 6.5 sixes @ -110 (DraftKings)

Time: 3:30AM CST

I comment some, but I haven&#x27;t done my own picks, so I figured I may as well dip my toes in the water here.  I&#x27;ve been following the T20 cricket tournament extremely close so far, and looking for all the best bets I can.  I can thank jaysial for getting me into it, by the way.

For my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> here, I&#x27;m going with the USA to hit at least 6.5 sixes against Namibia in their upcoming T20 match.  Reasons are as follows:

1.  The USA just hit 9 against the Netherlands, who are at least on Namibia&#x27;s level (and have defeated them), and are performing at a high level.

2.  Before that, in their first tournament match, they had 6 against Pakistan, and Pakistan is WAYYYYYYYYY above Namibia&#x27;s level.  Getting 6 off of them is actually pretty dang good.

3.  Namibia bowlers are giving up a lot of sixes so far in the tournament.  In their last match, they gave up 14 to India.  Now, India are the favorites and are obviously extremely good, but 14 is still a healthy chunk of them.  Before that, they played the Netherlands and gave up 9 to them.  Yes, that&#x27;s the same Netherlands team that the USA just defeated handily.

  
There&#x27;s also a bet on DK under &quot;match specials&quot; that gives +130 odds for a USA win and them to have more sixes than Namibia; I took that as well but that&#x27;s obviously riskier.

Good luck!</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Marie Bouzkova 🇨🇿 ML vs Elise Mertens 🇧🇪 2.4 units to win 4U @2.50 (Bet365)

Shouldn’t have posted my last pick considering my plan was to just cover the masters 1000’s and grand slams since those are where the players’ motivations are the highest. Good thing we’re in a masters week now and we have a busy couple of weeks ahead of us. As you can tell by the odds manage your bankroll as Bouzkova is the underdog for a reason, don’t crash out if the bet loses. Heard? Great. I would consider fairer odds to be around the 2.1 range so the value is there and the line is too wide for me.

Bouzkova hasn’t necessarily been setting the world alight but her results have been logical this year. Straight set losses to better players in Andreeva, Swiatek and Mboko, straight set victories against Cristian and Zarazua. She’s also faced Badosa twice which ended as three close sets, sharing the spoils with one victory each. Mertens on the other hand reached the Australian Open 4th round for the first time since her run to the semis in 2018 but she did have a very favourable draw. She easily took out Tararudee, Uchijima and Bartunkova before crashing out to the eventual champion Rybakina. Last week she defeated Pavlyuchenkova and bowed out to Kasatkina. 

The No. 22 has had a better start to the season compared to the No. 37 more so results-wise rather than performances but I’m backing the upset due to this in my opinion being a tough match-up for Mertens. The Belgian is a consistent all-courter who doesn’t have many holes in her game with a strong backhand and plays mainly with rhythm. Bouzkova on the other hand is an out-and-out counterpuncher whose gamestyle relies on extending rallies with her elite court coverage and depth on her shots. I suspect that Elise is going to have to take more risks in rallies to overcome Marie’s grit and find some sort of rhythm which is going to force more errors out of her. Being a better server and the fact she can be aggressive does mean she can pull it off but it’s not an ideal match-up, this is going to be fairly close. Bouzkova also leads the H2H 2-0 though only the victory in Cincinnati in 2023 is meaningful which proves that she has bothered her in the past (other match was 11 years ago). If I were to compare the Czech to another player, stylistically, it would be Kasatkina who leads the H2H 6-2 and just thrashed Mertens 0 and 4 last week despite her dreadful form. BOL !</td></tr>

**Short Write Up**:

Last season Iwaki (J2) failed to win any of their first nine rounds, but from round 10 and till the end, they were the 3rd best team in the league, only beaten by Mito and Nagasaki who eventually took 1st and 2nd place. They only won 1-0 in their opener, but were all over Sapporo and should have won that game 3 or 4-0. 

Fukushima United (J3) had some insane games last season like they almost have every season now and saw the most goals in their games last year, much helped by the fact that they had the worst defence. In the J3 history books the figure seven times in the biggest Wins/Defeats… Five of the times is on the wrong side. Fukushima doesn&#x27;t have any real money to build a promotion chasing team, so it’s mostly made up of University recruits and loans.

Kofu beat Fukushima 4-1, Iwaki who is even better, should be able to do something similar.  </td></tr>

For Switzerland, although they have better defenders in Roman Josi and JJ Moser, they simply do not have the same firepower that Czechia has especially with the loss of Kevin Fiala in their last game vs Canada. The closest to a NHL point per game player that they have is Nico Hischier and he&#x27;s not close. Another interesting fact that I saw about the Czech team is that only **one player** in the team didn&#x27;t play in the NHL. Most of them have at least 100+ matches played in the NHL before going to Europe. Meanwhile Switzerland has 9 players who currently play in the NHL and everybody else **never** played a single game in the NHL. To me this will come down to skill and experience which Czechia is better in both so I expect 2 scenarios. First one is Czechia overpowers Switzerland with their talent and puts up plenty of goals OR the second scenario is that Switzerland puts up a good defensive effort and Czechia gets their third goal in an empty net. I just don&#x27;t see Czechia only scoring 2 goals or less especially with goals being this important for the standings. 

Finally, although they didn&#x27;t have NHL players playing in that tournament, the last time Czechia played vs Switzerland was in the 2025 IIHF World Championship and Czechia won 5-4. Why am I bringing this up? Because the goalie for Switzerland will be the same that will be starting tomorrow so if he can get scored on 5 times with no NHL players imagine with them being there.

BOL!</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s Event:** English FA Cup (Soccer) | Arsenal vs Wigan (8:30 AM PST)

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:**  Eberechi Eze ATGS (+110) 1 unit to win 1.1 units

**Write Up:** I guess that&#x27;s what you get sometimes when you back bad teams. Absolutely terrible offensive showing from West Ham. Nothing more to be said. 

The FA Cup continues <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> and we are back to a player prop <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> and we&#x27;re taking a player who is &quot;due&quot;. Eze has really yet to click with his Arsenal team, after making the early season move over from Palace. This seems like the perfect opportunity for Eze to arrive. He is far too talented to continue his scoring drought. Eze has only scored 4 goals this season, 3 of them in one match back in November. I&#x27;m thinking he will slot into the #10 role and get some chances to shoot from the edge of the box, which is his most dangerous zone. 

Wigan are two tiers below Arsenal in England&#x27;s 3rd tier (League One) and are 22nd in League One to boot. They&#x27;ve got a relegation battle on their hands and I don&#x27;t see them being up for the task defensively away against Arsenal. BOL and happy Sunday!</td></tr>

**Football | Turkish Super League | 17:00 UTC+3**

**Match:** Goztepe vs Kayserispor

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Goztepe ML

**Write Up:** Goztepe are among the best defensive teams in the league and are keen to stay in the race for a European spot. I don’t see them slipping up against a struggling Kayserispor side down in the bottom half. They’re unbeaten in their last 8 games, and I’m confident they’ll keep that streak going.

I was originally going to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> a different game, but the odds were too low so I switched.

2/2 so far, hope it keeps going like this.</td></tr>

MATCHES RECAP: STRONG PERFORMANCES FROM BOTH - AL NASSR ( 0-2 ) &amp; REAL MADRID ( 4-1 ).

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>PICK</mark> - Athletic Bilbao Draw No Bet &amp; Salzburg to win any HALF AGAINST Grazer AK - 2.12 ODDS / +112 ODDS FOR AMERICAN MARKET

\- Athletic Bilbao will likely control possession early and apply constant pressure, forcing Real Oviedo to defend deep. Despite the low performances for Athletic Bilbao in away games, in such game, the experience &amp; quality should make the difference.  
\- Oviedo is expected to focus on defensive organization and counterattacks, with limited offensive opportunities throughout the match.  
\- Expect a positive outcome, in the worst scenario - a draw.

\- FC Red Bull Salzburg has significantly higher squad quality and attacking depth, allowing them to dominate phases of the game and create consistent scoring pressure against weaker opponents like Grazer AK ( 19-31 GD ).  
\- Grazer AK tends to struggle defensively against top-tier teams, often conceding momentum and chances over time, making it difficult for them to remain competitive across both halves. - FC Red Bull Salzburg’s previous match was well below their usual standards, as they failed to score despite having an offside goal minutes after conceding 2 in the first half. However, scoring is typically a consistent strength for Salzburg, given their attacking quality and offensive structure. Therefore, this match is expected to present better attacking efficiency and a higher number of goals.

Sri Lanka v England 

Sam Curran total wickets under 1.5 @ 1.5

Starts in about 10 Hours ⏳

Units: 5

https://www.buymeacoffee.com/JaySial

Reasoning:

Sam Curran in Sri Lanka bowled only 6 overs in 3 matches and managed 3 wickets.

Sam Curran vs Sri Lanka 9 wickets in 7 matches

I doubt he will bowl his full quota of overs.</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>Nottingham Forest - Liverpool | Over 9.5 corners @ 1.66

Their last meeting in November ended 8-6 to Liverpool in corners.

**Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Shonan vs Hachinohe |  Shonan Wins@2.00 (Coolbet) | **Stake: 5u**  💰💰💰

**Recap:** Nice to be back with a win again and a big one as well! 

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s Event:** Japan Special Tournament | Kyoto Sanga vs Avispa Fukuoka | 06:00 GMT +2

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Kyoto Sanga Win@2.05 (Coolbet) | **Stake: 5u**  

**Write Up:**

Kyoto Sanga with two 1-1 draws so far against Vissel Kobe and Shimizu, which I guess we can call okay so far. Sanga had a sensational season last year and nobody really expects them to follow up that 3rd place.

Avispa Fukuoka drew 1-1 against Okayama in the opener, before Cerezo beat them 2-0 at home. I have Avsipa to finish last in this West group, there is just very little about this team that inspires anything. They averaged less than a goal a game last year and over the winter they have lost some key players without replacing them with anybody noteworthy. The manager has also left after last season after being accused of power harassing yet again and the replacement hasn’t done anything special before this to inspire confidence. 

It would be really fuckings frustrating if Kyoto Sanga can’t win this game by just scoring a single goal. The guests here really do look clueless and poorly coached. My guess is another 2-0 defeat for Avispa.

<tr><td class='post'>Event: English Premier League
Tottenham Hotspur v Arsenal, 17:30 CET
<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Winner: Arsenal, 1.60, 1 unit

Write up: North London derby - a story in itself.
Probably one of the biggest point-difference between these two teams if front of this derby in the 21st century. Arsenal are chasing the Premier League title after 22 years, while Tottenham after a great start of the season now  can&#x27;t find a way to escape the relegation zone.
Arsenal are in front of the first serious test in the title race after drawing against Wolves. If they don&#x27;t manage to win at Tottenham, after whole 22 matchweeks there is a big chance for them to lose the first place in the near future because of the tougher schedule rather than Man. City.
Although in this kind of derbies statistics don&#x27;t matter a lot and the mentality in front of the games is the key, Arsenal dominated in their last Premier League meeting and won in the last 3 Premier League games at Tottenham away.
In addition, in Sunday Igor Tudor will make a debut as the new manager of Tottenham.</td></tr>

Losses happen! Got to keep trusting our gut. Onto the next. 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: Iowa vs Wisconsin/ Wisconsin ML (-148) 4u

Write up: Part of what makes Vegas so profitable is how reactive the average Gambler is. A lot of gamblers would see Iowa fresh off a win against Nebraska and Wisconsin fresh off of a loss and scratch their head here. Let’s present the facts. Iowa is 3-5 on the road. Iowa is 1-5 against teams ranked in the AP Poll. Iowa’s offense has looked horrible to say the least recently. And what made Iowa win last game was how they schemed against the Huskers offense. It’s easy to prey on a team when you’re on your home court. But I just can’t see the Hawkeyes being able to scheme quite as well on the road. Especially with how potent this Badger offense can be. The only way, and I emphasize only, the Hawkeyes can control this game is if Wisconsin is lousy with the basketball. Otherwise I don’t see a sputtering offense marching in on the road and dismantling a Badgers team in need of a win. Wisconsin is currently a tournament team but nothing is guaranteed. A loss here hurts BAD, and we all know winning on the road is extremely hard to do, ESPECIALLY with a struggling offense. Stirtz is phenomenal, but he’s gonna need a lot of help tomorrow. Thanks to those tailing. Only gamble what you can afford to lose, let’s have a good weekend everyone!

Geng showed quality last night but picked a horrible game 3 draft to lose. Moving on. 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>: Korea | LCK | 3am Eastern | T1 vs DPlus KIA | Over 4.5 games | 3U @ +170

T1 had a poor showing vs Bnk Fearx and I don’t see them absolutely dominating DPlus KIA here. I think they will go a full 5 games to decide this one. 

BOL if failing

**My Record:** 79-73-4 (+3.22)

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>:** Macklin Celebrini o0.5 goals scored (Canada vs USA)

**Odds:** +180

**Units:** 2.00

Puck drop is 5:10AM PST. This is match 2 of a system I have for Macklin Celebrini to score a goal. Since this is a very important game it would not be surprising if the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> does not hit. As we know he has been a prolific goal scorer during his time at the Olympics. 

Should this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> not hit I will continue to make the same <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> going forward until it does. I double my units after each loss. Celebrini plays again with the Sharks on the 26th.

🦊 <mark style='background:#fff59d'>TODAY</mark> <mark style='background:#fff59d'>PICK</mark>: Y.Wu v J.P.Ficovich, C.Wong v A.Hernandez: **Wu ML + Wong to win in straight sets (1.60)** 🦊

🎾 ATP 500 Acapulco, 1:30 and 3:00 CET

🚨First match starts in 2 hours🚨

About first match: Wu is simply a machine on hard court and he’s facing an unchallenging opponent like Ficovich, who gives his best on clay and just doesn’t seem to have enough weapons to put pressure on Wu.  
  
About second match: Coleman Wong is a strong player, and he’s not used to have mental blackouts, which are what could cause him to lose a set against Hernandez, who could join the tournament through a Wild Card and seems to just be a lower stages player, normally competing on minor ITF tournaments. 

I was tempted to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> just Wu in straight sets, but he’s not as mentally strong as Wong, so i preferred to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> just the ML and add Wong’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>.

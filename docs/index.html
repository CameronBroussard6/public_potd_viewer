<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: NBA Spurs v Warriors 

1U Castle O6.5 assists @ $1.71, B365

Write-Up: Big slate tomorrow, wanted to find higher odds considering the number of games we have to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> from but unfortunately couldn’t find one, and this was my first look so sticking with it. 

The case for it is pretty clear - he’s cleared this in his last 4, going 8-13-13-11 taking on a play-making role. He doesn’t need 11 or 13, just 7. 

Warriors are coming off a B2B from playing the Thunder so hoping there’s some easier scoring routes with a bit of fatigue. They also concede the 4th least free throws per game in the comp, which is great as nothing more annoying than your assist play getting burnt on shooting fouls. The Warriors effective field goal (EFG) defense % is mid tier for the league, while the Spurs are 5th for attack for EFG %. 

As long as he gets his usual minutes &amp; usage, and the Warriors don’t get blown out too early, I think this is a neat <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, if potentially just a smidge too low odds ($1.75 would be ideal).</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>***Record:*** 4-1

***Last Pick:*** (Loss) Kelly Oubre Jr. +3.5 pts vs Derrick White (-114 Draftkings)

Oubre unfortunately couldn&#x27;t hit the water if he fell out of a boat last night. He also got into foul trouble so he was way under his average mins per game.



***<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:*** Grayson Allen -0.5 pts vs PJ Washington (-115 Draftkings)

***Reason:*** Allen just dropped 42 points last game and do I expect him to do that again? Well no, but I still like the way he&#x27;s playing this year averaging 18.6ppg. PJ Washington comes into tonight averaging 15.5ppg but with the return of AD tonight (hopefully) I could see some of his points going to him. Jalen Green is out again for the Suns so Allen should have increased minutes tonight which means more chances to score. GL!</td></tr>

<tr><td class='post'>Knicks -3.5 (-110) at Hornets, NBA, 7:30pm ET, 2u.

Hornets are in a 3-in-4 with travel and have been shaky on the glass; Knicks are top tier in defensive rebounding and free throw rate differential. My number makes this Knicks -6.1 with LaMelo questionable; even if he plays I get -4.8. Charlotte turns it over above league average and New York’s half-court defense is built to force late-clock jumpers where CHA’s shot quality falls off. Knicks bench has a cleaner net rating and should win the non-starter minutes. Model is a simple Elo plus four factors (shot quality, TO%, reb%, FT rate) adjusted for rest and player availability; excludes garbage time. YTD sides: 52-34, +10.8u, 9% ROI. I’d play this to -4 (-115).

For lines, I open Pinnacle for fair prices, compare promos on DraftKings, and use Betpanda when I need quick crypto deposits and fast live-bet settlement.

It was probably bothering him but Felix was definitely copping out. He’s now had time to recover and should be more than fine to take a set off Ben Shelton who under a no-injury-speculation match in these settings, would be the rightful underdog to FAA here. WORST case scenario, we’re insured by a retirement if he’s *actually* still hampered, gets smacked first set and then retires after to confirm injury speculations and avoid hate.

Bet 1 unit to win .74 units

Why: The Blazers just look like the better team right now. They’re putting up points in bunches, moving the ball well, and playing with confidence, while the Pelicans can’t seem to find any consistency on offense. Even with Portland’s defensive lapses, their scoring should be too much for a short-handed New Orleans squad to keep up with.

As for the Thunder, they’ve got everything clicking — energy, depth, and home momentum. They rebound better, defend harder, and don’t rely on one guy to get things done. The Lakers are running on fumes without their full lineup, and that’s a tough ask in OKC’s building. I’d roll with the Blazers and Thunder tonight — both are just in better form and have clearer paths to win.</td></tr>

Two big teams in this matchup, Bayern being top of the Bundesliga and Arsenal being the current title holders of the Champions League.

Bayern have scored in every single game in the past 10 matches. Arsenal have scored in 9 out of their last 10 matches.

Bayern have only kept a clean sheet in 5 of their last 10 matches and as Arsenal is the favorite in the matchup I think they don&#x27;t keep a clean sheet here.  
Arsenal have only kept a clean sheet in 3 of their last 10 matches. Both teams to score has hit in 7/10 last matches for Arsenal and 5/10 last matches for Bayern.

Back after a little break and starting with a win here feels nice. After a slow start Lowry cleared 92 yards. Although a little sweaty, once he got his passing game moving the rushing yardage started to clock up and he executed in the final quarter.

**Todays <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** NCAAF - Central Michigan v Buffalo - *Ta-Quan Roberson o209.5 Passing -* $1.85 - 4 Units

Chips are good for 66th in the country for passing yardage allowed with 224 per game.

We did see Buffalo revert to more of a running game in their last win but Roberson hit this line the previous 3 games including a massive 402 yard game with 36, 38 and 55 attempts respectively.

Bulls haven’t had much difficulty scoring points this year, averaging 25.6 ppg with a game low 17 points and that’s been largely due to Roberson’s passing game. 

His failure to execute in the last game saw the rush being utilised so I’m happy to scrap that performance. I think we will see a return to normal service here and Roberson should give himself plenty of opportunities to get on a roll against a below average pass defence.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Ben Shelton over 12.5 Games Won (-165)

Russ cashes this easily; covers just on the basis of his points and assists and cashes every ladder up to 32, plus multiple rebound/assist parlays of 6/6, 7/7 and 8/8.  Books continue to undervalue him this season, going to be hitting it for the foreseeable future.

For <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> I&#x27;m backing Ben Shelton to win over 12.5 games.  I also like his moneyline but like this one a little more because ultimately it comes down to this: is it more likely that the match is a quick blowout one way or another or that Felix beats Ben? In my opinion, with two of the top servers in the game both in excellent form in recent months (both legitimately playing the best tennis of their careers), I&#x27;m seeing a competitive match.  The worry here is that a) Felix has been great so he could definitely win this one, or conversely b) Felix has been injured and might not be 100% tomorrow.  That said, I still think this should cash if not in 3 sets then with Shelton winning something like 7-6 6-4.  Personally I will be playing a couple units on both this and the Shelton ML, but forced to choose just one for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> I&#x27;m going with over 12.5 Games.

Should be one hell of a match; I already have my alarm set.  Good to be back posting picks for the degen community which I hold near and dear to my heart.  BOL if you tail.</td></tr>

\- Wemby has had 9(!) 3FG Attempts in the past 2 games with the return of Fox. 

\- He made 6 Threes last game. While certainly an outlier, we can expect some more attempts after such a successful night.

\- Warriors middle of the pack (rank 16) in allowing Threes to Centers

\- In the past week, Jokic and Chet (C) have both made 2 Threes against this Warriors defense

\- Also expect Steph&#x27;s aura / shooting to incentivize some Wemby attempts

\- Case in point: in his last 3 games vs the Warriors he&#x27;s shot from 3: 4/13, 3/10, 3/9

What a game. Back in the winners column, and my god was that fun. I can’t lie that when embiid got ruled out, I actually liked the play even more. What a game, and finally got a W betting against Boston . Theory didn’t hold up for why I’m fading them, but regardless a W. 

Back at it tomorrow, and keeping write up short again, but love this play. 

**Pistons -2.5**

Okay, these are two teams have had basically completely opposite seasons so far this young season.

Detroit started the season 2-2, losing to the Bulls in their first game, and my cavs a few games in, however they are currently on a 7gm win streak since that loss in October. I will say Detroit has been playing the bottom of the league in this streak, however a 7 game win streak is still impressive this early in the season.

Bulls on the other hand started the season 5-0, however now are 1-4 since then. The bulls have lost to the top of the league only losing by 10+ in 2 of those. Their 4 loses were against knicks, bucks, cavs and spurs. IMO those teams top 7-8 In the league. 

The stats, also show the bulls are the better team on paper. The bulls are the top half of the league in almost all O &amp; D categories, while the pistons rank towards the bottom in some of the key areas. For example, Pistons are 17th in opp 3pt %, while bulls are 4th in 3pt %. The one advantage I do think Detroit has in on the glass. The pistons crash hard on both ends, and are IMO the scariest O rebounding team in the league, and at home I see that being a big part of the game. 

With all that being said; you’d think the bulls were the right side, however this is a bet on my belief that Detroit js in the same tier as the those teams. Yes, they’ve had a cushy road to this win streak, however that is exactly what a young team needs to start the season. Momentum.

I know this isn’t the most conniving angle to boast a bet, but I just really think Detroit wins this at home tomorrow. I have paid close attention to Detroit all season, and just think this team is going to be a tough out and compete with the top teams in the league this season. I also think they bulls overachieved and we are getting value with their hot start this season. 

Right now Cade is Q, so I may regret making this play so early. Giddey is also Q for the bulls so hopefully he does play, while Cade doesn’t.</td></tr>

Event: North Texas @ Oregon st (8:30pm central)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: North Texas +3 (-120)

-everything is bet to win unit amount-

Write up: 

You know this is one of those games where I just think the wrong team is favored. My power ratings make this North Texas -1.5, and I’m gladly taking the points. We may as well call this squad the North Texas Vikings, because head coach Daniyal Robinson brought three starters with him from a Cleveland State team that consistently contended in the Horizon League. Robinson’s teams are gritty, pesky, and tough — his Cleveland State unit finished 73rd in defensive efficiency last season, and he’s clearly instilled that same identity in Denton.


Both teams this year have played at a snail’s pace, ranking in the bottom 30 nationally in tempo, which makes a close, grind-it-out game highly likely. That’s exactly the kind of environment where taking the points makes sense. Oregon State’s two wins this season have come by just 2 and 3 points, respectively.
Now let’s talk numbers. North Texas has the edge in nearly every statistical category. They’re shooting 39.1% from three compared to Oregon State’s 31.6%. From the field overall, North Texas is hitting 48.3% of their shots, while Oregon State sits at 43.2%. On the glass, North Texas holds a rebounding percentage of 52.4%, slightly better than Oregon State’s 50.1%. Defensively, North Texas is allowing opponents to shoot just 32.7% from the field, while Oregon State has allowed 45.8%.


The rim protection disparity is massive. North Texas averages 7.0 blocks per game, while Oregon State is averaging just 0.7. That’s not a typo — it’s a real gap in interior defense. Turnovers are another key edge: Oregon State coughs it up 16.0 times per game, which ranks near the bottom nationally, while North Texas commits just 11.0 turnovers per game, well above average. On the flip side, North Texas is generating 7.3 steals per game, compared to Oregon State’s 4.5.


Strength of schedule is relatively even, with Oregon State getting a slight nod, but not enough to offset the statistical dominance. North Texas also has an extra game under their belt, sitting at 3-0, while Oregon State is 2-0. Continuity matters, and that’s another edge for the Mean Green. Oregon State’s roster is still gelling — several players are underclassmen and international recruits who haven’t played together much. Meanwhile, North Texas has a core that’s already battle-tested and cohesive.


And it’s not just the numbers — it’s how they’re winning. North Texas held Loyola to just 32.7% shooting in their last game, showing they can impose their defensive will on the road. Oregon State, meanwhile, allowed opponents to shoot 45.8%, which is a major liability against a disciplined team like UNT. North Texas also forced 12 turnovers and grabbed 8 steals in that game, continuing their trend of creating extra possessions through pressure defense.


In a game with a total set at 136, we’re expecting a low-possession, defensive slugfest. That favors the team with better efficiency, better rim protection, and fewer mistakes — and that’s North Texas across the board. I’ll gladly take the 3 with the Vikings of Denton. Let’s bounce back big fellas and preserve our record of no b2b losses, as always, cheers 🍻</td></tr>

NCAAB // Prairie View A&amp;M Panthers @ Oklahoma State Cowboys

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Oklahoma State -32.5 (-105) 1u**



Oklahoma State welcomes in Prairie View A&amp;M in a tune up game that embarrasses all other tune up games. Prairie View A&amp;M is projected to be one of the worst teams in one of the worst conferences in the country. Their last game out they played Wichita State, who sits at #108 in KenPom, and got laughed off the court losing by 43 points, 62-105. They put Wichita State to the line 41 times and had 2 players foul out. They also only went 2/16 from 3 for 12.5%, yikes. Prairie View A&amp;M is truly awful. 

  
Oklahoma State on the other hand has looked great so far this season as they try to follow up their NIT run with an NCAA tournament appearance this year. They are 2-0 on the season beating both Oral Robberts and Texas A&amp;M by 24 points. Both teams ranked higher than Prairie View. Also worth noting Oklahoma State came into the Texas A&amp;M as a slight underdog and still took care of business controlling the game from the opening tip. 

Oklahoma State: #51 in KenPom, 

Prairie View A&amp;M: #341 in KenPom

Oklahoma State 2-0 ATS covering by an average margin of +14.8pts.

Prairie View A&amp;M 0-1 ATS not covering by -22.5pts. 

If Prairie View and Oklahoma State both keep up their same level of play, this game should be a blowout similar to Prairie View&#x27;s last outing and a comfortable cover.</td></tr>

Last Pick: Toronto Raptors -9.5 vs Brooklyn Nets @ 1.91. 3U. ✅

Raptors gave up 7 pts without return in the last 90 seconds of the game to make it seem closer than it was, but it still covers. We now have a 3 game winning streak on favorites spreads, going to continue riding this wave.

 

Next <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **Atlanta Hawks -3.5 vs Sacramento Kings @ 1.91**. 3U play.

The Kings play the Nuggets later tonight, and then play the Hawks tomorrow on a B2B. The Kings have an aging squad and given the late tip off tonight, I fully expect fatigue to play a role against the Hawks. Even without that factor, the Hawks have looked good, most recently pulling the big upset against the Lakers and beating the Clippers. Trae remains out, but the squad has adapted to his absence and are playing some good basketball. The Kings squad is a mismatch of aging talent and while a few guys can pop off, they are nowhere near as fluid and consistent as the Hawks.

 

*This line is available on DK. I’d play it to -4.0.*</td></tr>

Last Pick: Roman Andres Burruchaga ML vs Federico Agustin Gomez (-200, 2 units): Win

Tennis | Montevideo Challenger | 6:00 PM EST (estimated)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Vilius Gaubas vs Ignacio Buse | **Buse ML at -112 (DK). 1 unit.**

Write-up: Burruchaga closed at -335, and while he should have been able to serve it out at 5-4 in the second set, he was able to get the job done in the end. That win officially brought me back into the green for the first time in a while - I know that I&#x27;ve a lot of ups and downs as a capper, but at the end of the day, breaking even isn&#x27;t the worst outcome in a world where most people lose money. I hope that I can stay in the green as the sample size gets larger, and my next goal is to reach my highest unit return ever again. 

This should be a good matchup between two of the top performers in clay Challengers this season, Ignacio &quot;Nacho&quot; Buse and Vilius Gaubas. My reasoning here is actually pretty simple: I believe that the market is overvaluing the head-to-head. These players have faced off on clay twice this season, once in April in Menorca and once in Lisbon in September, with Gaubas winning two closely contested matches. What interests me, however, is that Buse closed at around -220 in both matches. In fact, Buse was pushed to those closing odds from an opening line of -189 in Menorca, meaning the market ultimately was not concerned by the first result.

As for the second match, it couldn&#x27;t have been much closer considering that it was a straight-setter. Buse won 56.0% of his service points compared to Gaubas&#x27;s 58.3%, and Gaubas also benefited from first serve percentages in that match. The performance rating told a similar story, with Gaubas earning a 7.31 while Buse earned a 7.16. The players seemed to be on pretty even footing, with Buse finding some nice attacking patterns to disrupt Gaubas&#x27;s heavy topspin.

Has anything happened since that second match to justify the price moving this much for the third? Not really, in my opinion. Gaubas followed up his Lisbon performance with a final in Braga, but then struggled after moving to South American clay, and didn&#x27;t look all that great in the first round against David Jorda Sanchis (7.16/10). In comparison, Nacho has been playing in this conditions for a few straight weeks, scoring some decent results in two Lima events and then crushing Timofey Skatov in the opening round here (7.98/10). Buse&#x27;s more attacking game is theoretically better on faster European clay, but the oddsmakers have still been pricing him as a high-end CH player here is SA, as he closed as a heavy favorite against solid players like Joao Reis Da Silva and Alvaro Guillen Meza. 

The conditions tomorrow should be similar to what Buse experienced in Lima, with mild temperatures, moderate winds, and high humidity, and I think his big groundstrokes should still be able to shine even if the courts aren&#x27;t the fastest. 

A lot of clay grinders, like Gonzalo Bueno and Sebastian Baez, have already struggled here in Montevideo, and I was even a bit surprised at how much difficulty Burruchaga had with Gomez&#x27;s big serve and forehand. Overall, I have no reason to believe that Buse won&#x27;t be able to use his superior serve and willingness to go for his shots to his advantage here, and I&#x27;m happy to take him at the best price he&#x27;s been available at in this matchup.

Yesterday&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Merthyr Town vs South Shields BTTS and o2.5 3u @ $1.80✅

Covered before half time, which is always good. 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Atletico MG to win vs Fortaleza 3u @ $1.61

Again, not a lot on <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> (midweek during international breaks can be grim... to the point where I&#x27;m even backing Bahamas to win) but I don&#x27;t mind this...

Mid-table Atletico MG hosts second-last Fortaleza in Brazil. Both teams are actually in decent form considering their league positions. Atletico are 3-1-1 in their last five, winning their last two games. This puts them second in the form table in the previous five games. Fortaleza are 1-3-1 in their last five, drawing three in a row. 

Atletico are a far better side at home, with 30 points at home compared to 13 away; They&#x27;ve also got a +10 goal difference at home compared to an even one away. 

Fortaleza are one of the worst teams in the league away from home this season, with 9 points in 15 away games and a -15 goal difference. Compare this form to 21 home points in 17 games.

Fortaleza will also be without Matheus Pereira, who got a red card late last match. He&#x27;s been in and out of the team, but if he&#x27;s not starting, is usually one of the first off the bench and will be missed. 

All in all, while there&#x27;s not a lot on - I think Atletico should win this at home and the $1.61 price works for me.</td></tr>

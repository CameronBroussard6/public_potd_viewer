Soo much eye candy <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Many simple wins here and there, but my job is to find the high odds games that give the highest wins possible. Lets keep the pattern up, because it will pay big once it hits. Aston Villa is back in shape now. The game <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> should be a testament on how strong they really are and how well their season will go. Bournemouth might be exposed <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> by the attacking quality from Aston Villa. I&#x27;m expecting at least 3-0 here or something similar, but anything can happen in football. Good luck everyone.

Last Pick: Martin Schindler ML vs Luke Woodhouse

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: Van veen ML vs Nijman 

Sport: Darts, Grand Slam

Reasoning: Van Veen’s three-dart average this season sits at around 97.99, significantly higher than Nijman’s 94.85 average.  ￼ Nijman is talented but less consistent at televised majors and his finishing sits behind Van Veen’s documented 44.95% checkout.

Rachaad White U 44.5 rushing yards -118 at BetMGM

In 4 games since replacing Bucky Irving, White has only covered this number once. Now he faces a patriots defense that holds opponents to the fewest rush yards per game in the league. Last week Bijan Robinson BARELY hit this number at 46 yards and he’s a few levels ahead of White in terms of skill and explosion. Also it appears to be a time share situation with Sean Tucker getting 12 carries in their last game with the Saints.  I would be shocked if this one doesn’t hit. </td></tr>

**Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** ***Spurs v Man U: over 2,5 goals(1.66) + AC Milan to win(1.61) @ 2.69 -- 3 units❌***

**Summary:** AC Milan giving away a 2-0 lead making our losing streak 4. 1 right 1 wrong AGAIN, this will be the last double before I&#x27;m stepping to singles again.

**Write up:**

**Dundee v Rangers**

Dundee is sitting 11th after 11 games in the Premiership with only 9 points, the points mostly came from wins against Celtic and Livingston, Celtic was struggling at the time and Livingston is in last place. They&#x27;ve only managed to score 9 times so far this season and the only worrying fact in this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> is that the previous match between these two ended in a 1-1 draw in matchweek 2 this season. I looked into that game and Rangers were the better side even after a red card in the second half. Dundee is obviously a team fighting for relegation this season and Rangers have started to look good enough to beat them.

**AZ v PSV**

This is a big game in the Dutch Eredivisie, 2nd v 3rd, although there is 4 points difference. AZ has picked up decent form recently and PSV has showed to be able to beat top teams. Clashes between the top teams in the top flight mean goals this season: Feyenoord - PSV (2-3), Ajax - AZ (0-2), AZ - Feyenoord (3-3), PSV - Ajax (2-2) and now AZ - PSV will be a goal scoring fest in my opinion. PSV have held a clean sheet in only 2 of their 16 games so far this season. AZ have scored in EVERY match (19) this season but one in all competitions (4-0 loss to Larnaca, 2&#x27; minute red card). PSV have seen 82% of their matches feature more then 3 goals, AZ 73%. PSV average 4.64 goals per game, AZ 3.36. Both teams to score has hit in 73% of the matches for both teams.

Best of luck if tailing! 🍀

Recap:
Welp, ngl I’ve been telling my friends I secretly thought Nix was a fraud but didn’t have any data to back it up, guess now I do….

Game: New Orleans Saints vs Carolina Panthers 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: 2U Panthers -5.5

Reasoning:

The Panthers are sneakily becoming a good nfl team. Bryce Young is finally developing and they’ve found a new star in their offense in Rico Dowdle, they are 4-0 in their last 4 games with Bryce Young  starting. Meanwhile the Saints are on the struggle bus with a new quarterback seemingly even worse than Rattler, they have been putrid of late averaging only 9 pts per game over the last 3 games. 

The real reason to hammer this with confidence is the Panthers massive differential in home/away splits. For whatever reason, they are averaging a whopping 10 pts more at home on offense (24 v 14). Expect the new Panthers team to continue making a sneaky push for a wildcard team with another dominant division win.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: [NFL] Treveyon Henderson 40+ Rushing Yards (Fanatics -140) NE vs TB 1:00 PM

Analysis: This is more of a value play than anything as most other books have this line priced at -150 or higher. Treveyon Henderson steps back into the lead back role this week with Rhamondre Stevenson out for the second consecutive week. Henderson is facing a Tampa Bay defense who has given up over 100 rushing yards in each of the last 4 games and 5/L6. Henderson received 14 carries vs ATL last week in the lead role and managed 55 rushing yards. Also worth noting is that he gained 75 yards on 10 carries with Stevenson healthy in Week 8. Henderson has the explosiveness to clear this line in just a couple runs, and he should receive a similar workload to last week. 40 rushing yards should be very feasible for Henderson on 12-15+ carries.

I will note. Henderson might cede a few carries to Terrell Jennings but Henderson will start and receive the majority of touches out of the New England backfield. 

Thank you to everyone who has tailed and interacted so far. Trust the process!⏰

Last time they played the rams he went 4/4 of FG. Ninners have a lot of injuries ans have trouble scoring in the red zone so that gives him lots of chances.

The haas i think have a slightly better car overall this week which should give ocon an edge and I know its gabi&#x27;s home race but the confidence drain + the fact the car isn&#x27;t as good as it is anymore, I&#x27;m confident with this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> the most

I really don’t understand why the # is what it is.

**Orlando -3.5 vs Boston**

First thing I have to mention is, this is a rematch from Friday. Same building, same teams, same basic storyline. Orlando just beat Boston 123–110 in their NBA Cup matchup. The Magic finally decided to hit shots from deep, going 17-of-35 from three and ripping off a 17–4 run late in the fourth after Boston had clawed back to take the lead. That wasn’t some fluky win, Orlando controlled a lot of that game, Boston chased, and when it came time to close, the Magic had more answers.

On the season, Orlando is 4–5 but better than that record suggests. They’re scoring 117.0 points per game and allowing 116.8, basically a wash. They do have a top-10-ish defense by efficiency (112.9 ORtg, 110.3 DRtg) and something I think they will be even higher when the season ends. They’re also winning the glass by +3.2 rebounds per game (45.1 vs 41.9), which matters a lot when you’re playing a Boston team that’s quietly getting bullied on the boards. I mean I dogged Queta in one of my Boston fades a few plays back, but holy shit is he impressed me. Boston is a totally different squad when he is on the floor. I mean this guy is +82 +/-, and the next closest player on the team is +44. Insane.

The top of Orlando’s roster is really good. Franz Wagner is at 22/ 6 / 4 on almost 50% from the field, Banchero’s at 22 / 9 / 4, basically playing point-forward and living at the line, and Bane gives them 15 a night (think this will increase as season goes on also) as a much-needed perimeter scorer. Wendell adds 12 and almost 8 boards, plus he can stretch you just enough to drag bigs away from the rim. This is a real front four. This isn’t the old “young, cute Magic” anymore, they have actual shot creation and mismatches. I don’t think these numbers reflect what the talent is on this team, as going into the season, everyone seemed to be very high on them.

Boston right now is a weird mix: 4–6 overall, but with a +2.3 scoring differential because the defense is still very real. They’re putting up 113.0 PPG and giving up 110.7, which ranks top-3 in the league on the defensive side. This season is Brown’s show, and while Brown has been awesome (28 PPG), the margin for error shrinks a lot, based on their current roster. I think Boston is in this weird spot, where they have “championship” players, but are not actually alive for competing for the championship. IMO they need to tank, and get a top <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> this season, but these guys do not know how to do that.

Stat-wise, Boston’s flaws match up nicely with what Orlando does well. The Celtics are getting out-rebounded by 3.2 per game, while Orlando is one of those teams that can punish that across 48 minutes, not just in stretches. Banchero and Wagner are big, physical wings, Carter crashes, even the role guys get involved on the glass. This isn’t the matchup where Boston’s “we’ll just spread you out and outshoot you” fix magically solves itself either: they hit 14.8 threes per game (top-6 volume) but on only 32.2% shooting from deep (27th). High volume, mediocre efficiency, and now in a building they just shot poorly in two days ago.

Orlando, by the way, isn’t some flamethrower from three overall. They’re only at 11.1 made threes per game (26th) and 35.1% from deep on the season. Friday was them hitting the “high end” of their variance. I’m not banking on another 17 threes. What I am banking on is the stuff that’s repeatable. Their size, their physicality, their rebounding, and the fact that they can keep getting downhill at a Boston team that’s undersized at the four and already struggling to keep guys off the offensive glass.

Market-wise, this is interesting. Books opened around Magic -4.5, and we’re now sitting at Magic -3.5 pretty much across the board, with moneylines in the -160 / +130 range. That kind of move usually means money came in on Boston +4.5 / +4 and dragged the number down. So yeah, if anything, the “smart” side by the screen is probably Celtics +4 early. I’m aware of that. I just don’t care enough to jump to the dog here, and not what I am seeing when I watch these teams play, or look at their talent.

Orlando just beat this exact team by 13 in this exact building. They have the better health, the stronger front line, the better rebounding profile, and a defense that’s good enough to make Boston’s shoot-the-lights-out path to covering pretty slim unless they go nuts from three. Boston can absolutely keep this close if Brown goes nuclear and the shooters finally hit their open looks, but that’s kind of where they’re living right now. Hoping threes fall and they don’t get crushed on the boards, on the road. 4-game win streak ended, and love this play to get another started. 

PS: Bucks +3.5 is another bet I love. Anyone who has followed me knows my thoughts on the Greek freak (probable as of typing this), and as much as I like Houston, and Reed Sheppard specifically, man do they need a PG. My boy Ryan Rollins will eat him alive.</td></tr>

Both teams are screaming BTTS.  Celta in their last 15 games have had 13 BTTS, and only 1 non BTTS match in their whole la liga season so far.  

And as for Barca in La Liga, all their away games were BTTS except for the one at Mallorca, and 8 out of 13 of all Barca games have been in BTTS.  And in all competitions Barca&#x27;s last 9 games have been BTTS in a row.

As for this fixture&#x27;s history, in 8 out of last 10 matches, this fixture has ended in BTTS.  Barca is famously playing a high suicide line, thanks to Flick, and opposing teams are easily creating chances on the counter.  Barca will definitely score at Celta, but I feel Celta might score once or twice.  You can even go for BTTS and over 2.5 goals this game for extra sauce.</td></tr>

Start Time &amp; TV: 1:00pm EST (FOX &amp; CBS)

Units: 2.75 Units

Reasoning: For this NFL sunday I like riding with the Buffalo Bills who are taking on the Miami Dolphins and the Carolina Panthers who are taking on the New Orleans Saints. The Bills (6-2) are coming off an impressive win last week against the Kansas City Chiefs where they controlled the majority of that game and they have already faced these Dolphins and despite not playing their best game and having a slow first half they still defeated these Dolphins by 10 points so I like them to continue their momentum and complete their two game sweep against Miami this year as Miami (2-7) is having a disaster year this year. I also like going with the Carolina Panthers (5-4) who have won 4 out of 5 of their past games including coming off an impressive road win against the Packers last week. Carolina has been particularly good at establishing the run game and pounding the rock this year as they are 5th in the NFL in rushing yards per game with 140 a game on average and they are facing an unimpressive rush defense as the Saints rank 25th in rushing defense and they let up over 170 yards on the ground last week against the Rams. The Saints (1-8) also have an abysmal offense as they rank second to last in the NFL in points per game only averaging 15 points a contest and in their past 2 games combined they have only 13 points and they benched Spencer Rattler but I dont believe Tyler Shough will solve this offenses problems and in his first NFL start last week he did not impress at all so I dont think he will be getting his first NFL win in this one.

Prediction: 20-12 Carolina, 31-17 Buffalo

Last pick:🏈Indiana -3/Georgia -3💰Indiana leg pushed but luckily that was the leg with more juice so we still profit over a unit. Not exactly what we wanted but well take profit any day of the week.

Honestly everything that went wrong did, Inter just played terribly as a team that should have at least won this game 4-0, they ended up only winning 2-1 which is terrible for their standards as they were -5000 favorites going into this game. OKC also somehow ended up losing to the Blazers after being up 20+ somehow to end their 16 consecutive game winning streak vs them. 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s match: Carlos Alcaraz vs Alex DeMinaur (Tennis/ATP Finals) &amp; Roma vs Udinese (Soccer/Serie A)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Alcaraz ML + Roma ML (+102, MGM)

Alcaraz recently lost his world number 1 title after ATP Paris when he lost to Cam Norrie and he has the chance to get it back in the ATP Finals as long as he makes it to the Semi Finals. Winning this event is definitely seen as a big achievement as it is the second most prestigious title in tennis after the slams and Carlos will have his ranking and the trophy as motivation to perform well here. Alex DeMinaur is no slouch on indoor hard courts as he pushed Alcaraz to 3 sets on this same surface earlier this year but Alcaraz was able to win pushing his H2H record vs DeMinaur to 4-0. Alcaraz has done well on hard courts this year and I still think vs a motivated Alcaraz the only guy who can compete with him is Sinner so I&#x27;m putting my faith in him <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.

Roma have generally owned this matchup, winning 5 straight against Udinese. They&#x27;ve also been fairly consistent recently, picking up wins against Parma, Sassuolo, Fiorentina and Verona while losing to Inter and Milan. They might not be punching above their weight but they are taking care of business against teams below them. They will also be at home <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> which they generally perform very well. BOL and bet responsibly.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:**  Man City Draw-no-bet &amp; Gil Vicente Draw-no-bet@1.84(Usual 3 units)

**Leg 1**:  Manchester City – Draw-no-bet

City host Liverpool in a classic clash of heavyweights in the Premier League. City enter this game in good form and with confidence after their midweek Champions League win against Dortmund by 4-1. They have now won 6 straight at home in all competitions, scoring 19 while conceding only 3 goals.

Meanwhile Liverpool have found form of their own, especially after showing cohesiveness and great dynamics in their 1-0 win over Real Madrid. Although reds come into this match on an extra days’ rest, let’s not forget they have lost 6 of their last 9 matches including 4 out of 5 away matches.

Only one point separate the two sides in the league table. But the reason I believe City does not lose this match, is that this will be Coach Pep Guardiola’s 1,000 career match as a manager. With the home crowd on a milestone day, I think the players will deliver for their boss at Liverpool’s expense. If they tie, we get a push, and they still celebrate.

**Leg 2**:  Gil Vicente– Draw-no-bet

Portuguese League 4^(th) placed Gil Vicente visit last placed AVS in what appears as a complete mismatch. AVS playing at home provides no advantage to them, as they have failed to win 12 of their 13 matches at home since the start of February, losing nine games in that time.  Even worse, AVS has yet to register a single win all season.

Gil Vicente on the other hand are looking to surpass last year’s point total with a win at AVS. They are looking to contend for European cup competition should they maintain their place near the top of the table.  Gil’s improved performance is attributed to their defense which has allowed only 4 goals all season.

AVS simply lacks the firepower to cause Gil Vicente any issues up front. Similarly they also lack the defense to stop Gil’s attack. Worst case, they tie and it’s a push for us.</td></tr>

**Write Up:** Red Bull struggled during qualifying yesterday, with Max qualifying P16, which means he will start from 16th in the race. If he stays with his current setup and starts from 16th, he will definitely struggle to make his way up to the front. On the other hand, if they change the setup, Max has to start from the pit lane, and will be very far from the front, with a setup that is uncertain. With these regulations where you have to be a lot faster than the car ahead to overtake, I believe that Max will struggle to make his way up to the top 6.

Event: SNF Steelers @ Chargers 6:20MST
 
Write Up: This primetime showdown features the Steelers 27th ranked defense on yards allowed (72.6) against tight ends in the league. Since bursting onto the scene in week 6, Gadsden has made a major impact on the Chargers passing game. He has quickly become the tight end the chargers have been missing and an effective safety cushion for Herbert and has earned himself a major role in the target share among the receivers on the team. In Gadsden&#x27;s last 4 games he has cleared this line easily with 68, 164, 77 and 68 yards. With LA&#x27;s injuries to the O-Line and most significantly Joe Alt going out for the season I expect the Chargers to get the ball out quickly and utilizing Oronde&#x27;s versatility in the passing game as often as they can. I believe this line could be used up to 60 yards as I think the books haven&#x27;t quite caught up to Gadsden&#x27;s usage in this Chargers offense.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: 🏈 Ravens ML + Derrick Henry 70+ alt rushing yards (-105).

Game starts at 1pm EST. Bet 3.5u

Writeup: Let&#x27;s get a streak going again and get over 30u for the first time all in one bet. You could honestly substitute a lot of teams at their ML (Bills, Seahawks, Lions, etc), but I wanted to make this easier and have both legs come from the same game.

Last week I bet against J.J. McCarthy, and this week I&#x27;m betting against the team. McCarthy looked solid for someone who has only played 3 games in the NFL, but he also looked like someone who&#x27;s only played 3 games in the NFL. The Ravens now have Lamar and many defensive players back and absolutely whooped the Dolphins 28-6 last week. Even with a losing record, this is still one of the premier teams in the NFL. The Vikings still need some time to figure themselves out now that they too have multiple players coming back from injury, although it is very likely starting RB Aaron Jones will be getting limited snaps as he will be playing slightly injured. Only a few teams have been able to effectively run against the Ravens, and this was with all of their injuries. Slightly more teams have been effective against the Ravens passing defense, but this was again with many of the Ravens star defenders out. J.J. McCarthy and Justin Jefferson will be a deadly combo in the future, but there&#x27;s still clearly some fine tuning that needs to be worked out. This goes for the other receivers too, as TE T.J. Hockenson has practically been invisible to McCarthy in all of his starts. The Vikings are getting there, but they&#x27;re not where they need to be yet.

The more prominent side of this comes from the Ravens offense against the Vikings. Lamar is back, and that completely changes the game for all players involved...I don&#x27;t need to give you stats regarding how much of a difference he makes on vs off the field. This also helps Derrick Henry, as the Vikings now need to gameplan for 2 elite rushers. Vikings are the 20th best rush defense in the league and have let multiple players go over 100 rushing yards against them, specifically elite or bell cow RBs, of which Henry is both. In his last 3 games, Henry has rushed for 122, 71, and 119 yards. He&#x27;s been averaging about 80 rushing yards a game this season and his over/under is set at 81 yards.

Separately, sometimes other kinds of statistics and numbers really push a player to achieve, such as milestones. It is very likely that Henry&#x27;s high school rushing record will get broken this month, and talks about this have started to grow, with Henry directly mentioning it recently. Situations like that often do have subtle motivational effects, especially for players like Derrick Henry whose identity and career are deeply tied to their legacy as dominant runners. If someone’s close to breaking it, even though he can’t protect it in any direct way, it can absolutely rekindle that prove-it mentality.

With all of that being said, I think Henry should be able to effectively run the ball now that Lamar is back against a weaker Vikings rushing defense. He should get to 70+ rushing yards, and the Ravens should win this game outright against a Vikings team that still has some issues to get over.

Event: NFL Football Pittsburgh Steelers (5-3) @ Los Angeles Chargers (6-3) 11/9 8:20PM EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Steelers ML +130 (1 Unit)

Write up: This prime time AFC showdown features two playoff caliber teams coming off of wins. Pittsburgh took down the previously 7-1 Colts at home while LA outlasted the Titans in Tennessee. On paper this matchup seems pretty close but due to key injuries and a recent momentum shift, Pittsburgh has an edge.

The Steelers have had a classic Mike Tomlin season up to this point. Led by Aaron Rodgers, they have had a combination of impressive wins and head scratching losses in 2025. But last weekend may have been a turning point. The most expensive defense in football showed up in a major way last week, forcing 6 turnovers and registering 5 sacks against the impressive Indianapolis offense. 

The Chargers have caught a serious case of the injury bug over the past few weeks. Star OT Joe Alt was placed on IR last week, and they will also be without OT Bobby Hart this week. They have several other notable players either out or questionable, but the offensive line injuries are the most crucial for this Sundays game.

Unfortunately, injuries are going to play a major role in this matchup, and Pittsburgh will be the beneficiary. I expect the Steelers to dominate in the trenches, especially now that they’ve found their rhythm. Justin Herbert will be running around all night, and he won’t be able to bail out the Chargers like he did last week against Tennessee. I’m taking Pittsburgh for this one. BOL to those tailing, let’s do some winning!</td></tr>

Last Pick: Justice Hill under 2.5 receptions (-120) 1.2U to win 1U ✅

NFL | Jaguars @ Texans 1 PM ET

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Nico Collins over 21.5 longest reception (-110) 1U

Write-Up: This is a line that historically sits around 24.5 or 25.5 each game and is down to 21.5 for this game. Now the obvious reason for this is Davis Mills starting at QB in place of CJ Stroud. This is obviously a downside to Nico Collins upside, but even then his total receiving yards line stills sits at the same place as it normally does at 64.5. In fact, this is 4 yards higher than it was last game when it was at 60.5. So the books are projecting Nico Collins to have similar production with Mills, but are shorting his longest reception by 4 yards.

When Davis Mills came in for injured Stroud last week, he connected on a 26 yard completion to Collins on his second play in, which would have cashed this line. He also looked at Collins repeatedly throughout the game, giving him 8 targets in 3 quarters. Collins has went over 21.5 for his longest reception in 5/7 games this year and 12/14 games last year. In Davis Mills last full season playing QB he averaged 39.7 yards for his longest pass per game. Last year CJ Stroud averaged 36.8 yards for his longest pass per game and this was the year where Collins went 12/14 on going over 21.5 yards. Therefore, I don’t think the reduction from 25.5 to 21.5 is justified.</td></tr>

**Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Parker Washington o3.5 receptions ✅️

**Game:** NFL: Jaguars @ Texans, 12pm CDT

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Nico Collins o64.5 receiving yards (-114 on FD)

**Rationale:**

The Jaguars come into this game surrendering an average of 256 passing yards per game to their opponents, including 7.9 receptions and 96 receiving yards to teams&#x27; primary receiving target. Simply put, the Jaguar passing defense is a bottom-tier unit in the league, and it has been all season.

On the opposite end of the spectrum, the Jaguar rushing defense has been very good, giving up just 86.9 rushing yards per game. Teams have struggled to run on the Jags all year, and the Texans&#x27; hodgepodge group will likely run into similar issues.

Nico himself is averaging 4.7 receptions and 59.1 receiving yards per game this season, but the Texans have had to face some tough defenses, including Denver last week. However, he has torched the Jags over his career. He has averaged 102.4 receiving yards against them over the last 5 meetings, including an 8 reception, 104 receiving yard line earlier this season.

  
The big variable here is the absence of C.J. Stroud. He is certainly better than Davis Mills, but Mills has been serviceable throughout his career, and the Jags have a history of being killed by backup QBs (see Jake Browning tossing for nearly 300 yards in 2.5 quarters in week 2). 

  
When Mills entered the game in the 2nd quarter last week, he targeted Collins 4 times for 4 receptions and 66 yards, 5 for 5 if you discount a holding call. Coming out of half-time, the elite Denver D completely shut down the Texas offense. The Jags have been unable to shut down anybody this year.

  
After all was said and done last Sunday, Collins accounted for 1/3rd of Mills&#x27;s completions. He loves to target Nico, and the Jags love to leave a team&#x27;s #1 option wide open. Just last week, Bowers destroyed them for 12 receptions and 130+ yards, and this has been a theme all year.

  
I like Nico to go ham on the Jags again tomorrow, just as he has done his whole career.</td></tr>

Event: La Liga ⚽️

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Rayo Vallecano +1.5 corner handicap vs Real Madrid (or +2 European corner handicap) 4U @ 1.95 (Bet365)

Write-up: A nice sweat-free <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> as we love them. Sargeant missed a good chance in the first minute and the timeless Bannan scored a screamer 3 minutes later in a pretty even first half. Wednesday were leading the corner count 3-1 at the that point. Second half though was all about the Owls who were by far the better side. This is football though so being the more dominant side isn’t enough and moments after a truly terrible miss by Lowe, Norwich equalised through Kvistgaarden and the score ended 1-1. On the corners front, Sheffield finished on 9 to the Canaries’ 4.

Rayo Vallecano were the surprise package of La Liga last season, earning a Conference League spot with an 8th place finish to boot. This season has expectedly been a bit tougher but currently still sit in 11th and have given some very tough games to some of the teams fighting at the top including a full-strength Barcelona team. Real Madrid on the other hand are sitting at the top of the league with 10/11 wins with Mbappé coming into his own with Los Blancos. Rayo Vallecano has averaged 6.3 corners won and 4 conceded at home in their last 20 whilst Real Madrid has won 4.3 + conceded 4.7 over the same time period. That gives means of 5.5 Vallecano corners + 4.5 for Los Merengues all factors considered with a recency and pressure weighting on El Rayo since Madrid are the better team.

I get an estimated 79% win rate based on these statistics for this play. Now I would decrease this slightly more due to the fact that Real should keep a lot of the ball but despite this I really find the value to be great here. Vallecano also covered this line in this fixture last year plus won 9 to 4 on the count against Barça earlier this year which proves they can still generate/suppress corners in spite of low possession phases.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> : Real Madrid to Win + Total Under 5.5 Goals @1.64 for 3u

Real Madrid are sitting at the top of La Liga with 30 points from 11 games, 5 points clear of second place Barcelona, and they are the most consistent team in the league right now. Kylian Mbappé is in absolutely lebthal form with 13 goals in just 11 games this season, making him one of the most dangerous strikers in Europe, and he is perfectly supported by Vinícius Júnior who has 5 goals and 4 assists, giving Madrid multiple world-class finishers who can score at any time. Rayo Vallecano are 10th in the league and completely outmatched - they lost to Villarreal last weekend and they are weak defensively. Vallecano have won only 1 of their 4 home games this season, which proves they cannot handle top-quality opposition. The reason under 5.5 goals is safe is because Rayo&#x27;s attacking problem is as bad as their defense - they scored so little this season that 4 of their 4 home matches stayed under 2.5 total goals, meaning even when Madrid score 3-4 goals, Rayo simply do not have the attacking quality to respond and create a goal-fest.

This line is much smaller than I expected, likely because the Bucks are coming off a win against the Bulls while the Rockets lost to the Spurs in their last game. But if you look at the individual matchups here, Giannis won’t be able to get to the rim as easily as he did against the Bulls, given the strength and physicality the Rockets have between Amen, Sengun and Jabari. In prior match-ups, the Bucks had Dame or Brook Lopez to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> up the scoring, but now they’re overly reliant on Giannis and that’s going to be tough here, especially those non-Giannis minutes could be brutal for the Bucks. The Rockets meanwhile have sputtered a bit to start the season, but still had 5 wins in a row before their loss yesterday. I expect KD and Sengun to show up here offensively, and given the personnel and difference in quality I will back the Rockets to cover this spread.

**Write Up:** Hi friends! Great hit yesterday to start off in the green (also went 4/4 in the soccer thread!). Enzo cleared the line 3 minutes into the match, and wound up with 2 SOTs. <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> we are staying away from the big game and heading to the City Ground where two struggling teams duke it out. MGW, much like the forest team as a whole, have had a disappointing start to the season. MGW was just snubbed of an England cap for the first time since he made his first cap back in spring. He will be hungry here, and much like Enzo yesterday, will likely take some hero ball shots from distance. He has hit 1+ SOT in 3 of his last 4 EPL matches. I like him a lot against this Leeds team who gave up 8 SOT away at Brighton last week and likely will be on the back foot much of the game as Forest try to pull themselves out of the relegation zone. Expecting a lot of shots for both sides <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> and thinking MGW finds one on target here. 

BOL to everyone!</td></tr>

[Teaser write up](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/s/rHfatVB0aA)

A&amp;M comes through in dominating fashion. But holy hell what in the fuck, Auburn with the boat offensive showing of their season and Vanderbilts defense just totally crumbled. Sorry about that guys.


Event: Lions @ Commanders/Rams @ 49ers (3:25pm eastern)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Lions -6 (alt line) and Rams ML. Two team parlay (+130) (2U) 

-everything is bet to win unit amount-

(Except this case since it is plus money we are throwing 2U to win 2.3U)


Write up: Once again I find myself coming off a loss, and I’ve never lost two in a row. In fact this is the first time I’ve ever lost 2 out of my last 3. We have had two 2 unit plays since being on <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> and both cashed with ease (rockets -15, won by 30) and Arizona +4.5 over Florida (won outright). The lions are going into a floundering commanders team that just lost Jayden Daniel’s after leaving him in late into a blowout. Dan Campbell is 12-0 ATS coming off a loss, and keep in mind there is extra motivation here because the commanders ended the lions Super Bowl hopes and dreams last year in Detroit! I expect a massacre here. Washington’s pass defense has been near the bottom by yardage allowed (around 254 per game). Jared Goff’s rhythm attack should repeatedly find leverage spots. Detroit’s defense has tightened to a top-10 profile by yardage and sits among league leaders with roughly 28 sacks — strong pressure output. The injuries to Washington are piling up and I expect Detroit to handle business on the road. Dan Campbell is also extremely aggressive and goes for it on 4th down a lot which only helps us cover this line of 6 even more. In fact, most of their five wins have been by double digits, with the lone outlier being the 38-30 win in Baltimore as +4.5 underdogs. Now the rams, the rams are going to get this win, do you not think the end of that game against the 49ers earlier this season has been on mcvays mind? I mean deciding to go for it on 4th down in overtime and not kicking the game tying field goal was something he immediately regretted and that is only one of two losses the rams have piled up this year! The injury to Fred Warner hasn’t been kind to the 49ers as they have allowed over 24 points in each of their last two games! Might I add those were to the Texans and the giants. Things won’t get any easier against a rams offense that is 1st in passing success rate, the 49ers are bottom 5 against the pass all season and dead last in sack rate in the nfl. Yikes. Rams are also 6-1 ATS this season as a favorite and I expect a big win. I love this smash spot at plus money and I’m looking to get right back on track. Sorry about that L <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> fellas, I felt really good about it going in. Train is rolling though and I’m going streaking like Frank the fuckin tank baby.

Detroit is coming off an ugly loss as huge favorites. 

Washington just lost their QB. 

Detroit has a better offense, (11 v 16) a better defense (8 v 28) and a better coach than Washington. (Sorry DQ, pull your QB next time.) 

The lions are going to come out pissed. They’ll be looking to bury Washington early and they aren’t afraid to run up the score. 

Thinking this one gets ugly in a hurry.

OSTER VS DJURGARDEN

Date: 09 NOVEMBER 2025 at 15:00

BET ON: Over / Under- Over +2.50

Odd: 1.64

SWEDEN

\- The final round brings two sides with everything to play for and little reason to hold back. Djurgården remain in the hunt for fourth place and a potential European spot, while August Priske’s chase for the Golden Boot adds further attacking motivation. The Stockholm side have been prolific in recent weeks, producing scorelines such as 8–2, 6–2 and 3–2, and even their goalless draw with IFK Göteborg came with nearly three expected goals created. Öster, meanwhile, are fighting for survival and likely need a win to avoid the drop. Since Björknesjö took over, their approach has been notably more aggressive, with four of seven matches clearing the 2.5 line and several others coming close. The suspension of key center-back Mattis Adolfsson further weakens an already fragile defense. With both sides highly motivated and leaning towards offensive football, this matchup shapes up perfectly for goals.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Jokic 30+ points. (11/10) (2.1) odds on most platforms 

2.5 units 

Write up: The first few games form Jokic were a bit shaky. We saw him hit very low points and he was forcing assists too much. In the last few games this has changed a lot where Jokic has been driving in more and attempting to score more points and this has been working. We saw him hit 33 against heat and 34 against kings. The reason why he had 26 last game was because he eased off a little towards the end. However even though there could be blowout possibility it doesn’t worry me. Jackson has been struggling in a lot of matchups with centres and I think Jokic will take advantage of this. I think he will hit 30 <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> and the value is great considering he comfortably did this in 2 recent games. Good luck everyone and feel free to support down below!

__Event:__ Cardinals @ Seahawks 4:05pm EST

__POTD:__ Jacoby Brissett o34.5 Pass Attempts (-125 MGM), 2.5u to win 2u

__Write Up:__ The Arizona Cardinals (3-5) are going for their 2nd consecutive road win as they travel to Lumen Field on Sunday afternoon to face the Seattle Seahawks (6-2). The Cardinals are coming into this game after a 27-17 win over the Cowboys as 4 point underdogs. The Seahawks are coming off a 38-14 win over Washington as 3 point favorites. Seattle is 9-1 in its last 10 games versus the Cardinals. __The Seahawks won their first meeting of the season in Arizona 23-20 in Week 4 when Jason Myers kicked a 52 yard field goal for the game winner as time expired. Cardinals QB Kyler Murray threw 41 times that game, only rushing 17 times.__ That should continue this week, despite the Cardinals starting Jacoby Brissett at QB.

The Cardinals having been throwing it a ton with QB Jacoby Brissett filling in for Kyler Murray. __Arizona ranks 2nd as the most pass happy team in the NFL via Pass Rate Over Expectation. In his first 2 starts, both losses, Brissett averaged 40 attempts per game, exceeding 36 in both games.__ Last week vs the Cowboys on Monday Night Football Dallas pooped the bed &amp; the Cardinals won by 10 running the clock down with 29 rushes. The Cowboys looked rough buff it’s a different matchup this week. __The Seahawks are favored by 6.5 points with an offense that is rocking &amp; rolling. Seattle QB Sam Darnold has this unit operating at an elite level. Seattle ranks 1st in dropback success rate &amp; 2nd in dropback EPA/play.__ The Seahawks run game has been trash. Seattle RB’s Kenneth Walker &amp; Zach Charbonnet haven&#x27;t been able to generate much on the ground this year. __Seattle currently ranks 23rd in rush success rate &amp; 27th in rush EPA/play.__ All of the Seahawks&#x27; offensive success runs through Darnold. __Darnold ranks 1st in the NFL in both EPA/play &amp; success rate, &amp; is also 3rd in Completion Percentage Over Expected (CPOE).__ Through 8 games, Sam has completed 70+% of his passes with 16 TD’s &amp; 2,084 yards, while turning the ball over just 5 times. __With Seattle, Darnold leads the NFL in the rate of passing plays that gain 10+ yards (39.3%) &amp; the rate of passing plays that gain 20+ yards (14.8%). This had led to 43.4% of Seattle&#x27;s sets of downs to reach 3rd down, the 6th best rate in the NFL.__ With the heavy passing attack the Seahawks are running a ton plays. __Seattle is averaging 65.3 plays per game, 4th most in the NFL. This has enabled the Seahawks to average 28.9 points per game (5th in NFL). Seattle has outscored opponents by a league high 72 points in the 1st half this season (134-62).__ This sets up the Cardinals &amp; QB Jacoby Brissett to throw the hell out of the ball.

With Seattle’s high powered offensive attack, opponents have been forced to chunk the ball. __The Seahawks defense is facing an average of 37 pass attempts per game, including more than 40 in 50% of their games.__ This is set up for a huge pass funnel for a Cardinals team that’s been passing it a ton lately. __Over the last 3 weeks since Brissett took over, Arizona has averaged 37 pass attempts per game (5th most in the NFL) &amp; 2.9 more than the offense had attempted all season. The Cardinals are throwing the ball 6% over expectation.__ This has proven that the Cardinals rely more on Brissett’s arm over the confidence on the Cardinals legs. __Arizona has struggled to run the ball this year &amp; they currently sit at 28th in rushing success rate. They’re going to have a tough time vs a Seattle run defense that ranks 8th in success rate vs the run.__ This is even more significant now that James Conner (ankle injury out for season) &amp; Trey Benson (meniscus injury had surgery) are out for this game. __The Cardinals are down to their 3rd &amp; 4th string RB’s. This is significant because Arizona has trailed for 27.1% of its offensive snaps, 2nd lowest rate in the NFL. While Seattle has trailed for 19.6% of its offensive snaps, the lowest rate in the NFL. Also Arizona has been outscored by 54 points (83-29) in the 4th quarter this season, worst margin in the league.__ But things have turned around under Brissett. __44.6% of Arizona&#x27;s sets of downs have reached third down under Jacoby Brissett (14th) compared to 54.4% under Kyler Murray (29th). Arizona has converted a league best 56.1% of its 3rd downs (23 of 41) under Brissett.__ What is even more significant is that Brissett set an NFL record last week. __Jacoby Brissett has thrown 25 career interceptions in 1,873 pass attempts. That’s an INT rate of 1.3%, the NFL’s all time record per PFF.__ The Cards trust him &amp; don’t trust their ground game, &amp; if they want to keep up with a Seahawks team that’s slings it they’re going to have to air it out. I was going to post passing yards instead of completions but Seattle is elite in allowing deep passes. __The Seahawks allow the 2nd fewest yards per completion (8.9) in the NFL.__ This is setting a game where Brissett dinks &amp; dunks his way downfield.

Seattle will beat up this weak Cardinals pass defense. Jacoby will throw it a ton to keep up.

**Last Pick:**   Troy Franklin Any Time TD Scorer (+170 on DK) 1u to win 1.7u ✅

**Todays Event**: 🏈 NFL Sunday Football Falcons &amp; Colts in Germany! 8:30 AM CST🏈

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Todays pick</mark>**: Tyler Allgeier u19.5 Rushing Yards (-112 on DK) 1u to win 0.89u

**Writeup:** Falcons and Colts faceoff for an early game in Berlin. Colts are projected to win with a spread of 6.5 and -310 Moneyline. Colts have the fourth best rush defense currently and the 26th best passing defense. With a high likelihood of Falcons to be trailing like they have the last 3 games, and a hard rush defense, there will be many more passes than rushes. Further evidence is Penix&#x27;s pass attempts line being set pretty high at 34.5

Now for Allgeier himself. While he has been averaging over 26 yards per game, his last three have been mediocre. Week 7 he had gotten a knee/hip injury which have been limited his carries and yards. The last three weeks, Allgeier has gotten 10 carries for 26 total yards. Now, he was taken off the injury report week 9 against the Patriots, yet played lower offensive snaps than week 8 (30% compared to 40%) and managed 2 carries for 6 yards. I still believe his knee/hip is affecting him. Note that the falcons have trailed majority, if not the entirety of all 3 games, which im expecting to continue 

Im expecting a very pass heavy game from the falcons with Bijan getting majority of the carries.

BOL to anyone tailing!

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:  Erling Haaland to score vs Liverpool 3u @ $1.72

I&#x27;m going for the big game of the day which isn&#x27;t usually something I do - but when you&#x27;ve got a game like this, you&#x27;ve almost got to. 

City and Liverpool have played some classics in recent seasons. 

I&#x27;m going Haaland to score. You can combine it with 2+ shots on target for $2.25, or combine it with City to win or draw for $2, but I won&#x27;t get fancy. 

This season&#x27;s City side are designed to feed Haaland the ball... No two ways about it. 

He has 13 goals in 10 games, and none of them are penalties. In fact. In the Premier League, City&#x27;s second highest scorer is a Burnley defender who scored two own goals.... From there, it&#x27;s only singles. 

But it&#x27;s not really outperforming numbers. 
1.08 xG per 90
4.5 shots per 90
2.6 shots on target per 90
7.24 touches in the opposition box per 90

And out of all those shots he&#x27;s had this season, only one has been outside of the box (and it was barely outside). 

He&#x27;s having an insane season, and City are feeding him as much as possible.

Tbh, there&#x27;s been a bit of doom and gloom around City&#x27;s gameplan this season - for me though, if you&#x27;ve got Haaland, you may as well do this.

Yes.... If he&#x27;s injured, you&#x27;re cooked (or need to pivot and do something else).... but this City side isn&#x27;t as good as they have been in the recent past, it doesn&#x27;t matter how you play, if Haaland is out, you&#x27;re cooked regardless. So you may as well play like you&#x27;ve got the best striker on the planet on your side. 

It will be interesting to see how both teams line up. Liverpool signed a bunch of attacking talent in the offseason (even the defenders they signed were attacking players) and struggled to combine them all into a lineup that doesn&#x27;t a) cop a million chances, b) isolate Mo Salah completely, and c) play about 3 people out of their best position. 

Now, they&#x27;ve gone back to what&#x27;s largely the same lineup as last season, and have been better, which makes sense. 

I expect Liverpool to do something similar to what they did vs Real Madrid with the only new outfielders starting being Ekitike and Wirtz. 

City will have selection choices to make too. Foden, Doku, and Cherki all look good but starting all 3 could be an issue without Rodri. Against Bournemouth they did it by having a Silva and Gonzalez double pivot, and they might do it again, but Silva as a DM is never an ideal situation. 

I still think there will be chances in this game, and I like City to win. And realistically, if City are scoring in this game, there&#x27;s a massive likelihood that Haaland is the one to do it. 

I know Haaland hasn&#x27;t got the absolute best record vs Liverpool considering he&#x27;s a goal machine, but the team has never really been so reliant on him getting the ball as they are this season.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>: Man City vs Liverpool (BTTS &amp; under 5.5 goals @ 1.72) 🍀


For <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>&#x27;s big EPL showdown between Manchester City and Liverpool, the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> is Both Teams to Score (BTTS) with under 5.5 goals at odds of 1.72. Manchester City is in excellent form but has conceded goals in their last four matches, showing some vulnerability at the back. Liverpool, fresh off a morale-boosting win against Real Madrid, is regaining their rhythm and has a strong scoring record at the Etihad, finding the net in eight of their last nine visits. 

Historically, their head-to-head clashes rarely surpass five goals, with the last five meetings all finishing under 5.5 goals. Given the stakes, City aiming to isolate second place with a slight edge over Chelsea, and Liverpool looking to push up to second with 21 points, both teams will be cautious yet competitive. Arsenal’s draw <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> adds an extra layer of tactical discipline likely to influence this game’s approach. Initially, over 2.5 goals seemed probable, but the odds being equal and the consistent trend towards under 5.5 goals, especially in such tightly contested fixtures, make the under more appealing. Expect an intense, well-fought match, with goals at both ends but no goal-fest.</td></tr>

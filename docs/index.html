Reasoning: Continuing to fade Canada, they aren’t a bad team but Sweden is just overall better and wants to hold onto the fourth playoff spot.</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>**Stats:**

**Recap:**  **Brandon Miller choked, shot volume was there and hornets won. Unfortunate**

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Brøndby ML v Randers**  
**Odds:** 1.87x  
**Units:** 5 Units

 big with a five unit play, and we am going with Brondby to win. They have made extremely big signings this window with Steve Cooper attracting big names such as Emmanuel Dennis, Ben Godfrey and I think these players are just levels above the leagues standard and they should cruise through this game.

Brondby have 5 wins, 1 draw and 3 losses so far this season and Randers are 2W 2D 5L. This is the first game of the season and I think brondby is going to come out with a win. Before season ended before christmas, Randers lost 3, won 1 where the other team had a red card and a draw.

Its not proud to bet on the rivals, but they have outclassed everybody in this window and expecting big movements from them as they have quality players now.</td></tr>

Last Pick:  Falcons vs XG ,Map 1 Duration OVER 39.5 Minutes (@1.71) ❌

Event: BLAST Slam VI

Time: February 8

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: PARLAY: 

Liquid -1.5 match handicap vs Gamerlegion + Tundra ML vs Heroic (@2.18)

Unit: 5 units

Recap: Unfortunately we lost our streak. That one hurt so much. We only needed 45 more seconds to win the bet, very unlucky XG suddenly stopped playing at all. I was so sure that it would go over the line when I was watching it. Map 2 also went over the line

  
Writeup : Liquid and Tundra are both favourites to win their games. Liquid has played against Gamerlegion a lot of times and has never conceded any map; their record has been 3-0 against GL in recent tournaments. I don&#x27;t see them losing any map tomorrow. They also already played during the group stage, and it was a 26-minute stomp. Heroic on the other hand, is a very inconsistent and unpredictable team, but they barely won against a tier 3 SEA team. I don&#x27;t see Tundra losing against Heroic.

Last Pick: Bublik 2-0 vs Nys + Gojo ML vs Vandecasteele (-192, 1 unit): Win 

Tennis | ATP Rotterdam (Qualifying) | 6:10 AM EST (estimated)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Roberto Carballes Baena vs Mees Rottgering | **Carballes Baena ML at -185 (DK). 1 unit.**

Write-up: Seems like parlaying heavy favorites was not a popular move, but it ended up working out fairly well. Bublik got an easy 6-0, 6-3 win to start, and later in the day Gojo finished things off after moving from -364 to -453 pre-match. 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>, I&#x27;m fading the 18-year-old local talent Mees Rottgering in a situation where I see him being overmatched. Rottgering did really well to get past Kyrian Jacquet after being bageled in the first set, but his performance rating came in at just 6.31/10. Roberto Carballes Baena may not be a natural hard-court player, but he does have experience in all conditions, and he already scored a nice win over Pablo Carreño Busta with a 7.16/10. Another factor to consider is that Jacquet was a much bigger favorite than RCB is here, even though I don&#x27;t see a huge level gap between them. Even if Rottgering has a strong serve and overall game for his age, he still doesn&#x27;t feel fully developed as a player, and I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s going to cut it against someone like RCB. These courts are indoors, but they don&#x27;t play lightning-fast, and that works to the benefit of the more consistent Spaniard.</td></tr>

 **Write Up**:

There is a lot to choose from <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, everything from the big game in England to more Japanese football, but I have choosen this bet as I feel it offers some really big value. Sevilla are conceding goals right, left, up and down at the moment, I mean you really have to try hard no to just accidently just get one at the moment. Girona looked almost set for relegation before they had a big uptick in results that has taken the to 12th, albeit it&#x27;s still just three points down to the relegation zone. 

I would be surprised if this game doesn&#x27;t see plenty of action! My guess is 2-2</td></tr>

Last pick : Wolverhampton vs **Chelsea -1,5 handicap** at **2,85** odds ✅

**CET 12:15 Football Eredivisie**

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>: Utrecht vs **Feyenoord -1 handicap** at **4,2** odds

Explanation: I want to start first by saying that we lose if Feyenoord wins with only one goal. So there is no push/void here. The second point is the odds being really weird here. Feyenoord have a huge motivation to win this game, sure it’s an away game. They are aiming for second place on the table, which gives direct Champions League placement. Utrecht on the other hand, seems to sit safe from relegation so far. The thing is that Feyenoord won the last two away games vs Utrecht and this handicap hit. Another weird thing here is the fact that the odds are so high for Feyenoord just to win at 2,17 (time of writing). That’s just ridiculous in my opinion. Either they know something which we don’t or they completely misplaced the odds. I’m thinking the latter and I’ll gladly take those 4,2 odds with a handicap on. 



Not much to say besides Feyenoord being the stronger team here and having the potential to completely outplay their opponents in this league. The exceptions are of course PSV and Ajax, who usually finish on the top every year. Handicap results here are quite common just like in the Portuguese league, where a gap between the top and the rest seems to remain.



I’m trying to keep track of the results in all the top leagues. I had way too many games to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> from Sunday, and honestly almost got a headache from trying to choose one. My goal is to have something around the 3x odds barrier or higher. This one qualified well and we will **always aim for** **long term** gains. I will try to post another <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> in the coming days. Seems like a good week is coming, with lots of league football to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> from. Good luck everyone.

Bookie: **Coolbet** and a **5** unit bet. Gamble **responsibly**!

<tr><td class='post'>**POTD Record:**  109 – 74 - 12

**Previous:**  Hearts Draw-no-bet &amp; Albacete vs Barcelona Over 2.5 total cards - LOSS

**New Event:**  The Superbowl – Seattle vs New England

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:**  Kenneth Walker III Over 20.5 Receiving Yards @ 1.95 (5 units)

**Warning:** I am 4-5-1 (W/L/D) in my last 10.  Worst streak ever in 195 picks here on <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>.  Everything is fine, except when I post it.  So do not tail me blindly, do your research and please bet responsibly.

“If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it”.  This is the same prop bet with the same yardage line and even the same odds that we won with in the divisional playoff game against the Rams where walker had 49 receiving yards.  Charbonnet is still out for the Seahawks and Walker has been the beneficiary of this extra load not only with more rushes, but he has become the go to checkdown receiver which easily got us over this line and will do so again. 

The Patriots pose a different challenge as their run defense is pretty damn good.  So good in fact that clashing with the Seahawks own defense may result in a lackluster defensive boring game where yards are hard to come by while punts abound.  Well, that seems to be what everyone is thinking so chances are we will probably see something else.

In either case, Walker eats.  No point repeating all the stats leading up to the first <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, since nothing has changed other than the opponent.  But if anyone wants to see them, here is the link to the original WINNING <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> post.  [First Ken Walker Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/comments/1qm1kn8/comment/o1k3bmf/?context=3&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)

Here are a few more:

* Patriots defense regularly gives up yards to running backs in the flat because they have successfully contained them limiting yards after the catch.
* Since week 16, Seahawks’ running backs averaging 54 receiving yards per game.
* The Seahawks rank #2 in running back target teams in the NFL ahead of the Detroit Lions and just behind the Atlanta Falcons.
* Sam Darnold has been targeting his RB’s on early downs to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> up short yardage, and allow more discretion on 2^(nd) and 3^(rd) downs to target downfield receivers. This may hold especially true with the Patriot’s defensive that will most definitely be pressuring Darnold all day.</td></tr>

Write Up: Super Bowls tend to start slow. Super Bowls tend to start even slower when it is between two QBs unfamiliar with big game environments.

Last Pick Write Up: That red card freaked me out a bit, but we got that win. Now I’ve got to hold that 2:1 W/L ratio!

Now for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>..

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Inter win &amp; Real Madrid to score @1.66

Write Up:

Is the superbowl tomorrow? Anyways.. we are doing soccer.

Six wins in a row. Now for tomorrow.

Sassuolo (11th place) hosts Inter (top of the league). Inter do well away, with 9W0D2L, while Sassuolo is mid at home with 4W2D5L - so the top team is meeting a meh one, and should deliver a win.

Real Madrid have been delivering some annoying draws away, but they almost alway score and should pop at least one goal here to get us better odds.

BOL!

**Write Up:** Running this play back as we&#x27;re taking Semenyo to score or assist in the match of the weekend. Liverpool and City, two giants of the EPL, are set to square off at Anfield after the reverse fixture in Manchester went 3-0 in favor of City. 

Semenyo has scored in his last 2 EPL matches and 4/5 in all comps. He has really hit his stride since joining City and has had great link up play with Haaland. I&#x27;m again buying down the juice of just ATGS, even though I think that to be the most likely cash, because I think he may wind up in a position to provide an assist to Haaland. Semenyo also scored 2 goals at Anfield earlier in the season while he was still with Bournemouth, so he knows how to beat this Liverpool defense on the road. 

BOL and happy Sunday!</td></tr>

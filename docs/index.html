<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>:  NCAAM San Diego State @ Colorado State 1st half points over 63.5 (-115) 6pm eastern. 

All picks are one unit 

Last pick: NCAAW - Charleston(W) @ Towson (W) under 130.5 ❌

Write-up:  Looks to be a great game - San Diego State is near the top of the league, and Colorado State is on a 4-0 streak.

Home court dynamics and altitude will figure big in <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>’s game. At home, Colorado State shows stronger confidence and shot selection. Altitude matters but more often than not it causes a slow down later in the game not the first half. 

Both offenses are built on efficiency. SDSU is averaging 79.1 points per game on 47.7% shooting, while Colorado State is scoring 76.5 per game on 49.4% from the field (25th nationally).

The defensive matchup is mixed. SDSU remains solid, holding opponents to 39.3% shooting, but Colorado State’s defense is a lot weaker, allowing 45.3% from the floor. They sit in the lower third nationally in opponent efficiency.  This opens up scoring, especially for SDSU. 

The model projects an offensive blend of 118.4 and a blended pace of 33.1. So the projection isn’t driven by extreme possessions. It assumes average tempo and both teams converting near season averages. In other words, no first half grind. 

Risks:  blowout, altitude effects hitting earlier than assumed, and SDSU imposing itself defensively early, creating long half-court possessions with slower scoring. 

But both teams have strong shooting profiles and SDSU should be able to exploit Colorado State’s defense, pushing the first half over.</td></tr>

Sport: Ncaab : Event Time: 18:30 ET

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Michigan -2.5 (1.86x , bet365) 3U

Last bet: The bengals dominated possession and the ravens scored on chunk plays even though they won 24-0 they only had the ball for a third of the game.

Write Up:

1 vs #3 at a neutral site. Both teams score ~50% of their points in the paint. Michigan’s superior length (6.1 blocks per game vs. Duke’s 3.5) gives them the edge in neutralizing Duke’s primary scoring method.

Offensive Overload: Michigan has won 21 games by 10+ points this season. Duke’s #3 defense is elite, but Michigan’s #1 offense has already proven it can dismantle top-10 defensive units (like Purdue). Duke has great defence but they have inflated numbers by dominating lower level competition. Should be a great game!

Last pick: James harden O 8.5 AST (L) (I know the basement was laughing ,those fvckin clowns)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Cade Cunningham Over 9.5 Assists (-130)HR

Reasoning: Chicago is 30th in 3PT% defense and allows the most points to opponents per 48 minutes over their last 10 games (124.7). Cade is the NBA&#x27;s 2nd-leading assist man (9.7 APG). Even if the Bulls double-team him to stop a &quot;cold night&quot; scoring outburst, he simply exploits the mismatch by finding open shooters. Cade’s usage as the sole initiator goes through the roof.

Scenario A:(The Libra Masterclass): The game stays competitive. Cade carves up the Bulls&#x27; drop coverage, hitting on lobs and shooters in the corners. He clears 10 assists by the middle of the 3rd quarter.

Scenario B:(The Blowout): Detroit goes up by 20. However, Detroit’s bench (Sasser/Holland) are high-percentage finishers. Cade often racks up 3-4 &quot;easy&quot; assists in transition before sitting the final 5 minutes.

Scenario C:(The Harden Ghost): Cade’s teammates go cold and miss wide-open looks. This is the only way this misses Chicago’s defense is so porous that the looks will be there; the shooters just have to sink them.

Scenario D: The white flag 🏳️ Cade’s minor wrist tweak flares up and he plays limited minutes. (Current reports say he’s a full go after a 42-point masterpiece vs. NYK).

Scenario E: Cold night Cade shoots 4/18 from the field. Good. As a Libra, when his shot isn&#x27;t falling, he balances the scales by becoming a pure floor general. A cold shooting night often boosts his assist numbers.

Scenario Proof

Matchup- Bulls allow the highest Opponent FG% in the league over the last 2 weeks. History- Cade dropped 13 assists on the Knicks (a much better defense) just 48 hours ago. Vibe -Libra energy. He’s averaging 10.2 AST on the road this month

--- Bet Size: 2.5 Units ($25) --- Unit Size: $10

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Yadier del Valle by Submission or Decision

Starting the record <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Del Valle is a heavy favorite (~1.22 ML), implying an 80%+ win probability. Rather than laying heavy juice, I’m targeting his most likely win paths at even money.

Del Valle enters this matchup undefeated, showing dominant wrestling, positional control, and consistent grappling pressure throughout his career. His clearest advantage here is on the mat, where he can dictate pace, control rounds, and create submission opportunities. His opponent is most vulnerable in these exact areas, making submission or decision the most likely outcomes.

At 2.00 odds (50% implied), this offers strong value relative to his projected win distribution.</td></tr>

Last Pick: Balestier Khalsa-Geylang International O3.5 goals + Sumqayit/Draw @ 2.15 ✅

Last Pick Write Up: Sumgayit was stressful for no reason. But for those of you who tailed the Khalsa-Geylang game degen bets... we made some money didn&#x27;t we folks? Match ended 5.2. I bet on almost all variations of over goals (1h, team goals, total goals over) and we even hit O6 goals at 7.2 odds. 

Now for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>..

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:  Thun ML &amp; O 1.5 goals @ 1.67

Write Up: 

Hope I&#x27;m not jinxing but this one should be pretty straightforward. Thun is in 1st place with 9 wins in a row against bottom of the league Winterthur. O2.5 goals has hit in 7/8 H2H, 5/6 Winterthur matches and 8/9 Thun matches.

I&#x27;m sticking with O1.5 for the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> due to record and safety purposes, but as a side bet I&#x27;m obviously doing some over goals laddering (up to O6.5 goals at a small stake at 13 odds since Winterthur lost 5-1 to St Gallen and 6-1 to Young Boys recently), plus some 1h win and U10.5 corner parlays. My main big bet is the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> though.

Event: Orlando Magic @ Phoenix Suns 5:00pm EST

Season NBA Record: 0-1 (-1.00u)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Mark Williams o8.5 Rebounds (+112) 3u

Write up: Mobley scratched late afternoon yesterday so our bet voids, no big deal. <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> we’re taking advantage of a mispriced line (imo).

Mark Williams has hit this rebound line in 4/L5 games, with that one miss being against OKC where he played only 16 min and had 1 rebound. Not sure what was up that game but was for sure a one off with an early exit. Williams is averaging 8.1 boards this season while over the last 30 days ORL has been allowing an avg of 14.8 rebounds to opposing centers. On Thursday’s game against the Kings, Maxine Raynaud grabbed 14 rebounds, who has a season average of 6.8 boards.

I chop this up to a similar reasoning that I used yesterday, Orlando has guys that just love shooting. Their starting lineup of Suggs, Anthony Black, Desmond Bane, Banchero all are attempting an average of 6+ threes a game while most of the time only scoring 2-3 of them. It’s a very hungry, offensive lineup where Williams will have more than enough opportunities to cash this line for us.

Honestly this is the first game of the day I was checking out for a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> and when I saw they had this line priced at +112 I had to slam it. Of course I am also laddering this one a little heavy at 10+ rebounds (+154) (1u) and 12+ rebounds (+360) (0.5u). Let me know if I’m tripping thinking this line shouldn’t be this high or of any questions or concerns. Let’s take advantage of the books’ mistakes wherever we can.

Best of luck</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>Event: SPAIN La Liga, Osasuna v Real Madrid, 18:30 CET

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Winner: Real Madrid, 1.70, 1 unit

Write up: 
The rematch from the first La Liga round this season. 
Estadio El Sadar was and this season still is an impregnable fortress for some La Primera clubs. 
But, the mentality for Real Madrid before this game is another level. They are doing great in La Liga with 8 consecutive wins and have the opportunity to secure the first place which they regained after 10 whole matchweeks. In the Champions League, they won a crucial first-leg match against Benfica in Lisabon in Tuesday.
Regarding to Osasuna, although they are been recognized as a tough opponent when they are playing at home, they didn’t finnished a season without at least 3 loses at home, even in their best seasons when they were finishing in the upper third of the table. This seasons after 11 played games at home, they lost 2 times.</td></tr>

USG sit in 1st place in Belgium&#x27;s top division against 11th placed Antwerp. USG have won 11 of 12 home games this season but aren&#x27;t a huge goal scoring team hence the under in goals.

Antwerp have been inconsistent at best away from home. I believe USG will have what it takes to keep the slender lead at the top of the table coming to the pointy end of the Belgium season.</td></tr>

NBA | Spurs vs Kings | 🏀  

Bobby feasted without Turner and Giannis, even got a double double. Cheers goat

Spurs are matching up against the tanking Kings, score could get real ugly here with a spread of -18 in favour of Spurs, meaning potentially less floor time for Fox and the other starters and im all for it.

Regardless of that he’s seen 22+ minutes in all but one game in his last 8 games &amp; 26+ minutes in 3 consecutive games.. Harper plays blowouts aswell so I love the upside here, should be in for at least 22+ here..

With 22+ minutes he’s over in 10/L11 games.

Harper gets most of his buckets from attacking the rim where Kings are horrible, absence of Sabonis is part of that. Love the assist upside aswell as he gets most of his assists when he’s on the floor without Fox and Castle where he’s the primary facilitator. Kings are bottom 5 in assists allowed to his position.. 

Love this spot for Harper</td></tr>

First post here: Rutgers +8.5 @ Minnesota CBB

  
Both teams have similar records as Rutgers is 11-15 while being 4-11 in big ten play while Minnesota is 12-14 while being 5-10 in big ten play. 

Rutgers has been playing better basketball as of late as they have covered in 5/6 games including winning straight up against Penn State the last game is -4.5 underdogs. They have been playing better team defense overall and have recently found their starting lineup after constant changes throughout the season. 

Minnesota just lost one of their best players in Crocker-Johnson; and have dealt with injuries all season. Crocker Johnson was Minnesota&#x27;s best rebounder and their second best scorer. They are down pretty much a six man rotation at this point. Minnesota is 1-2 without him, a bad home loss to Maryland (who Rutgers just beat handily) a loss at Washington, and a win at Oregon. Minnesota did not score over 62 points in any of these games which I believe highlights the significance of losing Crocker-Johnson. They have struggled to score without him. 

Overall I think that these teams are very evenly matched. While I do think Minnesota is a capable team; the loss of their best all around players looms large. In an early 12ET game, I believe it will come down to the wire, taking the 8.5 points here with Rutgers is a good play. </td></tr>

The streak is over. Racing did their job with a solid draw at La Bombonera (X2 ✅), but Rosario Central completely let us down at home. It’s a tough one to swallow given their home record, but that’s football. We take the hit, manage our units, and move on. We are still massively up in the long run.

**Al-Hilal vs. Al-Ittihad:** Al-Hilal is comfortably the best team in the league, playing at a European level.Their tactical discipline and squad depth should be enough to secure the win in this derby.

**Al-Nassr vs. Al hazm:** With Cristiano Ronaldo and Mané, Al-Nassr is lethal at home. They average 3 goals per match and need a big win to keep their title hopes alive. Against a mid-table defense, the -1.5 handicap is where the value is. They need to dominate from the start.

This number feels short for the way this sets up. Houston pushes tempo (top-10 pace) and Knicks games vs fast teams consistently land in the 220 range. Knicks offense is trending up with 116 PPG over the last 10 and Houston has been efficient lately with strong perimeter shooting.

Defensively both sides are giving it up. Knicks allowing 114+ per game recently, Houston still weak vs the three, and both teams send opponents to the line at a high rate, great for late over closing.

Fast pace + shot volume + free throws late.

Write Up: This play comes from my simulation-based NBA prop tool that weights season production, recent form, projected minutes, pace, opponent adjustments, and blowout probability before running Monte Carlo simulations to estimate true probability versus the posted line.

Cunningham is projected at 5.8 rebounds, with season and recent averages of 5.7 and 7.4 respectively. Projected minutes sit at \~32.7 in a core role. Opponent (+1.6%) and pace (+0.9%) provide slight positive adjustments, and variance is relatively tight (std dev ±2.1).

Even after a small blowout adjustment (-3.2%), the simulated distribution centers above 4.5 (right around 6). Given the juice at -184, unit sizing is kept moderate.

Writeup - Newcastle is back in action, and that means we’re heading straight back to our corners bet for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>’s match against Manchester City. The Magpies have been consistent in this department, with at least four corners recorded in their last ten matches across all competitions. More impressive is their league form, where they’ve cleared o5.5 mark in seven straight games.

While City can dominate possession, Newcastle still managed to hit four corners in their recent FA Cup encounter, which Newcastle lost 4-1,

So, Asian Line of Over 4.0 Newcastle corners is quite value as per me.

If your bookie doesn’t offer the Asian line, you can split your stake, putting 0.5u on o3.5 and 0.5u on o4.5.

Miskew has really struggled all week and her misses on take-outs this week have not allowed Canada to capitalize with big ends with hammer like they typically do. USA already have quite a few wins over elite teams this season and they&#x27;ve proven here at the Olympics that they can hang with anyone so I was quite surprised to see this line where it is.

I have no clue why exactly Trungelliti got a qualifying WC this week but the 36 year old (No. 131) should be outclassed in this match by the 22 year old (No. 94). Nardi reached the quarters here in Dubai last year beating regular ATP players like Fucsovics and Bergs in straight sets so clearly enjoys the faster conditions of Dubai. He reached the quarters in Montpellier, losing to Damm, easily dispatching the likes of Basilashvili and Cobolli 2-0 just a week after a finals run to the Manama challenger final where he straight setted Mendez, Kjaer, Blanchet, Virtanen before losing to Jacquet in the final (all players I consider better than the Argentine). The Italian’s aggressive game, taking the ball early, should win him points a lot easier than Trungelliti’s grinding play style being more of a clay courter in these faster conditions. He’s lost his last four hard court matches, three of them in straight sets including against Chung and Kwon who are outside the top 300. I don’t see Marco really having the tools to compete and Nardi’s last 21/24 HC wins have been 2-0 scores, with the exceptions of Shapovalov, Fucsovics and Ofner who are all levels above the Argentine. Trungelliti has been straight setted in 8/9 hard court matches against top 100 opposition and honestly even at his peak I would’ve probably backed this same play. I know qualis can pull out some really strange results but Nardi needs to qualify to defend last year’s points so he should be playing at 100% and even adjusting for qualifying tax BOL !</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: Tennessee vs Vanderbilt/ Vanderbilt -2 (-130) 2u

Write up: Absolutely love the commodores here. As many of you may remember, Vandy started off 16-0 and looked extremely dangerous. I still have high hopes for this team and think this game will kick off a potential perfect ending to their conference schedule. Vandy comes in at number 12 in the Kenpom rankings, which for those that don’t know, is a more valuable ranking than the AP Poll. To add to that, Vandy has 3 very good scorers, and another 2 that can make key contributions. They shoot better on all 3 levels than Tennessee does, and they log more steals and blocks a game than Tennessee. I get that doesn’t make them the better defensive team necessarily, but making those plays in a game like this can give all the energy they need. Tennessee is also very live or die off of the backs of Ament and Gillespie. Even with heroic efforts by those guys I still like Vandy’s spot right now. Statistically they’re better across the board, and they get to host a team they don’t like on their own home court. I expect this line to move so grab it quick everyone. And as always I deeply appreciate all the support you guys give me! If you’re tailing let me know!! Let’s have a weekend everyone, blessings!

Fonseca being elimintaed in the singles main draw, every hope of brazilian fans is hold by Fonseca/Melo. They probably aren&#x27;t the best couple between the two, but as in many matches played in south american tournaments - expecially in brazilian and argentinan ones - crowd will be completely wild.  
I think fans noise will have just too much impact on the game, also considering the fact that the german couple is not used to such extreme conditions.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **WW Map 1 ML (+100)** vs. SPARTA 4u

https://preview.redd.it/5cc09vt5vqkg1.png?width=747&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4ff86c88f80407ef3c7f12d04f1d495594339da

Game/League/Time: Counterstrike 2 (CS2) | Nodwin Clutch Series | 4:00 AM EST.

**Writeup:**

* WW have had a quiet rise from tier 3 after mostly facing Russian competition and are starting to look like a solid tier two team. They are 8-2 in their L10 matches, most strong beating ex-RUBY <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, who are rank 58. They have won 7 of their 8 matches this week, while going 14-3 in individual maps. They have been very dominant especially on their map picks as of late.
* SPARTA are in a weird spot, they took a long break 9 weeks ago, and just started back up playing, they&#x27;ve quietly added Norwi/Krad to roster without any official announcements, the team looked great out of the break with back to back 2-0s against TNT and Alliance, Alliance were pretty strong favorites and arguably one of the tournament favorites, but <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> they lost 2-0 in both games losing to TDK 2-0, and Illwill 2-0
* Both teams are very top heavy with the fire power, SPARTA have Djon8, star rifler, and AWPer yuramyata. WW have star rifler Ct0m and awper Deko, who is a huge talent that played in tier two and even had tier one offers but abruptly retired from competitive CS. Deko is averaging a .86  KPR L3 months leading the match

**Veto:**

* WW are projected to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> their map 1st, as SPARTA are the higher seeded team and should <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> their map 2nd. SPARTA have slept thru a veto one time before so this isn&#x27;t a guarantee but highly likely
* WW ban Ancient, SPARTA ban Inferno
* **WW <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> Dust 2**

**Dust 2 Stats:**

* WW are 81% winrate on 16 maps of Dust 2 in the L3 months, they are 8-1 in their L9 Dust 2 games, and are coming off a win against ex-RUBY who are a very strong D2 team
* WW despite rising from tier three and playing some bad teams have some very impressive Dust 2 matches, beating ex-RUBY 16-14 <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> who are a very strong Dust 2 team, beating FORZE Reload 13-4, GUN5 twice 13-6/13-8, Nemesis 13-4 and ARCRED 13-9
* SPARTA are 14% winrate on 7 maps of Dust 2 in the L3 months, they have lost 3 straight and have only put up more then 8 rounds in 2/7 of those games
* SPARTA struggled on Dust 2 in 2025 as well, their 2nd lowest winrate map at 14-22 in 2025. They ended 2025 off with a 3-12 record on Dust 2, losing multiple bad blowouts, with 10/12 of their losses being very one sided putting up 8 rounds or less. In 2026 so far they are 0-1 losing to illwill <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> 13-11
* One of SPARTA&#x27;s worst losses actually wasn&#x27;t an HLTV match, but losing 13-11 to a ESEA Main team who is completely unranked (an entire division below them which in CS is a big gap going from int&gt;main&gt;advanced).</td></tr>

Last pick : **Dinamo Zagreb -1 Asian handicap** vs Racing Genk at **3** odds ❌

**CET 18:30 Football Bundesliga**

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>: **Leipzig -1 Asian handicap** vs Dortmund at **3,02** odds,

Explanation: Last game <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> on Dinamo Zagreb was really bad. All I have to do is **forget** about it and move on to this game! <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> we got a Leipzig who is eyeing the top 4 for direct qualification to the Champions League. Dortmund on the other hand can afford losing, as their main aim will be staying top 3 this season. It&#x27;s basically impossible to win the Bundesliga, unless they beat Bayern Munich first and then go on a hot streak until the end. Which is most likely not happening. So their goal is to focus on the Champions League here, by **resting** **key players** for this game. They have all of their attention on Atalanta, which they beat 2-0 in the first leg. Playing away against them will take away all of their strength and energy.

If I was a coach I would easily forgive my bench players to lose this game against Leipzig, who is by no means a bad team. They are even the favourites to win this game and I buy it even more, because of the rotation happening for Dortmund. I do however think that Leipzig will win it with more than 1 goal difference. Therefore applying an Asian handicap. The odds are also looking juicy as we get value for our money. I also feel that I discovered a hidden gem in this case, and expect the odds to drop alot before the start of this game!

On the side note: My tactics won’t change by lowering the odds to less than 2. The goal is to find high odds to play here, such as the range of 2,2 to 3,3. I’m trying to keep track of the results in all of the top leagues. We will **always aim for** **long term** gains here and make sure to manage your bankroll. I will try to post another <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> in the coming days. Good luck everyone.

Bookie: **Coolbet** and a **5** unit bet. Gamble **responsibly**!

<tr><td class='post'>**POTD Record:** 19-43-5 *Another win, and this one was about as sweat-free as it gets! Finland had shockingly gone 2-0 up before Canada completed a historic comeback with seconds left on the clock, but the +2.5 spread was never really in danger. The under 5.5 goals also hit, if anyone added that to the play for plus odds. What a game though!! Smart challenge by the Finns in the end, literal fractions in that onside call. Canadians might want to frame that if y&#x27;all end up winning the gold. 100% hockey <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> hit rate achieved, and I doubt anyone can take that away from me as I&#x27;m going right back to football for the weekend. From one tense matchup and in great form, we&#x27;re moving back to the team that had caused me so much grief. It&#x27;d be magical to clinch that 20th win by fading... the good old* ***REAL MADRID*** *and I think they&#x27;re there for the taking this weekend. Let&#x27;s get to it!*

**Last Five:** ✅❌✅❌✅

**Event:** LaLiga, CA Osasuna v Real Madrid, 12:30 pm EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Osasuna, +0.5, +1.0 Asian Handicap, +100, 5 units

**Write Up:** Osasuna are perfectly midtable: 10th place, but their form is picking up. They&#x27;re on a streak of **5 games without a defeat (3W, 2D).** On the other side, *Real Madrid&#x27;s league form is downright frightening,* but if Barcelona could lose against the likes of Girona and Real Sociedad, surely Osasuna are capable of taking a point (or more) off the **visitors.**

Osasuna are very balanced, with a passable attack and a **strong defence,** having only **conceded 28 goals across 24 LaLiga matches** this season. For illustration, that&#x27;s one less than 5th placed Real Betis, only one more than 3rd placed Villarreal and just two more than 2nd ranked FC Barcelona. They&#x27;ve also shown they can absolutely trouble Real Madrid on their day, as **the corresponding game last season ended in a draw.**

Then there&#x27;s another angle: **fatigue and injuries.** Real Madrid players were involved in a very draining (both physically and mentally) Champions League match over the week against Benfica, and the sheer number of **injuries in key areas (Militao, Alaba, Bellingham, Rodrygo)** means Arbeloa can&#x27;t rotate the team as much as he&#x27;d probably want to. Meanwhile, the in-form Endrick is out on loan, so that right side of the pitch is looking dire at the moment.

Confidence is sky high, and I truly believe <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>&#x27;s the day I crush this Madrid curse for good. Going in with another max unit play. *To be clear, I don&#x27;t necessarily think Osasuna are winning this, but they should have enough in their tank to get out with at least a draw.* Feeling a big game from Budimir and Munoz incoming. BOL and let&#x27;s enjoy another heated Spanish matchup that gives me the 20th win on the board ☘️🫡</td></tr>

WEST HAM VS BOURNEMOUTH

Date: 21 FEBRUARY 2026 at 18:30

BET ON: Over / Under- Over +2.50

Odd: 1.55



\- Over 2.50 goals is strongly supported by both tactical evidence and the tone coming from each camp this week. West Ham United’s recent 2-2 meeting with AFC Bournemouth — heavily analysed by UK broadcasters — exposed exactly why this matchup produces chances: Bournemouth’s high press created repeated high-quality openings, while West Ham were dangerous in transition but vulnerable when defending crosses and second phases. Nuno Espírito Santo has since spoken in UK interviews about the need for a “mentality change” and being more proactive in the relegation fight, effectively signalling that sitting deep is not the plan — especially at home, where they must chase wins rather than settle. However, that front-foot approach has come with defensive instability, as they continue to concede from wide areas and quick counters. On the other side, Andoni Iraola has never deviated from his aggressive identity — his side press high, push full-backs forward and commit numbers into the box, which raises the tempo and stretches games. Bournemouth are also chasing a European push, meaning there is no incentive to play cautiously away from home. With West Ham needing points urgently and Bournemouth refusing to compromise their attacking structure, this shapes up tactically as an open, high-intensity contest with space at both ends — conditions that strongly favour Over 2.50 goals.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Shonan Wins@2.00 (Coolbet) | **Stake: 5u**  💰💰💰

**Write Up**:

Shonan started off the season with a very poor performance against Akita, especially the 1st half was far from good. However, they picked themselves back in the next round and beat Sagamihara 4-0 at home. Sure, I expected them to win that and their opponent got a player sent off, but things looked more right in that game. 

Hachinohe is a team I have been very down on and have no faith in their ability to stay in J2. They finished 2nd in J3 last season, despite being top for a long time, as they won none of their last six rounds and scoring only three goals. Since last season they have lost their manager as well, and there is almost no money to recruit players to keep them in the league.

I’m not sure how good Shonan will be this season, their relegation from J1 comes as little surprise last season as they kept selling off their best players, but Hachinohe is just not J2 quality really.  </td></tr>

**Write Up:** Glad to see some many of you hit on the play Thursday. The line creeped up to +125 before kickoff so hopefully some of you got it at even higher odds than I posted as well! Europa is usually tricky, but pleased the day went so well. We also swept with 4/4 plays and two big parlays in the soccer thread, if you&#x27;re not already following along there as well. Let&#x27;s carry that momentum into the weekend. 

We&#x27;re back for a Premier League weekend and I&#x27;m playing two of my favorite SOT players in this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>. These plays individually are around -150, which is much lower than I typically like to take for a straight play. But feel free to take either individually if you prefer. 

Let&#x27;s start with Enzo. We&#x27;ve cashed with an Enzo SOT 9 times now, and many of you who follow my plays already know why I back him so frequently. He has hit an SOT in each of his last 4 matches, including 2 goals in that span. <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> he faces Burnley, the team that concedes the most SOTs in the EPL by a wide margin, in front of the home crowd. He also scored a goal in the reverse fixture earlier in the season
I love him in this spot. 

Now for Rogers. Very similar story here. Rogers has hit an SOT in each of his last 6 EPL matches. He has averaged over 3 shots per game in this stretch. He&#x27;s also playing at home against a Leeds team that is bottom 5 defensively. Rogers also scored 2 goals in ths reverse fixture earlier in the year, I think he&#x27;ll fancy another one in this match. 

BOL and happy weekend!</td></tr>

Schalke 04 vs Magdeburg, Over 3.5 goals @ 2.82  (4u) 

I’m backing Over 3.5 goals in FC Schalke 04 vs 1. FC Magdeburg. Both teams like to attack and don’t always defend well, so their games can get really open. Schalke at home usually push forward, and Magdeburg are not afraid to take risks either. That often leads to chances at both ends. If the match starts fast, I can see this finishing 2-2 or even 3-2.</td></tr>

Sean has the exact style necessary to not only weather the take down storm of Fluffy Hernandez but also operates his offense with teeps and jabs which have caused Hernandez trouble in the past. Hernandez has almost been finished multiple times to body work from kicks and also Kevin Holland was able to finish him with precise strikes to the head--this is how Sean fights. Perhaps Hernandez has gotten that much better but I just dont see him winning minutes after the 2nd round. Give me Sean to pull off the upset.</td></tr>

Under 5.5 goals (-130)

Well back to unders and overs since it seems to work better for me and everytime I take a puck line for a certain team they decide to not show up until the end. 

Write up:

Bronze medal on the line and games like these usually are low-scoring because no one wants to be the first one that makes a mistake. Olympic rink is also smaller and NHL players aren&#x27;t used to it so less space to make plays so the name of the game right now with these games is to control the neutral zone. Finland has proven that they can shutdown teams pretty well by doing exactly that. Except for the game against Italy, Finland went under that line in **all of their games in the Olympics**. Meanwhile Slovakia has proven that they can put up a fight against others teams in the tournament so I expect them to give Finland a good fight and not let this become a blow-out. Both teams also played the day before so more mistakes and broken passes combined with more fatigue which is a perfect storm for a low-scoring game in a do or die game where a medal is on the line. 

Edit: Forgot to add in my write up that they played before in the tournament and Slovakia won 4-1 so for me it feels like Finland will be more wary of Slovakia&#x27;s offense and won&#x27;t let them take control of the game like they did in their previous game. Also even after that loss vs Slovakia, the Fins are still favorites to win the game (-290 ML).

Hello everyone, this is my first <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> and it will be the start of a great journey. I hope we progress profitably together.

Konyaspor haven&#x27;t won in the league for 12 matches. All of their last 5 home games ended in draws, and every single one of those matches was goalless (2 goals 3 times, 0 goals 2 times).

Galatasaray, on the other hand, have won their last 4 league matches, scoring at least 3 goals in each of them. In the Champions League, they defeated Juventus 5-2 to gain a huge advantage. Ahead of the return leg, there will be some rotation in this match, and an important detail is that Osimhen is not in the squad (He&#x27;s being rested for the Juventus game.) Still, we can say Galatasaray can easily produce goals with names like Mauro Icardi, Leroy Sané, and Barış Alper Yılmaz.

Looking at the head-to-head stats, Galatasaray&#x27;s clear superiority is obvious. In the first half of the season, they beat Konyaspor 3-1.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Carlos Alcaraz vs Arthur Fils | **Fils +4.5 games at -115 (DK). 1 unit.**

Write-up: That one was a pretty good read in the midst of some rough form for me. Mensik ended up not only covering, but winning outright as a huge underdog! En

The organizers of this tournament reportedly paid $1.2 million each for Alcaraz and Sinner to appear at this tournament, but ended up getting only one of them in the final. Alcaraz stated before this tournament that he still sees weaknesses in his game that he wants to improve and planned to take things &quot;match by match.&quot; In many ways, it&#x27;s been a &quot;match by match&quot; tournament for him in that he has had at least some struggles in all of his matches (with 3/4 opponents covering this spread), but has still managed to get over the line in each of them. Now, he faces a familiar face for the title in Arthur Fils, who pushed him extremely hard in the quarterfinals of Monte-Carlo on clay last year. Fils is one of the most talented players in the Alcaraz/Sinner generation, and seemed to be on a really nice trajectory in 2024 and 2025 before a back injury halted his progress and forced him off the tour for the back half of the 2025 season. He&#x27;s slowly been working his way back into things, though, and now seems to be at full strength three tournaments into his comeback. Here in Doha, Fils has posted excellent performance ratings (7.0, 8.11, 8.53, 8.3). There&#x27;s been a clear upward trajectory in his level, and his most impressive match was probably the semifinal against Mensik, who had just scored a massive upset over Sinner a round earlier. Fils is best known for his incredible forehand, which allowed him to dominate Mensik from the baseline by targeting that exchange. However, he has also been serving well (7.2, 8.3, 7.7, 8.2), which will be key in covering this handicap. Alcaraz&#x27;s return, meanwhile, was a bit off against the biggest server he played in Arthur Rinderknech (6.6), though he&#x27;s since rebounded (8.3, 8.5, 8.4). This isn&#x27;t quite the same as the Mensik handicap, as I do think Fils is going to need to break serve at least once to cover here. However, I also think he has a solid chance of competing with Carlos from the baseline. The easiest way to lose quickly to Carlos is not being able to compete with him off the forehand. However, Fils obviously has that shot, and we&#x27;ve already seen Carlos struggle a bit with the powerful forehands of Khachanov and Rublev. Fils also hits his forehand with a lot more spin and margin than either of those players, meaning it&#x27;s less likely to randomly be off for a game or two. It will be a bit tougher for him to keep up on the backhand, but the hope is that he can run around it given that these aren&#x27;t the fastest courts. The weather in Doha tomorrow is expected to be quite nice, as it has been all week, so I don&#x27;t expect the wind or humidity to affect this matchup. Fils&#x27;s match finished later than Alcaraz&#x27;s, so he&#x27;ll have slightly less time to recover, but this one doesn&#x27;t start until 9:00 PM local time, so both players should be fine in that regard. Alcaraz has also historically struggled a bit more at night than during the day, as the ball bounces lower, limiting his ability to tee off and increasing the amount of patience required in rallies. Overall, I expect this to be a close match, and I think this handicap is a bit too wide.

Time: 5:30 AM EST &amp; 8:30 AM EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Liquid ML &amp; Tundra ML @ 2.25 odds (5u)

Write Up:

Liquid has been absolute kryptonite for XG lately they’ve won mostly their recent head-to-head meetings. While XG is a solid team, they often play a slower, traditional Chinese style that Liquid just dismantles with high-tempo pressure. Liquid&#x27;s current form is way more stable, especially with Nisha playing at this level.

I think Tundra vs. MOUZ is a mismatch. Tundra also leads against MOUZ in their last head-to-head meetings. MOUZ is a mid-tier team that consistently hits a ceiling when they face the top 3 teams. Tundra has better players in every single position, and MOUZ’s drafting has been incredibly predictable lately. While they aren&#x27;t invincible anymore, they almost never drop games to teams outside the top 5.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Fnatic v Team Vitality - **Team Vitality to win @1.72 2U**

Write Up: Fnatic has been rolling with legacy odds until now. They have been underpreforming this entire tournament barely making playoffs with a record of 5-6 sharing the spot with weaker teams like Los Ratones and Shifters, only passing on because of tie breaker rules. Meanwhile vitality landed comfortably at 7-4 and 3rd place. Fnatic also lost 2-0 against navi, a team that played 2nd tier league only 2 years ago. Overall Fnatic looks like a team still trying to find their feet and have yet to deliver with their rookie toplaner Empyros and a bot duo consisting of Upset and Lospa that seems to not synergize well. Team Vitality has the experience and calm that makes them more likely to deliver the win.</td></tr>

Wellington are the catalyst to this selection, a team that all round scores while not knowing how to keep a lead for their life. Wellington have the highest BTTS rate in the league at 82% (14/17).

**Lore:**

We are heading to the London Stadium for the match between West Ham and Bournemouth, corresponding to Matchday 27 of the Premier League. What we are looking for in this opportunity is both teams to score and at least 3 goals in total on the scoreboard.

I like this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> because we have an attractive odd of -133 (1,75 decimal) for a scenario that the statistics strongly support. Nuno Espírito Santo&#x27;s West Ham arrives in a compromised situation (18th in the table), which forces them to be proactive, but their defensive fragility is alarming: they have conceded goals in their last 18 home league matches. The &quot;Hammers&quot; average 1.23 goals scored and a worrying 1.88 conceded, which almost always guarantees action in both boxes. In fact, in 5 of their last 6 Premier League games, the &quot;BTTS&quot; has been hit.

On Bournemouth&#x27;s side, Andoni Iraola&#x27;s men are having a remarkable campaign (9th) and arrive with significant momentum after beating Everton. They are a vertical and brave team, with an average of **1.65 goals scored** and **1.73 conceded**. Their xG (expected goals) of 37.62 compared to the 43 goals actually scored shows they are clinical, especially with figures like Rayan and the young Kroupi on a scoring streak. Furthermore, the recent head-to-head record is telling: the last five direct matches between the two ended in score draws (1-1, 2-2).

Regarding team news, West Ham recovers Jean-Clair Todibo in defense, which improves their buildup, but the absence of Freddie Potts due to suspension weakens the midfield balance. Bournemouth, although having doubts over Tavernier, keeps its offensive core intact. With the hosts&#x27; urgency to escape the relegation zone and the &quot;Cherries&#x27;&quot; offensive fluidity, a high-scoring exchange of blows seems inevitable.

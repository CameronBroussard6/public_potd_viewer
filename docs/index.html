Well both Real Madrid and Barca shit the bed this week in the UCL lets hope Laliga will be better. 

Real Sociedad after a rocky start look to be back on track, unbeaten in 5 matches and have won 3 games in a row. In H2H matches against Elche they have won 6 games in a row and since 2014 their H2H games have ended Under 3.4 goals. 

Elche maybe above Real Sociedad but they have only one win in 5 matches and have lost 3 times so also given Real Sociedad&#x27;s form i think they should at least draw here. BOL if you&#x27;re tailing.

Yesterday’s Pick: (NBA) David Pastrnak 1+ points + (NFL) J.K Dobbins o49.5 rushing yards (-149) ❌

***<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: (NBA) RJ Barrett o21.5 PRA + Cade Cunningham o3.5 rebounds (-197) (7:40 PM EST) (ALT PLAYER PROPS)***

Reasoning: RJ Barrett has gone over this line in 88% of his games this season. He went over this line in 93% of his games last season. H2H, he has gone over this line in 100% of his games vs the ATL Hawks the past 2 seasons. Barrett also has a favorable matchup as ATL are 25th in points allowed, 29th in rebounds allowed and 19th in assists allowed vs the SG position. As for the other leg, Cade Cunningham has gone over 3.5 boards in 75% of his games this season. 86% last season and 100% H2H vs the BK Nets the past couple of seasons. The Nets allow the 21st most rebounds overall but are actually pretty good vs the PG position, ranking 7th best in rebounds allowed to PG’s. However they haven’t gone up against a rebounding guard such as the caliber of Cunningham yet this season and also a key aspect/trend to take into consideration is Cade Cunningham has exceeded 3.5 boards in 17 of his last 19 vs bottom 10 defenses for rebounds allowed. With all these variables favoring the over,

👇

Take RJ Barrett over 21.5 PRA’s and Cade Cunningham over 3.5 rebounds for this parlay tonight!</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: 🏀 Maryland -4 (-110) \[CZR\]

The Maryland and Georgetown rivalry is a historically intense rivalry that was officially renewed for this season, with the last time these teams matched up was 2016. Maryland gets their home opener under new head coach Buzz Williams. Although this Maryland team has a whole new roster from last year, Buzz brought 4 players over from Texas A&amp;M - including Pharrel Payne, who scored 21 points in the season opener. Although these teams have only played one game, Georgetowns defense does not look good, while Maryland is 20th in offense efficiency. This game will be played pretty tight the whole way but I see Maryland pulling away and covering.</td></tr>

Hell be battling Wembanyama, but Wemby and the Spurs are coming off of a tough loss to the Lakers on Wednesday. While Spurs started their season hot, they’re on a two game losing streak. The Rockets on the other hand are on a 5 game winning streak. I’m gonna roll with the Rockets momentum and choose them on the ML with Sengun being involved heavily.

The Bulls have Matas Buzelis and Nikola Vucevic playing PF and C. Giannis should feast in the paint and have his way <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. The Bucks got blown out last game against the Raptors and I expect Giannis to comeback full force. He has also done quite well historically against the Bulls covering this line the last 4 times these 2 teams played. Both teams are also top half in pace and I expect a high scoring game. 

The Nets are one of the worst teams in the league and have 1 win vs the injury riddled Pacers. No need to go in depth with this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> as Pistons should be able to handle the Nets relatively easily.</td></tr>

🇫🇷 Ligue 1 – Paris FC vs Rennes
Bet: Both Teams to Score &amp; Over 2.5 Goals ⚽🔥
Odds: 2.00
Units: 1 (standard)

Reasoning:
Two attack-minded sides meet in what should be an open, end-to-end contest. Paris FC love to press high and push fullbacks forward, which often leaves gaps defensively — something Rennes’ quick transition play is built to exploit.

Both teams play with tempo, and neither is known for shutting games down once they open up. With the quality on both sides, this matchup screams goals.

Let’s keep the streak alive and get 4 in a row, and cash in on another goals fest! 💥⚽

<tr><td class='post'>**Record:** 2-4

**Last Pick:** Win, Long Island University vs. IU-Indianapolis, Under 185.5 (LIU 94, IUI 90)

**Event:** NCAA Men’s Basketball, University of Detroit Mercy @ Notre Dame, 7 p.m.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Notre Dame -21.5 (-102, DK) 2 Units

**Write Up:** After finally getting a win last night in a crazy one, back with another bold <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. I normally stay away from spreads over 20 points, but this game is interesting.

I think Notre Dame is better than they are getting credit for early on, and I think UDM in the bottom 25 programs in Division 1.

The Titans opened the season with a 20-point loss to the University of Illinois- Chicago, 91-71. Nothing against the Flames, but UIC is picked to finished 8th in the Missouri Valley Conference. Hardly an elite opponent.

Excluding the covid-shortened season in 2020, Detroit Mercy hasn’t had a wining season since 2015, and in that span they have five seasons where they failed to get double digit wins. They only won one game in 2023-23 and eight last season. They also lost by 20+ eight times last season to teams like Northern Kentucky, Milwaukee and Robert Morris. Notre Dame is better than all of these teams.

Detroit is picked to finish 9th in the 11-team Horizon league. The Titans are still rebuilding in Coach Mark Montgomery’s second year, and I think they will be better, but they are still bad.

Notre Dame, on the other hand, is picked to finished near the middle of the ACC, which is probably the best basketball conference in the country.

Coach Micah Shrewsberry comes into his third year with what appears to be the most talented roster he’s ever head. Junior guard Markus Burton is a prolific scorer (21.3 ppg in 2024) and he’ll keep the tempo of the game moving. The team also returns the coach’s son, Braeden Shrewsberry, who averaged 14ppg last season.

The Irish are just too good of a shooting team for UDM. The Titans, led by senior guard Orlando Lovejoy, who averaged 16.4 ppg last year. When you compare the rosters, Detroit just doesn’t stack up. I think the Irish win by 25+.</td></tr>

Last pick: Suns ML over Clippers

The Spurs started the season with 5 straight wins but have now dropped back to back games. The Rockets have done the opposite dropping their first two and winning their last 5. 

The Rockets have the best defensive versatility in the NBA, and some of the best help defenders as well. I think this is a very difficult matchup for Wemby. 

The Rockets are also the best rebounding team in the NBA on both ends of the floor. They are going to make this game physical and I expect that to be disruptive for the Spurs O whose offensive rating plummets without Wemby on the floor.

Even before the recent roster improvements, the Rockets have fared well against the Spurs in the Wemby era, only allowing him to shoot above 50% once in 7 games.</td></tr>

NHL 7pm 
**The <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Winnipeg Jets (Moneyline)**
**The Odds: Approx. -188 to -200**
**2 units 




1. The Goaltending Mismatch


This is the most significant factor in the game. The matchup in net is a massive, lopsided advantage for Winnipeg.


* **Winnipeg:** The Jets are projected to start **Connor Hellebuyck**, who is performing at an elite, Vezina-caliber level. He boasts a 2.31 GAA and a .922 SV%.
San Jose:The Sharks are projected to counter with **Yaroslav Askarov**, who has struggled significantly. He is posting a 3.88 GAA and an .874 SV%. (Even if the Sharks opt for their other goalie, Alex Nedeljkovic, his numbers are similarly poor at 3.29 GAA and.895 SV%).


The model identifies this as a non-competitive goaltending duel. Hellebuyck provides a massive defensive foundation that San Jose&#x27;s struggling netminders cannot match.


### 2. The Special Teams Mismatch


This is a &quot;strength vs. weakness&quot; mismatch in both directions, heavily favoring Winnipeg.


* **Winnipeg&#x27;s Power Play (25.6%)** is ranked 8th in the NHL. They will be attacking a San Jose penalty kill that is one of the league&#x27;s worst, succeeding only 72.7% of the time (ranked 30th).
* **Winnipeg&#x27;s Penalty Kill (89.4%) is elite, ranked 5th in the NHL. They will be facing a San Jose power play that is anemic, converting at just 12.1%.


Winnipeg has a clear, data-driven advantage when a penalty is called, regardless of which team commits it.


 3. The Situational Factor


The model&#x27;s most heavily weighted component—situational analysis—also points to Winnipeg.


* **For Winnipeg:** The Jets are in a &quot;bounce-back&quot; spot. They are a top-tier team (9-4-0) that is coming off a frustrating 3-0 shutout loss to Los Angeles. This is the second game of a long road trip, and they will be focused on getting back on track.
* **For San Jose:** The Sharks are in a classic &quot;let-down&quot; spot. They are a sub-.500 team (5-6-3) that just had a huge, emotional 6-1 win over a rival. Furthermore, this is the first game of a back-to-back, meaning they are in a &quot;look-ahead&quot; position.


**Conclusion:**
The Jets are the superior team in every key metric. They have a massive advantage in goaltending, a dominant advantage on special teams, and are in a more favorable situational spot. The market has correctly identified them as the favorite, and the model confirms this is the most logical and mathematically sound bet on the board.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Grand Canyon -12.5 (-115 FanDuel) 4.6 units to win 4

Write Up: Duke was able to bring it home for a nice 5u win on Tuesday. Tonight we go out west where Grand Canyon is hosting Youngstown St. 

I fully expect GCU to be rocking on the Friday night game as their home environment is sneaky rowdy. I also expect the Lopes to dominate in the paint and control tempo from the opening tip.

Their frontcourt duo of Nana Wusu-Anane and William Breitenbach should be enough to overman as they  showed physicality and control inside night one against PFW. The Lopes also have a deep rotation of core experienced guards that are also strong defensively. Grand Canyon looks ready to build on last season’s WAC title run.

Youngstown State, meanwhile, struggled in their opener, falling 74-59 to Pittsburgh. They allowed 42 rebounds, including 15 offensive boards, and committed a bunch of fouls. The Penguins lost key contributors from last season and are still adjusting to new roles. Their interior defense was exposed by Pitt’s frontcourt, and Grand Canyon’s size and rebounding edge should create similar problems. Playing at home in Phoenix, the Lopes have the matchup and momentum to cover the -12.5 spread comfortably.

Prediction: Grand Canyon 81 - Youngstown St 62</td></tr>

Team Wang have successfully defended against steals all season, opting for nice, open ends when they have hammer which negates Tirinzoni&#x27;s aggression when their opponents has hammer. Wang is also a great shot maker and typically keeps a game close right to the end with low scoring ends.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Winnipeg Jets ML vs San Jose Sharks

Bet 1 unit to win .51 units

why: The Winnipeg Jets enter this matchup looking to rebound after a shutout loss, and this is an ideal spot for them to get back on track. They’ve dominated the recent series against San Jose, winning five straight meetings, and their defensive structure has been among the best in the league. Winnipeg’s penalty kill and goaltending have been consistently reliable, giving them a clear edge against a San Jose team that still struggles to keep pucks out of the net. While the Sharks have shown flashes of improvement, their defensive lapses and penalty kill issues remain a major concern. The Jets’ balanced attack and disciplined play should allow them to control the tempo and capitalize on mistakes. With superior depth and experience, Winnipeg is well-positioned to dictate this game and come away with a convincing win on the road.</td></tr>

They just got blown out by 20 by Northern Illinois who is KenPom ranked 298 and picked to finish last in the MAC. UL Monroe finished with **18** rebounds in this game and gave up 31 2nd chance points. Yes, you read that right, 18 total rebounds in a game…. Don’t think I have heard of that before.

After that performance, UL Monroe is almost dead last on KenPom rankings at 358 of 365 teams….
Ole Miss sits at 22 ranked on KenPom currently.

Ole Miss will Dominate them on the boards. If they happen to miss they will grab the ball right back.

Ole Miss on the other hand is a possible Sweet-16 caliber team. They’re coming off a game in which they covered the spread by 8 points winning by 30.

Cremonese, on the other hand, is more balanced: with better attack indicators (about 1.2 goals/game), and their record is relatively more stable.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Twente to win + under 5.5 match goals (odds 1.57)

Twente have not won in their last three Eredivisie games and should bounce back here with a comfortable win over Telstar, who lost five of their last seven Eredivisie games. Twente at home with a way superior squad have no excuse to not win tonight.

The under 5.5 goals is to boost the odds from 1.39 to 1.57. Telstar usually have high scoring matches at home, but when they play away they always take a more cautious defensive approach leading to less goals. All 5 of Telstar&#x27;s away matches have seen under 3.5 goals happen. The 5 home matches for Twente have seen under 5.5 goals happen in all of them.

Quite confident in this one, good luck if you&#x27;re brave enough to tail after all those losses haha 🍀

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: NBA Pistons v Nets 

1U Duncan Robinson O2.5 3s made @ $1.80, B365 

Write-Up: Robinson in a good spot here form wise (hit this line in his last 4 games), usage (averaging 6.5 3s a game this year, so on average should go over considering he’s an approx 40% shooter), and the Nets are a league worst 3 point defence team (teams averaging 42% 3pt shooting on them). He hit this in 2/3( games against the Nets last year. 

Cunningham should be dominating at guard and kicking it out to the corner for Robinson to make his mark. A similar player in DiVincenzo went 6-13 from 3 just a few days ago v the Nets. Harris is still out, as is Ivey, and LeVert is questionable so his minutes &amp; usage should be solid. 

Would be happy to get back on the winners board after 2 losses in a row chasing bigger value odds and feeling like both could have easily hit. 

As always, if this bet interests you it’s reasonable to discuss the antithesis. 3 point bets can be unreliable, and there is a solid blow-out risk in this game (Pistons won all 3 games by 10+ last year v the Nets). However I think there’s a strong chance that if the blowout occurs Robinson hasn’t completely blown it from 3.</td></tr>

**Write up:**

Regular tailers know why we stay with 2 units on a Friday, not that we&#x27;ve had wrong picks but simply because the supply in football games isn&#x27;t as big as your regular Saturday/Sunday. Adding onto my motivation on keeping our bet at 2 units is because I&#x27;ve picked lower leagues here.

**Airdrieonians v Partick (19.45 GMT)**

**Partick is 2nd in the table** and they are looking to get straight promotion to the Scottish Prem. They&#x27;ve **won 5 out of their last 8** Premiership matches. They **smashed 9th place Queen&#x27;s Park 5-0** last weekend, in case you want to measure how they perform against lower teams.

**Airdrieonians is in last place(10th)** and have **lost in 9 of their last 14** matches. 3 out of the other 5 matches were draws against teams in 8th and 9th. They&#x27;ve lost 3-0 against first place St. Johnstone last weekend if you want to measure how they perform against teams that are placed high in the league table.

**Taborsko v Jihlava (16.00 GMT)**

**2nd place Taborsko** are hosting **11th place Jihlava**. Taborsko have **won 10/15** games this season. They have an unbeaten streak in the league thats going on for 12 matches, with 9 of them wins and **only 3 draws against 4th, 5th and 3rd.**

Jihlava have **only grabbed a point or more in 4 of their 10 recent matches**, and they were **against teams in 14th, 12th, 8th, 16th.** Bare in mind that this league only has 16 teams. I don&#x27;t see them standing a chance against the team in second here.

**Best of luck if tailing!** 🍀

NBA | Raptors vs Hawks | 🏀  

Trae still out for the Hawks and increased usage on Jalen Johnson, for obvious reasons Jalen’s role in running the offense has gotten bigger and playmaking duties aswell. Since Trae has been out he’s over in 2/3 games with the sole miss being last game where he had 22 PA, he was dealing with foul trouble and didn’t get the volume he has had previously as a result, 30 &amp; 28 PA in the other two games and over in 5/7 this season (4/L5).

30 PA in the earlier matchup this season against the Raptors WITH Trae playing, with this being a cup game his minutes should be even higher and as I mentioned his role in the offense aswell. Has had 9+ potential assists in every game without Trae and assist numbers has gone up, Hawks need Jalen to do both in this one which is why I like the PA.

Raptors ranked top 5 in most points allowed to PF’s &amp; top 10 in assists.</td></tr>

Event: MLS Cup Playoff Soccer Game 3/3 (series tied 1-1) #5 NYCFC (17-5-12) @ #4 Charlotte FC (19-2-13) 11/7 7PM EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: New York City FC ML +180 (1 Unit)

Write up: The first of 5 different winner take all playoff games happening this weekend in the first round of the MLS Playoffs kicks off tonight when New York travels to Charlotte, North Carolina. Game 1 was a narrow 1-0 victory in the same building for NYC, while Charlotte emerged victorious via a penalty shootout following a 0-0 draw in game 2. The winner advances to face the #1 overall ranked Philadelphia Union.

This match will be the 5th one between these two sides this season, and NYC has held the edge as of late. Charlotte won their first game 2-0 back in July, however New York avenged that loss with a 2-0 win of their own in September. And in the first 2 games of this playoff series, NYC has registered 22 shots (10 on target) compared to Charlotte’s 14 (7 on target). Additionally, NYCFC held 55% of possession in both playoff games. Excluding the penalty shootout, CFC has not scored against NYC since July, while New York has scored 3 goals against them.

NYCFC seems to be a puzzle that Charlotte FC can’t solve lately, and I don’t see that changing tonight. CFC may have extended the series to game 3 via penalties, but I don’t think they’ll pull that off this time. I’m backing the away side to pull off a close win.

Soccer | EFL Championship | Watford vs Bristol City | 3:00pm EST 

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** **Watford ML** (+110) 1U

Write Up: Moving swiftly on, we see Watford host Bristol City for their 15th game of the season. Watford, coming off a hard earned draw away from home, face off against a cold Bristol. Bristol have won just two of their last 8 games against Watford, the Hornets are used to this. Having taken down third place Middlesbrough earlier this month with a commanding 3 nil wi, they look to extend their November unbeaten run. A key factor in this fixture is Watford playing at home, Watford at home have won their last 3 matches in commanding fashion. Bristol coming off two tough losses from Stoke and Blackburn look to bounce back away from home. Watford are heading into this match with momentum and a great record at home, facing a side plagued by injuries and recent defeat.

Watford at home boast an impressive 4-1-1 record where Bristol sport a 2-2-2 record away from home this season. Watford have scored at least one goal in their last 13 matches against Bristol when they play at home, scoring is not an issue for Watford. Watford have not lost a match in 7 of their last 8 home games this season. Both teams are fighting to secure 3 points in hopes of finishing within the top 6. I expect a close match with Watford having a slight edge against a weakened Bristol side.</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>**POTD Record 42-36-1**

Man, that Suns game was IMO the best type of game to bet on. They trailed 48-51 at the half against the Clippers, then exploded to dominate the second half and walk away with a 115-102 win. Jalen Green looked like he was unleashed in his Phoenix debut, dropping 29 points in 23 minutes and raining threes. The Clippers tried to hang around, but once Phoenix flipped the switch, the cover was locked and I could continue on with my evening.

Back at it. Now we slide right into the Battle of Texas with my next play.

**Spurs +3**

Here’s the thing: I know Houston is slick, and their defense has been legit, but they may be down a key piece in this matchup. Steven Adams. and that changes everything when you’re facing a 7’4″ freak like Victor Wembanyama. Wemby’s last two nights were rough. Fouled out in one, barely 9/9 in the other. You know what that means (and one of my favorite theories in sports)? He’s due. He’s pissed. Even if adams does play, I still love getting them + money at home.

Last game, Wemby fouls out in the 4th. Six fouls, rhythm never really there, and he’s on the bench when it matters. Brutal. Game before that, 9 points, 9 rebounds. So you’ve got box scores that make him look mortal, fouls piling up, and people complaining about how bad he was his last two games. comments like &quot;overrated. I’m not buying it. What I am buying is that this is the exact kind of game where a guy like Victor absolutely loses his mind in a good way (I know I have said that the last few days). Yeah. This is a “statement game” spot if I’ve ever seen one (again said that last game - doubling down). I am so high on this guy, and I know thats not a bold statement, but when a player comes in doing things youve never seen before, it usually ends with changing the game completely, and a a decade of championship runs.

Okay back to the game. Houstons backcourt / creation is where they have the edge. So far this season, without FVF, the Rockets move the ball pretty well, and make a lot fewer dumb decisions than San Antonio’s young backcourt. The Spurs’ guards are talented, but they turn it over more and go through stretches where the offense just… dies. If this comes down to pure guard play in the final three minutes, I do lean Houston. But that’s also why you’re getting +3 and not Spurs as favorites. The line is telling you that they know Houston is the more stable team, but we also know Wemby might flip the board, which when he does, he does it unlike anyone has since Curry.

Houston’s defense is physical, disciplined, well-coached. They close out, they rotate, they make you hit jumpers. Houston’s bigs however, are where I think the advantage can be had for SA. They are more mobile than muscle; that’s exactly Wemby’s zone. No one is more mobile than him. He feasts when he doesn’t have to wrestle. Meanwhile, the Spurs have length, mix, and a slowing-down game plan that hurts the Rockets’ motion. Yes, Houston still has guard strength and creation (and KD), but the number gives you breathing room.

You’re not betting a hoop-shot win, you’re betting a bounce-back statement by a young core that doesn’t want to play backup in the division, at home. I mean, this matchup could be a rivalry for the next few years. Neither of these teams are going anywhere.

Overall, you all know my most weighted angle is a bet on Wemby, but I also like the way this team battled in LA in their last game, even with the countless mistakes, and missed opportunities, they stayed alive. I am not claiming a 50 point game in this one, but rather and exciting game where the Spurs get back to the domination they did to start the season.

PS: Detroit -10.5. BKN Sucks, and Detroit has covered 4 straight and are 2-0 ATS in games -7.5+. Also did I mention BKN sucks?</td></tr>

Write up: If you’ve been rocking with me on <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> for the time I’ve been on here, you know I don’t lose two in a row. Wild just lost to the hurricanes 4-3 tonight and now head up to New York to take on the islanders on the second leg of a b2b. We will see both backup goalies in (although the islanders backup has been slightly better). In the past 10 games the islanders have found some offensive rhythm, posting 28 goals! The Wild have only put up 20, yet have actually been expected to put up 34 in that stretch! The Wild have one of the best power play percentages in hockey right now as well at 30% which is unreal. That doesn’t bode well against an islanders team that has had an absurd 147 penalty minutes on the year! The Wild also have been expected to allow 36 goals over that stretch! The islanders will be rested and hungry after dropping two straight and losing in ot to the bruins 4-3 in a so! The Wild are 8-6 to the over and the islanders are 10-3 to the Over! Both of these teams are top 13 in expected goals for per 60 mins and both are bottom 8 in the league in expected goals against per 60 minutes! I like the fact that we can get an islanders team that should be able to find a groove against a tired legged wild team and I certainly expect the Wild to get a few in there after coming off a close loss in Carolina and going up against an islanders team allowing they’re oppenents almost 3.7 power plays per game! That’s terrible, not to mention they have a penalty kill percentage of under 75%!!

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: [NCAA Basketball] Wisconsin -27.5 vs Northern Illinois (FanDuel -110) 8:30 PM EST

Analysis: Similar situation to Florida yesterday. Wisconsin will be taking on the Northern Illinois Huskies in an early season tune up game. A little bit about the Huskies is that they went 5-25 last season finishing dead last in the MAC and are picked to finish dead last in the MAC this year as well. Long story short, this team is inexperienced and not supposed to be competitive this year. 

On the other side, the Badgers are led by Preseason Naismith Trophy Watchlist member John Blackwell, as well as 7’0 Nolan Winter in the paint and should dominate the Huskies all night with their size, athleticism, and overall talent level advantage. Also I should note that the #24 Badgers punished Campbell 96-64 on Monday and Campbell is a much better team than NIU. I expect a 30+ point domination from the Badgers tonight.

**Write-up:**  
First leg, Richard Martins. This is a layup fight for him. He lost a decision to Daniil Donchenko in TUF, but Donchenko turned out to be legit. His earlier loss to Manuel Sosa also aged well since Sosa got signed to the UFC. UFC is clearly still keeping an eye on Martins, and he probably gets another DWCS shot soon, so he just needs a few highlight wins on his record. His opponent is a can crusher and cherry-picked for Martin. Martins should get this done.

Second leg, Elbek. Carlo is explosive early, but his only loss showed the  hole in his game, once he gets taken down, he can be controlled. That’s exactly what Elbek is good at. I see him getting Carlo down early and looking for a finish in round 1 or 2, but to stay safe, we’re taking the ML. As long as he avoids that early chaos, he should win and keep his undefeated record.

NCAAF // Tulane Green Wave @ Memphis Tigers 

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Memphis -3.5 (-110) 1u**

  
Let&#x27;s head to Memphis, TN where the Tigers play host in a night game to the Green Wave whatever that is supposed to be. 



After an inexplicable loss to UAB, Memphis is back in form with a convincing win over Rice and a very quality win against #18 South Florida. The first iteration of the CFP bracket came out this week, and they slotted Memphis into the #12 spot. The pressure is on Memphis the remainder of the season, they absolutely cannot drop another game, and I don&#x27;t think they will. Outside of their 1 score loss to UAB they have been flexing all season long even going toe to toe with the big bad SEC and beating Arkansas. 



Tulane&#x27;s playoff hopes died last week at the hands of 4-4 UTSA when they got beat handily 48-26. They did have some quality wins before that but a loss like that puts a major damper in their momentum. They allowed over 500 yards to the Roadrunners and tossed 3 interceptions in the process.



Now of course teams sometimes just have a bad game, and I still think Tulane is a well above average group of 5 team, but I&#x27;m just not convinced they will be able to contend with Memphis, especially in what will be a tough road environment. 

  
Let&#x27;s look at the numbers:

Memphis Total Offense- #35 (430 ypg)     Tulane Total Offense- #56 (408 ypg)

Memphis Scoring Offense- #12 (37.7ppg)     Tulane Scoring Offense- #80 (25.9ppg)

Memphis Total Defense- #48 (347ypg allowed)     Tulane Total Defense- #103 (402ypg allowed)

Memphis Scoring Defense- #24 (19.22ppg allowed)     Tulane Scoring Defense- #79 (25.5ppg allowed)

  
Memphis is the statistically superior team which we can take a little bit from because they are in the same conference and have faced similar competition so far this year. I think the scoring opportunities will be there for Memphis.

  
Another thing to consider with Memphis is they simply do not beat themselves. They sit at 10th nationally in turnover margin 17-8 while Tulane has a turnover margin of 11-10 on the year. 

Memphis sits 27th nationally with 45 penalty yards per game, while Tulane is all the way down at 122nd nationally racking up 67.88 penalty yards per game. 

Memphis is a fundamentally sound, disciplined team who I think understands the position they are in now after seeing their names on the TV for the final playoff spot. 

  
Memphis has been an absolute cash cow this year sitting at 8-1 ATS, 4-0 ATS at home. Tulane is at 3-4 ATS and 1-3 ATS on the road. 

  
I fully expect this line to creep all day long and end around 5.5. This is a primetime game on ESPN and them boys from Memphis are ready for the spotlight!</td></tr>

Tournament: IEM Chengdu  
Time: 4:45 AM EST.

**Writeup:**

* FURIA are picking their map 2nd in this series, they have been on fire with their new roster, this team in my opinion is a dark horse for the upcoming major and they are in great form at the moment. Not only is their roster been great and hitting extremely hard but their map pool is also tremendous with all maps being above 50% winrate and not really having any &quot;weak&quot; maps in the pool that are exploitable as a punish <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> against them like many teams do have
* MongolZ are in a bit of a weird spot, they are coming off of benching their best player by far in Senzu, they have a 3-1 record at this tournament so far despite looking pretty shaky at some points throughout the tournament. New pickup Controlez has had a decent tournament so far for how fast he was thrust in to tier one and has had his moments of looking good. MongolZ map pool still seems relatively the same as before with a slightly higher priority on Inferno, but still strong on Ancient/Mirage
* MongolZ have won the h2h overall against FURIA lifetime but in the last few months (Since FURIA picked up molodoy) the h2h has flipped in FURIA favor, MongolZ were 5-2 with a 9-3 map record against FURIA in early 2025, but in the last 3 months, FURIA are 2-0 in matches with a 5-2 overall game record against MongolZ.

**Veto:**

* MongolZ ban Train, FURIA ban Ancient
* MongolZ <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> Mirage/Inferno, FURIA <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> Overpass

**Overpass Stats:**

* FURIA are 83% winrate on 12 maps of Overpass in the L3 months, they are the best Overpass team in the world in my opinion, they have been on an absolute rampage. They are on a 9 map winstreak on Overpass with huge wins over teams like MOUZ/Aurora/Vitality/G2 and more, who are some of the best teams in the world. So far at this tournament they are 2-0 on Overpass with wins against G2/MOUZ. Overpass is a historically very CT sided map which makes it a bit scary to bet on in the traditional sense since mongolZ would start CT side but FURIA have averaged a 58% T side winrate
* MongolZ are 60% winrate on 5 maps played on Overpass in the L3 months, this is their least played map and despite them jumping out to some strong results with wins vs. TYLOO/GamerLegion/TYLOO, they have lost their last two maps on Overpass losing to HOTU 13-8 and losing at this tournament to HEROIC 13-10

Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> : Football - UCL - Totenham Vs Copenhagen - Under 8.5 Shot On Target - Odds : 1.81 ( 4 Unit ) - Time 20:00 ❌

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> : Football - Serie A - Pisa Vs Cremonese - Under 8.5 Shot on Target - Odds : 1.61 ( 2 Unit ) - 19.45 UK Time

Both Pisa and Cremonese are fairly average Serie B sides that tend to cancel each other out. Neither team creates a high number of clear chances, and their games are often cautious and tight. Betting on draw in this game might be good but to damn risky. Low odds so going for 2 unit only.</td></tr>

Last Pick: Jamal Murray (Nuggets) O30.5 PRA @ 1.89. 3U. ❌

Murray has been an excellent shooter all season but went just 1/8 on 3s, many of which were good looks. He still ended with 25 PRAs, so I don’t think it was a terrible read, just a bad shooting night.

 

Next <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **Kristaps Porzingis (Hawks) O6.5 Rebs @ 1.84**. 4U play.

Returning to a Porzingis prop for the 3^(rd) time this season because I still believe the Hawks are being careful with his minutes (&lt;27 in each game) and he’s had poor shooting to start the season. Despite that he has put up decent numbers. With Trae out, and him adjusting to life as a Hawk, I expect him to take on more offensive responsibility and play bigger minutes. The Raptors will have Poeltl and Barnes so Porzingis will need to be more aggressive on the defensive glass, similar to the Cleveland game. Also, with Poeltl who operates entirely in the paint, he’ll be near the basket more than usual. He’s over this line in 4/L5 games against the Raptors. This is expected to be a close game, so with big minutes and a 3 day break, I will back Porzingis to cover this line.</td></tr>

WATFORD VS BRISTOL CITY

Date: 07 NOVEMBER 2025 at 21:00

BET ON: Match odds- WATFORD

Odd: 2.16



\- Watford look well placed to win against Bristol City, with Javi Gracia’s return restoring structure and belief. The Hornets’ recent home form — including wins over West Brom (2–1) and Middlesbrough (3–0) — highlights their growing attacking cohesion and defensive solidity. Bristol City, on the other hand, arrive depleted, missing around ten players including both first-choice wing-backs Neto Borges and Mark Sykes. The visitors’ morale is low after consecutive defeats and a heavy 5–1 loss to Stoke. With Watford motivated to push into the top eight and tactically sharper under Gracia, they look primed to capitalise on City’s injury crisis and fragile confidence.</td></tr>

Event: Soccer/Football, [Denmark Superliga] Odense vs Silkeborg


<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: BTTS + Over 2.5 goals @ 1.83 - 2 Units


A great meeting for goals as both teams top the table in total goals per game. Odense have managed to cover this line so far in 11/14 games, at home in 6/7. Silkeborg have covered in 8/14, and in 5/5 away games. The two sides already met earlier in a 2-1 win for Silkeborg, they also met earlier this year in a 2-2 draw. Both sides have no struggle to score either as they&#x27;ve scored on all kinds of teams, even on the strongest ones in the league.</td></tr>

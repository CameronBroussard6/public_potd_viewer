**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** JK Dobbins - o14.5 Longest Rush Attempt (-125 on ESPN Bet)

**Writeup:** *JK Dobbins has been a bowling ball this season, clearing this line in 86% of games (6/7) with an average longest rush of 22 yards per attempt.*

*Enter the Cowboys. Backfields this year have averaged \~103 rushing yards on 22–23 attempts (4.61 YPC) against them, allowing chunk-yardage efficiency.* 

*This has allowed every high useage back to cover this line this season:*

*Rico Dowdle - 15 Longest Rush Attempt*  
*Breece Hall - 22 LoR*  
*Josh Jacobs - 19 LoR*  
*Saquon Barkley - 16 LoR*

*Stylistically, this sets up for Dobbins. He’s a decisive, one-cut runner—hit the landmark, stick your foot in the ground, and go. Against Dallas’ front, that cutback lane shows up a few times a game.*

*The Cowboys’ run metrics are solid snap-to-snap, but they allow above-average yards after contact and have coughed up explosives when backs get through the first wave. That’s Dobbins’ wheelhouse.*

*With a realistic 12–16 carries in a neutral script and the way Dallas has given up sporadic gashes to RBs, you’re live on every early-down touch.*

*Dallas looks sturdier against zone than they do against man/gap concepts, where higher yards per carry and a bump in explosive rate is allowed. Dobbins favors in gap runs, having 59 carries there compared to the 44 zone carries.*

*Dobbins is a perfect fit for those gap looks: downhill, decisive, and a strong finisher through the second level. One clean B-gap crease on GT counter or duo, and you’ve got the one play you need to clear 15.5.*</td></tr>

Sport | League | Event Time: NFL - Green Bay Packers at Pittsburgh Steelers 8:20PM EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Josh Jacobs - Most Rushing Yards in the game (Only know of on Fanduel, -145, 3 units)

Reasoning:

Steelers rank 18th in terms of rush yards per game with 115.8 allowed, Packers are 2nd with 76.5

Add in that the Steelers use a true platoon with Warren and Gainwell (and occasionally Kaleb Johnson), while the Packers have a true bellcow running back in Josh Jacobs.  Warren went off last week so his over/unders should be up a bit, adding to our odds slightly, but it was vs Cincinatti&#x27;s putrid defense.

Ranking 18th Jacobs averages 69 (nice) yards per game

Warren ranks 27th at 62.5 yards per game after an extreme outlier week.  Prior to that it was 44 yards per game.

Gainwell is mostly just a receiving back

For <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>

La Liga 

Real Madrid vs Barcelona: Real Madrid ML @1.9

Both sides come into this Clásico with flaws, but the difference is simple: Real Madrid’s weaknesses are far less damaging. Barcelona are still missing key finishers like Lewandowski and Raphinha, and their current front line can be very wasteful.

I think madrid has been defensively the much better side with huijsen and militao being in good form. Also the keepers are a big mismatch, missing joan garcia is a big problem for barcelona. 

If cubarsi and garcia start as the projected lineups suggest, then i think mbappe will feast. This is the type of game where araujo should start and christensen if he is fit. 

All things considered, with the home advantage and Mbappé in top form, I see Real Madrid as clear favourites for this one.

Good luck on your bets</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>**POTD Record :** 89 – 56 - 7

**Previous :** Levski Sofia ML vs Dobrudzha &amp; Both teams &quot;NOT&quot; to score – **WINNING!**

**Recap:**  Finally things went according to plan.  Levski Sofia win 3-0.

**New Event:** EPL- Aston Villa vs Manchester City &amp; La Liga - Real Madrid vs Barcelona

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:**  Man City Win or Draw &amp; Real Madrid vs Barcelona Over 4.5 cards @ 1.80 (Usual 3 units)

**Leg 1**:  Man City Win/Draw vs Aston Villa

City visit Villa Park stadium as strong favorites after beating Villareal in Spain midweek in Champions League competition, while hosts Villa are licking their wounds after heading to the Netherlands only to lose to the Go Ahead Eagles, also for Champions League.

Aston Villa sit 12^(th) in the table right behind Brentford and Newcastle but slightly ahead of Brighton, all teams which had fairly decent performances <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> upsetting the likes of Chelsea and Liverpool.  This league can and does surprise as the level of competition is very high, and City is no stranger to the occasional upset.  However, City have lost only once in their last 10 matches and seem to have found their stride with Golden Boot favorite Haaland scoring 11 of their 17 goals this season.

City are currently 3^(rd) and can ill afford to drop points as they are within a match of catching Arsenal for the lead.  No major injury concerns to report for either side. 

There is no question Man City is the better squad and I am backing them to not lose.  As usual taking the better team and the odds are not terrible either.

**Leg 2**:  El Clasico - Real Madrid vs Barcelona – Over 4.5 Cards

One of the most anticipated rivalries in the sport.  This one in particular should be quite “caliente” with plenty of fouls and cards to go around. 

* Since 2024 they have played 6 times, of which Barcelona has won the last 4 in a row, 2 of which were at Real Madrid’s Bernabeau Stadium by scores of 5-2 and 4-0.  Those 2 matches had 7 and 10 cards each.
* Of their last 6 H2H matches, there have been an average of 6.6 yellow cards per game and a total of 4 red cards on top since 2024.
* In the last 4 meetings between these 2 there have been at least 7 cards per match.
* Since 2024 no match has had less than 5 cards.

To say Real Madrid is pissed and insulted in an understatement after getting embarrassed in front of their home crowd in such fashion.  They are currently league leaders atop of the table with Barcelona trailing in 2^(nd) place just 2 points behind.  This adds another dimension to the match as the winner also becomes the league leader.

There are plenty of reasons and ways to see that the animosity shared by these two Spanish giants goes beyond just bad blood due to sport.  There is historical context that goes along, but we will not get into that now.  If the previous stats are any indication of how this game will be played, I expect war on the field.  4.5 should be an easy cover.

Last Pick: Sofia Kenin 🇺🇸 U4.5 double faults vs Belinda Bencic 🇨🇭 ❌

Event: Premier League ⚽️

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Crystal Palace U2.5 team cards vs Arsenal 3U @ 1.72 (Bet365)

Write-up: Pretty unlucky loss but we’ve been on the other side of this quite a bit recently so I can’t complain, it was bound to happen. As expected it was a battle between the two with Bencic coming out on top in three sets. 2 double faults in the first set followed by another 2 in the second necessitated none in the third from Kenin. Unfortunately she waited until the last game of the match at 5-2 to DF a fifth time. 

We should be in for an entertaining game at the Emirates as this is a fixture that has historically brought goals aplenty, ending 2-2 and 1-5 last year. Arsenal are top of the league at the moment and have established themselves as the best defence in the world only conceding 3 all season. Meanwhile after a very promising start to the season, winning the Community Shield after the FA Cup last season, Palace are winless in their last three. Referee of the day Thomas Bramall is amongst the most lenient referees in the league averaging 4 booking points per match. Meanwhile, Palace have received an average of 2.25 yellows per match this season. What really amazed me while analysing this match is the fact that this line has been cleared in the last 22 matches between the two sides, dating back to 2014. That is honestly quite absurd and though doesn’t represent a whole lot of a deal, shows that despite being a “London derby” tensions usually remain low, which should help with decreasing bookings. Using all factors I get a mean of 1.90 bookings for Palace.

That gives this play an estimated 68% chance of winning. By building in the H2H I would give it closer to a 73% chance of winning (1.70 bookings). BOL !</td></tr>

EVENT/S = Arsenal VS Crystal Palaca

PARLAY BET =  Arsenal to win Second half and Viktor Gyokeres to have over 0.5 shots on target @2.07

UNITS = 3U to Profit 3.21U

SUMMARY =  I looked at a lot of games and a lot of players, even looking at the NBA which I am also a big fan of but statistically and for value I have decided on Arsenal. Arsenal have won every second half this season aside from 2. Their win against United earlier in the season had a second half with no goals and the wonder free kick Conceded against Liverpool from Szoboszlai. I actually see Arsenal winning both halves after a strong performance last time out against Atletico Madrid I think their form will be too strong and the fact they are a team that closes out games is a good sign, Crystal Palace form isn&#x27;t too relevant here but they haven&#x27;t been great recently, they do score goals but their 2nd half stats are far too inconsistent to hold any relevancy to me. Now onto the second part of the bet, Gyokeres has been a pretty average striker for majority of the season so far but he had a really good game against Atletico Madrid bagging 2 goals for himself. He has hit one shot on target in every game this season apart from 3. The game against city that ended 1-1, the loss against Liverpool previously mentioned and the opener against Man United. Every other game he has hit 1 shot on target if not more. I feel like he scores in this game but getting value for 1 shot on target is even better. Let&#x27;s make it a winning return and 8 wins in a row.

Last POTD: 🏈 Oronde Gasden II 25+ alt receiving yards + Under 52.5 alt total points (-139). 💰

Writeup: Gasden is going to be legit in this league. Not only did he hit his actual line of 44 yards but he hit the 60-100 range I mentioned in the last writeup. The under got a little squirrely at the end with LA having a chance to score a touchdown late, but they were stopped for a field goal. 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: 🏈 Jonathan Taylor under 20.5 Rushing Attempts (-114)

Game starts at 4:25pm EST. Bet 2.75u

Writeup: Going for a non primetime game this weekend as we are once again going with a Colts bet. We are taking the under on JT&#x27;s rush attempts, and this is actually because I continue to have a positive outlook on the Colts. They are going up against the Tennessee Titans, who are probably a bottom 3 team in the NFL. The spread for this game is Colts -14.5, and I like the Colts with their points in a decisive victory. Over the course of the season, JT has been averaging 18.5 rush attempts and has only gone over this line twice. Over the last 5 weeks, Jonathan Taylor has been under this line 4 times. Those 4 games were ones where the Colts were up big by the 4th quarter, and they would pull JT to rest him in the 4th because he wasn&#x27;t needed in order to win. The one time he went over this line, by 1 rush attempt, was against the Cardinals. This game was won by the Colts by only 4 points and came down to the wire - JT was needed all game. The second game where he went over was against the Broncos - another close game. You see the pattern? If we follow the trends here, JT and the Colts will have yet another effective game where JT will not need to run much, and he could once again get pulled early. There are still games in the 5 game stretch where he wasn&#x27;t pulled and still stayed under this line, so don&#x27;t worry about that. The last time the Colts played the Titans, JT only had 17 rush attempts. If the Titans defense manage to stop JT on the ground, this only helps us. The Colts are genuinely playing for the Super Bowl - if they can rest their stars, they will whenever they can. JT does not need to and will not go over 20.5 rush attempts in this game.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Football - A-League - Brisbane Roar v Wellington Phoenix - Under 2.5 Goals - $1.90 - 1.0 Unit - *starting in roughly 2 hours..*

Brisbane will travel to Wellington for their second game of the season. The catch is that Wellington have just gone to Perth and back (15 hours of flight time), so they are more likely to be affected if anything.

Brisbane enjoyed a 1-0 win at home to Macarthur in their first game, and only registered 6 shots, creating 1 big chance, with 36% possession of the ball. But what’s impressive was their ability to shut them out as the Roar were playing with 10 men from the 58th minute onwards.

Wellington managed a 2-2 draw with Perth away from home. Perth conceded 4 to City yesterday and were looking quite amateur, so the Wellington result doesn’t read so well considering they only managed 0.78xG for their 2 goals.

I believe Brisbane will take the safe approach here, as they don’t want to drop any points after a strong start. I expect them to have more ball than last game but Wellington may struggle to break them down resulting in a low scoring game. If Brisbane get a lead they will try to manage the game and inevitably park the bus.

This fixture has hit the under 2.5 goal line for the past 5 matches and the last time it produced more than 2 goals was back in 2023. They both lack natural goal scorers and only averaged just over a goal per game each last season.

I do have a slight concern about their defensive records from last season, so I’m keeping it safe with a 1 unit play.

* Ag1l has been playing great for SAW averaging a .74 KPR in the L3 months with a 51.3% headshot in that time
* Veto should be straight forward here, while it would normally be messy (both teams perma ban the same map), we have seen 3DMAX time and time again ban Mirage, even against teams who also perma ban Mirage. They have a 100% first ban rate of Mirage, and last time they played SAW (Feb 2025), they banned Mirage first. SAW should ban Inferno, it is their worst map by far and one 3DMAX are dominant on
* SAW have first <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> in this series, I&#x27;d be really stunned to see them go anything but Nuke as their first <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. 3DMAX weren&#x27;t known as a great Nuke team earlier in the year but recently have been red hot on the map. Their winrate has climbed and they have begun first picking the map with a 65% winrate on 17 maps played with most of these games being against tier one teams which is very impressive.
* Despite this, SAW have a 92% winrate on Nuke and are on a 10 map winstreak on the map, they are so dominant and so good at this map that even teams that don&#x27;t normally first ban Nuke have started to ban it against them. They first <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> this map in 59% of their matches which is an insanely high amount and for good reason.
* Ag1l leads SAW on Nuke, this is his best map by far on the roster. He is averaging a .85 KPR in the L3 months on Nuke (+.11 KPR) over a strong sample of rounds, and a .81 KPR in the L6 months on Nuke (+.10 KPR) on the map overall. Not only is it a GREAT map for KPR/his overall kills, but his headshot number is also fantastic on this map. His headshot % goes up to 58.7% in the L3 months (+7.4%) and 59.3% in the L6 months (+9% overall).
* Ag1l is 14/16 hitrate on Nuke (both misses being at 6 headshots), needs \~11-12 kills to hit this line with a kill line currently at 13.5/14.5</td></tr>

__Event:__ NFL: Bucs @ Saints 4:05pm EST

__POTD:__ Chris Olave o59.5 rec yards (-115 on FD), 3.6u to win 3.13u

__Write Up:__ The (5-2) Bucs are traveling to New Orleans to take on the (1-6) Saints. The Bucs are 3.5-point favorites &amp; the total is set at 46.5 points scored. The Saints give up a ton of points. __The Saints have trailed for 88.6% of their offensive snaps, highest rate in the league. They are allowing 2.45 points per drive (28th).__ This is going to lead to a ton passes from the Saints offense, especially since The Bucs are one of the most pass funnel defenses in the league.

__The Bucs rank 4th in rushing success rate allowed &amp; EPA per rush allowed.__ They have only allowed one 100 yard rusher this season &amp; limited Saquon Barkley to 43 yards on 19 carries, Christian McCaffrey to 54 yards on 17 carries, &amp; Bijan Robinson to 24 yards on 12 carries. In their last 3 games they’ve given up the 3rd most passing yards per game (284 ypg). Teams would much rather pass facing that elite run defense. Tampa also blitzes  a ton. __The Bucs blitz at the 6th highest rate defensively (36%) &amp; they generating pressure on 53% of their plays (5th highest). Saints QB Spencer Rattler has actually done well when facing pressure, completing 58.1% of his pass attempts (5th) averaging 7.1 yards per attempt (8th). When facing a blitz, he has completed 70% of his throws (5th) for 7.3 yards per attempt (15th). The Bucs are allowing 7.7 yards per pass attempt (26th). Who has Rattler thrown to on blitzes? Saints star WR Chris Olave. Olave accounts for more than 50% of the team’s receiving yards, has a team-high 40% 1st read target rate, &amp; averages 0.85 points per route run on blitzed dropbacks. Opposing offenses use play-action at the lowest rate in the NFL vs. TB (19% dropbacks). Which is significant because Chris Olave averages 0.46 points per route run with &amp; without play action. Consistent production compared to the Saints WR Rashid Shaheed who averages 0.93 points per route run with play action and 0.26 without it.__ And by points I mean fantasy points, odd stat but I thought it was an interesting add. In the past few weeks Rattler &amp; Olave have connected a ton. Olave has been used on some deeper routes. __After averaging under 10 yards per catch in every game over the first 5 weeks, over the past 2 weeks, he has had 98 receiving yards in consecutive games.__

__Weeks 1-5: 1.4 Yards Per Route Run, 8.8 yards Average Depth of Target, 35% air yards, 36% endzone targets__

__Weeks 6-7: 3.5 YPRR, 15.5 aDOT, 45% air yards, 100% endzone targets__

The cause of this has been Rattler is starting to air it out more. __In Weeks 1-5 Rattler had an aDOT of 7.4. Weeks 6-7 his aDOT has risen to 10.2 aDOT.__ This has led to a ton of utilization for Olave. __Olave ranks 2nd in the NFL in targets with 68 targets. In the last 2 weeks, Olave is the #4 WR in Fantasy Life’s Utilization Score for the season, No. 7 (83).
And now this week he&#x27;s going against the Bucs, who have been dominated by every mid-sized perimeter WR1 they&#x27;ve faced. Week 3 Garrett Wilson went 10/84/1 receiving on 13 targets, Week 5 JSN went for 8/132/1 receiving on 9 targets, &amp; Week 6 Kendrick Bourne went for 5/142/0 receiving on 9 targets. Part of this is because the Bucs offense has done so well you have to pass to keep up. __The Buccaneers have turned the ball over on 5.2% of their drives, the 4th lowest rate in the league. Tampa Bay has scored 8 TD’s from outside of the red zone, 2nd in the league. Now they face the Saints that have allowed 6 TD outside of the red zone, most in the league.__ The Bucs defense allows I ton of explosive throws. __They given up 25 passes for 20+ yards (3rd most) &amp; 4 passes for 40+ yards (7th most).__

The Saints have lost 2 pieces to their run game with Kendre Miller &amp; Erik McCoy ruled out &amp; they are dogs playing in a dome. Rattler has the potential to throw the most passes of his career, against a blitz heavy defense. Olave will eat.

Real Madrid vs Barcelona

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> : Real Madrid to Win or Draw + BTTS @1.76 for 4u

Real Madrid are top of La Liga with 24 points and have won eight straight home matches at the Bernabeu, while their only loss all season was 5-2 to Atletico Madrid, showing they are very hard to beat especially at home. Barcelona have big injury problems that will hurt them badly, missing key players like Raphinha, Dani Olmo and Robert Lewandowski. Furthermore, Barca manager Hansi Flick will not be at the touchline due to the red card in the last match and therefore cannot give instructions during the match. Real Madrid also have few injuries, but players including Trent Alexander-Arnold, Dani Carvajal and Hujisen will be available for the el classico, and their attack is deadly with Kylian Mbappé scoring in eight straight games before the Champions League and having 10 goals in 9 La Liga matches. 

The both teams to score part is almost guaranteed because the last six El Clasico matches produced 33 total goals, and Barcelona have conceded in their last six matches including a 4-1 loss at Sevilla, while Real Madrid&#x27;s defense is also weak without their main defenders. With both teams needing to attack and both having defensive problems due to injuries, this match should have plenty of goals from both sides while Real Madrid&#x27;s home advantage makes it very unlikely they will lose.

Last pick: Brentford vs Liverpool (BTTS &amp; Over 2.5 goals @ 1.83) ✅️

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>: Real Madrid vs Barcelona (BTTS &amp; Over 2.5 &amp; over 1.5 goals in the 2nd half @ 1.75) 🍀

Another day, another Moist Conflict! Our bet went through in the first half, 39 minutes was all it took. It ended up 3-2 to Brentford. On to the next one, with the biggest football match in the world, El Classico.

Tomorrow’s El Clásico at the Santiago Bernabéu is the best spectacle football has to offer, and this edition is loaded with narrative, stats and two teams desperate to attack from the outset. Real Madrid arrive as league leaders with 24 points in 9 matches, while Barcelona trail closely with 22 points, making this a true top-of-the-table clash where a win would create daylight in the La Liga race. The numbers behind this fixture are staggering: the last six El Clásicos have averaged over 4 goals per game, with both teams scoring in every clash, remarkably, none of those matches ended goalless at half or full-time. The “BTTS &amp; Over 2.5 Goals” angle has landed repeatedly, and five of the last six encounters saw at least two goals after halftime as both teams emptied their tanks chasing results late on.

Recent H2H backs this up: Barcelona triumphed 4-3 in their most recent league meeting, and also produced a 5-2 win and a 3-2 cup final thriller earlier this year, while Real have netted in 14 of their last 15 matches in all competitions. Kylian Mbappé, leading the scoring charts with 10 goals in just 9 league matches, is historically devastating in this fixture, scoring 11 times in 8 previous El Clásicos. Barcelona’s attack has also been rampant, under Hansi Flick, they average 3.3 goals per league match this term, and star men Lewandowski, Raphinha and Yamal (Lewandowski and Raphinha will not be playing this match due to injury) have each contributed over 10 league goals already.

For the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>: Both Teams To Score &amp; Over 2.5 Goals &amp; Over 1.5 Goals in the 2nd Half, paying 1.75 is exceptional value considering these performances. Only two of the last ten meetings have stayed under 3 goals, with the majority featuring a frantic second half as both sides chase the result. The refereeing tends to let the game flow and, crucially, attacking players on both rosters are in peak form. The quality of this rivalry demands a big show, and the stats almost guarantee it: goals, drama, and a fast, open game from start to finish. Backing this with odds at 1.75 stands out as a strong value bet for tomorrow’s main event.

Let&#x27;s cash it!

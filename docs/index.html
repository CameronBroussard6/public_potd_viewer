**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: (NCAAB) Towson +2.5 vs Elon (-120) (7:00 PM EST)**

Reasoning: Taking Towson to cover as dogs on the road. Let’s break it down simply. We got a team with a high powered offense vs a team that’s elite defensively. Elon ranks 35th nationally in adjusted efficiency rating and 299th in adjusted defensive efficiency. They are up against a Towson team that held the last two opponents to less than 55 points and rank 94th in adjusted defensive efficiency nationally. While Towson is not as strong offensively, Elon’s lack of defense and Towson’s ability to grab offensive rebounds helps them compete offensively. Head to head history and line movement also favors Towson. I expect possessions to be limited as neither team plays at a fast pace and with limited possessions, give me the team with the massive defensive advantage.

Salzburg vs Basilea, BTTS NO @ 2.5 (5u)

BTTS – No based on recent trends and matchup dynamics. Salzburg are defensively disciplined at home, often controlling tempo and limiting clear chances, while Basilea have struggled to score consistently on the road. With Salzburg likely to dominate possession and Basilea prioritising structure over risk, this game points toward a one-sided scoreline or a low-scoring stalemate rather than goals at both ends.</td></tr>

Odds: 10/11

Reasoning: Forest average about 5.3 corners per game in this competition, so asking them for 4+ is a low bar. Braga and Forest combine for roughly 4.5 cards per match, so over 2.5 total cards clears most of the time. Put together, the data makes it land around 64%

Odds: -140 Fanduel

Reasoning: The Sabres have a bottom third defense this year. They&#x27;re fifth worst in shots allowed per game (29.65), and tenth worst in assists allowed per game (5.24). Importantly, the Sabres are third worst in assists allowed to defenseman (2.0). Tonight, they&#x27;re up against Lane Hutson who&#x27;s first in the league among defenseman in assists (43), and second in total points (52).

Event: NBA | Charlotte Hornets @ Orlando Magic (7:10 pm EST) | 🏀

*Recap: Relatively easy cash. Mercer jumped out with a 13-0 start and led by 17 at the half. Western Carolina clawed back within \~10 briefly in the second half, but Mercer&#x27;s home offense was good enough.* 

Charlotte arrives in Orlando for the second game of a back-to-back. The Hornets played a gritty second half in a home loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday. For the second leg of B2B this season, Charlotte is 6-3 straight up and 8-1 against the spread, including seven in a row! Four of the six B2B wins have come on the road. Maybe it&#x27;s a product of just how young the roster remains, but these Hornets are remarkably resilient on no rest. Meanwhile, the Magic are only 3–5 ATS when they have a rest advantage. They&#x27;re 3-7 ATS over the last 10 games. Orlando is returning from a two-game Euro stint. My thesis is there will be rust, especially as they continue to work the previously-injured Franz Wagner back into the mix. Orlando is 17-25 ATS all year, and I liked the fight I saw in the Hornets on Wednesday. By the way, Charlotte is 25-19 ATS - good for the fourth-highest coverage percentage in the league (56.8 percent). This is a divisional game and Charlotte has to be feeling itself after some solid recent showings ( wins over the Lakers and Nuggets). Give me the youth. Give me the points. 

Good luck and Godspeed!

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Buffalo Sabres @ Montreal Canadiens OVER 6.5 (-120 on BET365 at time of posting), 1U for 1.83U**

**Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> recap:** Got the result correct, just not the timing, as it took the Caps 2 periods to solve Montambault and they won in OT. I’ll play it safer this time, need to break this 3-<mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> cold streak.

**Write Up:** Been away a minute, life takes over sometimes. This is the 2nd of 3 matchups between these prior to the Olympic break, I’m picking OVER 6.5 goals scores. Here are a few salient points:

**1.** **Goalies**: Confirmed starters are Montambault (MTL) and Luukkonen (BUF). **Montambault&#x27;s got weak recent numbers with a 3.27 GAA &amp; .887 SV% L10, but a measly 3.67 GAA &amp; .858 SV% L10 @ home.** Luukkonen has a better 2.80 GAA &amp; .908 SV% L10, but 2.93 GAA and .896 SV% L10 away. So both are giving it up.

**2. Goalies H2H:** While Montambault&#x27;s lifetime stats vs. Buffalo (10GP) are better overall at 3.04 GAA &amp; .905 SV%, he last played them March 3 of last year, and that was a very different Sabres team. And offsetting that, **Luukkonen is 1-2-0 in 4 lifetime games vs. Montreal with a 4.54 GAA &amp; .847 SV%.** In the event the Sabres start Lyon, he&#x27;s got a lifetime 3.14 GAA &amp; .883 SV% vs. Montreal (7GP w/ 4 different clubs).

**3.** **Offenses**: Both are top 10 offenses: in goals for per game, Montreal is 3rd (3.4 G/GP), Buffalo 10th (3.27 G/GP). However, both offenses are hot right now: Montreal is 3.5G/GP L10, while Buffalo is sizzling at 3.9G/GP L10. Montreal&#x27;s shot-volume is also up L10 at 27.7 S/GP (season avg: 26.1), while both SA/GP L10 and season are 27.2. Buffalo&#x27;s shot-volume is down L10 at 24.6 S/GP (season: 27.8), while their 31.5 SA/GP L10 is up compared to season avg of 29.7, meaning **Buffalo&#x27;s shooting% is especially good right now (L10: S/GP -3.2 vs season avg, GF/GP +0.63 vs. season avg).**

**4. Defenses:** Montreal 10th worst in GA/GP (3.26), Buffalo 11th (3.12). L10 have been around these numbers for both teams.

**5. H2H this season:** Montreal won 4-2 on October 10 in Montreal, Buffalo won 5-3 on January 15 in Buffalo. Neither of tonight&#x27;s expected starers (Montambault &amp; Luukkonen) player in either game, but their above numbers don&#x27;t suggest it&#x27;ll improve.

**6.** **Recent O/U** **:** Sabres cashed the Over in 8/L10, Habs cashed in 6/L10, but 3 of 4 Montambault starts in that time. **Furthermore, when I started typing the line was -110 and has already moved to -120.**

Let’s get back in the win column tonight!

**BoL and play responsibly. Comment if you tail or fade if that&#x27;s your thing, or don&#x27;t, I&#x27;m not your mom.**</td></tr>

Review:  I don’t know about all of you but last nights hockey was some of the weirdest I’ve ever seen in one night in my life. I’m not making excuses, 0-2 is a bad start, but what I want most is to take accountability. There was a guy who tailed both bets and even made a .5 unit parlay. He welcomed me and thanked me and I returned the favor with two shitters, I will never recover from what I’ve done to you electronicswitch4812!!! I’m so sorry!! That said, what the actual fuck just happened, Dostal comes a rats dick away from having a clean sheet against Colorado?!?! That’s crazy in itself but what’s even crazier is that the Washington capitals are already in playoff form,  and physically unable to get out of their own zone against a team who doesn’t want to win! I’m letting the emotions get to me a little after I waited for a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> I loved to send in here first.

Hockey | NHL | Buffalo Sabres vs Montreal Canadiens 7 PM Eastern time

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Over 6.5 Total Goals (-112) 

Write up: 

This is a good matchup, both are young teams with some real fire power. You’ve got Cole Caufield and Nick Suzuki on one side and Tage Thompson and others (I was gonna say Dahlin but didn’t think those 2 duos really were the same). Lyon vs Montembeault in goal both these goal tenders average around 3 goals against per game. I believe this game will either go over 6.5 within the first two periods or each team will score once a period and go into OT 3-3 which would auto cash our bet. Typically in the nhl after a night where it’s basically low scoring all around, it’s followed by a night of real fireworks! Hopefully that’s what we get! 

PS I’m staying away from home dogs for the foreseeable future and Colorado lost to a team missing 3 of their top 5 scorers? I won’t get over this one for a while, anyone have any tips for that? Or should I just not lose a bet again?</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Todays Pick</mark>: NCAA 1U-Portland St (-3.5) at Eastern Washington 

To start Eastern Washington has been horrible defensively and are ranked 348th in college in PPG surrendering 83.3. They also average scoring almost five points less per game than Portland St. 

Size wise they match up pretty close but the edge looks like it will be for Portland state on the rebounds. They are just more active. Also causing over 13 turnovers PG. 

Only ding I can see for Portland here is there FT shooting hasn’t been great at 69%. They should be able to stretch the lead from 3 point land though. Eastern Washington hasn’t defended the perimeter well at all.

**Write-Up:**

Brunson got it done for us yesterday, gonna keep the 1Q picks rolling

Luka Dončić is one of the strongest first-quarter scorers in the league. Over his last 10 games, he is averaging **12.0 points in the first quarter** and has reached **10+ points in 7 of those games**. He is not passive early either, putting up around **8–12 shot attempts in the opening quarter alone**, the offense is running through him from the start.

The matchup also helps. In his last four games against the Clippers, Luka has scored **31, 29, 43, and 12 points**, averaging **28.8 PPG** in those meetings. On top of that, the Clippers rank **bottom 10 in the league in defensive efficiency against guards**, a weak spot that directly suits Luka’s ball-dominant scoring style.

With his recent first-quarter production, high early usage, and a favorable matchup, **10+ points in the first quarter** is a well-supported line tonight.</td></tr>

Last: galatasaray vs. Atletico 1@3.50❌

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>: Bologna vs. Celtic 1@1.75

Both teams are going into the match with great motivation. Bologna wants the win to lock in the top eight.

It comes from a shock home defeat in the league against the troubled Fiorentina with 1-2. The &quot;Rossoblu&quot; were not good in this game throughout. They saw the visitors open the score in the 19th minute, while two minutes earlier the &quot;Viola&quot; goal was canceled by VAR as offside. The 0-2 happened in the 45th minute, in the last phase of the first half, making things very difficult for Bologna, which woke up in the last quarter. They had a post in the 85th minute with Rowe and reduced it to 1-2 in the 88th minute with Fabian, also having a very big chance to equalize in the injury time of the match with Kambiagi, who was unable to score from a favorable position. &quot;There is no time for depression. I want a reaction against Celtic. &quot;I want to see the real Bologna,&quot; said the team&#x27;s coach Vincenzo Italiano in his post-match statements.

In the League Phase of the Europa League, Bologna, after six matches, is in 13th place with 11 points, -2 from 8th-placed Porto, with a 3-2-1 record. More specifically, they lost 1-0 away from Aston Villa, drew 1-1 at home with Freiburg, won over Romania and the home of Steaua Bucharest 1-2, drew 0-0 at home with Bran and had two big wins on the 5th and 6th matches, 4-1 at home with Salzburg and 1-2 at &quot;Balaidos&quot; of Celta Vigo. After the upcoming game against Celtic, they close the League Phase at Maccabi Tel Aviv, aiming for the top eight and direct qualification to the last 16 of the competition.

Match News: Midfielder Sulemana returned from his loan to Atalanta but is not eligible to participate. Midfielder Fabian was loaned to Fiorentina. Italiano does not count on the injured Bernardeschi Loukoumi and Vitic for the match, while Orsolini and Castro are doubtful. Skorupski Dominguez and Dalinga return to the starting lineup.

**Odds:** \-120

**Units:** 2U

**Reasoning:** Eastern Kentucky is simply the better team. North Florida has been one of the weakest teams in the ASUN, struggling badly on defense and allowing opponents to score at will. EKU has dominated this matchup in recent meetings, including road wins, and has consistently shown the ability to pull away late.

With a clear talent gap, strong head-to-head results, and betting markets firmly backing EKU, −6.5 is a solid and relatively safe spread play.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Jusuf Nurkic o27.5 pra (-117) DraftKings 3u

**Write-up:** The consistency here is crazy. I’ve been taking this bet every time he plays in the last week, and he’s covered every time. He has hit this in 12 out of his last 15 played. Nurkic has also hit this line in 9 straight games, getting 30 or more pra in each as well. He has hit this in 12 straight when playing 23 minutes or more. INSANE. That dates back to December 1st. Absolutely crushing it. In two of those games, he has already played the Spurs, going 29 and 34 in the last one. He is doing this against good teams and good centers. This guy is not a bum, honestly, one of the best centers in the league right now. He’s grabbing 30 pra versus guys like Sengun, Ayton, Jokic, Duran, Wemby, Chet, the list goes on, man. 

Now, regardless, this is a tough matchup. The Spurs do have the alien on their team. They are also toting a rank 3 restricted area defense in the last 15 games, where Nurkic takes 84% of his shots. Then again, he’s already played the Spurs twice in that time span. Now, he averages fewer potential rebounds against the Spurs, but makes up for it in above-average potential assists. Spurs also give up the most assists to centers in the league, ranking 30th. 

Hopefully, he stays consistent for us here for the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>. He’s been good to me recently. Let’s get it! Good luck, fellas. 🍀</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Parlay@2.99 (Coolbet) | **Stake: 2u** 

1. Brann vs Midtjylland (Under 3 Goals)@1.71
2. Young Boys vs Lyon (Lyon Wins)@1.75

**Write Up:** 

**Brann vs Midtjylland | 18:45 GMT +2**

* MIdtjylland have seen 3 or less in 4/6 EL games
* Brann have seen 3 or less in 5/6 EL games

MIdjylland have had an fantastic season so far in the Europa League with their 2nd place, having won all of their games besides a 2-1 defeat away against Roma. The highlight being their 3-2 away win over Nottingham Forest. 

Brann are happy enough with their performances so far with their 22nd place. They lost the opening game 2-1 against Lille in France, but on another day it easily could have been a point for them, and then there was the last game when Fenerbahce came to Bergen and could easily have won way more than 4-0. 

I think there is a decent chance for a low scoring game here that has a good chance of ending in a draw. Brann will be fairly defensive for this game and be content with sharing the points against a side that has done so well in the competition and then at least take a point or beat a Sturm Graz that has nothing to play for away in the last round. Midtjylland will secure top 8 with a draw tonight so no reason to be a complete idiot either. Both teams will also have their top scorers out injured (Franculino(Mid) Sævar Magnusson(Bra))

\+++

**Young Boys vs Lyon | 18:45 GMT +2**

Lyon are enjoying the view from top of the Europa League table, but had to change manager due some terrible performances in League 1 and instantly got miles better, with a current run of 8 wins in 9 games across all comps, scoring 20 and only conceding 4(!). 

Young Boys are currently 22nd with nine points, which means they need at least one more point to have a chance of making it and it probably needs to be at least two, with how poor their goal difference is. That is not going to be easy with their other game left is away in Germany against Stuttgart, who they lost 5-1 against last season. Their form is not good at all with only 2 wins from their last 8 games across all comps.

Young Boys should definitely not be underestimated as they do have a lot of European experience, albeit it did end with them finishing last in the Champions League last season having lost ALL eight games, scoring only 3 and conceding 24…

I’m mostly picking Lyon because they are looking so strong at the moment and Young Boys aren’t doing anything to inspire confidence in them. </td></tr>

Write Up: I lost two in a row so I took a bit of a break. Now I’m back because I like this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. Brann (22nd place in Europa League, 2W2D2L, 6:7, and 4th place in the 2025 Norwegian eliteserien) is hosting Midtjylland (2nd place, 5W0D1L, 13:5, 2nd place in the Danish superliga). 

Brann has no wins in last 3, no clean sheet in last 7 and BTTS in last 4/5. Midtjylland has no losses in last 3, O2.5 in last 8/10 and BTTS last 5/7. 

In this competition, Brann has lost against Lille and Fenerbahce, draw against Paok and Bologna, won Rangers and Utrecht. Midtjylland won Sturm, Forest, Tel Aviv, Celtic and Genk - only lost against Roma.

Midtjylland/draw + O1.5 is the safe bet here but I’m also placing a bet on O2.5 goals, Midtjylland win and Midtjylland/Draw + BTTS

I&#x27;m going back to the logic that certain players like to play certain team&#x27;s play style. McDavid thrives against Pittsburgh. In his only game this season vs them he got 6 shots. In his last 6 games against the Penguins he went over that line 5 times. The only time he didn&#x27;t was because Draisatl had 7 shots and McDavid was feeding him. McDavid still had 3 shots in that game btw. With Draisatl still not expected to play, I expect plenty of chances for McDavid against an aging Pittsburgh team that played the day before. McDavid also went over the 3.5 line in his last **13 home games!!!**

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: Under 6.5 Goals (-115) 2.3u To Profit 2u

Write-Up: Another win, that one was a bit sweaty, although it was 4-1 nearing the end so I wasn’t worried about an empty netter ruining it. <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> we have the Stars playing in Columbus. In net for the Blue Jackets is Jet Greaves, he has been a good goalie for them this season which is no surprise if you look at him the last 2 seasons. This season, Jet Greaves has a .908 save percentage and a 2.70 goals against average. That 2.70 goals against average is very impressive given the fact that the blue jackets allow the 2nd most shots against in the league. For the Stars, we have Jake Oettinger in net, he has been amazing every season so far in his first 5 years. This season, he holds a save percentage of .902 which is a bit low to his standards but the stars are good defensively which helps him have just a 2.67 goals against average. The stars on offense are pretty good, ranking 5th in goals, but they are missing a top scorer in Mikko Rantanen, and without him it will be tough to get pucks by Jet Greaves. The Blue Jackets are very bad offensively this season, they rank 25th in goals and are almost dead last in shots on goal, ranking 31st. With their inability to get many shots on net, I’m not scared of them getting many chances to score on Oettinger.

Handball | EHF Euro | 20:30 CET | France vs. Denmark
<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: France +2,5 @ 1.80 / -125 (2 units)

Write Up: 
Two teams widely regarded as the best in the world are meeting in the group stage of the Euros. France enters this matchup in solid form, while Denmark is coming off a very surprising loss to huge underdogs Portugal just two days ago. 

Defensively, Denmark has not looked up to par against much worse opponents. 

While Denmark has been the most dominant national team of the past decade at the World Championships and Olympics, the Euros have been a different story. They have failed to cover the spread in their last six EHF Euro games.

This should be a tightly contested game between two evenly matched sides. Even accounting for Denmark’s home-court advantage, a spread of +2.5 goals with France is too good to pass up.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Luka Doncic Over 29.5 Points $1.70 Odds currently**

Alright I&#x27;m gonna be honest I like this because the tab allows one point below so it&#x27;s actually 29 points, but I think the current line at 30.5 is also ok as 31.5 is usually what I would have him at.

Alright the reason why im going with Luka Doncic is because he dropped 12 against them when he last played them, he played 20 minutes and had 12 points, along with not playing in the second half. A lot of players were injured with it mainly being Rui and Ayton. But I liked the fact that in the first half his shooting volume was crazy, being 10 FG attempts in the first quarter and not counting some FT attempts as well. Furthermore he was not heavily double teamed or anything just straight stinker from him which happens. 

The last match before that he played them, he had 43 points but that was at home. I also think this team had a pretty horrid schedule as well, playing 3 games on the road against the Raptors who are top 5 in defence and played in OT, then you play the Wizards who are top 8 in pace and then you play the bulls who are also top 5 in pace. Now they finally end their three game road trip playing their first home game so im assuming these guys are knackered, but the 1 days of rest could help a lot but keep in mind this team is old as hell. 

A team who played the Clippers with these same variables was the Hornets. The Clippers played 3 games on the road and returned for their first home game, where Lamelo had 25 points, being their leading scorer with Kon being second highest scorer at 18. Luka Doncic has also never had more than 1 or 2 bad games as after every game scoring below 25 he tends to drop 30. I believe he does play winning basketball but he has one condition in doing so. He must be a part of the offence or rather a touch whether it be an assist or a point. Rightfully so as well as he is useless on defence so being bad on offence is a useless body on the court.

Currently his free throw record has been bad and Intuit Dome&#x27;s “Wall” doesn&#x27;t help either, meaning this will be a very close points spread for his points. However dont let this fool you he is arguably one of the best scorers currently. 

Analysis is that as a Laker he has gone 31, 29, 43, 12 1. As a Maverick he has also dropped a fair few 35-50 point bombs but also a couple 22 point games. But for this month of Jan he has hit 30 points with ease, but for the few games he hasn&#x27;t hit against it was either a top 8 defensive team or double teams as well.

Honestly I just like this because the odds seems so wrong to me personally.</td></tr>

**Last Pick Summary**: That was (almost) EXACTLY the type of match we were looking for. Qarabag AND Frankfurt delivered 1 goal each in the first 10 minutes of the match, clearing the BTTS leg of the bet and leaving us 1 goal from the promiseland. No sweat on this one? Think again.

After 2 goals in 10 minutes, we went 70 minutes without seeing the back of the net and as 80’ came and went, we were about to question our life decisions. But, <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, was not that day. A penalty got us over the bump, and we saw 3 total goals in the last 10’ + stoppage time. Qarabag snuck out a last minute victory and in typical Frankfurt fashion, they went from 2-1 to 2-3 in a matter of moments. 

Congrats to all who tailed on this one, felt good after an unfortunate early red card in the Monday <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s Write Up:** Well, we ended this Champions League matchday on a positive note with a nice win. January 22nd brings us a fresh batch of Europa league fixtures. <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> I am rockin with Dinamo Zagreb to get the W at home against FCSB. Taking a look at these two teams Europa League profiles, they may seem similar on the surface. Dinamo Zagreb is 2-1-3 and FCSB is 2-0-4. DZ sits one point (7) ahead of FCSB (6) in the table. DZ have scored 8 times and conceded 13 times, while FCSB has scored 7 times and conceded 11.

The key is the difference in competition.

Dinamo Zagreb has lost their last 3 matches, but it has come against 2 Spanish La Liga squads (Betis, Celta Vigo) and one French Ligue 1 squad (Lille). Spanish and French sides are generally going to have their way with a Croatian side. The games before this, DZ drew with Malmo in Sweden and beat Maccabi Tel-Aviv and Fenerbache. 

FCSB is coming off a good Europa League win, but it was at home. They are a different team on the road and have had an abysmal campaign so far, where they are currently ranked 11th in Romania (yes, Romania)! Dinamo Zagreb has a fixture against a bottom of the table squad on Sunday, so I have to believe that DZ at home can handle this FCSB squad fairly easily with low pressure this weekend!

Spizziri has always had consistency and the ability to grind out points, but his power has slightly improved. Wu is also a young player with potential but has not shown the ability to win consistently in majors. 

I think Spizirri is more seasoned and the confidence from beating Fonseca in R1 should be relevant. Spizirri will grind out baseline rallies and force Wu to make errors. I also expect Spizziri to win a set easily and even if this goes 5 should cover this spread.</td></tr>

As for Al-Hilal, they are first in the Saudi Pro League, wining 5 of their last 5 &amp; playing a team in tenth place that has lost 7 games out of 16. I don&#x27;t like the spread for this game as Al-Feiha are one of the better bottom half teams in the SAP, especially as of recent.

Short writeup <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, but a very similar play to yesterday. Tielemans has battled a few injuries this season so not a huge sample size, but he has been playing great football lately. He tends to play further forward than Caicedo, but Fenerbahce has a better defense than Pafos. This has hit in his last 2 Europa League games and I expect Villa to lean on his experience here.

**Start Time:** 20:00 KST, \~9/10 hours from posting

**Writeup:** A bit of a lopsided day of LCK with very clear favourites going in, but lets go!

BNK FearX have surprised thus far, going 2-0 in Week 1 having upset Nongshim Redforce in 2 games for their first match of the season and dispatching HANJIN BRION in a tough 3 game series. They are excellent when ahead, but the real shining star has been their tenacity to extend losing positions and compete in the lategame, resulting in long games that end in a comeback win.

The gameplan is clear, funnel all the resources and play towards Bot. Mid+Jungle proximity in the first 15 minutes lie heavily towards botside and dragon pit, allowing their up and coming star player Diable to scale into the later stages with relative safety and maybe even a lead. If it doesn&#x27;t pan out in the early game, FearX&#x27;s midgame skirmishes have been strong, showing great engages during neutral objective scuffles.

Gen.G to no ones surprise has hit the ground running from the start. 2-0 in matches, 4-0 in games, a clean sweep for THE domestic powerhouse of Korea. They play the prototypical Korean style, start slow, build up advantages through superior individual play, and break the game open with neutral objective teamfights.

On paper, this match is a wash, most likely a clean 2-0 for Gen.G, BUT Gen.G in their first two series had a map 1 duration of 29:43 against DRX, and 31:12 against KT Rolster, with an average just a few seconds under 30:30. Compare this to their map 2 duration, and its night and day. Map 2 against DRX in 24:29, and map 2 against KT 28:02, cutting down the game timer significantly. FearX is better than both in current form so they&#x27;ll keep it more competitive.

Gen.G takes the first game slow and methodical, feeling their opponents out and figuring the best approach to win. FearX has shown incredible form so far, the momentum of their great Week 1 results will keep their spirits high heading in. Their ability to stay and prolong games will shine and give them the edge to extend the game timer. As an added bonus, they will have <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> priority during game 1, so FearX will have the draft advantage and play their strong champions from the get go. BOL!

If there is one thing you can count on, it is consistency from Sinner, especially on hard courts. He is going to come out, put pressure on his opponent in every one of their service game, and limit his unforced errors, After he settled in against Gaston, he was right at home ripping on the forehand and backhand. I don&#x27;t expect that Duckworth can put enough pressure on Sinner. Another reason he is so successful at this bet is that it just destroys opponent&#x27;s mentality when they throw everything they have at home and work so hard just to win a couple games. If Sinner can take the first set in the usual 6 games, then I see this one taking care of itself.

<tr><td class='post'>**POTD Record:** 10-32-5 *The Barcelona curse might lowkey be back in full swing as they once again cooked up one of the weirdest games in a while. Goals flying in from all angles, Lewandowski scoring an own goal and then remembering he&#x27;s supposed to shoot on the other goal, and grabbing one on the other end too. Just crazy stuff, but of course Barca just about covered the handicap, dealing me another loss. A dreadful list of games <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> if I&#x27;m being honest so I&#x27;ll keep it simple*

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Al Feiha +1.5, +2.0 Asian Handicap, +115, 1 unit

**Write Up:** Al Hilal are comfortably in first place of the Saudi league, **but it&#x27;s not like they&#x27;ve been blowing out teams recently.** Al Feiha might be struggling for form, but they also **concede at a rate of less than two goals per game,** so I think this spread in Al Feiha&#x27;s favor is more than fine. Also, Darwizzy **Nunez&#x27;s form is patchy** and he&#x27;s been dealing with injuries, so I don&#x27;t expect the Al Hilal attack to be as relentless <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. BTTS Yes is certainly another option if you want to gamble with that. BOL and let the 10 game winless streak commence ☘️🫡</td></tr>

Tennis | Oeiras Challenger | 8:00 AM EST (estimated)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: Francesco Passaro vs Stefan Kozlov | **Passaro ML at -148 (DK). 1 unit.**

Write-up: Really tough loss. Watanuki led by 6-4, 2-0 before falling apart and ultimately losing the entire match. That brings me to 3 losses in a row for the first time in quite a while, but I’m still in the green on the year and up over 20 units since September, so I don’t feel terrible about my current process. Nevertheless, if you have any criticism, feel free to share it (preferably before the match, though — maybe others could benefit from your knowledge of why the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> is terrible). I am happy to discuss tennis with anyone, and I know that my reasoning is far from perfect or even complete. 

Francesco Passaro is a young Italian prospect best known for his clay-court game, but he also has a sneakily strong hard court resume, including a strong performance at last year’s US Open, where he qualified before taking world No. 26 Cobolli to five sets. Passaro gained entry to Australian Open qualifying earlier this month and performed pretty well, taking out a dangerous HC player in Lajal before falling to Boyer in 3 sets. He also had a strong indoor season last year, making a Challenger SF and qualifying for Metz, so he should be prepared for the conditions here. While his performance rating in an easy first-round win over Hemery was nothing exceptional (6.8), it still exceeded Kozlov’s average mark through three matches (6.67). 

Kozlov was once one of the top American juniors, making two Grand Slam finals and earning a main-draw US Open wildcard in 2017, but his pro career has been up-and-down, and he currently resides in the middle of the Challenger level. His results this year haven’t been as good as Passaro’s, and the market’s recent pricing of him has me think he should be a bigger underdog here. He was nearly even money against Kukushkin in qualifying; however, Kuku was later a +175 dog against Lajal, who was himself a very narrow favorite over Passaro at the AO. Of course, this isn’t quite apples-to-apples, but Passaro was also a similar favorite to this against Boyer at the AO, yet I feel that Boyer is playing at a higher level than Kozlov right now. Overall, I think Passaro should be at least -160 here, and I expect his serve and forehand to be the biggest weapons on the court.</td></tr>

I dont like anything for Europa League, so we moving to Mexican womens football <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Monterrey is 9-0-1 against Cruz Azul in the H2H. At home Monterrey have won everytime, no draws. Previous time Cruz Azul won, but it was at their home. This is a revenge game for Monterrey, seeing how they have dominated the H2H by alot.

In the standings Monterrey are currently 3-0-0 with a 10:0 goal diff. At home they have absolutely crushed opponents this season with a 4-0 and 5-0 respectively. Cruz Azul played once on the road this season and that was a draw.

‎Match : Daegu Kogas @ Samsung Seoul Thunder

‎<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Samsung Seoul Thunder Under 80.5 @1.85 Odds ( 1xBet ) 5unit MAX UNIT ! to win 4.25u

‎Write Up:

‎First off, Thunders offense has been straight cheeks this season they&#x27;re averaging like 76-79 points per game overall (some spots say around 79.3 league-wide, but home games dip lower, often in the low 70s). In their last stretch of games, they&#x27;ve been scoring 74, 70, 76, 62, 92 (that one outlier win), but mostly hanging around 70-77 against decent teams. They&#x27;re not exploding for big numbers, especially when their shots aren&#x27;t falling.

‎Thunders Total Points Under 80.5 at odds @1.85: Hits in 64% of sims vs implied 54%. EV ~+0.18. Thunders averaging 77 recently, struggling offensively at home vs KOGAS (under in 6 straight H2H home games).

‎Now zoom in on vs KOGAS specifically that&#x27;s the killer trend. Thunders have been capped hard in these matchups: they&#x27;ve scored under 80.5 in like 12 of the last 13 games against KOGAS, and specifically in their last 6 home games vs them, they&#x27;ve stayed under. Recent H2H scores? Stuff like 76 in December loss, 80 in another (but often lower), and KOGAS defense clamps down on them holding them to averages way below their season norm.

‎Previews and sims are all over this too, under 80.5 for Thunders is hitting 60-65%+ in models, with odds around 1.8-1.85 giving solid value. It&#x27;s not flashy, but it&#x27;s consistent as hell. Fade their team total over, ride the under should print if KOGAS controls the pace like usual.

‎I also sprinkle some on KOGAS ML @2.1  .

Thursday’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> - Shapovalov -1.5 game spread -112

FYI, this match is Thursday in Australia, but it’s Wednesday night in the U.S., so you’ll have to get in quick.

We have a matchup of big hitters here. I’m going to lean on the side of Shapovalov. He plays his best tennis on the hard court slams. He has a very high ceiling and if he is playing well, he will be too much for Cilic. If he isn’t playing well, then Cilic can certainly win this. Shapo had a good first round showing and I expect that to continue into rd 2.

Cilic of course has had a great tennis career, winning a slam all the way back in 2014 and was a finalist here in 2018. However, it’s been a while since he’s been able to go deep in a major (he did make 4th round in Wimbledon last year). This is the first time he’s been past the first round in a hard court major since 2022. He had a ton of respect and experience and could certainly pull this off, but I think he’s getting a little too much from the books.

Good Luck!</td></tr>

Teams: HLE vs. BRO (3:00 AM EST.), GenG vs. FearX (5:00 AM EST.)

* If anyone needs help finding the plays or a place to bet esports feel free to reach out! Happy to help

Writeup:

**Casting U 3.5 Kills Map 1**

* This is definitely the &quot;safer&quot; of the two legs in my opinion but I love both a ton. To understand why I think their is so much value, we must look at the state of top lane as a role at the moment, top lane in league was already the lowest kill participation role, and often the lowest kills besides supports in the game. This has been exemplified by the recent meta changes of incentivizing split pushing, the summoner spell changes to teleport, and the heavy kill meta in the jungle especially early on in series. This has lowered top liners kills by a significant amount and brought it even lower. Looking at the major regions, in LPL, their is currently only 1/13 top liners averaging more then 3 kills per map, In the LCK their are only 2/10 top liners averaging more then 3 kills and one is mainly because Faker is a very low kill share mid lane.
* Casting has played 5 maps in the LCK so far, he has averaged 1.4 kills per map in the 5 games so far, he has a 0/5 hitrate on this line this split so far with his top kill game being 2 kills so far this split. He has the lowest KP% in the entire LCK at the moment as well
* BRO are massive underdogs in this series, HLE were considered a super team and they started 0-2 and are itching to make it right, this is likely to be a stomp and it is one of those games you kind of feel bad for BRO for being the unlucky ones that draw against HLE on the schedule.
* While 5 games this split isn&#x27;t a ton of data, we also have Kespa Cup and 2025 pro data we can utilize. In Casting&#x27;s LCK games so far, he has a 1/19 cover rate in map losses on O 3.5 kills which was a hook to the over. He has averaged 1.21 kills per map loss in the LCK so far. Even in his map wins, this isn&#x27;t a guaranteed cover as he has hit in 5/8 wins so far in LCK. As said HLE are -1000 favorites, Zeus is one of the best top laners in the world, nightmare matchup imo for BRO.

**Clear U 3.5 Kills Map 1**

* Everything written about the top meta and top lane also applies to Clear as he also is a top laner. He also enters this game with a nightmare matchup going up against GenG and Kiin, GenG have run LCK for 2+ years now, barely dropping series, they are 4-0 so far and despite FearX impressive start, GenG have dominated them only dropping 1 map to FearX in the last 2 years
* Clear and fear have performed much better with an 80% map win rate in 5 maps, but despite the wins, he is only averaging 1.8 kills per map, amongst the lowest in the league. He has a 1/4 over rate in map wins so far this split and a 4/5 under rate overall. Clear is slightly scarier in my opinion as he does have more pop off games, in his last 50 map losses in the LCK, he has a \~15% cover rate and also hits this line in a higher % of wins then Casting does
* However with that being said, the thing I am most focused on is the h2h matchup. A lot of Clear&#x27;s stats last split were inflated because of the LCK format, they only played bottom tier teams + Damwon, allowing them to pad stats and only play against weaker top laners making Clear look better.
* H2h against Kiin, this has been a nightmare matchup for Clear, Kiin is 15-1 lifetime against Clear in the head to head, Clear has gone U in 14/16 of those h2h matches. Lifetime Clear is averaging 1.56 kills when he faces against Kiin, the last time he covered the Over was February 4th 2024. In his last 13 map losses against Kiin, he has only totaled 12 kills overall meaning he has averaged 0.92 kills against GenG/Kiin in map losses. IF this isn&#x27;t enough, GenG are similarly -1250 favorites, both matches should be one sided blowouts, both guys easily clear their unders here in my opinion</td></tr>

Vikrotia lie mid- Europa table with Porto in an edgy 8th spot that can be both a positive or a negative. Both sides will intend on stamping their tempo early on but expecting a clash that leads to end to end opportunities that print our corners. Expect one side to lead heavily on first half corners - play just doesn&#x27;t matter who (Similar to our Barca <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> but Slavia came through with 4 first half corners to Barca’s 2).

Playable up to 4 just wary of ending right on 4.

Another correct <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>. From 1-8 to 8-9 already. The units are in the positives, time for the record to follow.

1-1 after 10 minutes but it made me sweat a little bit to see the third goal go in only in the 78th minute. It ended 3-2 so the scoreline says no sweat but the doubts were close to hitting halfway through the second half.

Also I am working on a spreadsheet to easily check past and upcoming <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> bets for a quick overview and to be even more transparent.

**Write Up:**

A lot of matches <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> but I am sticking with what works. Both teams have something to play for.

Ferencvaros are 2-1-0 at home in the Europa League in which they scored 6 and conceded 3. 9 goals in 3 matches, a good sign.

In the Hungarian league they are sitting in second place but their home record is only 9th out of a 12 team league with a 3-2-4 record. Scoring 17 and conceding 12. Another good sign.

Panathinaikos are 2-0-1 away in the Europa League, scoring 6 and conceding 4. 10 goals in 3 matches. The signs keep on being positive for this play.

In the Greece league they have a 2-2-4 record with 10 goals scored and conceding 14. Combined with the Ferancvaros record I like this play.

Both teams will want to secure their positions in the table. Ferencvaros will have to face Nottingham Forest and Panathinaikos will face AS Roma in the last match of the group stage.

Getting a decent result <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> will be key for both teams.

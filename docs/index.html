**Last Pick:** Rose ML ✅️ || 1u at -156 || Vinyl at Rose 7:30pm ET on 01/09/26 || 3v3 Unrivaled Basketball

That was a wild finish with Chelsea Gray hitting 2 clutch three pointers to win it. This was a close call with Vinyl leading most the game. Also, I do apologize for incorrect average odds on last few posts. I had a few cells with zero value that were feeding into the average but should be correct now.   

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Phantom +3.5 points vs Mist || 1u at -115 on Bet MGM || Mist at Phantom 7:30pm ET || 3v3 Unrivaled Basketball

Mist (2-0) had an easy start to the season against a struggling Hive (0-2) and managed to pull out a win on Saturday against Laces (1-1) despite going into the 4th quarter trailing 64-71. Phantom (1-1) started the season with a tough loss to Breeze (2-1) but stomped a struggling Lunar Owls (0-2) on Saturday winning 94-60. 

Phantom are a stronger team when it comes to generating offense. They&#x27;ve gone 62-118 (52.5%) from the floor and have 38 assists to 16 turnovers. Mist on the other hand are 58-129 (45%) shooting and have 24 assists to 18 turnovers. I&#x27;m hesitant to back Phantom ML because Mist do have a few advantages. Mist have 66 total rebounds (15 OR and 51 DR) compared to Phantom&#x27;s 57 total rebounds (9 OR and 48 DR). It&#x27;s worth noting that Mist have played about 5 more minutes than Phantom. I think Mist&#x27;s biggest advantage is Phantom foul a lot with 33 total PF and lead Unrivaled with 16.5 PF per game. Mist are 16-23 at the line (which isn&#x27;t great) but is good enough and important in Unrivaled as only 1 FT attempt is awarded per foul. Mist have 28 total PF but Phantom are only 7-12 at the line this year.

Phantom ML is plus money if you&#x27;re looking for upside. But I feel better about the Phantom +3.5 spread in a game that should be competitive. BOL</td></tr>

**Match**: Liverpool vs. Barnsley

**League**: 2025-26 English FA Cup, Third Round (Men’s Soccer)

**Last Pick Summary**: Wow. El Clásico always delivers. That was a pretty incredible match, and we were happy to fall on the correct side of that one. Barcelona looked like the dominant side for the first 44 minutes jumping up 1-0 and controlling the match. After a 3 goal flurry, we went into half 2-2. The second half was a real toss up, but Barcelona stayed true to themselves, and delivered a 3-2 final score after a 73’ goal from Raphina. An even money win is always a great way to end the week.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s Write Up:** After two days of Spanish futbol, we are moving over to the UK. Liverpool are hosting lowly Barnsley at Anfield. It’s true… Liverpool has been the definition of inconsistent. And yes, Liverpool was bounced from the FA Cup by the infamous Plymouth Argyle last year. Their 1-0 defeat came from a 53’ Penalty after a handball. Slot rested essential personnel and they were embarrassed by PAFC. Now, 11 months later, Liverpool will face a Barnsley squad that sits 1 spot below Plymouth Argyle in the English League One Table. You read that correctly. Liverpool is facing a team that is 17th in the ENGLISH LEAGUE ONE TABLE.

Not only is Liverpool playing for FA Cup redemption at Anfield, but they also watched this weekend as Arsenal (4-1), Man City (10-1), Aston Villa (2-1), and Brentford (2-0) all advanced in the FA Cup. These were all against teams that are ahead of Barnsley in English standings. The closest comparison should be the 10-1 Man City win, as they trounced Exeter City 10-1. Exeter City sits 3 spots ahead of Barnsley in the English League 1 Table.

Finally, Liverpool has until Saturday for their next match which is at home vs bottom dweller Burnley. They won’t play again until a mid week Champions League match against Marseille on Jan 21.

This is not a spot where Slot wants to mess around and let a League 1 squad keep it close. Liverpool wants to prove to their fans (and themselves) that they belong at the top of the Premier League table and a nice Monday bloodbath will do just that.

Thinking we see 4+ goals for Liverpool and 1 or less for Barnsley.</td></tr>

**🏀 VJ Edgecombe o1.5 Steals -106** vs the Toronto Raptors

Edgecombe has been a demon on steals lately. He&#x27;s cashed in L7/7 games, getting 2+ steals including a 5 steal game against the Wizards.

He&#x27;s also L3/3 cashed against the Raptors. This includes 2 against them in their game yesterday.

These teams played against each other yesterday in an overtime game with all players getting heavy minutes. Expecting increased sloppiness and turnovers in this game as a result.

To compound on this, Raptors have poor ball security here. They rank 19th overall in allowed steals and 21st in steals allowed to SGs.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: (NBA) Charlotte Hornets +8.5 vs Los Angeles Clippers (-180) (10:40 PM EST)**

Reasoning: Charlotte is coming off a dominant 150-95, 55 point win vs the Utah Jazz last game. Charlotte are 13-4 covering the spread since December 5th and are 2nd in offensive efficiency in the league over the past two weeks. They are playing good competitive basketball and are healthy, yet the books continue to undervalue them in my opinion. They have the ability to play competitive basketball with any team right now. Kawhi is listed as questionable for the Clippers so if he doesn’t play only increases my confidence. Yes the Hornets are on the road however they have won 4 of the last 5 road games. Line movement has favored Charlotte as well. Regardless if Kawhi plays or not, I expect the ￼​Hornets to keep this game competitive and I’m taking them to cover with a 8.5 point cushion tonight on the road.

Write-Up:
Al Nassr have had a few underwhelming performances recently, but overall they remain one of the strongest attacking sides in the league. Historically, Al Nassr tend to step up in big matchups, and this fixture sets up well for them to at least avoid defeat.

Both teams have been consistent in finding the back of the net, and BTTS has been a common outcome in meetings between these two sides. While Al Hilal are currently on an unbeaten run, that streak should serve as added motivation for Al Nassr to deliver a strong performance. Keeping the analysis simple for my first post, this spot offers solid value on Al Nassr to win or draw with goals from both teams. BOL!</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Joel Embiid o24.5 points (-105) BetMGM profit boost (+119), 2u

**Write Up:** This is the second game of a back-to-back in Toronto. Last night&#x27;s game went to overtime, with the Raptors winning 116-115. Both Sixers&#x27; Edgecombe and Maxey played 44 minutes, while Raptors&#x27; Barnes and Murray-Boyles (C) logged 40. Embiid will be well-rested after sitting out last night&#x27;s game and is back for the second game. He&#x27;s off his minute restriction and is averaging over 30 minutes a night now. Toronto typically defends the center position well, but that won&#x27;t matter against a player like Embiid.

In their first matchup this season, Embiid had 29 points while playing only 26 minutes. He&#x27;s hit this point total in 9 straight games against the Raptors, with his last sub-25 point game coming back in 2022. This season, he has covered this line in 6 of his 8 games with 30+ minutes played, which have all been in the last few weeks. The Sixers should lean on their big man tonight to secure the second game of the series.

**Last Pick:** Northeastern +2 vs. Towson for 2 units❌ &gt; I hate when games like this have to hit my POTD record.  Northeastern looked incredible in the first 2 minutes, it was clear they had a game plan... and then their Dutch star Youri Fritz goes down and never comes back.  This guy is genuinely the most important piece on this team and its not even close, best scorer, rebounder and stealer; because of this they go on to get absolutely destroyed on the boards and in the paint, which ends up being the difference.  Without a doubt if Youri isn&#x27;t hurt this is a sweat free cover.  Anyway, shit happens.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>:**  Navy ML for 1 unit -110 vs. American &gt; Nothing interesting for college basketball <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> but this is probably one of the more interesting games.  Objectively both these teams are mid like most of the teams in the Patriot league, but I think this game comes down to free throws.  Navy is ranked 80th in FT attempts against a team in American who defensively fouls the 351th highest.  Meanwhile on the other side, American is an elite FT shooting team, but Navy doesn&#x27;t give up many opportunities.  If Navy can take care of the ball, I think this should be a low scoring game where Navy ends up winning just based on free points at the line.   Navy is now on an 8 (4 in conference) win streak with American on a 2 loss streak, with their last game coming as a loss at home against a team Navy beat by 7 on the road.  I just think we&#x27;re getting the better team here with a lot of returning players.  On top of that, America is probably about to go to war, so I&#x27;m sure these guys are in shape and getting mentally locked in lol.

Model details: AdjEM model trained on current season data, utilizes a scaling isotonic calibration system to improve model predictiveness without overfitting. The model existed as a Monte Carlo model but since adjusted it for simplicity and automation purposes as I have a lot less free time nowadays. Model uses layer 2 adjustments after prediction output to further adjust for trends (such as look ahead, rest advantages, let down spots, travel, bounce back etc). Model uses a baseline team/coach ranking before applying current season data.

ROI for potds so far is \~31%, overall model performance this season is 10.2%.

Reasoning: Celta average 1.33 goals per game with stronger underlying numbers (xG 22.8) against a Sevilla side conceding heavily (xGA 28.5). The form data reinforces the edge: Celta are 4th for away form, 5th over the last 10 games and 4th over the last 5, while Sevilla sit 18th (third-worst), are poor at home, 18th over the last 10 and 15th over the last 5, consistently leaking goals. Taken together, Celta scoring once and avoiding defeat is the high-probability outcome rather than a reach.

Event: NFL: Texans @ Steelers 8:15pm EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Woody Marks o56.5 rushing yards (-115)

Write Up: With the Texans going into a favorable matchup against a Steelers team who scraped their way into this game. I like Woody Marks to demand a heavy load in the Texan’s run game. He has hit this line in 4/6 games, with the last game against Indiana being questionable with starters being pulled. Jawhar Jordan is also OUT for the game, who had previously been the RB2 for this team, giving him more of an edge to get increased carries with his only threat to his carry share being Nick Chubb who has only been a shell of himself for the later 1/3 of the season. 

Pittsburgh has allowed 113 rushing yards per game this season. This ranks them right around 12-13th this season. Although they had some strong showing in the past 3/4 weeks, I think the Texan’s defense allows them to hold a 1 score lead for majority of the game. To pair with this, Demeco Ryan will look to avoid any costly errors from a young Quarterback, and will keep the ball on the ground against a team who can quickly capitalize on turnovers.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Sam Merrill Over 11.5 @1.80 (Bet365). Placing 1u on this to win 0.8u

Write Up: Going with what has worked until Vegas fixes this line. Sam Merrill has a decently strong chance to clear 11.5 points against the Jazz because the matchup plays directly into his biggest strength: three-point shooting which the Jazz just gave up so much of in their blowout loss a few days ago. Utah has consistently struggled defending the perimeter, allowing opponents plenty of open looks from deep, and they’re one of the teams most willing to give up volume threes. That’s perfect for Merrill, who doesn’t need high usage to score—just a few clean catch-and-shoot opportunities. Historically, he’s also been comfortable scoring against Utah, and if he sees his usual rotation minutes, a couple of early threes can put him well on pace. With the Jazz’s shaky perimeter defense and Merrill’s efficiency from beyond the arc, getting to 12+ points is a very realistic outcome in tomorrow’s game.

Surprised it&#x27;s only over 3.5 when Nathan MacKinnon&#x27;s line is over 4.5 shots. Connor McDavid is everywhere on the ice right now and has easily hit that line 9 times in his last 10 (he had minimum 5 shots each time and even went to 10 shots in one of those games). He is shooting 6 shots on average per game in his last 10 and I feel confident he&#x27;s gonna hit it again tonight with the Blackhawks being 4th in the league in shots allowed per game. Oilers played against the Blackhawks only once this season and McDavid got 5 shots with Bedard in the lineup.

Sam Hauser is a shooter that is dependent on other players getting him shots. With Jaylen Brown being listed as doubtful, the Celtic&#x27;s best playmaker has a good chance of not playing, so I expect him to get lower quality shots (and probably less shot attempts in general).

**NFL - Houston @ Pittsburgh, 8:15 PM EST, ESPN/ABC**

***<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Nico Collins o68.5 Rec Yds (-114) 2u***

The last of our football run ends in Pennsylvania, as the Steelers host the Texans to conclude this years wild card weekend in the NFL - every year this is one of my favourite weekends in all of sports, and it’s only better now that the league are expanding their broadcast reach and format.

**There’s 3 reasons why I love this bet**, and when you have 3 reasons to love a bet, there’s really no other reason to dig too deep. I’ll keep it simple and briefer than normal for you guys.

(I will note: *This isn’t my first choice - I was gonna <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> the Rodgers completion line*, but when I saw our friend Joe made that choice, I decided to go with plan B, which isn’t a bad one)

First: Pittsburgh has a god awful Pass D. **They rank 29th in the NFL giving up 244 pass yards a game**, &amp; QBs took their liberties: **11 QBs had 25 or more completions, 15 had 35 or more attempts, 12 QBs completed &gt; 66% of their passes (min 20 att).** This team can’t stop the air attack.

Second: *Collins is coming off a week off*, which doesn’t seem like that big of a deal for most, but for Collins it was 100% a welcome rest - he’s a physical receiver who works hard away from the ball - to me this screams game-prep advantage. **He averages 8 targets a game (6.3 L6)** and is very clearly CJ Strouds number one guy with a **24% target share** - he has been *under this his L2*, but was **6/7 prior to that** when the games mattered most.

Third: Nico’s big play ability makes this a threat throughout the game in almost any situation. Despite *”only having 71 receptions”* on the season (still 21st in the league), **he was 8th in the league in receiving yards, 6th in YPC, 8th in YPG, &amp; 11th in EPA** - he’s efficient, but CJ is also not scared to flood him, with **double digit targets in 6 games this season**.

Houston can find many ways to win this game, but I would be baffled if they didn’t have Nico as, at the very least, their second offensive option tonight. **Nico for 70!**

Last play review:

***NFL - Omarion Hampton o11.5 Rush Att*** ☠️

*(Absolutely embarrassing, but at the end of the day I did consider what happened a possibility &amp; it unfortunately came to a very bold reality. One run, and he was done - heartbreaker, especially with a favourite like Vidal just sitting right there at 7.5 and I balked… but, I am glad to hear of at least two people who were able to get a refund on their bet)*

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** John Collins o 1.5 3PM (+113 on DK) - 3 units

Lurked here a bit and thought I&#x27;d try my hand at a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. 

Collins has found his footing in this Clippers offense and has been over this line in 5 straight and 9 of L10, including hitting 5 threes in the previous game against the Pistons. 

This is an appealing spot here at positive money against the Hornets who rank #29 in 3P% allowed to opponents, and #25 in 3PM allowed to opposing power forwards. 

Granted Charlotte has put together a few nice defensive games lately so the books might be reacting to that, but this is likely skewed since their last three opponents (Raptors, hospital Pacers, and double hospital Jazz) have all been bottom ten 3P% teams with injuries to key scorers. 

Collins also shoots a much higher 3P% in home games (44.9%) vs. away (38.2%) this season.

As an added bonus, Kawhi is GTD and may not play which would give more scoring opportunities to Collins.</td></tr>

* Maldonado opened the season with a 16 point,5 assist showing in Cairns. This is the same stadium against essentially the same lineup, except he was part of the SEM Phoenix then and wasn&#x27;t as primary a focus as he will be now.
* With Alex Higgins-Titsha out, Cairns don&#x27;t really have a &quot;shut down&quot; defensive guy. Galloway is the closest but expect him on Terry Taylor. Andrew Andrews and the Cairns backcourt are all offensively minded.
* Maldonado is a guy that is capable of lighting it up for 20+ points. He&#x27;s yet to do it in the NBL but did in the Euroleague, which I&#x27;d say is a much tougher defensive league.
* Norton was injured last game so we should see the ball in Maldonado&#x27;s hands more as the PG. Being surrounded by spot up shooters (Ducas, Devers in particular) and a PnR machine Jacob Holt, the assist opportunities should be huge tonight.
* Between the points and the assists, I dont know which one will be the one that pops tonight but there&#x27;s too much upside across both to not play this PA line

Todays <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: **Sevilla v Celta Vigo: Celta DNB @1.88**

I guess I cant quit.  Last win was almost a BTTS no shitty goal they let in and they scored 5.

Anyways on we move. Sevilla are coming into this on shaky ground right now. They’ve dropped a few in a row, failed to score in their last three matches and look a bit out of form in front of goal. They’re inconsistent and can get punished at home when they’re not firing on all cylinders.

Celta Vigo, on the other hand, have been solid on the road and in decent shape overall. They picked up a good win against Valencia recently and have been tougher to beat than Sevilla in recent matches. Their away record this season is one of the better ones in the league and they’ve been competitive in most games they play.

The odds for the match show it as fairly balanced, but there’s value in backing Celta not to lose. With Sevilla struggling for goals and Celta looking more consistent, the draw no bet cushion on Celta makes sense — you either get the win from them or a refund if it ends level.

Why Celta DNB ?

-- Celta are in better recent form than Sevilla

-- Sevilla’s attack has dried up lately

-- Celta have a respectable away record this season

Best of luck.</td></tr>

**Write Up:** Alrightyyy <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today’s pick</mark> DAMONS ON A BENDER is second up here off what could possibly be one of the worst rides I’ve ever seen in its debut. On that occasion, the horse jumped well from the inside barrier but was literally choked and restrained all the way to second last, game over from there. <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> we again draw barrier one but swap that inept jockey for A Bullock, the king of country NSW, and provided we jump well (missed the start in its first trial but has been good in next 2 subsequent trials/races) I cannot imagine a world that we aren’t in the top 4 in the run.    
    
The way we finished off last start indicates ability and the market support suggested the horse was going to get to a decent level, so I’m hoping the position in run will yield a different result.    
    
In terms of opposition there isn’t too much on exposed form. The second favourite will likely come across and lead from the outside barrier, but that’s easier said than done and automatically assuming it gets across without burning much petrol is wishful thinking. The 12 poses some intrigue, but I haven’t seen much gate speed from it in any of its starts, and don’t think Taree is a track you won’t to get too far back on, plus I think it’s looking for a lot further.    
    
This is definitely my least confident <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, due to the class of horse being low, and thus reliability isn’t the greatest, however I’m still confident enough to post it as a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard vs Roberto Bautista Agut | **Bautista Agut +2.5 games at -118 (FD). 1 unit.**

Write-up: Nice win for Hurkacz, who missed some opportunities on return but played quite well in both tiebreaks. 

Interesting match between the big serving Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard and veteran Spaniard Roberto Bautista Agut in Auckland. Mpetshi Perricard won two matches last week in Brisbane, but actually didn&#x27;t cover this handicap in either of them, as he broke serve just two times all week. The huge gulf between Perricard&#x27;s serve and the rest of this game means that many of the sets he plays go to tiebreaks, and many of his matches turn into a &quot;coin flip&quot; of sorts dependent on a few key points. On the other side of the net, Bautista Agut isn&#x27;t any kind of power server, but he makes his first serves at a respectable 66.5% clip, which decreases the amount of variance in his service game. This isn&#x27;t good for Perricard, who relies on aggressive returning and stringing together a few low-margin shots to even have a chance to break. Another point to mention is that this is one of the windiest events on tour, with winds up to 13 mph expected tomorrow, and I could see this throwing off Perricard&#x27;s best weapon enough to get RBA into some rallies. Auckland is also the fourth-slowest hard-court event on tour (according to Tennis Abstract, based on 2024 data), which further dampens the effectiveness of the serve. In terms of the baseline rallies, RBA&#x27;s groundstrokes are a bit old-school, as he prefers to take them early and flat, but without taking great risks in shot selection. I expect this to pose significant problems for the 2.0m-tall Perricard, who tends to struggle significantly with lower-bouncing balls. 

There is one big question mark in this matchup, which is that RBA has been out since last year&#x27;s US Open with a right leg injury, and actually withdrew from Brisbane last week. However, I feel that we&#x27;re getting a slight discount on his odds as a result. I&#x27;m banking on two things here: I don&#x27;t expect this to be a super physical matchup, and I don&#x27;t see RBA trying to play through injury at 37 years old. If he turns up on court, I expect him to be fit, and I see his efforts being enough to keep this one close on the scoreboard.</td></tr>

Event: Texans @ Steelers 


<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: CJ Stroud under 33.5 pass attempts 


Write Up: I really wanted to fade the Kings on the 2nd night of their back to back, but it&#x27;s playoff season, so I&#x27;ll stick to the NFL. 


CJ Stroud has only gone over 33 completions 4 times this year. In those 4 games, Houston had some of their worst performances, losing twice and almost losing to the lowly Colts and Raiders. Stroud is just not an elite passer, and I don&#x27;t think the game script for a playoff game is to go pass heavy with Stroud. 


Now, Pittsburgh allows an average of 36 attempts per game this year, which is probably why Stroud&#x27;s attempts total is so high. However, in the last 5games,that average has come down to 31. 


Lasly, Pittsburgh allows an almost league worst 65 plays per game. However, in the last 5, that number has fallen to 57. The offense playing better and the defense getting off the field more has helped. 


With the Steelers passing attempts allowed trending down and plays allowed trending down, and Houston performing badly when they rely on a ton of passing attempts from Stroud I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll see Stroud slinging is around all day. 


I also think Houston will be the better team and have the lead, so they&#x27;ll be running it more later in the game. </td></tr>

Write up: Here I think is the end for Rodgers and the Steelers season. Typically I don’t love road playoff games but this one feels good. The Texans don’t thrive depending on the crowd. Defense travels. Especially when we have an immobile qb against a very disruptive defensive line and a skilled secondary. The offense doesn’t need to be great in order for Houston to win. As long as Houston controls their turnovers they should control this entire game. I’m staying away from the spread in fear of a slugfest. I think this is tremendous value considering what we saw Houston do to the Chargers a few weeks back. Who I’ll add is a much better team than the steelers. Moneyline feels safe and I’m willing to back arguably the hottest team in football. I also feel like this team will be playing with a huge chip on their shoulder in an attempt to solidify themselves as a legitimate team moving forward.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Al-Hilal Vs Al-Nassr - **Over 3.5 Total Goals @ 1.87 (Melbet)**

**Write Up:** Al Hilal and Al Nassr face off in a massive Pro League clash that could have a big say in the title race. Both teams are among the league’s strongest attacking sides, but recent form clearly favours Al Hilal. Al Hilal come into the match unbeaten after 13 league games and show no signs of slowing down. They’ve won five straight matches in all competitions, doing so with control and confidence rather than relying on chaos. Comfortable home wins against Al Hazm and Al Khaleej brought six goals, while away victories over Damac and Al Kholood showed they can manage games efficiently.

Defensively, Al Hilal are one of the most dependable teams in the league. They’ve conceded only 12 goals all season and have kept clean sheets in three of their last five matches. Even when games become more open, like the 3–2 win over Al Khaleej, they tend to respond quickly and regain control. At home, Al Hilal are consistently dangerous going forward. They’ve scored at least three goals in two of their last three home games, showing how effective they are at breaking teams down once sustained pressure kicks in.

Like Al Hilal, Al Nassr are one of the league’s most dangerous attacking teams, having scored 38 goals so far this season. However, recent results suggest their defensive control is slipping. They’ve conceded seven goals in their last three league matches, including losses to Al Qadsiah and Al Ahli.

Away from home, Al Nassr have found it harder to manage games. Defeats at Al Ahli and earlier at Al Taawoun stand in contrast to their more comfortable home performances. Even the 2–2 draw against Al Ettifaq followed a familiar pattern, where they struggled to hold on after taking the lead.

Both teams have scored at least once in every league match this season, home or away. Al Hilal are 22 from 22, while Al Nassr are 23 from 23, which speaks volumes about their attacking consistency. I like the over 3.5 goals line in this match. While it’s a higher threshold, this is a huge derby between two attacking powerhouses, and the importance of the fixture often leads to open, intense games. Together, they’ve already scored 73 league goals, and recent matches on both sides have regularly gone beyond the three-goal mark.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: **Boston-Indiana U223.5 (-105 FanDuel) 1U**

Event: NBA | Celtics @ Pacers (7:30 pm EST) | 🏀

*Recap: 14 points in the first half, 12 in the second - 9-for-10 from the floor - and tack on seven assists for good measure. Everything went right for Black. The Magic even rallied in the fourth for a win over the banged up, visiting ...checks notes... New Orleans Pelicans!? Yikes, Orlando. Note to self: Take scoring point guards against New Orleans.*

**EDIT @ 10 AM: The line has moved (again) to 225.5. I&#x27;m sticking with my thesis and putting another unit down. However, I&#x27;m only counting the original bet at 223.5 in my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> records.**

Two caveats before we begin. First, I saw the Utah-Cleveland line open at 250.5 and I wanted to take the under for my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> just for the sheer audacity of it. That is the second-highest line of the season, tying Indiana-Denver on Nov. 24. That game finished over by 1.5 points. The highest over/under this season belongs to Utah-Atlanta with 252.5 on Dec. 12 - it went under by 10 points. Instead, I&#x27;ll put a personal side bet on the under because... why the hell not? I don&#x27;t think Utah gets run roughshod two games in a row, especially with Markkanen back in the lineup.

Second, I am jumping on the Boston-Indiana line early with an under play that hangs much hope on Jaylen Brown *not* playing. As of this writing, he&#x27;s listed as doubtful with lower back spasms. Goodness knows Boston (24-14) *shouldn&#x27;t* need Brown on the road against an Indiana (8-31) team that just set a franchise record for most consecutive losses. The Pacers have since broken the streak, so there&#x27;s not the same sense of professional urgency to step up and stop the losing.

Here&#x27;s why I think Brown could/should rest. He just logged a season-high 43 minutes in a loss to San Antonio on Saturday, and played 36 minutes the night before in an important win over Toronto. Even if he doesn&#x27;t sit outright, I could see his minutes getting restricted. He&#x27;s already 22nd in the league in minutes per game (34.3) and second in in usage rate (35.9 percent). The last game he missed was Dec. 20 for illness. Before that, it was Dec. 3 - again, for illness. He&#x27;s played all 10 Celtic games since Dec. 20, including the aforementioned back-to-back. Dude needs a rest, and the Celtics don&#x27;t need him to put down a hapless Pacers squad. The moment he&#x27;s confirmed out, I suspect the line will drop.

Whether or not Brown goes, Boston already plays the slowest pace in the league. *If* Brown is out, I would expect Mazzulla to lean even harder on their half-court identity and grinding style - fewer offensive possessions and no star player sucking up all the gravity bodes well for my thinking. Mazzulla might also see it as an opportunity to flex as a defensive unit. You can take the player out of West Virginia, but you can&#x27;t take the West Virginia out of the player. It&#x27;s something they&#x27;ll want to keep finetuning in the run-up to playoffs. And even *with* Brown playing, Boston just suffered a season-low 95 points in Saturday&#x27;s loss to the Spurs. Boston does rank second in offensive rating and that gives me pause, but ... ... ... *gestures hopefully at Brown sitting.* Know where else Boston ranks second? Opponents&#x27; scoring average. The Celtics are giving up just 110.4 points per game. Now, I&#x27;m pretty dumb in most regards but I can do math: 110.4 + Indiana&#x27;s 111.2 average = not over 223.5.

The under has hit in four of the last five games for Indiana, and three of the last five for Boston. Both sides have been dead under teams all year: Boston is 21-17 to the under and Indiana is 24-15. If you&#x27;ll allow me to cherry <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> some more stats: Indiana is 28th in scoring, 30th in field goal percentage, and 29th in offensive rating. Remarkably. the Pacers play at a high ...wait for it... pace, where they are ninth in the Association. To wit, Indiana point guard Andrew Nembhard has had an incredible run of recent play, including a 29 point, nine assist, six rebound outburst in a win over Miami on Sunday. But he *did* miss Indiana&#x27;s game prior to that, and is listed as a questionable with lower back soreness for Monday. If Nembhard can&#x27;t go, Indiana might not break 90. I mean it. Indiana remains without their second-leading scorer (Benedict Mathurin - out since Jan. 2), hence the uptick in Nembhard&#x27;s value. But Boston ranks third in stopping opposing point guards in both points AND assists. Even if Nembhard plays, I believe he&#x27;s going to have a tough time doing anything. *Quick aside:* two of my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> wins have been Nembhard O25.5 points and assists. If he gets that number again, or higher, I would consider sprinkling on the under - despite how good he&#x27;s been lately.

I think I know why this number is as high as it is despite the injury news. The teams played a 140-122 game in Indiana on Dec. 26. Brown had his usual 30, and Nembhard and Mathurin both played. But it took an outlier shooting night for Indiana to get there. Furthermore, four days before that, these teams played a 103-95 game in Boston. Brown got his typical 31, and Nembhard and Mathurin both played. I think Monday&#x27;s matchup will look more like the latter than the former. I especially think Boston will see it as team defense practice for going up against much, much better teams. In fact, Boston might already be looking ahead to Thursday&#x27;s game in Miami, where they will play another high-paced team (but one that can actually shoot and score).

Good luck and Godspeed!</td></tr>

The biggest matchup in Saudi football. BTTS has hit in the last 6 H2H meetings between these two. Al-Nassr are not in great form, having lost their last two games and drawn the previous one, but they still managed to score in all of those, with the last time they failed to score coming in March of 2025, even though their squad is miles ahead of almost any club in the league. Al-Hilal are in great form, having won all of their last 18 games. Still, Al-Nassr can&#x27;t be underestimated, which is why we&#x27;re playing it safe with Al-Hilal double chance + BTTS.</td></tr>

**Write Up:** Coming off a &quot;hero&quot; performance in Week 18, where he saw a season-high **7 targets** and hauled in 3 catches (including the game-winner), Austin has clearly earned the trust of Aaron Rodgers in high-leverage moments. Even with DK Metcalf returning to the lineup, Austin remains the primary deep threat and &quot;gadget&quot; receiver, often targeted on low-risk screens and quick slants designed to utilize his elite 4.30 speed. Since the Texans&#x27; defense is known for a ferocious pass rush that forces quarterbacks to get the ball out quickly, Austin serves as a natural &quot;safety valve.&quot; Requiring only two catches to clear the line—a mark he has met or exceeded in nearly half of his games this year—the high-volume environment of a playoff game script makes this one of the most attainable props on the board. This is also at plus money right now which seems crazy to me.

<tr><td class='post'>**POTD Record:** 9-27-3 *The Barcelona curse strikes again, killing my streak before we even really properly got going. Was fun while it lasted. Gotta say, that was a crazy game (three goals in added time in the first half!) and in peak sigmabale fashion, the madness ended with two huge missed opportunities by Madrid (Carreras, you&#x27;re on fraud watch). This doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;ll stop fading Barca though, we still have some unfinished business. Anyway, I think I&#x27;ll have to take that for a streak, been ages since I hit two in a row, so improvement is there, albeit a bit slow.

**Event:** Saudi Pro League, Al Hilal v Al-Nassr, 12:30 pm EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Al-Nassr DNB, +120, 1 unit

**Write Up:** Al Hilal&#x27;s form looks downright scary, but if there&#x27;s one team that can break their 18 match winning streak, it&#x27;s Al-Nassr. This matchup is huge because an Al Hilal win could see them run away with the league and Ronaldo and Co. just aren&#x27;t going to let that happen. **The last H2H also ended with a huge Al-Nassr win** and I think <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>&#x27;s just the day the Al-Nassr team properly turns up and gets the job done. Their form hasn&#x27;t been stellar, but these players are always capable of delivering and I think their attack is going to click, and we just have to hope the defence finally shows up for once. Al-Nassr have had troubles breaking down more defensive sides, even struggling against teams down to 10-men at times, but there are **no worries about Al Hilal sitting back,** as both teams are going to try and fully go for the win. In the light of that, the BTTS Yes and Over 2.5 goals look good to me too, if you want to dabble with those. Going in with just the one standard unit after being burnt by Barca. BOL, let&#x27;s enjoy another heated clash in Saudi Arabia and set ourselves up for a strong week ahead ☘️🫡

Write-Up:

Almost looked like we were cooked at halftime, but Washington gets it done with ease in the second half.

Gainwell has been red hot of late, coming off receiving games of 64 / 12 / 78 / 46. More importantly, he has been the main receiving threat in 3 of the last 4 games, either leading the team in yards, receptions, or both. Target share has also been promising, with 7+ targets in 4 of the last 5. Game script should be in our favour.

As always, Book it and see you Monday for another winner.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Liverpool -2.5 Spread (-110) 1.1 units to win 1 unit

**Write Up:** Last match of the 3rd round of the FA Cup as Liverpool host Barnsley, the 17th place side in England&#x27;s 3rd division. There are 57 teams between these two in the hierarchy of English football. All signs point towards this being a bloodbath in favor of Liverpool. 

We&#x27;re getting good odds for this because Liverpool have had trouble scoring goals in recent weeks and it is likely Liverpool do not llay their full first team. But with the week off after this match and being in front of the home crowd, I&#x27;m expecting a similar setup to City (who won 10-1 against their 3rd tier team) where they play many of their first team players to start the match, then sub them off at halftime or in the 2nd half once they have a comfortable lead. We are banking on Liverpool coming out offensively and going for goals, rather than sitting on a small lead. For reference, last year Liverpool won 4-0 in this round of the FA Cup, and I&#x27;m predicting a similar scoreline here.

__Event:__ NFL: Texans @ Steelers 8:15pm EST

__POTD:__ Aaron Rodgers o20.5 completions (-105), 4.2u to win 4u

__Write Up:__ The Wild Card Round finished up on Monday night as the hottest team in football, the Houston Texans (12-5), head to Pittsburgh to take on the Steelers (10-7). After losing their first 3 games of the season, &amp; ending up at a 3-5 record after 8 games, the Texans went on to win 9 games in a row to close the season, longest active winning streak in the NFL. Houston is just the 7th team in NFL history to make the playoffs after starting a season 0-3. Their winning streak started with a 36-29 comeback victory over the Jaguars, and it was actually Davis Mills that got Houston across the finish line there. However, things went to another level when C.J. Stroud returned in Week 13. Houston had a Dropback EPA per play of 0.142 from Week 13 on, ranking 9th in the NFL. This led to now the 3rd season in a row that Texans QB C.J. Stroud &amp; head coach DeMeco Ryans have won 10+ games. The Steelers on the other hand, barely made into the playoffs winning 4 of their last 5 games. The Pittsburgh offense is on its best stretch of the season. They have averaged 23 points in their last 5 games &amp; have scored 26+ in 4 of their last 5 games, including 26 points last week. After losing to the then 4-12 Cleveland Browns Week 17 in what should’ve been a must win game, they then went on to beat the Ravens in the last week of the regular season after the rookie Ravens kicker missed a FG, putting Pittsburgh Steelers in the playoffs for the 13th time in Mike Tomlin’s 19 seasons &amp; saving his job. In a game with 2 good defenses &amp; not extremely explosive offenses, this one has the lowest game total of the Wild Card Round. Pittsburgh averaged 10.6 plays of 10+ yards per game (27th). Houston averaged 11.2 per game (24th). Houston ranked 28th in offensive success rate (38.8%), the lowest of any team in the postseason. Pittsburgh ranked 20th (41.1%). The Steelers have scored 101 points off turnovers (3rd) while Houston has scored 90 (4th). A Steelers streak will be ending on Monday night, Pittsburgh will get their 1st playoff win since 2016, or they will have their 1st loss in Pittsburgh on Monday night in 35 years. Pittsburgh’s 6 consecutive playoff losses is the longest active streak in the NFL. The only way they’re going to have a shot at winning this one will be an high performance game by their 42 year old QB.

Steelers QB Aaron Rodgers is making his first playoff start since 2021. He ranks 4th all time in career playoff yards (5,894) &amp; 3rd all time in career playoff TD’s (45). Rodgers comes into this game throwing the football more than he has all season. Rodgers finished the year by throwing for 247.2 yards per game over the last 5 games after averaging 189.6 yards per game before that. His 3 highest yardage totals came in that span. In the Steelers last 3 games, he threw the ball 39+ times, the most he had thrown before those games was 36 back in October. __Rodgers now has 5 games in a row with 21+ completions, averaging 25 completions in his last 5.__ Last week in a must win game vs the Ravens, Rodgers threw 47 times &amp; completed 31 passes. Rodgers finished with 21+ completions in 10 of 16. The way he is able to rack up so many completions is his extremely fast time to throw. __Rodgers time to throw on average is 2.56 seconds, fastest in the NFL amongst all 36 QB’s with 250 dropbacks. 56.4% of his passes have come within 2.5 seconds of the snap, the highest rate in the league.__ All of his passes have been short quick throws. 22.9% of his attempts are behind the line of scrimmage &amp; 45% are between 0-9 yards downfield. He is averaging just 6.7 yards per pass. __On top of that the Texans defense primarily runs use Cover 3 coverage. Rodgers has a 67.7% completion percentage, completing 90 of 133 passes vs Cover 3 this season. Also, when facing QB’s that get the ball out in less than 2.56 seconds, Houston has allowed a 69.2% completion percentage for 1,777 yards, 6.2 yards per pass, 12 TD’s, &amp; 4 INT’s this season.__ When opponents have held the ball longer, Houston allowed just a 47.7% completion rate (3rd) &amp; 6.9 yards per attempt (4th). Houston has been elite at getting after the QB this season ranking 4th in the NFL in pressure rate (40.7%). Rodgers quick pass style &amp; the Steelers OL have led to the Steelers allowing the lowest pressure rate in the league at just 25% &amp; lowest now blitz pressure rate at 25.4%. On top of that the Steelers have passed on 58.81% of plays this year, 8th most. While Texans opponents have passed on 59.39% of plays, 8th most. The Texans rank 4th in the NFL in rushing yards allowed per game at just 93.7. They rank 3rd in the NFL in Rush EPA per play allowed (-0.124 The Steelers are going to look get Rodgers going in this one. Especially with star WR DK Metcalf back from injury after decking a fan. __The Texans have allowed 21+ in 3 of their last 4 games &amp; 2 of those QB’s were Riley Leonard &amp; Jacoby Brissett.__ With the Texans having one of the best secondary’s in the league, all signs point to Rodgers peppering his WR’s at close range &amp; dumping it off to RB’s.

The 42 year old QB gets us back in the green.

&gt; **Write Up:** This <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> is from my soccer model that I&#x27;ve been using for the past two years. It assigns ELO ratings to players and projects a win chance based on the combined ELO ratings of the players on each team. TeamReddit is projecting a 62% win chance here which creates value here on the ML.</td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>

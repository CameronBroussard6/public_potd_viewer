**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Italy v South Korea - Total Over 12.5 @ 1.91

**Write Up:** Italy is by far the favorite to win the Gold Medal. It&#x27;s their first game at this Olympics and will be looking to come out strong especially playing in front of the home fans. They are playing South Korea who lost yesterday to Sweden 10-3. They started off strong against Sweden going 2-1 up before falling back. A little bit of controversy happened when they called the game early because they were told it was mathematically impossible to win with 2 ends left which was not true. It&#x27;s common to admit defeat early in Curling but normally it will only happen if it&#x27;s going into the last end or it&#x27;s mathematically impossible to win.   
  
Anyways Italy should win this one Handily but the Handicap of -7.5 is too much for my liking. I like the over in this one. Italy should have a couple of 3-4 point ends and South Korea might even score a point or two.

Tundra on the other hand has hit this line 5 out of 7 maps in the past two days . Both teams play well from behind by split pushing and cutting waves and delaying game as much as possible. Their encounter on the last tournament went over 38.5 as well. I think the line should’ve  been from 40.5 so we’re getting good value in such a low line for such close game that could go both ways the only way we lose this bet is if Falcons picks a cheesy Huskar or fast paced tempo hero.

Tennis | Cleveland Challenger | 3:50 PM EST (estimated)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Borna Gojo vs Tristan Boyer | **Gojo ML at -152 (DK). 1 unit.**

Write-up: Friend closed at around -220, so I feel okay about that loss. On to the next one.

Borna Gojo is a talented player who stands at nearly 2m tall and possesses a powerful game reminiscent of Marin Cilic. Injuries and inconsistency have been major themes in his career, but when he&#x27;s timing the ball well, it can be extremely hard to stop him. In the first round here in Cleveland, he scored a dominant 6-0, 6-0 win over the 17-year-old Jack Kennedy (7.64 performance rating). It was clear that Kennedy was overmatched, but I didn&#x27;t feel that he gave the match away with unforced errors; rather, Gojo was able to take control from the start, earning free points on serve and taking a strong court position in rallies. 

On the other hand, Tristan Boyer only earned a 6.64 rating for his 4 &amp; 4 win over Garrett Johns. I will say that I think the rating slightly underrates his performance, as his forehand was doing a lot of damage, and he showed some good resilience to not get broken back at 4-3 in the second set. Boyer has the serve and physical attributes to succeed on fast courts, but actually developed his game on South American clay. The result is that he has developed a one-two punch game with a heavy forehand, but doesn&#x27;t approach the net as much as he maybe should. However, once you&#x27;re able to target Boyer&#x27;s backhand, things start to fall apart. Johns isn&#x27;t a bad player, but he doesn&#x27;t have the weapons for these conditions, and found himself constantly on defense in their match. In comparison, Gojo has the weaponry to dictate, and his serve into the Boyer backhand should score pretty often. Boyer&#x27;s topspin also tends to fall in the strike zone of taller players, and he actually holds an 0-7 record against players 6&#x27;2&quot; or taller in the last 52 weeks. Overall, I see Gojo having the advantage in the serve and backhand departments, and I think Boyer will need to make a lot of first serves and clip a lot of lines if he wants to win this. Gojo won&#x27;t win with a double bagel this time, but he should be able to move on here.</td></tr>

Fenerbahce Over 1.5 goals first half @ 2.5

Fenerbahce host Erzurum in a match where the Istanbul giants are clear favorites. The home side possess strong attacking quality and usually create many scoring chances, especially at their stadium. Erzurum often struggle defensively against superior opponents and concede multiple goals on the road. With Fenerbahce needing a confident performance, backing them to score over 1.5 goals looks valuable at this price.</td></tr>

&gt;We are playing against Czech Republic again tomorrow, this time with a team that looked very strong in the opening draw, Sweden. The Czech team looked completely outclassed against Canada and Chabicovsky was particularly weak. Sweden is another very strong experienced team that will put a lot of pressure on the young Czech team. The bigger advantage for Sweden is actually with the women; Isabella was the best player on the ice in the opening draw and she should easily outshoot Zelingrova with draws and hits. Sweden are coming off a 10-3 win over a Korean team that I have ranked higher than the Czechs. Sweden won 10-4 in the only career head-to-head match between these teams. Should be another easy win for Sweden.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** 2. BANJORA - WIN - $1.80 (Betting 4 units)    
**Write up:** <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s pick</mark> is BANJORA who is resuming for its second preparation and second race start. On debut was slowly away but mustered to sit 4th/5th, and showed great grit to wear down the leader BENEVAC, who has since won and run in much tougher races.      
     
Since that run BANJORA has trialled on two occasions. Firstly finishing 2nd after showing great gate speed and leading the field, and was applied absolutely no pressure. The second he again began brilliantly and sat 4 wide round the turn, finishing full of running without being tested at all. This improved ability to ping the gates implies maturity and development, and bodes well for us in the race since drawing barrier 4. The likely leader is one gate inside us, so I imagine us sitting just outside and in plenty of clear air.     
     
BANJORA is also yet to see a firm deck, but with the trials coming on ground that was borderline soft/good, I have no doubt we’ll handle it fine, and there’s even the potential of an improved showing on such a track.     
      
I think we’re a clear standout here, and the only horse we’re gonna have to get past is JUST AWESOME, which I’m fairly confident we’ll be able to do. GL!</td></tr>

Game/League/Time: Counterstrike 2 (CS2) | Nodwin Clutch Series #4 | 7:00 AM EST.

**Nuclear TigeRES:**

* Ended 2025 on a crazy run of form really solidifying themselves as a top tier two team after rising from relatively out of nowhere in the middle of the year. 2026 so far has been relatively the same, they have a 14-7 record in overall matches to start out the year, they are 33-20 in maps played overall at a \~62% win rate
* They were a playoff invite to Nodwin so they did not have to get thru group stage, they have played two playoff games to make it to semi finals, they beat UNiTY 2-0 (13-8/13-2), and upset 9INE <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> in a dominant 2-0 (13-7/13-9) as 2.20 underdogs
* Roster is built well overall, solid IGLing from Senka, strategically they have some really cool strats for a tier two team, they have clear star players/strong fire power at the top with z1k4/flouzer the Russian duo, and m1quse/ayuki as more supportive players
* TigeRES are currently at #42 in the world rn, they desperately want to keep stacking wins and gaining VRS points to try to crack the top 30, every win counts a ton and losses would hurt significantly adding even more incentive

**illwill:**

* illwill roster really seemed like a thrown together PUG team but has actually been performing better and more consistently as they get more reps in tier two, a weird mixture of russian IGL nEMANHA, french rifler hAdji, Romanian&#x27;s adamS and 7kick who randomly became an AWPer and has actually been doing a great job at it, and ukrainian fostar
* illwill have a very strong record this year at 15-5 overall, they have been farming lower tier  teams/tournaments relative to TigeRES, beating some tier 3/low tier two teams while Nuclear TigeRES is mostly in the mid-high tier two, but still a very strong record none the less. They have a 31-15 record in maps this year so far. They won a forfeit in RO16, and beat Betclic 2-0 in quarter finals (13-8/13-3)

**Projected Veto:**

* Nuclear TigeRES are the higher seed, they have side choice, 90-95% will <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> to choose second, they had side choice in the R016 against UNiTY and chose to veto 2nd as well
* illwill ban Ancient, Nuclear TigeRES ban Overpass
* illwill <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> Mirage, **Nuclear TigeRES <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> Inferno**

**Inferno Stats:**

* Nuclear TigeRES are 84% winrate on 19 maps of Inferno in the L3 months overall. It is their third highest played map in the pool, and their highest win rate currently. They are on a 4 map winstreak on Inferno.
* This TigeRES core was 15-3 on Inferno in 2025, averaged 54% winrate on CT side, and 66% on T side
* illwill are 33% winrate on 9 maps of Inferno in the L3 months overall. This is their only map with a &lt;50% winrate in the map pool at the moment, and by far their most uncomfortable.
* TigeRES have some extremely impressive Inferno wins against quality teams to start 2026, they are 5-2 this year so far, beating Nemesis 13-5, EYEBALLERS 13-6, and VP 13-10, they also had a very close lose to Gentle Mates 19-15, who might be the best Inferno team in all of tier two, very strong stuff
* illwill have very mixed results on Inferno, blown out by Tricked/FNC, close losses to BASEMENT BOYS/UNiTY, wins over Bet-M and Ursa, and in the last week have two relatively bad losses to 1WIN/FAVBET 13-7 each (both are very strong Inferno teams). They also had a win vs. ECSTATIC on Inferno 13-8 a week ago who are decently strong, but they also won both pistols</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Juventus DNB@1.88 (Coolbet) | **Stake: 3.5u**

**Write Up:** 

* Atalanta have won 1 of their last 21 home games against Juventus…
* Spalletti have only lost 2 of 20 games since taking over Juventus 

After a bad start to the season under Ivan Juric, Atalanta changed the coach and it got better for a long time, but now things have slowed down. Atalanta beat Parma 4-0 last home game, but also in the last five, they drew against Pisa who are in the relegation zone, lost both Champions League games that they were also favourites in and were massively lucky to get away with a 0-0 draw against Como on Sunday. 

Juventus has much the same story as Atalanta, as they also have gotten a whole lot better after sacking their manager. I will say that they are somewhat reliant on Kenan Yildiz to score and create chances, he is pretty clearly their best player at the moment and there is maybe some concern that he will not play this game. 

I don’t expect fireworks from this game, but for my money I believe Juventus has enough about them to see this game through in normal time with a 1-0 win.  </td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: ⛳️ Si Woo Kim top 20 finish including ties (+105)

Tournament starts at 9:20am EST, finishes Sunday evening. Bet 2u

Writeup: First thing to note here is the price of the bet has been moving like crazy since Monday. I got this originally at +125, and has since moved anywhere from +105 to -130. Do a little shopping around to try to get the best value.

I’ll also note that Kim has anywhere from the 3rd-5th best odds to win this entire event, and yet he is still listed as a plus money play in some books just to make top 20. Let’s capitalize on this.

The Waste Management Open is known for its fairly easier greens, making tee-to-green and strokes gained metrics very important if you want to come out on top in this tournament. Kim is currently 5th overall in tee-to-green metrics over the last 5 events this season, and is 4th in strokes gained. He is also leading in strokes gained specifically in his approach shots. Recently, Kim came tied for 2nd at the Farmers Insurance Open and tied for 6th at the American Express. In this tournament specially, he placed tied for 21st in 2025 and tied for 12th in 2024. I expect the winning score to be around -18, and with Kim having a Greens In Regulation of 75%, along with his fantastic ball striking with his iron play, I expect him to have a lot of birdie opportunities to keep climbing up the leaderboards. Kim has been a bit varied in his putting, but has recently earned 1.2 strokes gained from his putting over the last 5 events. 

I will be willing to say Kim will have some of the most birdie opportunities this entire tournament, the question will be if he can convert. Even if he is average in his conversion rate, his iron game and metrics in this area have been so good that he should be able to finish in the top 20 by the end of Sunday. A plus money play makes it even better.

​Write Up:

We’re taking Tundra ML again.

Xtreme Gaming loves to play slow. They want to drag games out, farm up Ame, and stall until they hit their timings. The problem is that Tundra doesn&#x27;t let you do that. Tundra plays a suffocating, objective based style that chokes out the map early. They don&#x27;t just kill you, they take away your map so you can&#x27;t drag out the game.

Tundra also defeated XG back in the last BLAST slam using this exact same style. XG might be able to drag games out against other teams, but Tundra is too disciplined to let them get comfortable. XG is good, but Tundra is just a bad matchup for them play style wise.

**Details: Al-Okhdood (Akhdoud) vs Al-Hilal - Saudi Pro League - 12:30 PM EST**

**---**

**The last 2 have just been stinky, let&#x27;s get back to normal. We&#x27;ve got 1st vs 15th in the SPL <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.**

**---**

**Al Hilal have played Al-Okhdood twice this season and have covered this line both times, achieving 7 and 11 corners in those games. Over 4 in both first quarters.**

**---**

The Saudi Pro League hasn&#x27;t failed us so far considering we&#x27;ve only touched the 2 best teams being Al Hilal and AL Nassr. The title race between these sides just brews heavy sided stats that fall in our favour.

Al Nassr have closed the gap over these past weeks, With Hilal now drawing 3 straight games anything less than 3 points tomorrow is confirmed capitulation. Al Hilal dominate the ball and give their opponents little to feed off out of possession. Considering Goal difference has been overlapped, 1 goal wont dwindle corner chances tmr.

**---**

* **Al Hilal** Average 6.7 Corners per game in the SPL
* In Al Hilal&#x27;s last 8 away games they&#x27;ve covered this line 7/8 with an average of 8.25 Corners Per Away game.
* In Al Hilal&#x27;s last 10 games they&#x27;ve covered this line 7/10.

**---**

* **Al Okhdood** are joint second for most corners conceded in the SPL at 6.2 Per game.

**Match:** [Blanchet U.](https://www.flashscore.dk/spiller/blanchet-ugo/pSmNT7D2/) vs [Fils A.](https://www.flashscore.dk/spiller/arthur-fils/IoIhUqIN/)

**Bet:** [Blanchet U.](https://www.flashscore.dk/spiller/blanchet-ugo/pSmNT7D2/) with handicap 4,5 games at odds 1.66

**Units:** 1 Units

**Explanation:**

Ugo Blanchet has really played well recently and won some big matches. He is playing against Fils who have not played a lot this year and have been out for some months. The match is being played on indoor hardcourt and should support a close match. In fact Fils has only played 1 match against Royer, which was a close 3 set match and the latest match before that was back in October.

I believe Ugo&#x27;s great shape and matches indoors support him and Fils is in my opinion favored too big in this match up. Fils is the better player overall but as his current form is questionable, we need to play Ugo with +4,5 games.

I see a good value in this bet and good luck!

### ⚽ <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: River Plate Reserve ML @ 1.62 (-161) - 3 Units


We are on a **4-win heater**. After comfortably hitting the Racing <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> yesterday, we’re staying in the Reserve League (Proyección) because the books still haven&#x27;t adjusted to the massive gap between these squads.

* **River Plate (Home):** &quot;La Maquinita&quot; is a powerhouse. Their academy is world-class, and at home, they play with a level of intensity and technical superiority that mid-table teams just can&#x27;t handle. They are coming in with great rhythm.

* **The Fade (Talleres):** Talleres’ reserve side is in a complete freefall. They’ve managed to win only 1 of their last 10 matches, losing 6 of them. But here is the kicker: **they haven’t won an away game in 7 months.** * **The Play:** I’m bumping this up to 3 units. River is superior in every single department, and Talleres’ psychological barrier when playing away from home is too big to ignore. 1.62 is a gift for a mismatch of this caliber.


BOL!!!

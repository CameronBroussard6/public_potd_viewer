**Football Record: 1-1**

**Net Units: +0.84** 

**Last 5** ❌️✅️ 

**Sport:** Football 

**Match:** Fulham - Liverpool (16:00 CET) &amp; Man City - Chelsea (18:30 CET) 

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Fulham o0.5 goals &amp; Man City ML 

**Unit stake:** 2U 

**Odds:** 2.26 

**To win:** 2.52U 

**Recap:** 

As predicted Wolves had no trouble scoring at least one goal. And just like I said it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if they manage to win vs a weak West Ham 

Arsenal managed to win their game. It was a bit closer than I would have preferred but I never doubted this Arsenal squad 

**Write Up:** 

Very similar bet as yesterday 

Fulham love to score 1+ goals at home. Scoring in 8/9 home games this season, only failing to do so versus league leaders Arsenal. They&#x27;ve scored 5/5 times in the L5 games and also scoring 4 at home vs Man City 

Liverpool have played away from home 9 times so far, conceding in 7 of those games. Only managing to keep a clean sheet against Burnley &amp; West Ham who both are bottom three as home teams this season 

I don&#x27;t like to take historic records into account as it isn&#x27;t that relevant in my opinion. But for those who do prefer it, Liverpool last kept a clean sheet away at Fulham in 2009. In the last 11 home games Fulham managed to score at least once against Liverpool. Including last year where Fulham won 3-2 against the eventual champions. An upset win by Fulham tomorrow wouldn&#x27;t be the craziest thought either 

Chelsea have just parted ways with their coach, which is not the best way to start the year. They&#x27;ll also miss Caicedo due to disciplinary points and possibly Cucurella to a hamstring strain. They do have depth in the squad but these players will definitely be missed 

Man City has won 8 straight home games since losing to Spurs at the very start of the season and I don&#x27;t see how that should change. Last 5 home games in the league they have scored 15 times and conceded 3 times 

Pep Guardiola also has some injuries and unavailabilities within the squad to deal with but the depth of his squad more than makes up for the absentees 

Again, not my cup of tea but H2H Man City is also 4-1-0 at home vs Chelsea in recent years. Including a 3-1 victory in january 2025 

Also not extremely relevant but a fun extra stat: Michael Oliver being the referee could have a minor impact too. Since 20/21 he has refereed 13 Chelsea away games of which they have lost 6. He has refereed 14 Man City home games of which they have won 11

**Sport | League | Event Time / Time Zone <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Soccer | La Liga (Spain) | Real Sociedad vs Atletico Madrid | 15:00  EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>:** Atletico Madrid ML k-105 (draftkings)| **1.05 units to win 1 unit**  

After analyzing recent performances, stats, and attacking trends, **Madrid ML** is the strongest <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> for this fixture.

**Write-Up:**  

This <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> is strongly supported by both statistical trends and team context this season. Atlético Madrid sit 4th in La Liga with 11 wins, 4 draws, and 3 losses, demonstrating consistent form against both top and mid-table opponents. Real Sociedad are struggling in 16th place with 4 wins, 5 draws, and 8 losses, including several narrow defeats at home, highlighting inconsistency and vulnerability against stronger sides. Atlético have scored an average of 1.83 goals per match while conceding just 0.89, reflecting a well-balanced combination of offensive efficiency and defensive discipline. Sociedad average 1.24 goals scored per match and concede 1.47, indicating defensive weaknesses that are amplified by recent absences.

Injuries and suspensions heavily impact Sociedad’s lineup: key players out include defenders Iñaki Rupérez, Clément Lenglet, suspended Igor Zubeldia and Jon Gorrotxategi, while midfielders Yangel Herrera and Ander Barrenetxea are also unavailable. Nicolás González is doubtful, further reducing attacking options. This significantly weakens Sociedad’s ability to maintain structure and transition into attack. Atlético, in contrast, appear fully fit and benefit from tactical stability under Simeone, particularly in away matches where they prioritize defensive solidity while exploiting counter-attacks.

Home advantage for Sociedad is mitigated by Atlético’s strong away form. Sociedad’s home record this season includes wins over Mallorca and Sevilla, but losses to Girona and Villarreal, highlighting inconsistency even at home. Atlético Madrid have consistently scored in almost every away match while conceding very few goals, maintaining disciplined defensive lines. Historical head-to-head also favors Atlético, who have dominated Sociedad in recent La Liga encounters.

Considering form, injuries, tactical discipline, defensive efficiency, and historical data, the projected outcome heavily favors Atlético Madrid. Realistic scorelines cluster between 1-0 and 2-1, with Atlético controlling the pace and exploiting Sociedad’s weakened defense. This makes Atlético Madrid the strongest, most data-backed <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, representing a disciplined, high-probability play rather than chasing a volatile result

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Elena-Gabriela Ruse ML WTA TENNIS 5u @1.93 ⚠️scheduled to start in 4 hours


Pretty standard home win for Villa at great odds. I suggested taking any Watkins props which would have all hit with me grabbing a goal and a couple shots on target. 

Now it’s time to get back to what I do best. Tennis. Model has us in with a 72% chance of victory giving us a pretty good edge on the market. Elena is in great form after obliterating her opponent 6-1, 6-0 and we will need her to take down a struggling American in just a few hours. 

If anyone is interested the model also suggest Kyrgious has a 66% chance of victory and he is currently priced in as a relatively big underdog. I am taking him but have not decided for him to be the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> due to his real lack of consistency. He has the skill the win this match with little effort, but there’s always a risk that he turns up and just can’t be asked.

Last pick: Tennessee @ Arkansas; Arkansas ML (-156) 2 units ✅.  I love you John Calipari and Acuff Jr. Close game until Acuff said enough was enough. 

Event: NFL Cowboys @ Giants 12 pm CT 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Cowboys -3.5 (-110) 2u

Don’t you love watching two underperforming teams play football? Well I do and I love to bet em even more. Both of these teams are out of the playoffs already this year so there is no real benefit for the Cowboys to win this game. However, Dak Prescott made it very clear him and the team were gonna play for pride as the season has been a disappointment. 

Motivators for Dallas: 
With a win, Dallas would bring their record to an overall .500, the team has not finished under .500 since 2000-2002 stretch. Jerry Jones is a prideful man, he is probably doing everything he can to continue that. Also, Dallas would finish 5-1 in the division with this win. Which would be a huge confidence boost going into next season. Eberflus (DC coordinator) is basically coaching for his job in this one. He was a disappointment in Chicago as the HC and has been terrible calling this defense this year. He will be pulling out everything he has to have a respectable end of the season. Just in case he has to plead his case for another team to hire him if the cowboys let him go. 

Reasons for NYG to lose: 
I mean come on, it’s pretty obvious. They sit at the 2nd best chance to get the #1 <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> going into Sunday (Behind the raiders of course). They are tied with 3 other teams with a 3-13 record. And due to their strength of schedule they would claim a higher <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> than all of those teams in a tiebreaker. The players/coaches are preaching that everyone will be playing and going all out. Do you really believe that? The owner would be crucified by fans for winning a pointless game and ruining their chances for the 1st or 2nd <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. I believe NY will play hard to get quality reps heading into next season but I do not believe they are prioritizing a win in this matchup. 

The Cowboys have won the last 9 matchups between these two teams. In the last 9 matchups, the cowboys have an average win margin of 15.67 points. They absolutely dominate this team on a regular basis. BOL</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Ka&#x27;imi Fairbairn Over 1.5 Made Field Goals -145 (Bet365) 5u**

Ka&#x27;imi Fairbairn has made 2+ FG in 13/14 games this season. He is 38/42 on FG&#x27;s, good for 90% and 13th in the league. In the previous H2H matchup against the Colts, Fairbairn was 2-2. In the previous 7 vs the Colts, he has hit this line 5 times. He averages 3 FGA per game this year. Texans head coach DeMeco Ryans has already stated he plans to play all of his starters tomorrow. The Colts will be starting rookie QB Riley Leonard tomorrow, so I expect the Texans defense to make him see ghosts, which in turn leads to more posessions for the Texans on offense. If Fairbairn attempts only 2 field goals, he should make them. Tomorrow&#x27;s game will also be played inside NRG Stadium which is a dome. NFL kickers historically have better FG% indoors than outdoors. BOL

__Event:__ NFL: Cardinals @ Rams 4:25pm EST

__POTD:__ Michael Wilson o66.5 rec yards (-110), 4.4u to win 4u

__Write Up:__ The Arizona Cardinals (3-13) are traveling to LA to take on the Rams (11-5) to close out the regular season in a NFC West battle. The Rams have lost 2 games in a row &amp; have dropped out of the race to win the 1st round bye in the NFC. They will finish as either the 5 or 6 seed in the NFC Playoffs. If the Seahawks beat the 49ers on Saturday night then the Rams can finish 5th if they win this game. But regardless of the outcome there is potential the Rams bring in their 2nd stringers. As for the Cardinals, they have lost 8 games in a row &amp; are obviously out of the playoffs. Having been down every game, Arizona has been slinging it &amp; that should continue this week. 

Arizona has lost 8 straight games with a league worst -126 point differential over that span. This has led to Cardinals QB Jacoby Brissett throwing the ball more than any other team in the league. __Brissett is averaging 41.2 passes per game.__ This week he will be without his WR1 Marvin Harrison Jr who the Cardinals just placed on IR. Harrison has missed 4 games this season. In those 4 games Michael Wilson has been a star. __Michael Wilson’s averages without MHJ (4 games):__

15 targets

10.3 receptions

124.8 receiving yards

0.8 TD’s

__Without Marvin Harrison Jr, Wilson has been targeted on 29% of his routes averaging 2.35 yards per route run, both top 10 in the league. He had 11+ targets in all 4 games.__ That should continue this week, especially with what Wilson has on the line. __Wilson currently has 907 receiving yards &amp; is 93 yards away from his first 1,000 yard season. Wilson is 93 yards away from 1,000 on the season.__ The Cardinals &amp; Brissett will do all they can to get Wilson his yards, with nothing else to play for. Wilson also torched the Rams the last time they face each other just a month ago. __In Week 14 Wilson had 11 receptions for 142 yards &amp; 2 TD’s, with 16 targets.__  The have also been getting torched through the air lately, allowing the 9th most receiving yards to WRs &amp; 6th most receptions. Here are some recent stat lines by opposing WR’s:

JSN: 8 rec 96 yds, 1 TD

Amon-Ra: 13/164 2 TD’s, Jamo: 7/134 1 TD

Wilson: 11/142 2 TD’s

Coker: 4/74 1 TD

JSN: 9/105 

Wilson should be able to hit this easily, I think he breaks 100 this Sunday afternoon.

**Short Write Up**:

* Has nine SoT from his last six games

West Ham are in the relegation zone and have been there forever now, but things are starting to get better. Last round they beat fellow red zone residents Burnley 2-0 away for three massive points and if everything goes right this round, they will move above forest into safety. Manchester United have been completely transformed since Carrick took over from Amorim, with a four game winning streak, beating both Arsenal and City in the process. 

I do think Manchester United should prove to be the better team here and finally win five games in a row, but I don’t think there is any obvious reason for this to just be a walk in the park against a side that has a super in-form player like Summerville on the wing.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: (NCAAB) Duke Blue Devils -14.5 vs Pittsburgh Panthers (-165) (9:00 PM EST)**

Reasoning: Pittsburgh has lost 6 of their last 7 games and are taken on the 2nd ranked team in the country, Duke Blue Devils. Duke has a significant edge in offensive and defensive efficiency. The only thing going in favor of Pittsburgh is their at home tonight. Duke has covered 4 of their last 5 on the road. Pitts offense is horrible and their defense surprisingly play worse at home. Duke will cause major problems for this Pittsburgh offense tonight hence them coming out with a comfortable win here for the Blue Devils. Lay the 14.5 points on Duke tonight

<tr><td class='post'>* League: English Premier League
* Event: Tottenham vs Newcastle
* **<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Over 3.5 &amp; BTTS**
* **Odd: 2,60 (1xbet) - 2 Und**

*<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> written in Spanish. Translated with AI. Please understand.*

Lore: We&#x27;re heading to Tottenham Hotspur Stadium for the vibrant clash between Tottenham and Newcastle, corresponding to Matchday 26 of the Premier League.

What we&#x27;re looking for on this occasion is a scenario of a constant exchange of blows: we need both teams to score and, at the end of the 90 minutes, for at least 4 goals to have been scored in total.

I like this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> because we have very attractive odds of 2,60 for something that, analyzing the tactical context and the absences, I see as highly feasible. Thomas Frank&#x27;s Tottenham arrives at a critical moment, flirting with the lower part of the table and with a defense that is a real hospital. The absence of Cristian &quot;Cuti&quot; Romero due to suspension, added to the injuries of Udogie, Danso, Porro, and Davies, forces Spurs to improvise a defensive line with players like Dragusin and Van de Ven who, although fast, tend to suffer against direct transitions.

If we look at Tottenham&#x27;s case, they average 1.40 goals for and 1.40 against, but the recent trend is what gives us the value: they are coming off a 2-2 draw against City and a 2-2 draw against Burnley. In their last 5 matches, &quot;both teams to score&quot; has occurred frequently, and their defensive fragility is evident, allowing an average of 2.60 goals in their most demanding games.

On Newcastle&#x27;s side, the statistics are fuel for this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. Eddie Howe&#x27;s team averages 1.4 goals scored and concedes 1.38, but away from home, their matches tend to be constant back-and-forth affairs. In their recent away games, they have registered scorelines like a 4-1 loss to Liverpool and a spectacular 4-3 against Leeds. With Harvey Barnes on a hot streak (the team&#x27;s top scorer with 12 goals in all competitions) and the creative ability of Guimarães, they have enough firepower to punish a depleted London defense.

Historically, this is the Premier League fixture that has been played the most times without registering a 0-0 draw (61 consecutive matches). With both teams in need of points and defenses that concede easily, the &quot;Over 3.5 and BTTS&quot; has fantastic value.

**Event:** NBA // Spurs @ Lakers 10:30 PM EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Harrison Barnes O8.5 Points

**Odds // Units:** Pinnacle (-100) 2u

**Write-up:** Simple value play on a soft line. Barnes has been quietly consistent, going over 8.5 in 6 of his last 10 games with a season average of 11.1 PPG. The model projects him at 11.1 tonight with a +30.8% edge over the line.

The Lakers are on the second night of a back-to-back (played OKC last night, lost 110-119), which typically means tired legs and softer defense - they&#x27;re already 25th in defensive rating. With Wembanyama drawing most of the defensive attention in the paint, Barnes gets clean looks as the veteran floor spacer.

Recent form is trending up: 9, 19, 9 in his last 3 games. Even his &quot;off&quot; nights (7, 5, 6) still put him close to the line. At -106, this is a low-risk, high-probability play. Barnes gets his 25-30 minutes regardless, and the Spurs need his veteran scoring with Castle still developing.

Low line + tired defense + role player consistency = easy money. BOL!</td></tr>

**Last pick:** Atalanta ML + u4,5 goals @ 1,66

**Event:** West Ham vs Manchester United

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Manchester United DC + o2,5 goals @ 1,84

**WriteUp:** Manchester United is in great form winning their last 4 games, including City, Arsenal, Spurs scoring 2 or 3 goals every game. They are first in xg/90min (1,81) and scored the 3rd most goals 46(1,84/match) in the league. They are 5th best at xga/90(1,31) and 12th in conceded goals 36(1,44/match).
West Ham is also in great form winning 4 of their last 5 games. However they are 17th in xg/90 (1,21) scored 35 goals (1,24/match). They are 19th in xga/90 (1,78)   and 19th in conceded goals 48(1,92/match).
I expect atleast 3 goals this game and Man United to win 1-2 or 1-3 but they could also choke with a 2-2 draw.</td></tr>

Finally a break but there&#x27;s still more to go.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** (NCAAB) Arizona State vs Oklahoma State (Oklahoma State +2.5)

**Start Time:** 02:00 AM (GMT)

**Odds:** \-118

**Units:** 5U

**Reasoning:** Take Oklahoma State Cowboys +2.5 because this matchup has “one possession game” written all over it. Arizona State doesn’t really put teams away, they grind, stall, miss shots, and let everyone hang around longer than they should. That’s good when you’re holding points.

Oklahoma State is exactly the kind of team you want in this spot. They defend, they play physical, and they’re perfectly comfortable making the game ugly. You’re not asking them to dominate, just to exist for 40 minutes without collapsing, which they’re very capable of doing.

I don&#x27;t love small spreads (less than 2.0 is straight up crap) but +2.5 is just enough for me to take it when it&#x27;s gonna be as competitive as this.</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>Record: 6-0-2

Form: WLWWLWWW

Match: Chelsea v Leeds &amp; Napoli v Como

Time: 20:30 &amp; 21:00 CET

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Both matches Total Goals over 1.5 (1.68)

Reasoning:

Chelsea’s home games consistently deliver goals. They’ve scored 2+ goals in multiple recent matches, and their attacking numbers at Stamford Bridge are trending upward. Leeds’ away defense has been shaky, conceding regularly against stronger sides, while still offering enough threat to keep games open rather than slow. Even if Leeds fail to score, Chelsea have more than enough quality to push this game past the 1.5 goal line on their own. Given Chelsea’s form and Leeds’ defensive issues, this line looks well supported by both form and underlying stats.

Napoli matches are rarely quiet, especially at home. They average close to 2 goals per game in league play and have scored in the vast majority of their recent fixtures. Even when Napoli don’t dominate from start to finish, their attacking depth and tempo usually produce goals. Como, on the other hand, are not a side that sits back for 90 minutes — they tend to concede when facing top-half opposition, and Napoli’s high press and wide play should create multiple clear chances. As it is a cup match and none of these teams will be happy with a draw, over 1.5 goals looks like a strong and relatively safe angle.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: 🏀 Iowa State ML + Arkansas ML (-105).

Games start at 9pm EST. Bet 3u

Writeup: Annoyed with our last loss, let’s get back in the win column win a moneyline parlay.

Iowa State has an offensive advantage in pretty much every metric against TCU, and they are putting up these metrics against some of the best teams in the nation with a top 3 quality of record. They’ll have a top 10 offense going up against a top 50 TCU defense. Even more impressive is Iowa State’s 5th ranked defense, while TCU has a top 100 offense. TCU is a bit more consistent game over game, but we’re simply taking the better team here, not much else needs to be said.

Arkansas vs LSU has a greater likelihood of being closer game. Normally I avoid taking the favorite in these types of matchups where teams have opposite play styles, but this Arkansas offense is rolling. They have the 5th most efficient offense along with the 4th best field goal conversion rate. Along with a huge offensive rebounding advantage, I expect this to be too much for LSU’s 130th ranked defense.

**Odds // Units:** FanDuel (-130 / I used a profit boost, so it is +100) 2.5u

**Write-up:** No Grayson Allen tonight, which feeds Brooks. Booker is playing, and Jalen Green should be eased back in with his minute restriction. With Booker and without Allen this season, he is 12/18, 67% - pretty good. At home, he is 8/9, averaging 25 points. He had 18 in that one game and played only 25 minutes since they put a beatdown on the Kings. He’s already covered in tougher matchups like the Rockets, Spurs, Thunder, Wolves, and 76ers. The Mavericks have been bad at defending pull-up jumpers, and we’re talking about Brooks, where his bread and butter is some form of a pull-up shot. Similar to KPJ, he runs PNRs and tries to get into the midrange/paint for a layup or step back + fadeaway. The Mavericks, same as the Magic, aren’t protecting the paint all that great, ranking bottom 25% this season. Like I mentioned, Brooks is taking almost 50% of his shots there. The Mavericks also play at a fast pace, so Brooks is naturally going to have a few more chances to score tonight. Looks like another 25 point game to me.</td></tr>

Chelsea vs Leeds

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Chelsea -1 @ 1,86 (1 unit) (Premier League)

4 win streak, let&#x27;s keep it going!

To the Premier League, where Chelsea faces Leeds at home. I think there is certainly value in this one. Chelsea has a great recent record. They&#x27;ve won their last 4 Premier League games, also won against Napoli in the Champions League. In recent matches, Chelsea only lost to Arsenal.

Leeds are not looking to bad. They won against Fulham and Forest. But they lost 4-0 to Arsenal.  
They did drew against Man United and Liverpool, which is quite impressive. But if you check the xG, it should&#x27;ve been another scoreline at the end.

Chelsea should win this, hopefully with 2 or more. If they win with 1 goal difference, we get the money back.

Last pick:Jaylen Brown (BOS) OVER 6.5 Rebounds (L) Lesson: none

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: : Karl-Anthony Towns (NYK) OVER 12.5 Rebounds(-125)HR

Reasoning: 🕵️ Detective clues:

Evidence 1: The &quot;Vacuum&quot; Volume KAT has become a rebounding monster under the new defensive scheme. He has cleared this 11.5 line in 6 of his last 10 games, averaging a staggering 13.3 rebounds per game over that span. His recent outings include massive totals of 20, 22, and 15 rebounds. Mitchell Robinson has been ruled OUT for tonight’s game due to injury management. The Logic: Without Robinson to &quot;vulture&quot; boards, KAT’s rebounding floor sky-rockets. He averages 14.3 rebounds per game when Robinson sits. That&#x27;s nearly two full boards above your target.

Evidence 2:The Indiana Rebound Desert The Pacers are currently the worst rebounding team in the East, ranking 29th in total rebounding percentage (47.7%). After trading away size for perimeter play, they allow the 2nd most points in the paint and struggle to box out elite bigs. Indiana’s frontcourt simply lacks the physical gravity to keep KAT off the glass. Indiana’s new big man, Ivica Zubac, is Questionable with an ankle sprain. Even if he plays, he won&#x27;t be 100%. If he sits, Indiana is forced to start Jay Huff, who doesn&#x27;t have the mass to keep KAT out of the paint. Rebounding Defense: Indiana ranks 29th in the NBA in total rebounding, losing the battle by an average of 4.4 boards per game.

Evidence 3: Historical Matchup Edge In his only other meeting with a similarly undersized Indiana rotation this season, KAT dominated the boards. The forensic data shows that without a traditional &quot;glass-eater&quot; at center for the Pacers, the Knicks&#x27; offensive rebounding efficiency (top-3 in the league) funnels extra opportunities directly to Towns. KAT&#x27;s Current Heater

* The Numbers: KAT is leading the NBA in rebounding at 11.9 RPG. He recently recorded games of 20 and 15 rebounds.
* The Efficiency: He is hauling in double-digit rebounds in 38 of his 49 appearances this season. Scenario Playbook

Scenario A (The Ideal):The game remains competitive into the late 4th quarter. KAT plays 32–35 minutes and naturally clears 12+ rebounds by the middle of the 3rd quarter due to Indiana&#x27;s high-pace/missed-shot volume.

Scenario B (The Grind): Indiana shoots unusually well from 3-point range, limiting defensive rebound opportunities. KAT has to work harder on the offensive glass, but his 3.8 offensive RPG average keeps us alive.

Scenario C (The Outside Influences):Early foul trouble for KAT. If he picks up two quick ones in the first quarter, his minutes get slashed, and we rely on a massive 3rd-quarter surge to hit the number.

Scenario D (The White Flag 🏳️) The Mike Brown Factor. The Knicks go up by 25+ points. Coach Brown pulls the starters with 8 minutes left in the game. We need KAT to have 10-11 boards by halftime to survive the early &quot;towel-throw.&quot; Scenario E (Cold Night):The Knicks&#x27; perimeter defense is too good, and Indiana turns the ball over instead of shooting. Fewer shots = fewer rebounding chances.

Scenario Proof:The NBA 2K26 simulation and real-world forensic trends both show KAT clearing 11.5 in 85% of projected 30-minute simulations against Indiana&#x27;s current roster. The &quot;Line Creep&quot; from 10.5 to 11.5 is a reaction to his dominance, but the data says there is still value at this number.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Shkendija vs Struga - BTTS Yes @ 1.73

Write Up: A funny stat - in the last 6 times these two teams played H2H since Oct 2024, 4/6 matches went exactly 1-1, and BTTS has hit in 5/6 last H2H.

Shkendija has no clean sheet in L8 H2H and Struga no clean sheet in L4.

BTTS has hit for both of these teams in their last 4/5 overall matches (for both teams against other teams) and Shkendija has conceded in L4 and Struga in L5.

I think it’s logical to try for the trend to continue. I’m doing BTTS as my main bet, but I’ll also do a small side bet for draw.

Great spot for KAT here to feast on the glass as Robinson is a great rebounder and without him there’s more responsibility on KAT to clean it up.

Like the assist upside here as he’s had 2, 3 &amp; 3 in his L3 vs the Pacers &amp; the fact that Pacers are top 10 in pace, leading to more possessions and increased RA potentials.

He is avg 14.3 rebounds per game without Robinson compared to 11.9 on the season.

Over in 9/13 without Robinson avg 17.4 RA’s on 23 rebound chances &amp; 5.2 potential assists per game. 

Over in 3/L4 against the Pacers

Pacers did acquire center Zubac before the trade deadline but he’s questionable for this game with a left ankle sprain, and with the all star break around the corner, I doubt he’ll play here.

Blowout is a concern definitely but you never know with the NBA, these teams have a somewhat of a rivalry aswell with the latest playoffs series so im hoping Pacers step up, and in order for it to be a blowout we’d need Pacers to miss tons of shots where KAT hopefully dominates with rebounds.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Elise Mertens ML x Linda Noskova ML @ 1.75 (2u)

Reasoning: 

Kasatkina was horrible in her first round match against Uchijima but benefited from her level falling to take it in 3. Mertens won&#x27;t give her the same leeway. She blew Pavlyuchenkova off the court in the first round and should continue her run of form.

Noskova on the other hand played brilliantly against a decent opponent in Joint in her first round match and should take it comfortably against Gracheva. (There was extensive strapping on Noskova&#x27;s thighs in the tournaments leading to the AO, that seems to have disappeared now, giving us a slight reassurance on her health)

Good luck.</td></tr>

**Start Time:** 9:00 PM ET

**Odds:** \-111 (Fanduel)

**Units (to win):** 1.65u to win 1.5u

**Reasoning:** Nice sweat on the last pick, one second away from overtime ruining our under. Onto <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, where I took a negative correlation parlay. Looking at the Mavs, a 7 game losing streak puts them well outside the play-in, and team morale is dipping. During this stretch, they&#x27;ve gone 2-5 ATS, winning by a mere 1.5 points against the Hornets and by 6.5 to the Rockets, one of the worst favourites ATS in the league. However, the major bright spot of recent has been rookie sensation Cooper Flagg, who has been seeing increased volume and maintaining impressive efficiency. Setting aside his last game against the Spurs where he only played 26 minutes, Flagg has routinely notched 20+ FGA. I expect this volume to return especially after playing less minutes in a blowout loss. On the Suns side, I see this as a clear opportunity to get back on track before the all-star break. After a couple tough losses, the Suns are dangling at the 7th seed, in danger of the play-in. Despite this, I&#x27;m optimistic about the matchup, as Phoenix won the earlier matchup this year in Dallas by 9 and they are one of the best teams ATS as a favourite in the league.

For those who aren&#x27;t able to parlay these 2, I&#x27;d take Suns -7.5.

Last Pick: Yale @ Howard Full Game Under 147.5

Result: LOSS ❌ (Combined score: 168)

Review: OT. OT. OT.

The game was tracking cleanly under almost the entire way. Regulation was set to end at 139 total points, well below the 147.5 number, before a last-second Yale three tied it and sent the game to overtime.

Once OT hits, full-game unders are immediately at a disadvantage because the total was never priced for extra possessions. The added period pushed it over, but the original game flow and pacing played out exactly as expected. This one was decided by overtime, not by a breakdown in the read.

College Basketball | NCAA Men’s Basketball Houston @ Utah | Time: 9:00 PM

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Under 142.5

Odds: -105 (DraftKings)

Write-Up:

Houston–Utah profiles as a game where possession control and defensive structure outweigh raw scoring potential. Houston consistently imposes half-court discipline on opponents, limiting early-clock opportunities and forcing long, contested possessions. When Houston dictates the tempo, games tend to slow naturally rather than oscillate, which suppresses both pace and efficiency without requiring poor shooting luck. Utah’s offense is more rhythm-dependent and less effective when forced into late-clock execution, making sustained scoring runs difficult in this matchup.

From a game-flow standpoint, margin separation here works in favor of the under rather than against it. Houston does not accelerate when leading and is comfortable draining clock while maintaining defensive pressure. Utah lacks the spacing and foul-drawing profile needed to reliably manufacture late-game scoring inflation, which reduces over risk even if the game stays competitive. This creates a scenario where possessions quietly disappear over the final ten minutes rather than multiply.

The under is further supported by late-game tendencies. Houston is among the most disciplined teams nationally when closing games, prioritizing shot selection and defensive containment over pace. Without consistent transition chances or an extended foul sequence, Utah is unlikely to push the total upward late. Structurally, this matchup favors containment, control, and clock erosion — all characteristics that support a total staying below market expectation.

Best of luck!!

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: 1u on Luca Harrington to win a medal (+250)

I’ve been watching this kid come up over the last few years and simply put, no one is messing with his rotations and amplitude tomorrow. 

Coming off an incredible gold-medal x-games performance, Luca was the heavy favourite going into qualifiers but slipped out slightly on the first rail in his qualifying run resulting in a uncharacteristically low score (we’ve also seen some questionable judging at times throughout these games, but I digress). 

Now we’ve been gifted this insane line, so feast your hearts out at your own discretion. I will preface this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> by saying Birk Ruud did look fantastic in qualifiers, but he shares similar strengths as Luca (big rotations and amplitude, while being a little less technical on the rails) and I just think Luca possesses another level. I also like Alex Hall as a sneaky dark horse contender due to his unmatched creativity and technical abilities but the judges are unlikely to reward him in the face of guys like Birk and Luca.

Write up: BYU has been nothing short of horrific these last couple weeks. So why not bet them.. But in all seriousness Baylor has lost 11 straight vs ranked opponents. BYU has won 22 of 23 against unranked opponents. Baylor has also struggled in the first half of games in the Big 12. Falling behind on a team who can run up the score like BYU? That’s a recipe for disaster for Baylor. And you gotta imagine BYU knows how big of a moment in the season this is. A loss here derails everything. Not only does BYU have the potential number 1 <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> but they have a very solid supporting cast in Saunders and Wright who both can be trusted late. I just don’t think Baylor has enough to beat this team at this spot. I trust Dybantsa in crunch time with my life. Let’s put our hard earned on the Cougars tomorrow. Let me know if you’re tailing!

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>: England | Premier League | 230pm Eastern | Everton vs Bournemouth | Everton DNB 3U @ -128

Everton Draw No Bet against Bournemouth is a value-driven <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> that balances form, matchup dynamics, and game state risk. Everton’s recent performances have shown a clear upward trend, particularly in defensive structure and midfield control. They have been far more compact without the ball, conceding fewer high-quality chances and forcing opponents into lower-percentage shots. This defensive improvement is crucial against a Bournemouth side that relies heavily on transition moments and wide overloads rather than sustained possession.

At Hill Dickinson Stadium, Everton’s underlying numbers traditionally improve, especially in terms of expected goals conceded. The home crowd tends to amplify Everton’s intensity, leading to stronger pressing phases and fewer defensive lapses. Bournemouth, meanwhile, have been far less consistent away from home, where their attacking output drops and they struggle to dictate tempo. When Bournemouth are forced into a slower, more physical match, their effectiveness noticeably declines.

From a tactical perspective, Everton’s direct approach and set-piece threat pose a persistent problem for Bournemouth’s back line, which has shown vulnerability against physical forwards and second-ball situations. Everton do not need prolonged dominance to create danger; their ability to capitalize on moments, particularly from dead-ball situations, gives them a clear edge in tight matches.

The Draw No Bet angle strengthens the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> by mitigating Everton’s tendency to grind out narrow, low-margin games. If the match turns cagey or ends level, the stake is protected, while Everton’s superior defensive stability and home advantage still provide a realistic path to victory. Overall, Everton Draw No Bet represents a disciplined, analytically sound selection that aligns with form trends, matchup edges, and risk management principles rather than relying on outright result volatility.</td></tr>

League of Legends (LOL) | LPL 2026 Split 1 playoffs | 1:00 AM EST. | Teams: ThunderTalk vs. LNG

**Writeup:**

* LNG are massive favorites in this one and for good reason, TT are the worst team in the league, 1-12 game record and yet to win a series with just 1 map win. LNG are 12-2 in game record and 6-0 in matches, complete inverse of TT, while TT was still in the harder group, I still think this is a compelte mismatch, most of LNG group was bad but LNG roster is very good, they have a ton of talent and should roll over TT, expecting a 3-1 if im being generous, 3-0 if LNG play serious throughout.
* LNG in map wins die the 2nd least/14 teams in the LPL, and rank 12th/12 in deaths per game amongst playoff teams at only 6.6 deaths per game, while also having 12 map wins overall meaning this is quite a strong sample to go off of. They don&#x27;t die a lot and play very cleanly in their games, at a 6.6 average (round up to 7 to be generous) Ryan3 would need 4/7 kills to go over or a roughly 57% kill share. He is currently averaging a 33.6% kill share overall meaning this number will be very hard to achieve.
* In map losses, Thundertalk don&#x27;t really do much either, their pace of play is extremely slow, they average just 8.8 kills per map loss, even at this number still very hard for Ryan3 to hit this line, they often just rollover and let teams dictate pace of play against them and they aren&#x27;t proactive at all. Ryan3 is often left farming in side lane for the grubs fight early
* LNG in map wins don&#x27;t give up many kills to enemy adc&#x27;s at all, In map wins this split, LNG are only giving up 1.58 kills to enemy adc&#x27;s in their 12 map wins overall, well below this line, they also have a massive advantage in bot lane with 1xN/missing up against Ryan3/Feather.
* Ryan3 is averaging 2.42 kills per map in losses this split for Thundertalk, has gone O in 2/12 map losses. However this average is inflated from a very high kill loss which he dropped 8 kills, factoring that out, in the other 11 losses, he is averaging 1.91 kills per map loss overall</td></tr>

This is a classic set up of a horse racing well but not getting a stakes win, coming back to a maiden in its next prep and proving far too good for its opposition.

I like OG here just playing for one unit but might increase, following rationale:

* fnatic have lost four straight matches and haven’t played for 3 weeks
* OG are a new roster but they played yesterday and won the last two matches convincingly albeit to weaker teams
* OG’s players are well established and three of them are cracked whereas on Fnatic I’d say they have one maybe two players with big firepower
* Overall I’d line OG more like -125 to -150 range so see upside on the new roster and assume they&#x27;ve been putting the practice in which is why they started the new season so hot

The only watch out is both teams are experienced and there’s a lot at stake.. might go to three maps (in a bo3) but I like OG to prevail nonetheless. Another couple of side tangents why we might be seeing value on OG: both teams are popular and their fans will bet on them regardless and I&#x27;d say OG&#x27;s IGL (in-game leader) is a little unpopular with some bettors maybe fading him but it&#x27;s just perception imo I think he&#x27;s a very solid IGL fwiw.

Xinyu Wang - Elena Rybakina

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Xinyu Wang +5.5 games at @1.80 (-120), stake 100$ (1U)

Xinyu Wang has looked solid in almost every match this season. For example, at the Australian Open she caused Anisimova quite a few problems, in a match where she could have won the first set. Here, in her opening match, she cruised past Arango, only facing some difficulty in the second set when her serve dropped below her usual standard. However, she possesses one of the best serves in the world, and I don’t think she will concede breaks easily <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.


Elena Rybakina comes into this match after winning the Australian Open title, where she defeated Sabalenka in the final. She is an exceptional athlete, but I expect a slight dip in her level. Often, after winning a Grand Slam trophy, players tend to be more relaxed at the next tournament and somewhat less motivated. I believe this could be the case here as well, leading to a more modest performance.


Therefore, I believe Wang will not lose by more than a 5-game margin, and my prediction is based on this idea.</td></tr>

Since coming back from injury, Bruno has been outstanding. In their 6 matches played in 2026, he has scored or assisted in all of those games.

West Ham have actually played pretty well as of late and are also equally motivated to get out of the relegation zone. These two teams played in December at Old Trafford and they drew 1-1. With that being said, ManU controlled a lot of that game and I think it’s safe to say this team is currently playing with a different confidence level than they were in December.

**Write Up:** Back in the green yesterday as our guy Malen came through clutch with 2 goals on 7 shots. Got a touch sweaty as Malen had a bunch of shots blocked, but he came through for us again. Appreciate the love friends, and good to see a lot of you cashed yesterday! Let&#x27;s see if we can start a streak. 

We&#x27;re playing back one of our favorite plays <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> and backing Enzo Fernandez to land a shot on target. Enzo, as many of you know, is one of my favorite players to back and fits the style of player I love to back to a T. He&#x27;s always working hard, chases every fast break, takes free kicks frequently, crashes the box well, and isn&#x27;t afraid to shoot from distance. This is lower odds than I usually like to take him, but I absolutely love this spot for him so we&#x27;re not going to overthink it. 

Leeds sit 16th in the table and sit right at 16th defensively as well. They just conceded 6 SOTs at home to Forest and 9 SOTs at home to Arsenal. The reverse fixture at Leeds ended 3-1 in favor of Leeds, and while Enzo didnt have an SOT he did have 3 shots which is rare for him to not find the target. 

Enzo has been on a tear lately and is in the running (maybe favorite?) for midfielder of the year in the EPL. He has scored 4 goals in his last 7 matches, and landed an SOT in each of his last 3 matches. I expect Chelsea to dominate the ball here at home and im turn get their shots in. I&#x27;m also thinking there&#x27;s a chance Palmer is rested in this game and Enzo will play further forward where he has thrived this season. Even if he plays further back, I still see him getting his shots in.

Al Ittihad and Al Gharafa are two very attacking teams that play fast, wide football. Both sides rely heavily on crosses, set pieces and constant pressure in the final third.

Event: Soccer/Football, [Germany DFB Pokal] Hertha vs Freiburg


<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:  Hertha over 10.5 shots @ 1.80


Freiburg allow a lot, they allowed 19 to Dusseldorf playing away in this cup, and 11 to Darmstadt at home. In the league Freiburg allowed 11+ in 10/11 away games, clearing vs the weaker German sides too - Heidenheim, Werder, Wolfsburg. Hertha covering 11+ in 8/11 games at home in the league, covered in 1/2 home games in the cup, failed to cover vs Elversberg where they went 1-0 then 2-0 up, <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> they should not win as easily vs Freiburg, meaning they should put up goal attempts.</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>**POTD Record:** 13-40-5 *A Messi esque goal by Carreras of all people dented my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> before a dazzling last minute Mbappe tap-in put the final nail in the coffin, smashing the 40th loss right on the board. You just couldn&#x27;t make this up. We move though and I love the look of the next <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>! <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s a bit of a unique day with the Premier League matches being played midweek and I&#x27;m here for it*

**Last Five:** ✅✅❌❌❌

**Event:** Premier League, West Ham v Manchester United, 3:15 pm EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** West Ham +0.5 Asian Handicap, +110, 1 unit

**Write Up:** Never back Manchester United when the matchup seems favorable for them. **The last time United strung 5 wins in a row was over two years ago** and I think West Ham have enough in their locker to stop them from repeating this feat.

Yes, *Manchester United are playing well at the moment* and there&#x27;s a sense of optimism in their ranks that hadn&#x27;t been felt in *(what feels like)* forever, but West Ham come into this game in great form themselves. **They&#x27;ve won 4 out of their last 5 games,** proving they&#x27;re going to be anything but a pushover. Their forwards seem to be in great form, with the always incredible **Bowen scoring 3 goals in the last 5 games against Man United,** while **Summerville&#x27;s scored in 5 games on the bounce in all competitions.** In contrast, while Manchester&#x27;s attack certainly isn&#x27;t looking too shabby at the moment, they still have **issues fitting the likes of Sesko into their system.** Here&#x27;s an even better stat though: **Manchester United have lost all of their last 3 games at West Ham&#x27;s ground.**

This <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> is essentially **West Ham to win or draw,** but my book offers slightly higher odds on the Asian handicap versus the +105 on the double chance. Do some line shopping and see the kind odds you can snatch. BOL and let&#x27;s enjoy some Premier League football on a Chewsday for whatever reason ☘️🫡</td></tr>

**Match:** [Cilic M.](https://www.flashscore.dk/spiller/cilic-marin/nLoK5syL/) vs [Tien L.](https://www.flashscore.dk/spiller/tien-learner/xUHOBJK6/)

**Bet:** [Tien L.](https://www.flashscore.dk/spiller/tien-learner/xUHOBJK6/) ML at odds 1.53

**Units:** 1 Units

**Explanation:**

Tien has really moved fast up the rankings and is currently number 23. He did well in Australia and lost to Zverev where he even took a set. Furthermore, Tien won against Cilic a couple of weeks ago. Now he is playing on home court in the US and I believe he will win this match as he is the favorite, he is an upcoming star player and he literally just won against Cilic.

Even though I am tempted to go for a 2-0 win, I am playing it a bit save here as we haven&#x27;t been too lucky with our 2-0 bets.

Good luck!

**Write Up:** Resumed first up in a really strong Highway race at Rosehill and completely bombed the start. Despite racing well back in the field, unleashed a high turn of foot to run third, beaten only just over a length. Has since gone back to the trials and coasted for an easy win.    
    
Draws barrier 3 here and provided we don’t blow the start again, should position in a beautiful spot leaders back or the 1-1. There isn’t much in terms of opposition here, so the only gamble is the start. If we are within a few lengths round the turn, should be way too good.</td></tr>

Outside of a couple good wins Frech had a poor last season going 15/25. Like most Czech players Vondrousova is very talented but constantly dealing with injuries. Despite playing a small schedule last year she won a WTA 500 and made the US Open quarter finals before withdrawing due to injury. If she is recovered after a few months rest I believe she will win in straight sets and improve to a 5 - 0 record vs Frech and perhaps has a little extra motivation to do well in Australia as she did not play here last year.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the day</mark> : Jalen Brunson Higher 28.5 Points (-120) 


Reason • :
The Knicks are coming off an &quot;embarrassing&quot; loss to the Hawks where they lost their dominant home record. Now, they face a Detroit team that is first in the East (26-9) but currently wounded. on the road stats is the clincher: Brunson has an 80% hit rate in Detroit, including a 40-point explosion in the playoffs.

Scenario A. The Captain’s Revenge
Brunson scores 15 in the first half to erase the memory of the Atlanta loss. He continues to exploit the Duren-less paint and finishes with 32 points to secure the road win.

Scenario B The Efficiency Boost
Detroit plays better defense than expected, but because they are on a back-to-back, Brunson draws fouls on their tired guards. He goes 10-for-12 from the free-throw line (similar to his Philly game) and clears 29 points through sheer volume.

Scenario C The Blowout (Low Risk)
The Knicks are so focused that they blow Detroit out by the 3rd quarter. Even in this case, Brunson is the engine of the lead—likely having 26+ points by the time the starters are pulled.

Scenario proof:

Scenario Proof:
 * The Injury Gap: Detroit is missing Jalen Duren (starting center) and Tobias Harris. Without Duren’s rim protection, there is no one to stop Brunson’s floater or drive.

 * The Close Game: With a -3 spread, the game is projected to be tight. Brunson is averaging 34.4 PPG over his last five games. In a close game, the ball stays in his hands for all 36+ minutes.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Leicester Vs West Brom - **BTTS @ 1.8 (Melbet)**

**Write Up:** Leicester welcome West Brom in a Championship match where both teams have been unpredictable. Leicester are currently 13th in the table, with West Brom close behind in 18th, just three points adrift. The Foxes have shown they can be dangerous going forward, but they’ve struggled to stay solid defensively. 

They’ve found the net in four of their last five games, including an impressive 3–1 win over Ipswich and a 2–1 victory against Derby. When Leicester play at a higher tempo, their attack looks sharp and confident. Defensively, Leicester are still struggling. Heavy losses to QPR and Sheffield United highlighted issues with spacing and organisation, and conceding in each of their last five games shows the lack of stability at the back.

At home, Leicester often push players forward, which helps them create chances but also leaves them exposed to pressure. They’ve scored 34 goals and conceded 34, showing how hard it has been to find balance. In fact, only four Championship teams have conceded more goals this season, and Leicester haven’t kept a clean sheet since their 0–0 draw with Coventry City.

West Brom’s recent form has been mixed rather than disastrous. Wins against QPR and Sheffield United showed they can stick to a disciplined game plan, but losses to Swansea and Hull City highlighted their ongoing struggles in attack. Three of their last five matches finished 1–0 or 2–1, showing how tight their games usually are.

Away from home, West Brom usually stay compact and keep things tight early on. They don’t often start games aggressively, but when they fall behind, their shape can open up. Having conceded 33 goals this season, they aren’t solid defensively, but their lack of goals often forces them to push forward late which is  a situation that plays into Leicester’s attacking approach at home.

BTTS has hit in Leicester’s last 8 matches, and it has landed in 9 of their last 10 and 16 of their last 20 games overall. Leicester matches regularly open up, especially with their attacking style and defensive issues. West Brom show a similar, though slightly less consistent, pattern. BTTS has landed in 7 of their last 10 games and 12 of their last 20. Even in past meetings between these two sides, both teams have scored in 3 recent encounters.

With Leicester’s attacking intent and ongoing defensive issues, I anticipate an open game here. West Brom’s tendency to stay compact before taking risks later on only adds to that pattern. All signs point toward a game where both sides are likely to find the net.

Event: NBA Suns at Rockets 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Rockets -7.5

Write Up: The Suns have a good record over the last games, but they&#x27;ve been beating up on mostly bad teams. This game is the 2nd night of a road back to back, while Houston is rested. Earlier this year they got smashed at home by Houston on the 2nd night of a back to back, and they got smashed again by Houston on the road even on 4 days rest. So I&#x27;m betting Houston would handle PHX even in normal circumstances, but on the 2nd night of a road back to back, PHX will struggle and not cover the 7.5.</td></tr>

Going back to the well here. We picked the Wild against the Ducks on the road and the Wild continue to win when Gustavvson is in, which he should be after getting the night off in their last game. He is 7-1 in his last 8 starts, with his last 2 wins being on the road. 

The Kings have been struggling a bit in their last 10 games. They’ve been rolling with Forsberg in goal until recently with Kuemper being back from injury. Kuemper gave up 5 and 4 goals respectively in his last 2 games. They might go back to Forsberg, who hasn’t been great when tasked with being the full time goalie. 

 The Kings are 6-9-4 at home this year while the Wild are 13-4-5 on the road. The goal differential on the season is +23 for the Wild and -4 for the Kings. The Wild should be favored here, but the odds are a pickem with a slight lean towards the Kings.

<tr><td class='post'>**POTD Record:** 6-23-3 *Another L on the board to make it 10 in a row. Safe to say I didn&#x27;t think Gonzalo would turn into prime R9 and bag a hattrick, including an outside of the box half volley (on a turn no less) and a backheel. Raul Asencio also seemingly just decided yesterday was the perfect day to score his first goal for Madrid. I thought Betis were fairly competitive in the second half, even hitting the post twice, but it just wasn&#x27;t meant to be. Just my luck. For some extra salt on the wound, Xabi subbed in Fran Garcia late in the game (in my write up, I criticised both his subs and his decision of pushing Fran Garcia into attack) and he immediately scored.

**Event:** AFCON, Egypt v Benin, 11:00 am EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Benin +1.0 Asian Handicap +105, 1 unit

**Write Up:** *We&#x27;re back at the tournament that arguably took my notorious run to another gear: the AFCON. The grass is always greener on the other side and I thought diving into other competitions would&#x27;ve been the play, but it turns out AFCON is still the source of my last win from over 10 picks ago.* <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> we&#x27;re back just in time to target the Benin game. On paper, Egypt look like heavy favourites but I&#x27;m more than positive that&#x27;s not how the game is going to actually play out <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> and I see immense value in giving Benin just a bit of a helping hand with a +1.0 Asian Handicap. While mainstream media frames Egypt as vastly superior, a deeper look at the numbers suggests Benin can keep this tight and stay within that +1 goal cushion.

Egypt’s recent defensive performances haven’t been nearly as convincing as their clean sheets would suggest. They conceded **16-18 shots** in their two group stage matches and only shut out opponents due to defensive circumstances. They were forced into defending for their lives after being a man down against South Africa and the other clean sheet came against a rotated Angola side. This suggests that Egypt&#x27;s defence can be breached, and isn&#x27;t as bulletproof as the reputation suggests.

Benin, meanwhile, have shown resilience and the ability to compete against technically superior teams through their sheer physicality and a structured defensive shape. While they failed to score against DR Congo and Senegal, they did beat Botswana in their **first-ever 90-minute win at AFCON finals** and were **competitive in matches where they were underdogs.** That resilience, coupled with smart defensive shape, means Benin aren’t a team that&#x27;s easily blown away. Not much to go off when it comes to H2H as these sides barely played each other, with the most recent result being a *2-0 win for Egypt in 2020, but the teams&#x27; levels were completely different back then and yet Egypt didn&#x27;t dominate that game too much.*

**Egypt were also knocked out in the round of 16 in the last tournament,** showing they&#x27;re more than capable of stumbling early, and there&#x27;s going to be serious pressure on them to deliver. Usually slightly dysfunctional teams crumble under such pressure and I believe Egypt could struggle <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Meanwhile Benin stunned Morocco on penalties at this stage in the AFCON 2019 and they&#x27;ll be looking to cause another upset facing another strong Northern African side. Another thing that works in Benin&#x27;s favor is **Trezeguet&#x27;s poor form as he&#x27;s yet to register a G/A** in this year&#x27;s tournament, while Mohamed Salah doesn&#x27;t seem to be back to his scary old self and the partnership with Omar Marmoush has been slightly less fruitful than most fans had anticipated. All in all, I definitely feel that **Benin +1.0 Asian Handicap** gives us some amazing odds for covering most results, barring a blowout, which feels highly unlikely in what should be a cautious, tight AFCON knockout affair. I feel a big game coming from Benin&#x27;s **Olaitan and Mounie who were involved in five goals during the AFCON qualifying,** with the wide attacker contributing two assists, highlighting his creative threat. I do like the BTTS Yes angle too, as well as the Under 3.5 goals angle, if you want to sprinkle some extra spice on this madness, but personally, I&#x27;m just sticking to the outlined <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. I&#x27;m very confident in this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, but I&#x27;m going into this with just a standard unit, as you can imagine I want to preserve the bankroll in these tough times, ahead of the fun upcoming games (particularly targeting the Spanish Supercup in a few days&#x27; time).

Kiryat Yam vs Nof Hagalil looks set up for goals, and over 2.5 is the right call. Both sides prefer open play and push numbers forward, often leaving spaces at the back. Recent performances show defensive lapses and good attacking intent on both ends.

Cobolli vs Rinderknech , United Cup 🎾🏆 9 pm ET 1/5/25

Record: 15-12
Net Units: +3.53 Units ✅

Explanation: I think Rinderknech is at a significant disadvantage in this matchup because Rinderknech historically has struggled more on hard courts. while Cobolli is historically better on hard courts with his clay court nature of being able to grind points out. It may sound silly the first time hearing it, but the type of court you’re playing on is a significant factor for tennis.

 Cobolli is one of the better returners , he’s at around 30% first-serve return points won and creates a nice amount of break looks (0.62 break chances per return game), so he’s solid at not letting big serves get past him.  

He’s been playing great and been on the come up, as of most recently . He’s arguably a top 25 player now, and that’s the right momentum to have coming into this matchup.</td></tr>

**Event**: English Premier League - Leicester City vs West Brom - 20:00 GMT+0

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>**: Leicester City DC and Over 1.5 @1.85 - 1u

**Write Up**: Leicester&#x27;s season has been shaped by how inconsistent they&#x27;ve been. After being relegated in horrible fashion last season, they still haven&#x27;t found their footing under Marti Cifuentes and you just can&#x27;t know what Leicester will show up. But the same could be said about West Brom under Ryan Mason. West Brom find themselves 18th in the league with scattergun performances. But what you can say for the Baggies is that their xP tells us they should have more points than they do, which isn&#x27;t the case for Leicester. But the negative for West Brom is their shocking away record. They&#x27;ve got 10/13 losses playing away this season making them the fourth worst in the league for this metric. And while Leicester&#x27;s home form isn&#x27;t particularly great, they have covered DC in 9/12 of their games. And this is why I&#x27;m ultimately landing on taking Leicester DC here as they have slightly higher value due to being the underdog. The other thing expected from Leicester other than them being shit is for goals to go in. They are very leaky and have covered the 1.5 line in 22/25 games. West Brom haven&#x27;t been so open but they do have good xG generating metrics so with Leicester being poor defensively, they could contribute to the score. 

**Additional Thoughts**: The City game was hard to take as they looked in control from the beginning and to throw it away like that was a bit maddening with just 2 minutes to play. I&#x27;m less sure about this one overall but I&#x27;m not to enthused by tomorrow&#x27;s games so I can only do my best.</td></tr>

We are looking at a Leicester whom are not too bad at home this season having a 5-4-3 record and a 17:14 goal diff. The outlier in this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> though is that we are counting on the consistency of West Brom, which is that they are bad on the road. Away from home West Brom rank 21th and are 3-0-10 but the bigger thing is that they have now lost 9 games in a row when traveling.

On the H2H side things are looking positively for Leicester as they dominate this fixture by 7-2-1 in the last 10 games against West Brom.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Fabian Marozsan vs Yibing Wu | **Wu to win first set at +110. 1 unit.**

Write-up: Yibing Wu is a player who displays an extremely high level when healthy, but simply can&#x27;t stay on the court for more than a few months at a time. This is his first time competing in Hong Kong, but there&#x27;s no doubt that Asian hard courts are where he plays some of his best tennis. The good thing for Wu is that he doesn&#x27;t come into this match completely cold, as he looked pretty fit in an exhibition match a couple of weeks ago. Nevertheless, it&#x27;s hard to predict how Wu will fare as the match drags on, which is why I decided to go with his first set ML here.

Meanwhile, Marozsan&#x27;s hard court results last year were punctuated by some really nice wins and some really rough losses. The Hungarian tends to strike the ball extremely flat, which means that he can beat nearly anyone when he&#x27;s finding lines, but can also lose to nearly anyone when he&#x27;s not. This makes it tough for me to price him as a favorite against someone who tends to rise to the level of his opponent. Don&#x27;t get me wrong: Wu likes to crush the ball as well, but I find that he plays with a degree of tactical intelligence that allows him to not hit himself off the court. Neither player has a world-beating serve, and so I expect this match to be decided from the baseline, where Wu should be able to garner some crowd support and get off to a hot start. As I said, I feel that Wu should easily have enough in the tank for one good set; after that, I&#x27;m not sure, which is why I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the ML at slightly better odds.</td></tr>

**Write Up:** What an ending to the City-Chelsea game. Our guy Enzo came through for us again with a clutch stoppage time goal to level the score and secure Chelsea a point. He actually landed 2 SOTs in that one play, as his first shot was saved. Gotta love a big play late in the game, what a sweat, but moments like this are why soccer can be so much fun to watch. 

Day off for the Premier League <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, so we&#x27;re giving the Championship a try as Leicester host West Brom in a mid table battle. Leicester have underperformed this season, especially after being relegated from the Premier League at the end of last season. They just haven&#x27;t quite clicked. West Brom have fairly well become furniture in the middle of the Championship table, after their latest promotion and immediate relegation back in 2020. They are also in terrible away form, losing their last 9 away matches. 

Jordan James is a 21 year old midfielder playing his first season in English football on loan from France. He is a true midfielder, so he does not take a ton of shots. The shots he does take though he makes count. He is currently Leicester&#x27;s leading Goalscorer with 8 goals in 20 appearances. He is also in the form of his young life, **scoring a goal in each of his last 3 matches**. This play is more about current form than about overall year stats, as he goes through good and bad shooting form spells. 

James actually plays a fairly similar role and position to Enzo Fernandez, with a little less box crashing with headers and more finding space in the center of the box and shooting. I love the odds we&#x27;re getting on this for the form the lad is in. As always, **please mind the lineups before going to heavy on this**. He has started and played most of 20/21 games he has been fit for this season (the only game he didnt start was the first match of the season), but you never know when a coach may get cheeky with lineups.

NIGERIA VS MOZAMBIQUE

Date: 05 JANUARY 2026 at 20:00

BET ON: Over / Under team Corners- NIGERIA Over +5.50

Odd: 1.72



\- Nigeria Over 5.5 Corners is strongly supported by the tactical and motivational context of this matchup. Eric Chelle has repeatedly stressed in Nigerian and French-language AFCON press briefings that his team’s identity is built around front-foot football, sustained pressure and wide attacking play, regardless of the opponent. Nigeria’s tournament games back this up: with Osimhen, Lookman and Chukwueze constantly attacking the box, the Super Eagles spend long spells in the final third, forcing deep defensive blocks and generating repeated wide deliveries and second-ball situations — a consistent recipe for corners rather than clean open-play finishes. The lack of injuries in the squad allows Chelle to maintain high intensity and aggressive wing usage for 90 minutes, while Mozambique arrive weakened defensively, missing both starting centre-backs Diogo Calila and Nené, which African tactical previews highlight as a major blow against aerial pressure and overlapping full-backs. Mozambique are expected to defend extremely deep and narrow to survive, inviting crosses and sustained pressure rather than engaging higher up the pitch. With Nigeria highly motivated to assert dominance early in a knockout match and structurally set up to attack from the flanks, the game script strongly points toward sustained pressure and a healthy Nigeria corner count rather than a low-tempo, possession-sharing contest.</td></tr>

**Recap:** 

Fulham scored a quick goal and even managed a draw after an amazing last minute goal 

Man City had a devastating last minute equaliser but Chelsea had an extremely good second half and it was, sadly, deserved but unlucky for me 

**Write Up:** 

Egypt has looked better than their results show in my opinion 

First game dominating Zimbabwe but needing a late game winner from Salah. Second game getting an early lead and having to cling on due to a red card right before halftime. Final group stage game getting a draw while resting key players 

I expect them to win here and I think they will want to gain some confidence going into the final stage of AFCON 

Benin lost twice versus Senegal and DR Congo. They did manage a narrow win versus Botswana. Botswana themselves have been extremely out of form in 2025 so a win against them doesn&#x27;t say much 

Egypt have the star players, better form and something to prove

BOL everyone!</td></tr>

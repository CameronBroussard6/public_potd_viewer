**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:**  6. DAMONS ON A BENDER $2.25                 
**Write Up:** Alrightyyy <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today’s pick</mark> DAMONS ON A BENDER is second up here off what could possibly be one of the worst rides I’ve ever seen in its debut. On that occasion, the horse jumped well from the inside barrier but was literally choked and restrained all the way to second last, game over from there. <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> we again draw barrier one but swap that inept jockey for A Bullock, the king of country NSW, and provided we jump well (missed the start in its first trial but has been good in next 2 subsequent trials/races) I cannot imagine a world that we aren’t in the top 4 in the run.    
    
The way we finished off last start indicates ability and the market support suggested the horse was going to get to a decent level, so I’m hoping the position in run will yield a different result.    
    
In terms of opposition there isn’t too much on exposed form. The second favourite will likely come across and lead from the outside barrier, but that’s easier said than done and automatically assuming it gets across without burning much petrol is wishful thinking. The 12 poses some intrigue, but I haven’t seen much gate speed from it in any of its starts, and don’t think Taree is a track you won’t to get too far back on, plus I think it’s looking for a lot further.    
    
This is definitely my least confident <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, due to the class of horse being low, and thus reliability isn’t the greatest, however I’m still confident enough to post it as a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>.

Last Pick: Hubert Hurkacz +0.5 games vs Taylor Fritz (-110, 1 unit) ✅

Tennis | ATP Adelaide | 6:00 PM EST (estimated)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard vs Roberto Bautista Agut | **Bautista Agut +2.5 games at -118 (FD). 1 unit.**

Write-up: Nice win for Hurkacz, who missed some opportunities on return but played quite well in both tiebreaks. 

Interesting match between the big serving Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard and veteran Spaniard Roberto Bautista Agut in Auckland. Mpetshi Perricard won two matches last week in Brisbane, but actually didn&#x27;t cover this handicap in either of them, as he broke serve just two times all week. The huge gulf between Perricard&#x27;s serve and the rest of this game means that many of the sets he plays go to tiebreaks, and many of his matches turn into a &quot;coin flip&quot; of sorts dependent on a few key points. On the other side of the net, Bautista Agut isn&#x27;t any kind of power server, but he makes his first serves at a respectable 66.5% clip, which decreases the amount of variance in his service game. This isn&#x27;t good for Perricard, who relies on aggressive returning and stringing together a few low-margin shots to even have a chance to break. Another point to mention is that this is one of the windiest events on tour, with winds up to 13 mph expected tomorrow, and I could see this throwing off Perricard&#x27;s best weapon enough to get RBA into some rallies. Auckland is also the fourth-slowest hard-court event on tour (according to Tennis Abstract, based on 2024 data), which further dampens the effectiveness of the serve. In terms of the baseline rallies, RBA&#x27;s groundstrokes are a bit old-school, as he prefers to take them early and flat, but without taking great risks in shot selection. I expect this to pose significant problems for the 2.0m-tall Perricard, who tends to struggle significantly with lower-bouncing balls. 

There is one big question mark in this matchup, which is that RBA has been out since last year&#x27;s US Open with a right leg injury, and actually withdrew from Brisbane last week. However, I feel that we&#x27;re getting a slight discount on his odds as a result. I&#x27;m banking on two things here: I don&#x27;t expect this to be a super physical matchup, and I don&#x27;t see RBA trying to play through injury at 37 years old. If he turns up on court, I expect him to be fit, and I see his efforts being enough to keep this one close on the scoreboard.</td></tr>

Last Pick: Dawson Knox over 20.5 yards receiving. Nice win, I did sweat a bit though. 


Event: Texans @ Steelers 


<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: CJ Stroud under 33.5 pass attempts 


Write Up: I really wanted to fade the Kings on the 2nd night of their back to back, but it&#x27;s playoff season, so I&#x27;ll stick to the NFL. 


CJ Stroud has only gone over 33 completions 4 times this year. In those 4 games, Houston had some of their worst performances, losing twice and almost losing to the lowly Colts and Raiders. Stroud is just not an elite passer, and I don&#x27;t think the game script for a playoff game is to go pass heavy with Stroud. 


Now, Pittsburgh allows an average of 36 attempts per game this year, which is probably why Stroud&#x27;s attempts total is so high. However, in the last 5games,that average has come down to 31. 


Lasly, Pittsburgh allows an almost league worst 65 plays per game. However, in the last 5, that number has fallen to 57. The offense playing better and the defense getting off the field more has helped. 


With the Steelers passing attempts allowed trending down and plays allowed trending down, and Houston performing badly when they rely on a ton of passing attempts from Stroud I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll see Stroud slinging is around all day. 


I also think Houston will be the better team and have the lead, so they&#x27;ll be running it more later in the game. </td></tr>

Huge W for us. Also an amazing game to watch, onto the next. 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: Houston Texans vs Pittsburgh Steelers/ Texans ML (-155) 4u

Write up: Here I think is the end for Rodgers and the Steelers season. Typically I don’t love road playoff games but this one feels good. The Texans don’t thrive depending on the crowd. Defense travels. Especially when we have an immobile qb against a very disruptive defensive line and a skilled secondary. The offense doesn’t need to be great in order for Houston to win. As long as Houston controls their turnovers they should control this entire game. I’m staying away from the spread in fear of a slugfest. I think this is tremendous value considering what we saw Houston do to the Chargers a few weeks back. Who I’ll add is a much better team than the steelers. Moneyline feels safe and I’m willing to back arguably the hottest team in football. I also feel like this team will be playing with a huge chip on their shoulder in an attempt to solidify themselves as a legitimate team moving forward. Thanks to those who have been tailing and if you’re new to tailing me drop a comment! Thanks everyone, let’s have a good week.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Al-Hilal Vs Al-Nassr - **Over 3.5 Total Goals @ 1.87 (Melbet)**

**Write Up:** Al Hilal and Al Nassr face off in a massive Pro League clash that could have a big say in the title race. Both teams are among the league’s strongest attacking sides, but recent form clearly favours Al Hilal. Al Hilal come into the match unbeaten after 13 league games and show no signs of slowing down. They’ve won five straight matches in all competitions, doing so with control and confidence rather than relying on chaos. Comfortable home wins against Al Hazm and Al Khaleej brought six goals, while away victories over Damac and Al Kholood showed they can manage games efficiently.

Defensively, Al Hilal are one of the most dependable teams in the league. They’ve conceded only 12 goals all season and have kept clean sheets in three of their last five matches. Even when games become more open, like the 3–2 win over Al Khaleej, they tend to respond quickly and regain control. At home, Al Hilal are consistently dangerous going forward. They’ve scored at least three goals in two of their last three home games, showing how effective they are at breaking teams down once sustained pressure kicks in.

Like Al Hilal, Al Nassr are one of the league’s most dangerous attacking teams, having scored 38 goals so far this season. However, recent results suggest their defensive control is slipping. They’ve conceded seven goals in their last three league matches, including losses to Al Qadsiah and Al Ahli.

Away from home, Al Nassr have found it harder to manage games. Defeats at Al Ahli and earlier at Al Taawoun stand in contrast to their more comfortable home performances. Even the 2–2 draw against Al Ettifaq followed a familiar pattern, where they struggled to hold on after taking the lead.

Both teams have scored at least once in every league match this season, home or away. Al Hilal are 22 from 22, while Al Nassr are 23 from 23, which speaks volumes about their attacking consistency. I like the over 3.5 goals line in this match. While it’s a higher threshold, this is a huge derby between two attacking powerhouses, and the importance of the fixture often leads to open, intense games. Together, they’ve already scored 73 league goals, and recent matches on both sides have regularly gone beyond the three-goal mark.

Gainwell has had a hard time getting to this number throughout the year. He’s been really involved in the pass game, but he doesn’t get a ton of carries. His rush attempts line is at 7.5 and with the game script, I could see that going under as well.

This Houston team held JT to 14 for 26 and Omarion Hampton to 14 for 29 in their last 2 games. This defense has been a top defense against the run this season.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: **Boston-Indiana U223.5 (-105 FanDuel) 1U**

Event: NBA | Celtics @ Pacers (7:30 pm EST) | 🏀

*Recap: 14 points in the first half, 12 in the second - 9-for-10 from the floor - and tack on seven assists for good measure. Everything went right for Black. The Magic even rallied in the fourth for a win over the banged up, visiting ...checks notes... New Orleans Pelicans!? Yikes, Orlando. Note to self: Take scoring point guards against New Orleans.*

Two caveats before we begin. First, I saw the Utah-Cleveland line open at 250.5 and I wanted to take the under for my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> just for the sheer audacity of it. This is the second-highest line of the season, tying Indiana-Denver on Nov. 24. That game finished over by 1.5 points. The highest over/under this season belongs to Utah-Atlanta with 252.5 on Dec. 12 - it went under by 10 points. Instead, I&#x27;ll put a personal side bet on the under because... why the hell not? I don&#x27;t think Utah gets run roughshod two games in a row, especially with Markkanen back in the lineup.

Second, I am jumping on the Boston-Indiana line early with an under play that hangs much hope on Jaylen Brown *not* playing. As of this writing, he&#x27;s listed as doubtful with lower back spasms. Goodness knows Boston (24-14) *shouldn&#x27;t* need Brown on the road against an Indiana (8-31) team that just set a franchise record for most consecutive losses. The Pacers have since broken the streak, so there&#x27;s not the same sense of professional urgency to step up and stop the losing.

Here&#x27;s why I think Brown could/should rest. He just logged a season-high 43 minutes in a loss to San Antonio on Saturday, and played 36 minutes the night before in an important win over Toronto. Even if he doesn&#x27;t sit outright, I could see his minutes getting restricted. He&#x27;s already 22nd in the league in minutes per game (34.3) and second in in usage rate (35.9 percent). The last game he missed was Dec. 20 for illness. Before that, it was Dec. 3 - again, for illness. He&#x27;s played all 10 Celtic games since Dec. 20, including the aforementioned back-to-back. Dude needs a rest, and the Celtics don&#x27;t need him to put down a hapless Pacers squad. The moment he&#x27;s confirmed out, I suspect the line will drop.

Whether or not Brown goes, Boston already plays the slowest pace in the league. *If* Brown is out, I would expect Mazzulla to lean even harder on their half-court identity and grinding style - fewer offensive possessions and no star player sucking up all the gravity. Mazzulla might also see it as an opportunity to flex as a defensive unit. You can take the player out of West Virginia, but you can&#x27;t take the West Virginia out of the player. It&#x27;s something they&#x27;ll want to keep finetuning in the run-up to playoffs. And even *with* Brown playing, Boston just suffered a season-low 95 points in Saturday&#x27;s loss to the Spurs. Boston does rank second in offensive rating and that gives me pause, but ... ... ... *gestures hopefully at Brown sitting.* Know where else Boston ranks second? Opponents&#x27; scoring average. The Celtics are giving up just 110.4 points per game. Now, I&#x27;m pretty dumb in most regards but I can do math: 110.4 + Indiana&#x27;s 111.2 average = not over 223.5.

The under has hit in four of the last five games for Indiana, and three of the last five for Boston. Both sides have been dead under teams all year: Boston is 21-17 to the under and Indiana is 24-15. If you&#x27;ll allow me to cherry <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> some more stats: Indiana is 28th in scoring, 30th in field goal percentage, and 29th in offensive rating. Remarkably. the Pacers play at a high ...wait for it... pace, where they are ninth in the Association. To wit, Indiana point guard Andrew Nembhard has had an incredible run of recent play, including a 29 point, nine assist, six rebound outburst in a win over Miami on Sunday. But he *did* miss Indiana&#x27;s game prior to that, and is he&#x27;s listed as a questionable with lower back soreness for Monday. If Nembhard can&#x27;t go, Indiana might not break 90. I mean it. Indiana remains without their second-leading scorer (Benedict Mathurin - out since Jan. 2), hence the uptick in Nembhard&#x27;s value. But Boston ranks third in stopping opposing point guards in both points AND assists. Even if Nembhard plays, I believe he&#x27;s going to have a tough time doing anything. *Quick aside:* two of my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> wins have been Nembhard O25.5 points and assists. If he gets that number again, or higher, I would consider sprinkling on the under - despite how good he&#x27;s been lately.

I think I know why this number is as high as it is despite the injury news. The teams played a 140-122 game in Indiana on Dec. 26. Brown had his usual 30, and Nembhard and Mathurin both played. But it took an outlier shooting night for Indiana to get there. Furthermore, four days before that, these teams played a 103-95 game in Boston. Brown got his typical 31, and Nembhard and Mathurin both played. I think Monday&#x27;s matchup will look more like the latter than the former. I especially think Boston will see it as team defense practice for going up against much, much better teams. In fact, Boston might already be looking ahead to Thursday&#x27;s game in Miami, where they will play another high-paced team (but one that can actually shoot and score).

Good luck and Godspeed!</td></tr>

**Write Up:** Coming off a &quot;hero&quot; performance in Week 18, where he saw a season-high **7 targets** and hauled in 3 catches (including the game-winner), Austin has clearly earned the trust of Aaron Rodgers in high-leverage moments. Even with DK Metcalf returning to the lineup, Austin remains the primary deep threat and &quot;gadget&quot; receiver, often targeted on low-risk screens and quick slants designed to utilize his elite 4.30 speed. Since the Texans&#x27; defense is known for a ferocious pass rush that forces quarterbacks to get the ball out quickly, Austin serves as a natural &quot;safety valve.&quot; Requiring only two catches to clear the line—a mark he has met or exceeded in nearly half of his games this year—the high-volume environment of a playoff game script makes this one of the most attainable props on the board. This is also at plus money right now which seems crazy to me.

**Event:** Saudi Pro League, Al Hilal v Al-Nassr, 12:30 pm EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Al-Nassr DNB, +120, 1 unit

**Write Up:** Al Hilal&#x27;s form looks downright scary, but if there&#x27;s one team that can break their 18 match winning streak, it&#x27;s Al-Nassr. This matchup is huge because an Al Hilal win could see them run away with the league and Ronaldo and Co. just aren&#x27;t going to let that happen. **The last H2H also ended with a huge Al-Nassr win** and I think <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>&#x27;s just the day the Al-Nassr team properly turns up and gets the job done. Their form hasn&#x27;t been stellar, but these players are always capable of delivering and I think their attack is going to click, and we just have to hope the defence finally shows up for once. Al-Nassr have had troubles breaking down more defensive sides, even struggling against teams down to 10-men at times, but there are **no worries about Al Hilal sitting back,** as both teams are going to try and fully go for the win. In the light of that, the BTTS Yes and Over 2.5 goals look good to me too, if you want to dabble with those. Going in with just the one standard unit after being burnt by Barca.

Bournemouth u21 vs Charlton u21, over 4.5 goals @ 2.6

Bournemouth U21 vs Charlton U21 looks set for a high-scoring clash, with over 4.5 goals the standout <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. Both sides play open, attacking football and U21 matches often bring defensive mistakes. Bournemouth U21 score freely at home, while Charlton U21 tend to concede but also contribute goals themselves. Expect a fast tempo, end-to-end chances, and plenty of goals throughout the match.</td></tr>

Last Pick: Parker Washington Over 51.5 Rec Yards ✅

NFL | Texans v Steelers 8:15pm EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Kenneth Gainwell Over 30.5 Rec Yards | Odds: 1.9

Write-Up:

Almost looked like we were cooked at halftime, but Washington gets it done with ease in the second half.

Gainwell has been red hot of late, coming off receiving games of 64 / 12 / 78 / 46. More importantly, he has been the main receiving threat in 3 of the last 4 games, either leading the team in yards, receptions, or both. Target share has also been promising, with 7+ targets in 4 of the last 5. Game script should be in our favour.

As always, Book it and see you Monday for another winner.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s Event:** England FA Cup (Soccer) | Liverpool vs Barnsley (11:45 AM PST)

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Liverpool -2.5 Spread (-110) 1.1 units to win 1 unit

**Write Up:** Last match of the 3rd round of the FA Cup as Liverpool host Barnsley, the 17th place side in England&#x27;s 3rd division. There are 57 teams between these two in the hierarchy of English football. All signs point towards this being a bloodbath in favor of Liverpool. 

We&#x27;re getting good odds for this because Liverpool have had trouble scoring goals in recent weeks and it is likely Liverpool do not llay their full first team. But with the week off after this match and being in front of the home crowd, I&#x27;m expecting a similar setup to City (who won 10-1 against their 3rd tier team) where they play many of their first team players to start the match, then sub them off at halftime or in the 2nd half once they have a comfortable lead. We are banking on Liverpool coming out offensively and going for goals, rather than sitting on a small lead. For reference, last year Liverpool won 4-0 in this round of the FA Cup, and I&#x27;m predicting a similar scoreline here. 

BOL let&#x27;s start the week strong!</td></tr>

Both of these arabian juggernauts have the squad (and the money) to compete in any of the big european soccer leagues. Where old washed up players go to cash out big checks and score crazy ass goals in front of empty stadiums. I am going to make this easy.

BTTS has hit for these teams their L6/6, and Al Hilal has won 18 STRAIGHT games (crazy) and has not lost in the past 25 games. Their last loss was in july, crazy.

So just basically need Al Nassr to kick one in and Al Hilal to do what they have been doing since july.

__Event:__ NFL: Texans @ Steelers 8:15pm EST

__POTD:__ Aaron Rodgers o20.5 completions (-105), 4.2u to win 4u

__Write Up:__ The Wild Card Round finished up on Monday night as the hottest team in football, the Houston Texans (12-5), head to Pittsburgh to take on the Steelers (10-7). After losing their first 3 games of the season, &amp; ending up at a 3-5 record after 8 games, the Texans went on to win 9 games in a row to close the season, longest active winning streak in the NFL. Houston is just the 7th team in NFL history to make the playoffs after starting a season 0-3. Their winning streak started with a 36-29 comeback victory over the Jaguars, and it was actually Davis Mills that got Houston across the finish line there. However, things went to another level when C.J. Stroud returned in Week 13. Houston had a Dropback EPA per play of 0.142 from Week 13 on, ranking 9th in the NFL. This led to now the 3rd season in a row that Texans QB C.J. Stroud &amp; head coach DeMeco Ryans have won 10+ games. The Steelers on the other hand, barely made into the playoffs winning 4 of their last 5 games. The Pittsburgh offense is on its best stretch of the season. They have averaged 23 points in their last 5 games &amp; have scored 26+ in 4 of their last 5 games, including 26 points last week. After losing to the then 4-12 Cleveland Browns Week 17 in what should’ve been a must win game, they then went on to beat the Ravens in the last week of the regular season after the rookie Ravens kicker missed a FG, putting Pittsburgh Steelers in the playoffs for the 13th time in Mike Tomlin’s 19 seasons &amp; saving his job. In a game with 2 good defenses &amp; not extremely explosive offenses, this one has the lowest game total of the Wild Card Round. Pittsburgh averaged 10.6 plays of 10+ yards per game (27th). Houston averaged 11.2 per game (24th). Houston ranked 28th in offensive success rate (38.8%), the lowest of any team in the postseason. Pittsburgh ranked 20th (41.1%). The Steelers have scored 101 points off turnovers (3rd) while Houston has scored 90 (4th). A Steelers streak will be ending on Monday night, Pittsburgh will get their 1st playoff win since 2016, or they will have their 1st loss in Pittsburgh on Monday night in 35 years. Pittsburgh’s 6 consecutive playoff losses is the longest active streak in the NFL. The only way they’re going to have a shot at winning this one will be an high performance game by their 42 year old QB.

Steelers QB Aaron Rodgers is making his first playoff start since 2021. He ranks 4th all time in career playoff yards (5,894) &amp; 3rd all time in career playoff TD’s (45). Rodgers comes into this game throwing the football more than he has all season. Rodgers finished the year by throwing for 247.2 yards per game over the last 5 games after averaging 189.6 yards per game before that. His 3 highest yardage totals came in that span. In the Steelers last 3 games, he threw the ball 39+ times, the most he had thrown before those games was 36 back in October. __Rodgers now has 5 games in a row with 21+ completions, averaging 25 completions in his last 5.__ Last week in a must win game vs the Ravens, Rodgers threw 47 times &amp; completed 31 passes. Rodgers finished with 21+ completions in 10 of 16. The way he is able to rack up so many completions is his extremely fast time to throw. __Rodgers time to throw on average is 2.56 seconds, fastest in the NFL amongst all 36 QB’s with 250 dropbacks. 56.4% of his passes have come within 2.5 seconds of the snap, the highest rate in the league.__ All of his passes have been short quick throws. 22.9% of his attempts are behind the line of scrimmage &amp; 45% are between 0-9 yards downfield. He is averaging just 6.7 yards per pass. __On top of that the Texans defense primarily runs use Cover 3 coverage. Rodgers has a 67.7% completion percentage, completing 90 of 133 passes vs Cover 3 this season. Also, when facing QB’s that get the ball out in less than 2.56 seconds, Houston has allowed a 69.2% completion percentage for 1,777 yards, 6.2 yards per pass, 12 TD’s, &amp; 4 INT’s this season.__ When opponents have held the ball longer, Houston allowed just a 47.7% completion rate (3rd) &amp; 6.9 yards per attempt (4th). Houston has been elite at getting after the QB this season ranking 4th in the NFL in pressure rate (40.7%). Rodgers quick pass style &amp; the Steelers OL have led to the Steelers allowing the lowest pressure rate in the league at just 25% &amp; lowest now blitz pressure rate at 25.4%. On top of that the Steelers have passed on 58.81% of plays this year, 8th most. While Texans opponents have passed on 59.39% of plays, 8th most. The Texans rank 4th in the NFL in rushing yards allowed per game at just 93.7. They rank 3rd in the NFL in Rush EPA per play allowed (-0.124 The Steelers are going to look get Rodgers going in this one. Especially with star WR DK Metcalf back from injury after decking a fan. __The Texans have allowed 21+ in 3 of their last 4 games &amp; 2 of those QB’s were Riley Leonard &amp; Jacoby Brissett.__ With the Texans having one of the best secondary’s in the league, all signs point to Rodgers peppering his WR’s at close range &amp; dumping it off to RB’s.

The 42 year old QB gets us back in the green.

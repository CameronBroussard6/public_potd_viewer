PSG reasoning: have only lost one of last 6 against premier league opponents. They are the top scorers in the UCL, and while spurs in unbeaten in the UCL, I see PSG getting it done at home <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. 

Liverpool BTTS reasoning: Liverpool have kept only two clean sheets in their last 14 matches and they have conceded exactly three goals in four of their last six fixtures. We’ve all seen this is not the Liverpool we expected this year, with goals absolutely floodinggg

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Olympiacos vs Real Madrid. Real Madrid -1 (-108)

Madrid have scored 12 goals in their last 4 UCL games, with Kylian Mbappé leading the charge at 19 goals across all competitions (including 5 in Europe). Vinícius Júnior (8G+7A) and Jude Bellingham add 15 combined contributions—enough to break down any low block.

Recent form: 3 straight La Liga wins (9-1 aggregate) post-Anfield loss, showing resilience. Xabi Alonso&#x27;s side averages 2.1 xG per UCL away game, and Olympiacos have conceded 1.5+ xG in 3 of 4 home European matches.

The Greek champs sit 31st with 2 points (2 draws, 2 losses), scoring only 2 goals total in the league phase—none from open play at home. Ayoub El Kaabi (7 goals domestically) is isolated up top, and they&#x27;ve failed to score in 2 of 4 UCL outings.

Home form is solid domestically (unbeaten in 9 European homes overall), but against elite attacks? Vulnerable: 1-1 vs. PSV, 0-2 vs. Atalanta. Expect Madrid&#x27;s press to starve their counters.</td></tr>

Write Up: Harvard is top 70 in eFG% at 56.2% they’re  shooting the ball very efficiently this season. They’re also top 80 in fg % shooting the ball well so far this year. Harvard does have some sloppy stretches of basketball which worries me but I think they keep this one close <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. As for boston college they are one of the worst shooting teams statistically this season. They’re also top rank 357th from beyond the arc at a 26.5% shooting clip. If Harvard can get hot, this one can go the other way pretty fast. Harvard has the better offense by a mile here and I see this one being much closer than anticipated. Boston college does out rebound Harvard offensively but I think they are just too inefficient shooting the ball to cover this one. Back Harvard with the number.</td></tr>

And at the time I made the bet a little earlier this morning, it was plus money, so it seemed like a no-brainer to me to put a unit on it.

**Write Up:** KAT has hit this line in 6 of his last 8 games, falling 1 rebound short of this line against the Heat on Friday, 11/14. Throughout the seasons so far, Towns is averaging 12.4 rebounds per game. The Charlotte Hornets this season have done a fine job of defending the center position overall. However, the place where they lack the most is in rebounding. The Hornets struggle to keep big centers from getting rebounds. While I have chosen this line, it would not surprise me to see Towns walk out of this game with 14 or more boards.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Kel&#x27;el Ware o11.5 Rebounds (-111), 5 units

**Write Up:** Fun night for the NBA. Two rematches 2025 playoffs--Thunder vs Timberwolves and Houston vs GSW. I found a lot of things that I like tonight (Curry 3s, KAT reb &amp; Brunson points, Sengun on anything, Jalen Duren P+R...) but it was really hard for me to decide on the single best <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> to keep the streak alive. Ultimately, we are going with Kel&#x27;el Ware on rebounds. Once again I don&#x27;t fully understand his lines here given recent form (18, 16, 14, 16, 14, 10, 13, 20, 12, 6). He&#x27;s averaging 11 on the season, but 13.9 in his last 10. The Miami Heat are a lower FG% shooting team, and the spurs are bottom 8 team in defensive rebounds, especially without Giannis. (he&#x27;s been upgraded to questionable, but probably on minutes even if he plays). This should create a few more opportunities for Kel&#x27;el, who should get some good minutes with all of Miami&#x27;s injuries. Foul risk is lower here too, bucks being a bottom 4 team for opponent fouls. The Heat also just play better @ home. 

**Take Kel&#x27;el Ware over 11.5 Rebounds.**

Let&#x27;s have a great Thanksgiving eve! Cheers everyone!

Todays <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: **Liverpool vs PSV BTTS &amp; u5.5 goals in match @ 2.10**

**My bet**: https://imgur.com/a/B5vfmMN

Writeup: Liverpool’s 3-0 defeat to Nottingham Forest on Saturday was another setback in a miserable run for Arne Slot’s side. It came only two weeks after the 3-0 loss to Manchester City and has left the Reds sitting 12th in the Premier League after 12 games.

Defensively they look lost. Even Alisson’s return could not stop them conceding three goals in back to back league games for the first time since 1965. Virgil van Dijk is surrounded by uncertainty as Ibrahima Konate’s contract situation drags on, Milos Kerkez is still adjusting, and Trent Alexander Arnold’s move to Real Madrid has left a hole that has not been filled. Dominik Szoboszlai has even been forced to play right back at times, weakening the midfield further.

Up front things are not much better. Mohamed Salah looks far from the player who finished fourth in the last Ballon d’Or voting, Alexander Isak has not yet clicked, Hugo Ekitike is still finding his rhythm, and Florian Wirtz is taking time to adapt to English football. The result is a title defence that already looks finished unless something dramatic changes.

Europe has offered some relief and Liverpool arrive in good shape in the Champions League with three wins from four. PSV will still view this as a rare chance to take something at Anfield. They are unbeaten in 11 games across all competitions and although their European results are mixed, they have scored nine and conceded seven in their first four matches. Their high risk style under Peter Bosz means they almost always create chances, but they also allow plenty.

The Dutch champions claimed two away 1-1 draws at Bayer Leverkusen and Olympiacos after losing their opener, while a convincing 6-2 win over Napoli showed their attacking threat. They sit 18th in the league phase table but remain vulnerable to slipping down with several teams close behind.

PSV’s record away to English clubs is poor, but given Liverpool’s current frailties this feels like one of their best openings in years. The matchup points strongly toward both sides finding the net. Liverpool concede in almost every game right now and PSV’s front line is playing with confidence, while the Dutch side’s open approach usually leaves space for the opponent.

At the same time it is unlikely to become a complete shootout. Liverpool’s attack is struggling for fluency and PSV tend to play more controlled football in big European away games. Their recent scores suggest something in the range of 1-1, 2-1 or 2-2 is far more realistic than anything approaching six total goals.

That makes BTTS and Under 5.5 goals a strong angle for this contest.</td></tr>

Gonzaga’s 125.2 adjusted offensive efficiency compared to Michigans 121.0 just covers Michigans slighter 2.0 edge in adjusted defensive efficiency.

**Event:** UCL Olympiacos v Real Madrid, 3:00 pm EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Real Madrid ML -156, 3.5 units

**Write Up:** Taking a break from all the underdog madness, I&#x27;m going for something that should *(at least in theory)* be a pretty safe bet. Yes, Real Madrid doesn&#x27;t look too good at the moment, but I back them to get it done against a weaker side in Olympiacos. The poor results that Madrid has seen in the last three games have come **against an inspired Liverpool, a bogey team in Rayo Vallecano whom Real Madrid hasn&#x27;t beaten at their ground in over three years, and Elche, who are known for harnessing a high intensity, high possession gameplay** (they&#x27;re the team with the 3rd highest posession average per LaLiga game, right after Barcelona and Real Madrid) - *I had predicted the Elche draw in the SoccerBetting sub, I&#x27;m not someone who just blindly backs the favorites*. Anyway, this has resulted in a **pretty tasty ML for Real Madrid** (-156 or @ 1.64), which is imo, **slightly** **inflated**. Tonight&#x27;s UCL match is a **redemption arc for Madrid**, and they&#x27;ll be looking to kill Olympiacos nice and early, and I fully back them to do it with 3.5 units staked. The match holds **extra importance** to les Merengues, as a win would give them a **fighting chance of securing a top 8 finish**, ahead of some tougher matchups. It&#x27;s not going to be an easy match by any stretch of the imagination, but one that Real Madrid is very capable of winning - the **quality is just there**.

# Real Madrid to Win vs Olympiakos

Madrid haven’t been perfect **1 loss, 2 wins, 2 draws in their last fivem** but even when they’re not at their best, they still usually manage to outclass teams like Olympiakos. Olympiakos tend to struggle against sides with higher tempo and technical quality, so even this slightly wobbly Madrid should have enough to take it. 

# PSG to Win vs Spurs

PSG are creating chances and finishing them, which is a refreshing concept. Spurs on the other hand have been doing their best impression of a team that forgot how defending works. PSG’s attack should be enough here, especially with the better momentum and fewer identity crises.

# Note

We’re down **10 units**, which wasn’t part of the plan, but here we are. So <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> we’re rolling with two teams that actually look like they know what they’re doing instead of anything that might trigger emotional damage.

Write-Up: Cleared this easily in his first 5 games this year (29, 35, 51, 29, 30) before injury stopped his output. Has still cleared it in 2 of his last 3 on restricted minutes - a solid couple days rest since the Clippers game and now nearly 2 weeks returned means his minutes should go up. 

I like this play v Brunson. Never quite sure whether the PG’s against him will score heavy points or assists so I like to play both. Suggs cleared his line easily last game, and the likes of Russell, Davion Mitchell &amp; Giddey have gone over their lines recently too.

NBA | Pacers @ Raptors  
  
Raptors are up against the Pacers, who have the league&#x27;s lowest FG%. In addition, they have a fast-paced gameplay style. So, I expect them to miss alot and alot more rebound opportunities.  
In NBA, I am more comfortable taking rebound prop when player usage is at its peak. Without RJ Barrett, Scottie will be the key player for the team and hence, have more rebound opportunities along with the usage. Very small sample size, but in the last game, he had 38 minutes against the Cavaliers and 11 rebounds, so the line 7.5 feels very safe. I personally expect him to double double but that&#x27;s just me. GL 🍀.

Play of the Day:

Basketball | NBA | 27 Nov, 02:00 AM SAST

Karl-Anthony Towns (Knicks) Over 2.5 Assist @ 1.78(-128) 1 Unit



Write-Up:

I’m really liking Karl-Anthony Towns to go over 2.5 assist vs the Hornets. The Hornets give up the fourth-most assists to opponents, and KAT has been quietly consistent as a passer all season. He’s averaging around six potential assists per game and has cleared this line in 10 of his last 12. Even with the Knicks missing OG Anunoby, Towns&#x27; minutes and usage shouldn’t be affected. With a strong matchup and a reliable hit rate, this is a spot where KAT should be able to get at least 3 dimes.

This line to too low for Ant vs Thunder. He has cashed in L7/8 vs the Thunder including double digit boards in their last 2 meetups. Over those 8 games, he&#x27;s averaging 7.4 rebounds.

In his last 5, he&#x27;s averaging 5.2 boards as well, a steady increase from season average and last 10 average.

Thunder are not particularly strong in this area despite being a good defense. They rank 20th in the NBA in rebounds allowed to SGs.

Ant hitting 30-40 minutes per game should allow a decent range of time to get his 5 boards.

A lot of commotion in the media regarding Vinicius Jr. and Xabi Alonso very much disliking eachother. With the squad backing Vinicius Jr. in this debacle you never know what happens in a game like this. Despite that I still think this is one of those matchups where players will just show how professional they are by putting it all on the pitch, and with Olympiakos not being a worthy opponent to Real Madrid&#x27;s XI I think this will be a comfortable win for Real. 

Olympiakos hasn&#x27;t won in the Champions League yet.  
With Real being on the verge of the top-8, getting them a spot in the last 16, I think the squad will put their differences with the coach aside and get a win here to end their bad run of form recently.

Last Pick: Manchester City to win + Chelsea-Barcelona BTTS @ 1.76 - LOSS

Last Pick Write Up: Alright, come on man. All the best City players got benched and Barcelona got a red card. I don&#x27;t even know what to say.

Now for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>..

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Arsenal vs Bayern - BTTS Yes @ 1.65

Write Up: 🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨 DO NOT TAIL ME. I AM ON A 5 <mark style='background:#fff59d'>PICK</mark> LOSING STREAK 🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨

I think this one is pretty easy for the odds, but I&#x27;ve thought so about my latest <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> but things happen. Bayern is in 1st place in the CL tables, Arsenal 2nd. In the last 4 Champions League matches, Bayern has scored 14 goals and conceded 3, while Arsenal have scored 11 and conceded 0. I think Bayern is the team to finally make Arsenal concede one, and I think Arsenal will manage to put at least one in the net. 

Since I have been cursed in my latest picks, this match will probably just end up with both teams having 11 goalkeepers each.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Barcelona to win the first half by 5 or more &amp; Barcelona to win the game by 9 or more, 1.83, 1u

Barca is slowly coming back, 7-5 total score, but they are still playing warm-cold games. This one should be an easier one, and it is a must win, so I wasn&#x27;t comfortable with a big spread of 14 points, and I took this combination instead. Additional confidence should be a guest win against Canaria for the weekend, never an easy trip. It was 61-72. 

I also like the Lyon loss against Monaco in the Euroleague, 32 point loss at a home court is not an easy one to shake off. For the weekend, they managed to beat Dijon at home 85-80, a bottom team with 0-5 score, so not much of a success. Of course, the win is the only thing that matters there, but it shows that this team was not selected well, and they are probably the worst team in the Euroleague at this point.</td></tr>

Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: ❌ Clippers +6.5 VS Lakers. They were neck and neck until the 4th quarter. They gave away so many uncontested shots and turnovers yet stayed neck and neck. 4th quarter that started to bite them in the ass as it should have been the entire game. I want to leave clippers alone now, but watch them start playing good just like last time I missed placing a wager on them. 
 
Writeup: Pacers aren’t looking too good this year so far of course. But they do beat Raptors in these categories; 3rd in Field Goals attempted, so when they are landing they are winning. 3rd in Freethrows Attempted, averages almost 2 more than Raptors. Almost 2 more offensive rebounds per game, so that’s 2 more opportunities for up to 6  more ppg. They are going to turn this around, also added another good 3 point shooter Garrison Matthews. They cover the spread essy here</td></tr>

So, Pafos boss Juan Carlos Carcedo says the last thing his side is thinking about is the league table as his side could move up the standings tonight with a positive result against Monaco.

&quot;Our previous win in this competition means we want more success. The players will need to enjoy the occasion and to play well.

&quot;I am not thinking about the three points. Our focus has to be on each individual game and it&#x27;s individual challenges. Monaco is a difficult opponent but we have a game plan.&quot;

NBA | OKC v Timberwolves | 🏀  

Goat gets it done and finishes at 25 points, no doubt 👑 

OKC is a nightmare scoring matchup for #1 options so I’m expecting Ant to take on more of a facilitator role in this one, something he’s done in the past aswell when facing OKC with success. Has gone over this line in 8/L9 games against OKC with him ending at 8 on the sole miss where he had 20 RA chances. 

9, 14, 17, 21, 12, 15, 15, 10 &amp; 8 RA’s against OKC last year.

Over in 5/8 this season with 30+ minutes avg 9.4 RA &amp; 16.4 RA chances per game

Like the upside of rebounds in the matchup aswell as he’s had 7+ rebounds in 7/9 of those games against OKC.

OKC defense is just too good and I’m expecting Ant to be tightly guarded forcing him to pass which is very welcome for me. Last season had the Jdub assignment defensively leading to Ant being in good spots for weak side rebounds, obviously Jdub is injured but I would guess he’s on Wallace which should set him up in something similar.</td></tr>

Write Up: Chychrun is on fire right now. He has a point in 8 straight and 2+ points in back to back. 

He currently has a point in 85% of home games for the season and 9/L10.

I love this even more because Hellebuyck is on IR with a knee injury for the WPG Jets, which is a big loss considering he’s arguably the best goalie in hockey right now. 

With Jakob’s current form and the Caps averaging 3.3 goals per game, I believe he’ll get us back on track!

PSG VS TOTTENHAM

Date: 26 NOVEMBER 2025 at 21:00

BET ON: Over / Under team corners- TOTTENHAM Over +3.50

Odd: 2.10



\- Without creative playmakers like Maddison and Kulusevski, Spurs are unlikely to fashion many chances from open play — which pushes them to lean on transitions and set pieces, where they remain dangerous. Under Thomas Frank, they often switch into a more direct, transitional style when away, inviting pressure but aiming to draw fouls and win corners rather than dominate possession.

\- Statistically, Tottenham are among the league’s leaders in corners per game this season, averaging well over five per match. Their aerial presence — especially via van de Ven — means opponents must be alert, and that often forces fouls or clearances under pressure, creating corner opportunities. Tactically, Frank’s set-up uses a mix of inswingers, late runs, and second-phase attacking from corners, designed precisely to exploit defensive hesitation.

\- Given the likely tactical shape: a compact, defensively solid PSG, Spurs will probably absorb pressure, win multiple set plays, and use those to relieve stress — making the over 3.5 corners bet very logical under those match conditions.</td></tr>

Arsenal vs Bayern Munich

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> : Bayern to Win or Draw @1.7 for 3u

Bayern are in sensational form and have a huge historical advantage over Arsenal. Both teams are missing players. Bayern have been absolutely incredible this season, putting together a European record of 16 straight wins before drawing with Union Berlin, and they just thrashed Freiburg 6-2 last weekend after going 2-0 down, showing they have the mental strength and firepower to come back from any situation. Vincent Kompany&#x27;s side are top of the Champions League with 12 points from 4 matches and have won 17 of their 18 games in all competitions this season, making them one of the most dominant teams in European football right now. Harry Kane has been lethal with 5 goals in just 4 Champions League games and continues to terrorize defenses, and even without Luis Diaz who is suspended for three matches after his red card against PSG, Bayern still have world-class attacking options in Michael Olise, Serge Gnabry, and the rising star Lennart Karl.

Arsenal will be without their main center-back Gabriel Magalhaes who suffered a thigh injury on international duty with Brazil and will be out for weeks, which is a massive blow because he has been the leader of their defensive line that has only conceded 5 Premier League goals all season. The historical record between these two clubs heavily favors Bayern, who have won 8 of the 14 meetings against Arsenal compared to just 3 Arsenal wins, and the Germans have scored 30 goals past Arsenal in those 14 matches including the infamous 10-2 aggregate thrashing in 2017. Arsenal have not beaten Bayern in their last 5 Champions League encounters, with the visitors winning three of those games by a 5-1 scoreline, memories that still haunt Arsenal fans and give Bayern a huge psychological edge.

This feels like a great line to get the Penguins here as they look to be back at full-strength tomorrow against the Sabres. After an IR stint, Jarry will suit up without an injury designation. Before the injury, he was 5-2 with a .911 save percentage.

Joining Jarry’s return, Bryan Rust will be back for the Penguins as well. As one of the Pen’s top goal scorers, his presence will be greatly felt by this squad. 

On the opposite side of the puck, the Sabres are struggling on the road with a 1-5-2 record on the road. They’ve also allowed 75 goals so far this season, and the Pens should be able to add quite a few to that tomorrow. 

The Penguin’s spread is set at -1.5 (+204) so I’m just sticking with the ML.

**Write Up:** What a roller coaster of a game. Enzo looked the best player on the pitch, with two disallowed goals in the 1st half, both disallowed due to questionable offsides calls (on his teammates). But, he comes through for us late in the match with a SOT, after passing up an easy goal opp for an assist. This is why I like to back players that work hard, because they can hit at any point in the match and never give up. 3rd time Enzo has cashed us at plus money, gotta love our guy!

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> we head back north to Liverpool as the reigning EPL champions host the 1st place Dutch side PSV Eindhoven. Liverpool are on a major downturn after losing 3-0 to Nottingham Forest over the weekend.

A win here puts them level in points with 1st place in the UCL.

That&#x27;s where we are at <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Van Dijk is a center back for Liverpool, not your typical shot taker. That said, I&#x27;ve noticed an interesting trend. Van Dijk has cleared this line in 3 of 4 UCL matches this year, playing all 90 minutes in every match and scoring 2 goals in the process. The odds are too tempting to pass up. Yes he hasn&#x27;t shot a ton in EPL fixtures, yes he&#x27;s a defender, but this is a different league with squad rotations and different points to play for. 

Our play here is really corners (and set pieces), as most of Van Dijk&#x27;s shots come from headers off corner kicks. PSV play an attack heavy style which favors this, as I expect the pitch to be stretched and a lot of set plays. They conceded an average of 6.5 corners per match, but usually 7-8 against better sides. Vegas is also expecting 7+ corners, and I like the chances of one of the 7+ corners landing on their top target van Dijk.

Van Dijk is also Dutch, playing against a Dutch team, comprised of mostly Dutch players. There will be a bit of ego/pride in play here, as van Dijk knows many of these players on PSV and will want to show out. Van Dijk is the Netherlands team captain after all, on top of being the captain for Liverpool.

**Mind your units here**, the play is +255 for a reason. But I like the value, BOL if tailing and as always feel free to fade. Have a great Wednesday!</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>POTD Record: 1 - 0

Net Units: +4.76u

Sport: Champions League - Atletico Madrid vs. Inter Milan @ 3:00pm EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: BTTS + Under 5 goals = +115 (5 units)

Write up: Atletico Madrid has been finding form in La Liga recently and has been defensively very solid while Inter Milan has carried on their scoring ways. Inter Milan is sitting in a great position in the CL table, Atletico needs to start bringing their form into the CL and I believe Simeone will have his team ready. Therefore, I believe both teams to be good enough to be dangerous however they both won’t take outrageous risks. Therefore, I expect each to score but this not to be a high scoring affair. This is subject to change based on starting lineup announcement. 

BOL!

Edit: Lineup announced. Don’t love seeing Thuram on the bench, otherwise I like what I see. Let it ride!</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>After a long time away, I&#x27;ve decided to return, having had a good few weeks personally I feel it&#x27;s worth while to get back to what I done well for so long

Picks will always be at around 1.80 better, yes I could play it &quot;safer&quot; but for me it pays off in the long term to take the risk to win more units.


Overall record 73W-44L

Units +63.7

Last pick:

Hannover vs Schalke 04

Both teams to score and over 2.5 goals 

(1.85) 3 units ✖️

This feels like a long time ago now. But I can actually remember it very well now that I&#x27;m writing about it again.

A very cruel loss here , the away side and under dogs Schalke raced to a 2-0 lead in the first 14 minutes.

They then sat back and defended for most of the game and despite scoring 3 times , all 3 goals for Hannover got overturned by Var, so many chances and goals ruled out I&#x27;m still pissed about this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> 2 months later 😂



<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>:
 
Uefa Champions League:

PSG Vs Tottenham 

**PSG win and over 2.5 goals 

(1.80) 2 units **

Defending champions PSG host a Tottenham side who started the season well but the wheels have started to come off badly for them.

The sides met at the start of the season for Super Cup, which ended 2-2 , the PSG squad had just played the club world cup 3 weeks before this and the players had just come back from their summer break, with no training or match fitness they still almost won this.

PSG come into this game with 3 wins from 4 champions League games, **scoring 14 goals conceding 5**, they are outrageously stacked in attack so even with injuries to Dembele and Doue, Kvaratskhelia should start coming back from an injury, and Barcola and Ramos look good as has midfielder Joao Neves who&#x27;s scored 6 goals in his last 5 matches in all competitions.

For Tottenham they started the season well, but have just **1 win in their last 5 matches** , it&#x27;s not just the fact they&#x27;ve not been winning it&#x27;s how they&#x27;ve been getting dominated alot of matches, Dominated against Arsenal in a 4-1 loss, dominated at home to Chelsea where they lost 1-0 but Chelsea managed 3.67 XG. Away matches against Leeds who managed 16 shots and 1.6xg, Everton managed 1.78 xg against them Leeds and Everton both teams without a good striker between them.

Leeds and Everton didn&#x27;t punish Tottenham despite playing well and creating a ton of chances they both lack great attacking players,but a team as good as PSG really should score at the very least 2 goals here.

Tottenham will get chances though, and do usually find a way to score.
Since Hakimi&#x27;s injury at right back , midfielder Zaire-Emery has been filling in and although he&#x27;s an incredible midfield he&#x27;s out of position here only 19 years old, they have conceded a lot more shots in the 2 games he&#x27;s played out of position whether that&#x27;s a coincidence or not.

As long as PSG can break Tottenham down reasonably early I can&#x27;t see why they don&#x27;t win this and the match has at least 3 goals here.









BOL and only bet what you can afford to lose!</td></tr>

(Playable up to -150) {{I played this 4 hours ago sorry the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> thread only gets posted late}}

Reasoning: *backing the 21 year old Spaniard with the higher floor and higher ceiling vs Cadenasso. Cadenasso transitioning from a final on clay in Montemar three days ago to now *indoor* clay in Maiai might find him taking a while to adjust. Whereas Merida’s hard court experience (much better than Cad on HC’s) will transition a lot better to the slightly faster conditions of the indoor clay. Merida has 1 win in the last 1.75 months including 3 first round exits. Financially and ranking wise he *cannot* afford another first round exit here and he’s perfectly primed for the win here.*

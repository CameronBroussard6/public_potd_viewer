**Last Pick Summary**: Another pretty sweat free <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> (and very sweat free <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> due to early payout for those of us on Bet365)! There really wasn’t a doubt in my mind after two early goals from Dinamo Zagreb. They were clearly the dominant side in the fixture and proved it without question. Congrats to all those who tailed on this one as Dinamo Zagreb cruised to a 4-1 victory over FCSB.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s Write Up:** We have a pretty small soccer slate <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, and I told myself I will never post a basketball <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> again, so I am digging deep into the model to find the best <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> possible. I locked in on a 2-Legger <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> playing my two favorites (in the \~-350 range) together. I know many of you don’t like 2 leg parlays and at -154 it probably puts some of you off as well. That is quite alright. We ride nevertheless.

Inter Milan come into this as the clear Serie A leaders, rocking a 16-1-4 record with 49 points. They are three points ahead of rivals AC Milan and are far superior to Pisa’s 14 points at the bottom of the table. They have been absolutely dominating league play and there is no reason it doesn’t continue here against bottom dweller Pisa. 

This will be my first foray into Ligue 2, as we key in on an expected defensive matchup between  mid-table squads Pau and Grenoble. French Ligue 2 is generally known for low scoring/close matches, and these historically hit under 3.5 goals frequently. Neither side in this matchup seems to be a clear favorite or a team that will pull away with 3+ goals. Direct H2H between the two squads has hit under 3.5 in 4 out of the last five matchups, and under 2.5 in those matchups as well.

Give me some classic Inter dominance and low scoring Ligue 2 action and we are locked in for the day lads.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: **Mercyhurst -1.5 (-105 FanDuel) 1U**

Event: CBB | Mercyhurst @ New Haven (1:00 pm EST) | 🏀

*Recap: Easy peasy lemon squeezy. Charlotte had eight players in double figures, led by 21 at the half, and held Orlando&#x27;s starters to 55 points - Anthony Black was basically a no-show. It&#x27;s worth noting that Franz Wagner didn&#x27;t play. All is not well in central Florida. But I&#x27;ll take my money and move on.*

New Haven cannot score. Full stop. KenPom ranks them 352nd in offensive efficiency and 360th in adjusted pace. They are slow. They are plodding. They are glacial. Yes, they&#x27;ve won three in a row, but two of those victories came at home against Northeast Conference bottom teams. My thesis is simple. New Haven cannot score. ...And Mercyhurst is incrementally better. Plus, the Lakers from Erie, Pa. are spread-covering machines. Granted, Mercyhurst is 19 spots better than New Haven in offensive efficiency and 15 spots better in adjusted tempo. But they&#x27;re 55 spots better in defensive efficiency and they&#x27;ve been covering all year long. Overall, Mercyhurst is 11-6 ATS. On the road, they&#x27;re 7-4. In their last five games, it&#x27;s 4-1. Mercyhurst also boasts an 18-point home win over NEC second-place team Central Connecticut, which topped New Haven by 11 on Jan. 4. I also like Mercyhurst&#x27;s nonconference showings better. The Lakers have played Syracuse (lost by 14, but covered easily), Miami - Ohio (lost by 5, but covered easily), and Marshall (lost by 9 but covered). In fact, the only truly rotten showings on Mercyhurst&#x27;s slate is a blowout at West Virginia (did not cover), a blowout at Davidson (did not cover), and a season-opening thumping at Northwestern (where they *did* cover). On the other hand, New Haven just hasn&#x27;t showed up against any of the big schools it&#x27;s faced. I mean, they were getting 18.5 against a terrible Penn State squad and fell by 44. They got 39.5 against Vanderbilt and lost by 43. They were getting 13.5 against a .500 Fordham team and lost by 18.

Devil&#x27;s advocate: New Haven *is* ahead of Mercyhurst in the NEC standings, but that may be a product of the Lakers playing the Top 3 schools early in the conference play more than anything. And in those three games, Mercyhurst has ...you guessed it... covered three times. They even won two outright! At 1.5, this is essentially a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>&#x27;em. Mercyhurst holds opponents to 66.1 points per game (24th in the nation) and have covered 63 percent on the time on the road. I like the Lakers to go on the road and be just enough better. As a basketball fan, however, I&#x27;m not sure you could pay me to watch this game. I predict.... ugly.

Good luck and Godspeed!

Last Five (New to Old): LWLWW

Last Pick: Vinyl at Lunar Owls o140.5 points ❌️ || 1.0u at -113 || 3v3 Unrivaled Basketball

GAH that was a frustrating game to watch. Vinyl put up a terrible offensive performance and final score was 68-57. Every time this game started to open up it felt like there was tech, replay assist, or tv timeout. Hamby did not look confident and finished with just 8 points. But I&#x27;m looking to get back on track with this next slate of Unrivaled matches 

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Mist ML || 1.0u at -128 on FD || Mist at Rose || 3v3 Unrivaled Basketball 7:30pm ET

Mist (3-2) take on Rose (3-2) in a game that&#x27;s got stars on both sides of the ball. But these offenses have very different approaches

Let&#x27;s start with Rose who lost their last two games despite Kahleah Copper returning from injury. This team loves the three ball. Rose lead Unrivaled with a 40.4% 3PT shooting percent and 21.8 3PT attempts per game. They have the worst 2PT shooting percent of 48.9% in Unrivaled, but because of the 3 ball they have 3rd best eFG% at 53.4%. This team doesn&#x27;t turn the ball over a ton with the lowest turnovers per game at 6.2, resulting in a 2nd best 1.94 assist to turnover ratio in Unrivaled. 

The Mist on the other hand shoot with volume. They lead Unrivaled with 63.8 FGA per game (Rose at 56.6) but have the lowest FG% at 42.3%. So far this season, Mist have shot 25.5% from distance and have a 50.7% 2PT shooting percent. They have the worst eFG% at 46.6% in Unrivaled. Mist have the 2nd lowest turnovers per game (6.6) and 3rd best assist to turnover ratio at 1.76, just behind Rose in both categories. 

On defense, Rose allow opponents the 2nd highest FG% at 49.1% and allow 2nd highest eFG% at 55.02%. Meanwhile, Mist allow 3rd lowest FG% and eFG% at 44.7% and 49.49%. 

This game is a toss up and books are giving Mist a slight edge with -1.5 point spread. Mist are a high volume but low shooting percent team, playing against a Rose side that allows opponents to shoot well. While Rose are a threat from distance, I believe Mist can be solid enough defensively and can get the win. BOL</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Cade Cunningham o8.5 ast (-143) DraftKings 2u

**Write-up:** Taking Cade tonight. He is coming back from an illness + hip soreness, but he should be ready to roll. Would hate to get a surprise minute restriction. If anything, he should sit. To start things off, Cade has hit this in 25 out of 36 games this season. H2H, he is 3 out of 4 against the Rockets. Looks like it will be a full lineup tonight. When Cade plays with all the starters for at least 30 minutes, he has hit this line 15 out of 18 times. I expect him to play most of the game, given the close spread of -3.5.

The Rockets defend very well, and they are an extremely tall team. They rank 6th in defending the point guard position. Shouldn&#x27;t affect Cade too much, since he is one of the best players in the league. Versus the top 10 defenses this season, he still manages. Most of his assists come from inside the restricted area, where the Rockets defend the best. However, against teams that defend that area well, he has managed to attain at least 10 assists 10 out of 12 times. During those games, he racks up around 20 potential assists. The volume is there. This season, the Rockets play at a snail&#x27;s pace compared to other teams, ranking 28th. Pistons sit around the middle of the pack, but this helps Cade&#x27;s chances tonight. When playing against bottom 20-ranked teams in terms of pace, he has hit his line 11 out of 14 times, with two of those games coming from the Celtics. If that wasn&#x27;t enough, the Rockets in their last five games rank 22nd in points allowed inside the paint. When Cade has played against a team that ranks 20th or worse, he has hit his line 11 out of 13 times. Alongside that, when playing against teams that rank in the top 15 in denying opponent three-point attempts and free throw attempts, he is a perfect 6 out of 6.

Basically, what I&#x27;m trying to say is Cade is matchup-proof. He does extremely well in high-competition matches. He gets hard for tough matchups, just to prove he is the best on the floor. Cade is an excellent point guard and an elite floor general. He always has the ball in his hands, and he&#x27;s always looking to set his teammates up. Pass-first type of guy, but can take over games at any time and score the rock whenever he wants. Look for a gritty matchup tonight with a lot of physicality. I want to see Cade alley-oop to Duren and posterize somebody tonight. MARK IT.

Let’s get it! Good luck, fellas. 🍀</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Inter to Win to Nil + PSG o1.5 TTG (+163 DK)

3u to Win 4.91u


Write up: These are 2 top teams both going up against relegation sides. Both sides should score at least 2 and Win to Nil but this is the safest combination IMO. PSG and Inter are coming off of losses in the CL and need to bounce back. Inter is at home and should control possession while Pisa park the bus trying to limit damage and counter. PSG will be aggressive and are due for a high scoring output with their offensive weapons. Note: Due to their busy schedules both Inter and PSG may not play their best lines for a majority of the game. I still like this play but if you wait until starting XIs are known the odds may improve.

**Event Time:** 6 hours from post.

**Match:** Auxerre VS PSG

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** PSG to Win to Nil @ $2.15 (1 Unit)

**Write Up:** 

Alright legends, let’s get stuck into this one. PSG is coming off a bit of a nightmare in Portugal after losing to Sporting in the Champions League, and usually, when the Parisians get their ego bruised, someone in Ligue 1 is about to have a very bad Friday night. They’re heading to Auxerre, and while the PSG medical room is currently busier than a pub on a Friday afternoon with Hakimi, Mendes, and Neves all sidelined the depth they have is still lightyears ahead of what Auxerre is working with.

I’m looking at the &quot;Win to Nil&quot; here because Auxerre’s attack has been about as threatening as a wet paper towel lately. They’ve managed a measly 14 goals across 18 matches this season, and their finishing has been statistically rated as &quot;Very Weak&quot; by basically everyone watching. Even with a slightly rotated backline, PSG still has guys like Zabarnyi and Marquinhos to hold the fort, and with Vitinha sitting in the middle hogging the ball like it’s his personal property, Auxerre is going to struggle to even get a sniff of the goal.

Luis Enrique doesn&#x27;t exactly do relaxed after a loss, so I expect him to have them drilled to keep a clean sheet and just suffocate this game from the jump. PSG won the reverse fixture 2-0 without breaking a sweat, and Auxerre is currently stuck in a three-match losing skid where they can barely find the back of the net. Getting $2.15 for a professional shut out against a team that couldn&#x27;t hit the side of a barn is the kind of value that makes the early morning kickoff worth it. Let’s get it.</td></tr>

Slower paced teams (28 rockets, 15 pistons) but both in the bottom 10 of defense (22nd rockets 29th pistons) and both in top 15 offence. From what I can tell the line is the way it is because the last time they played the score was 115 to 111.

  
If the Rockets have average to above average FG% I think this should cover pretty easily. Doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m alone though. Over 75% of the bets and money are on the over.

Write-Up: Wow, that last one went great with the game ending 1-0, let’s hope we can have something like that again. <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> we have the Capitals coming to Calgary to play the Flames. The Flames have Devin Cooley in net who is having a great season after a pretty bad one with the Sharks in his rookie year. He is also playing particularly even better than his season stats in these past few games. This season, Devin Cooley has a save percentage of .922 which is just amazing, and he also has just a 2.18 goals against average. For the Capitals, Vézina contender Logan Thompson is having another great season with pretty much identical stats to last season. Logan Thompson has a .913 save percentage and a 2.43 goals against average this season. Although the Capitals are trending over recently, they are still a pretty average scoring team, ranking 13th in goals this season, and have to face Devin Cooley who is playing out of his mind. On the other side the Flames are just terrible at scoring, they’ve traded some good players away as they are sort of building towards a rebuild/retool now, they’ve traded rank 31st in goals this season. With ranking so low in goals it’ll be hard for them to score against an experienced Logan Thompson who has been consistently good a couple years in a row.

Of course this might be a game where Inter just cleanly wins without getting a card or conceding a corner, but the stats suggest otherwise and Seria A is chaotic.

Additionally, these two teams played eight days ago on 1/15 and Eichel had five shots on eight attempts in that game.</td></tr>

Despite BLG being slight favorites, JDG has shown strong early game control, which should help keep the map balanced into the mid game. That factor increase the probability of long map durations, creating value on the Over 32.5 line.</td></tr>

Dewa had a shaky start with a home loss to Pelita. If the loss was not that surprising, both are top 5 teams in the league; the difference was. 3 wins afterwards, each one more secure than the previous one.

Surabaya all 3 losses, 18, 20, and 43 points difference. Everything screams that the spread is way too low here; these 15 points should be at least 25.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Levante Vs Elche - **BTTS @ 1.75 (Melbet)**

**Write Up:** Levante and Elche come into this match both looking for consistency after uneven recent form. Neither side has been able to fully control games, often mixing solid periods with costly defensive mistakes. Their recent head-to-head meetings have usually been tight, and this looks set to follow the same pattern. Elche are pushing to keep their slim European hopes alive, sitting eighth in La Liga, eight points behind sixth-placed Real Betis. Levante, meanwhile, are under real pressure near the bottom, placed 19th and six points adrift of safety. With both teams fighting for different reasons, this should be a closely contested game.

Levante head into this game after a 2-0 defeat away to Real Madrid, part of a tough run against strong opposition. Before that, they showed some resilience with a 1-1 home draw against Espanyol, a result that reflects their season so far. At home, Levante have struggled badly to turn good moments into results. They are winless in their last four league matches at their own stadium, including draws with Espanyol and Real Sociedad. In fact, Levante have the worst home record in La Liga this season, picking up just three points from eight matches and conceding 18 goals.

Elche come into this match after a 2-2 draw with Sevilla, a result that showed both their competitiveness and their defensive issues. That followed another draw away at Valencia, meaning they’ve picked up back-to-back stalemates against strong opponents. Across their last five matches, Elche have scored in four, but they’ve also conceded in four, often struggling to hold leads or see games out comfortably.

Away from home, their form remains a concern with four losses and a draw, although the Valencia result hinted at better organisation. The win over Rayo Vallecano before Christmas looks more like a one-off than a true shift in form, leaving Elche as a side that can score but remains vulnerable defensively.

Levante have scored in 4 of their last 6 home matches, with BTTS landing in 4 of those games as well. Looking at a wider sample, BTTS has occurred in 6 of their last 10 home fixtures. Elche show a similar trend away from home. They’ve found the net in 5 of their last 6 away matches, with BTTS hitting in 4 of those. Zooming out, 7 of their last 10 away games have also seen both teams score.

Both teams have enough quality to score in this match. Levante and Elche have shown they can be fairly reliable in front of goal, but both are also vulnerable defensively. Levante have conceded in four of their last five league games, while Elche have scored in four of their last five overall. Neither side has shown the consistency needed to keep clean sheets for a full ninety minutes.

Elche are having the stronger season overall, but they are still searching for their first away win in the league. Levante, meanwhile, have one of the weakest home records this term. With both sides struggling to turn performances into wins, this matchup looks well set for a draw, with goals at both ends.

**Basketball | B2 League Japan | 23 january 10:55 AM CET (central european time)**

**Write Up:** I’m taking Over 153.5 in Fukuoka vs Nara because both teams have been hot offensively in recent games, and when they meet, the pace usually picks up. Fukuoka likes to push in transition, Nara can score in bursts, and neither has a lockdown defense, so even with averages being modest, this game has blowout potential and scoring runs that could push it past 153.5. Plus, the sharp money moving the line up hints that some bettors see the scoring going higher than expected. **P.S note --&gt; I also always recommend to take a better line live ( like let&#x27;s say the game starts slow and you catch the line at over 148,5 or smth)**

Odds: -120 

Last: Spizziri (-2.5) over Wu ✅

This match should be interesting. I went with the game spread as opposed to the ML as Rublev has a bigger serve than Cerundolo and it gives us a small margin to still cover if Cerundolo wins the match. 

That being said I love Rublev here. Rublev is 1-3 against Cerundolo but this match will be a best of 5 and will be at a major. Rublev is known for his tendency to lose against superior players in quarterfinals, but he has been very consistent in beating lesser opponents earlier in majors. 
Rublev has started off 2026 well and looked fantastic in his 1st round match. I think Rublev is back to his old self after a rough 2025.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Map 1 - Over or Exactly 30:30 Map Duration 2-Way (1.83) 2u to win 1.66u ✅**

**Start Time:** 17:00 KST, \~6 hours from posting

**Writeup:** Fewer things are more exciting in sports than a storied rivalry. Lakers vs Celtics, Yankees vs Red Sox, El Classico in La Liga. For Korean League of Legends, they have the Telecom War, aka KT Rolster vs T1.

The Telecom War came to its greatest and most important matchup during last year&#x27;s Worlds Final, concluding in an epic five game series with the championship decided on the last game. These were the two best performing teams of 2025 during its biggest international event and they both put on a show.

Coming into 2026, KT have not had the best start. After a tough 2-1 victory in their first match, they then fell 0-2 in the next series to end Week 1 with 1-1 in matches. Their offseason acquisitions have not been the greatest either, but one can argue that they are now a bit more stable without the tremendous ups and downs the team is known for historically.

T1 on the other hand bring in a rising star in Peyz. He is young, has an insanely high ceiling for improvement and is battle-tested on the biggest stage. Their roster is marginally improved by this, but their teamwork has suffered after losing one of the team&#x27;s cornerstones in Gumayusi. They are 2-0 in matches but have played all six possible games, having lost a game in every match they&#x27;ve played thus far. They are still working out things, but they will be scarier in the latter half of the year.

Both teams have slow paced tendencies. T1&#x27;s average game duration is 31:08 whilst KT&#x27;s is 30:58. This is especially true for Game 1 as T1 average 33:05 and KT 31:20 during the season so far. Aside from the stats, the key matchup here will be the botlane. If T1 can get their botlane ahead, they can snowball hard. But the strength of KT has been their Mid+JG duo, providing assistance across the map and deterring early aggression.

KT will neutralise the game and keep it close. They play through Bdd in the midlane to create priority for early game objectives. T1 are a methodical team, they play for objective timers and won&#x27;t force unless they are eons ahead. I predict the first game will come down to the later stages of the game, which helps prolong the map duration. Finally, KT will have <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> priority during Map 1. They can dictate the draft and play their strong champions, much like what FearX did yesterday.

Telecom Wars are always competitive, the diehard fans of both sides spur the players and they&#x27;ll deliver when they need to. Both teams will take it slow, not allow the game to run away quick and decide the game during neutral objective teamfights.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Pistons -3 (I&#x27;m cashing it out if Cade Cunningham is out).**

**Use bet365 to cash it out if Cade Cunningham is out important. DO NOT PLACE THIS BET if you do not like the fact that you might lose money if you cash it out or you can wait tomorrow and take it when Cades confirmed**

I usually hate doing things like cashing out but this one is for a good reason. Currently the Rockets are slaving Kevin Durant and working him to the bone. He is averaging around 37 minutes a game which is insane to me considering how old this man is. 

So looking at his schedule starting his home game stretch was Bulls 28 points and 40 minutes, then OKC number 1 defence 37 minutes and 19 points, back to back Minnesota Wolves 40 minutes and 39 points, Pelicans 36 minutes and 18 points, Spurs 39 minutes and 18 points. 

Fatigue is clearly affecting this man at 37 years of age. These are intense minutes, players such as Steph, Leonard, Harden all have special rotations to ensure that they will not be too tired. Kevin Durant has also looked tired against certain teams like the Pelicans missing normal mid range shots and missing an alley opp uncontested. 

This Rockets squad has also been very very off unsure if its because Sengun is injured and coming back due to how poorly they have been performing but the offence has been extremely isolation based and wasting shot clock time, furthermore the three point shooting is very bad obviously Tari Eason could help, as well as Jabari Smith Jr ending his three point drought, but this pistons squad is number 2 on defence. 

I&#x27;m backing Pistons because to be honest they are a very good defensive team, and I love this team because they are dogs imo and hustle. A beaten up and currently confused Rockets squad should be easy work for the Pistons. A legacy game from either Reed or KD is my concern but I&#x27;m unsure how likely that will be with how sloppy they are right now against the 76ers and a back to back doesn&#x27;t help them.

Oh a concern to help judge whether you want to risk this is Cade Cunningham has been horrible in his last three games back from injury.

Oh also this is now a back to back for the Rockets with a overtime to the 76ers now lmfao if Cade Cunningham plays as long as he does well to assist should be light work.</td></tr>

**Write Up:** Back to Germany <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> where we&#x27;ve historically had some good luck as last place St Pauli host 14th place Hamburg. Typically bottom table matches don&#x27;t scream goals, but plus money for over 2.5 goals was too juicy to pass up for two horribly defenses. Both of these teams will want (and expect) a win here, and while neither team typically scores a lot I see this being an open match where both teams try for goals against equally bad defenses. Really a classic match where a stoppage force meets a moveable object, and we&#x27;re backing the stoppable force. 

I like this for a few reasons. The first being team form. St Pauli has scored in 6 of their last 7 matches, including against some tough defenses, and scored 2 goals in 3 of those 6. Hamburg have also scored in 5 of their last 6. Additionally, the reverse fixture ended 2-0 to St Pauli, which was one of their 3 wins this season. They&#x27;ll want to show out and take this match as well at home, so I&#x27;m expecting a high press and attacking style match.

Tennis | Oeiras Challenger | 9:10 AM EST (estimated)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: Leandro Riedi vs Zsombor Piros | **Riedi ML at -145 (Caesars). 1 unit.**

Write-up: Nice win for Passaro, who faltered a bit in the second set and was available at plus money at points, but ended up dominating the third. 

Leandro Riedi is a talented but injury-prone player who plays his best tennis on fast hard courts. The highlight of his young career was certainly last year&#x27;s US Open, where he qualified without dropping a set and made it to the Round of 16 in the main draw before finally running into a wall in Alex De Minaur. However, he&#x27;s also been performing decently to start 2026, as he won a round against Choinski in AO qualifying and has looked good through two matches here in Oeiras. I will say that Piros has also performed quite well in his opening two matches, as he has actually earned slightly higher performance ratings than Riedi. However, the recent market pricing of these two players makes me think that they&#x27;re not quite on the same level. Riedi was a bigger favorite than this against Henrique Rocha, a home player who I see on a similar level to Piros, while Piros&#x27;s odds against Yevseyev put him in the same tier as Liam Broady. Of course, Broady has plenty of experience in these conditions, but he&#x27;s another player without the recent form or weaponry of Riedi. I expect Riedi&#x27;s serve and forehand to be the best shots on the court here, which is always something I&#x27;m looking for. In addition, concerns about his health are mitigated by the indoor conditions, which tend to be lower-impact on the body, and I&#x27;m not too worried about his ability to go 3 sets here. I know odds have already moved on some books, but I would take this up to around -160.</td></tr>

The <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> sadly doesn&#x27;t hit. Eventually it became a 1-1 but neither team managed to score one more. I did find another play later in the day that I liked even more than <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> which did hit. That was posted over in the soccer thread. But the streak is sadly over nevertheless.

Time to start a new winstreak and I have the perfect play for it. Buckle up, this is a good one.

**Write Up:**

Midweek matches are over. It is time for the weekend and that means league football. When I noticed this one I loved it right away!

Auxerre are 9-0 if you take +1.5 in their home matches. This includes tough opponents like Lille, AS Monaco, Lyon, Marseille, Toulouse and even league leaders Lens.

They have 10 goals scored and 11 conceded. Their defensive block is solid.

PSG away with the +1.5 line taken into account have a 2-7 record in away games. Close away games with some draws and losses and a 5-2-2 record. Their 18-11 goal record in 9 games seems decent but 1 game had 6 goals. 8 games with a 12-8 goalscoring record is not as impressive anymore.

Now look at this insane H2H record.

**If you give Auxerre the +1.5 they win 18-0 H2H in home games since 1999.**

This makes me extremely confident.

The only blip is the earlier game this year which ended 2-0 for PSG. But...

Auxerre are worse away from home with a 0-2-7 record and 4-17 in goals. At home they are stronger going 3-1-5 with 10-11 in goals.

This will make the difference and my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> a winner.

I am really confident, hence the 4U bet.

* In 56 map losses last year, Perfect only went O 3.5 kills in 4/56 map losses for a 7% cover rate with most of them coming in early 2025. Perfect has missed this line in his last 26 map losses last going over on August 1st. Perfect had a 0/12 hit rate against T1 in map losses in 2025
* Despite this writeup mostly going off a T1 win, this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> still has major. equity in a map win. In 72 map wins last split, PerfecT only went over in 28/72 maps won last split or \~39% of map wins meaning even in map wins there is plenty of chance this line misses. Especially with the decrease in top lane KP% and kills on top lane being way down this split so far

**Leave&gt;Ryan3 Map 1 Kills (-250)**

* I don&#x27;t like to be hyperbolic, but Ryan3 might actually be the worst ADC player I have ever seen in my many years of watching League of Legends. ThunderTalk as a whole just look awful as a team, they have been completely unproductive, they sit around and let teams do whatever they want against them and they almost always lose out because of the lack of talent on their roster
* We watched this exact same matchup yesterday (less then 24 hours ago). EDG won 2-0 in a very one sided series, Leave covered in both series and was dominant in both lanes with little trouble and was completely comfortable in both games.
* So far in LPL, Leave is averaging 2.9 kills in 6 maps played so far, he is due for a lot of positive regression on this number as his kills have been getting stolen like crazy in map wins and still early in the split. Looking at Demacia Cup numbers, Leave played 14 maps overall, he averaged 5.57 kills per map at Demacia Cup with a 31.2% kill share for his team
* Ryan3 is averaging the least kills of any ADC in the LPL at 1.8 kills per game. He also has the lowest DMG% of any ADC at 21.8% which is insanely low for an ADC and over 2% lower from the next worst ADC. He also has the least gold share %, and lowest damage per minute.
* Leave is averaging +767 gold at 15 minutes despite a negative win rate right now in LPL. Ryan3 is averaging a -751 gold at 15 minutes in LPL. We just watched this play out twice yesterday, see no reason why <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>&#x27;s result will be any different</td></tr>

Match 4 hours from now


Write up: Posting after a long time, haven&#x27;t really bothered much recently, but tennis is back on so I thought might as well try to get going again.


I like rublev against cerundolo cause I believe rublev is a very good player even though he has had his struggles last year, he seemed to be getting out of them eventually as the tour ended and I think this court and conditions favor him much more than dolo. Though dolo has had some convincing matches so far I just can&#x27;t trust the guy, especially on hard court he has always been iffy and he has burnt me before, when I took him last time on hardcourt last year. Though the ranking might seem close I dont believe its the same on hard court, imo rubley should be taking this over dolo unless he is just having a very off game.

Event: Australian Open R1 🎾

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Corentin Moutet 🇫🇷 +9.5 games handicap vs Carlos Alcaraz 🇪🇸  5 units to win 4.2U @1.83 (Bet365)

This promises to be a thriller match on paper between two of the most creative players on tour and I really hope it delivers. For me, the line is way too wide for this match which is why I’m happy to take it even though I’m expecting a straight set victory for Carlos. Moutet has gone from being a universally hated clown to somewhat of a fan favourite thanks to his playing style despite his antics (though are less recurring nowadays). I personally find that the magician has the best touch on tour. There, I said it fight me for it. He’s become a lot more consistent as well since last year, climbing up to his current rank of No. 37. He claimed his first top ten wins last year over Rune and Fritz and in general is a nuisance to play no matter the opponent. The boy covers the court like his life depends on it, will throw all sorts of different patterns of play and has every shot in his locker to make sure the opponent has to hit one more ball in the court. Moutet loves the big stage and won’t go down without a fight which is why I like how large the spread is. He is pretty underpowered on the serve and backhand which may complicate holds a bit but I expect his other tricks to make up for this. Despite a small fitness concern in round 1 he easily beat Schoolkate in straights and really stepped up in his match against Zheng after going a set down, who retired in the fourth set.

Alcaraz meanwhile is the No. 1 but has never made it past the quarters here in Australia. He sacked his coach Ferrero just before the season started and the verdict is still out on whether it was a good decision we’ll have to wait and see. He took care of his business in his first round victories over Walton and Hanfmann with straight set victories but he didn’t seem at his dominant best and they both covered the spread. Moutet is going to be a stronger opponent than them and if he doesn’t reduce the errors I could see the frenchman test him in this match, especially with how much he can force the errors. Also, playing against such an unorthodox opponent for the very first time can take a little bit of an adjustment period and one close set would be crucial for us. I feel like the diceyness of Corentin’s game may put Alcaraz in his head at times as he can often lose concentration plus the lefty aspect could increase the unpredictability to force more errors out of the spaniard. Generally you can instantly tell when Carlos is going to be in terminator mode for a tournament from his very first match (e.g. US Open ‘25) but I didn’t get that feeling from his first two so I predict he’ll complicate his life just a bit to make it a lot closer than the books anticipate. I also feel like his creative play will be matched for once which may reduce his chances at free points plus a lot of Moutet’s game from the baseline is about redirecting power which Alcaraz has an abundance of and may have to resort to (and increase the UE’s) to make the match competitive. Let’s just hope for some great tennis, eh. BOL !</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: (AO) Frances Tiafoe to win a set vs Alex de Minaur
Odds: 1.71
Units: 5u

Reasoning:
De Minaur deserves to be favored, but this is a best-of-5, and that’s where this line feels off.

Tiafoe doesn’t need to be the better player for the match — he just needs one set, and his profile fits that perfectly. He serves big enough to hold without playing great, and when his forehand is clicking he can shorten points and run away with a set quickly. One strong service set or a tiebreak is all it takes.

De Minaur’s game is built on consistency, pressure, and attrition. That usually wins matches, but it doesn’t always produce clean 3–0s, especially against someone with Tiafoe’s power and ability to spike for 20–30 minutes. Over five sets, it’s hard to completely suppress that kind of shot-making.

I’m not calling the upset. I’m calling a 3–1 or 3–2 type match, which is exactly what this bet is asking for.

Cambuur vs Eindhoven, over 3.5 goals @ 2.3 

SC Cambuur vs FC Eindhoven has all the signs of a goal-heavy clash. Cambuur play aggressive, attacking football at home and rarely slow the tempo, but that approach leaves them exposed defnsively. Eindhven are happy to trade chances and can punish mistakes. With both teams favoring offense over control and defenses thatconcede regularly, an open match is expected.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Philadelphia Flyers @ Colorado Avalanche -1.5 (-120 on BET365 at time of posting), 1U for 1.83U)**

**Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> recap:** As expected, a hard-fought match, and 1 of the goalies followed the script, but Luukkonen made 32 saves on 34 shots and a missed empty net iced it.

**Write Up:** Ok y’all, time to go hard. I’m not just picking Colorado to beat Philadelphia tomorrow, I expect them beat the spread! Here’s why:

**1. COL Home record:** Colorado have been struggling lately, esp.  at home where they are 1-1-2 in their last 4. ***However, they’re a whopping 20-1-4 at home this season, and all 20 wins coming in regulation.*** They are a combined 110 GF and 52 GA, good for 4.4 GF/GP and 2.08 GA/GP. If you remove the 3-7 shellacking against the lowly Preds last week, their GA/GP at home drops to 1.8. At home, they outshoot their opponents 36-25.5. In their last 10 at home, they’ve outscored opponents 39-21, and outchanced them 34.8 S/GP to 25.4 SA/GP. After dropping 3 of their last 4 and losing to Anaheim in OT their last time out (Dostal stood on his head to get the win for the Ducks), Colorado will be hungry to get back in the win column and not keep it close. 

**2. Offense, Defence, &amp; Special Teams:** COL rank 1st in the NHL in scoring at 3.96 GF/GP, goals allowed at 2.27 GA/GP, PK% at 85% and shots/game at 34.9. In those same categories, PHI is 22nd in scoring at 2.9 GF/GP, 20th in goals allowed at 3.1 GA/GP, 23rd in PK% at 77.7% and 26th in shots/game at 26.0.  Now, you may think the power-play is where it turns, since the Avs are only 26th in the NHL with a 16.5 PP%, but the Flyers are 30th at 15.5%. The Flyers (4th) rank only slightly ahead of the Avs (8th) in SA/GP, 25.4 to 26.8. This won’t be enough to overcome the rest of the Avs strengths.

**3. Goalies:** Philadelphia had better hope that starter Dan Vladar is ready to come off IR, as amongst qualifying goalies his .905 SV% (22 of 61) and 2.46 GAA (11 of 61) are WAY ahead of backup Samuel Ersson’s .858 SV% (61 of 61) and 3.38 GAA (53 of 61). Colorado’s still missing one half of lights-out goalie tandem Scott Wedgwood. If they go with presumptive starter Mackenzie Blackwood, his .917 SV% (4 of 61) and 2.26 GAA (5 of 61) are both top 5 for qualifying goalies. If they go with 2nd-year Trent Miner, he’s got 4 of his 6 lifetime games this season, putting up a .933 SV% and 2.03 GAA which belies his 1-0-2 record, as he came off the bench once, saving all 20 shots he face while already down 4-1 (Avs in a shootout) and his only win was a 4-0 29-save shutout of the Blue Jackets on Jan 10. 

**4. Goalie H2H:** Dan Vladar is 2-4-0 lifetime vs. Colorado, with a 3.88 GAA and .887 SV%. Ersson is 0-2-0 H2H with a 2.74 GAA and .913 SV% (he came off the bench once, making 8 saves on 9 shots after starter Carter Hart was shelled for 5 goals on 15 shots). On the flip side, Blackwood is 11-2-2 vs. Philly with a 2.24 GAA and .927 SV%. Trent Miner has never played against Philadelphia. 

As this is an inter-conference games, these teams only face each other twice/year. That said, Avs won 3-2 in Philly in December this year, are on a 4-game win streak in this matchup and 7-2-0 in the past 5 seasons.

Look to the Avs to right the ship and put up lopsided numbers here. If you&#x27;re shy about the spread, the 3-way moneyline is currently at -190, it&#x27;s just not juicy enough money in my opinion for this juggernaut.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: NCAAMB: SLU -8.5 vs St. Bonaventure -108 (1U TO WIN 0.92U)** 

Write up: As said best in the comment section last night, all good things come to an end… Syracuse snaps our 11 bet win streak… That is the best my model has performed since creating it - l hope you all had as much fun as I did the past 11 days - let’s get back in the W column tonight - Model has this as the highest confident Edge % and EV % for the day. Will add some personal information in this write-up as well.

• ⁠Model has St. Louis ML at 87% (Highest % the model has shown me) 

• Model says St. Louis should be -10.5 favorites

• EV better betting 100$ = 12-14$ for this play

• I’m sure some of you will be hesitant about this because of the last time I bet on SLU (SLU vs. VCU over, and both teams shot under 29% in the 1H) - SLU is 6-0 in conference play, while the Bonnie’s are 1-5 - SLU is a top 10 team in the country when it comes to PPG - they average 91.1 PPG while the Bonnies are a bottom 2 team in the A10 in terms of defensive efficiency, also noting they are bottom 60 in the country - The pace in which SLU plays at is to fast for the Bonnies - Looking at the Bonnies, they have 3 guys - Mitchell, Charles, and Simmons - Simmons is their 3 ball threat, who is coming off one of his best shooting games this year - Mitchell is their big, who has been an absolute tank this year, and Charles who is just a very good player in every part of his game - that being said, the Bonnies have been inconsistent, especially in A10 play while SLU has continued to roll - Mitchell will have his hands full with Avila because Avila plays half of his game beyond the arc, and the other half in the paint - The pace of this game will be to fast for Mitchell - I can see SLU having a game plan along the lines of getting Mitchell switched on a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, and getting him in foul trouble early - The Bonnies 2nd option behind Mitchell, is a freshman, who has played good minutes, but nothing close to what SLU can do - after the freshman, is there 4/5, Big Red (nickname) - and Bonnies coach, just last week talked about how he still has a lot to learn, and it’s more of his basketball IQ, and not so much his performance - Buddy Simmons can flat out shoot the lights out of the gym - but he has been very inconsistent - that’s the game plan for SLU, and a lot of other teams that play the Bonnie’s, limit one, Simmons or Mitchell, and you have a very good chance of winning 

•SLU has the best defense thus far in the A10, only holding teams to an average of 65 PPG - Bonaventure allows over 50% of shots from inside the paint, which SLU will exploit - SLU is a top 20 team in the nation in the rebound category, while the Bonnie’s are bottom 3 in the A10 alone - Ever since Marshall and Irmakov went in the injury category for the Bonnie’s, they have been pretty bad, their backcourt and depth is basically gone (hence the 1-5 start in the A10) - I like SLU -8.5 in this spot here

**Last:** (CBB) Nebraska -11.5 (1.5u) - ❌🤢

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** (CBB) Indiana (-7.5) at Rutgers

**Start Time:** 6:00 PM ET (FS1)

**Odds:** -102 (FanDuel)

**Units:** 1.5U

**Reasoning:** Them: Indiana basketball is on a complete nose dive.

Me: Sweet. Let’s go bet on them!

After winning 12 of their first 15 games, the Hoosiers (12-7) welcomed then-No. 10 Nebraska into town on Jan. 10. Up 16 points with a little over 16 minutes to go, a statement-making victory appeared to be on the horizon. Instead, the team coughed up separate runs of 13-0 and 16-0 on its way to dropping a gut puncher, 83-77. The Hoosiers haven’t recovered since, losing each of their next three games by 14+ points. Not surprisingly, the team’s performance on both ends of the floor has suffered over those three games, scoring just 63.0 points on 40.5% shooting while conceding 80.3 points on 50.7% shooting. Yeeeeesh. 

And *this* is how we plan to get over a disgusting, disgusting beat from Wednesday night?

But before you scroll away, hear me out. Yes, the recent run of form has been putrid. Sure, the thought of dropping any amount of coin on this squad is downright terrifying. Yet upon closer examination, this is a game the Hoosiers should not only win, but win convincingly.

Six of the team’s seven losses have come against teams ranked in the Top 100 in NET ranking—at No. 1 Michigan, No. 8 Nebraska, at No. 11 Michigan State, No. 15 Louisville, No. 21 Iowa and at No. 30 Kentucky—with the other coming on the road at No. 83 Minnesota. Regardless of some of the scores in those contests, nobody could fault Indiana for losing to any of those opponents. 

Now, take a look at how the team has performed in nine games against opponents ranked outside of the Top 100 in NET rankings:


* Penn State (114): W 113-72 
* Marquette (142): W 100-77 
* Maryland (149): W 84-66 
* Siena (189): W 81-60 
* Milwaukee (230): W 101-70 
* Lindenwood (231): W 73-53 
* Bethune-Cookman (270): W 100-56 
* Alabama A&amp;M (307): W 98-51 
* Chicago State (352): W 78-58 


Not only are the Hoosiers 9-0 in those games, but they’ve won each game by 18+ points and by an average margin of 28.3 points. Furthermore, the team averaged 92 points on 51.6% shooting while conceding just 62.6 points and holding opponents to a meager 36.7% shooting from the floor. 

That’s alarming news for Indiana’s opponent Friday night: NET No. 154 Rutgers. 

The Scarlet Knights (9-10) enter on a bit of a slump themselves, after dropping two straight and three of their last four. But what stands out is how the team has struggled against teams ranked in the Top 50 in NET ranking:


* Michigan (1): L 101-60
* Purdue (5): L 81-65
* Illinois (9): L 81-55 
* Iowa (21): L 68-62 
* Tennessee (25): L 85-60
* Ohio State (35): L 80-73 
* Wisconsin (39): L 96-87 
* Seton Hall (45): L 81-59


Not only is Rutgers winless in eight tries, all but two of those loses came by nine or more points.

Through 19 games, the Scarlet Knights offense has been anything but efficient. The unit ranks 249th in three-point shooting (32.1%), 251st in offensive efficiency (1.012), 272nd in scoring (70.3 PPG) and 325th in field-goal percentage (40.9%). That could present numerous challenges against the Hoosiers—No. 36 NET ranking—who rank 43rd in opponent field-goal percentage (41.2%), 58th in opponent three-point shooting (30.8%), 59th in defensive efficiency (0.993) and 69th in scoring defense (69.9 PPGA). In those nine aforementioned games against opponents outside of the Top 100 in NET rankings, those numbers fall to just 62.6 points conceded on a porous 36.7% shooting from the field. 

Things don’t get much better on the opposite end of the floor.

On the year, Indiana ranks 44th in offensive efficiency (1.151), 67th in field-goal percentage (47.2%), 69th in scoring (81.1 PPG) and 94th in three-point shooting (35.4%). Those numbers improve to 92.0 points on a blistering 51.6% shooting from the field in those nine contests against opponents outside of the Top 100 in NET ranking. Furthermore, against the nation’s No. 2-ranked defense (Michigan) last time out, the Hoosiers finished with 1.027 points per possession—the fourth-highest mark for a Wolverines opponent this season. Saying Friday could be a long night for an underwhelming Rutgers defense—153rd in scoring defense (74.1 PPGA), 174th in opponent field-goal percentage (44.5%), 216th in defensive efficiency (1.067) and 318th in opponent three-point shooting (36.7%)—would be an understatement. 

Look for Indiana to take out its frustration Friday night and win this one by double-digits.

Also, PUKA FREAKING NACUA MY FANTASY GOAT!! Who else is in the semis in fantasy? Best of Luck with your matchup!!

• ⁠Model has Alabama winning by 3+

• ⁠There is an edge of 5-7% and the EV is looking like 7-10$ based on a 100$ bettor

• The model has this as a high confidence play - same as the past two plays

• This game is going down to the wire 100% - I think Bama has the better team, and last time they played, the turnovers are what killed em

• Model actually has Bama ML and Under 41.5 as the top plays - it is a tie, and the first time ever I am seeing this on my model... my gut tells me Alabama ML is the play, so I am rocking with that instead of the under

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Boxing🥊Jake Paul vs Anthony Joshua 10 P.M. E.T. U.S.A. (Exact start time not concrete) OVER 2.5 rounds. 

5 units

Saw this line go up to -183 in places and have been eyeing it since the fight was announced. -160 on betonline now, and -150 on bovada. Check your books if you agree with this bet to find the best value.

Ring sized announced 22x22 which is a little bigger than normal, giving Paul more room to run from Joshua. 

This brings back horror memories when I hammered (didn&#x27;t post on here) the over 5.5 rounds at (-110) and watched the line to explode to over 7.5 rounds well into the -200&#x27;s only to watch Joshua make him look like a girl and knock him down 3 times and out cold effortlessly in the opening rounds. Honestly was sketched out by how Nganou can beat and knock down the arguably better Tyson Fury (even in bad shape) and not last the opening rounds with Joshua.

Anyway if Nganou legitimately couldn&#x27;t last at all with Joshua being around 265lbs Jake Paul coming in weighing 40-50lbs less would seemingly not have a chance to do better one could think. However I&#x27;m betting the opposite.

Jake has much more boxing experience than Francis and will be more fleet of foot, and does know how to box well and avoid shots much better than Nganou. With the bigger ring allowing more room will benefit Jake more than Joshua. I think Jake starts out and quite possibly goes as long as he can picking his safest spots while focusing on survival more than inflicted damage as long as he can.

It just feels for me personally Jake never schedules in opponent that will end up embarrassing him. Him getting knocked out in under 2.5 rounds classifies as that. If he can duke out 6+ rounds in this fight i believe he&#x27;ll gain boxing respect. Both Fighters will/could end up walking from this winners from a money/status standpoint.

If Jake gets rocked early it takes a ton a value and appeal form future fights. If he somehow makes this a fight, that&#x27;s set ups even bigger money grabs in the future. I guess I&#x27;m willing to bet hard that this happens.</td></tr>

Last Pick: ✅Canadiens -1.5 (Chicago Blackhawks @ Montreal Canadiens) - The Blackhawks look lost on the ice without the young leadership of Bedard, and Montreal had a fairly easy time skating circles around them, finding their valuable scoring chances and playing strong defense, only surrendering a single goal in a 4-1 victory.

Hockey | NHL | Vancouver Canucks @ New York Islanders | 7 P.M. EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: New York Islanders -1.5 (+180)

Write Up: Although their superstar Bo Horvat will miss this game, the Islanders have played fairly consistently on both the offensive and defensive sides of the ice, even being one of the very few teams to take down the white-hot Avalanche in regulation this year. The Canucks, meanwhile, have traded away a top player in the league in Quinn Hughes, and look to really settle in for a rebuild type of season after a disappointing start. Although they’ve won their games since trading away Hughes, the Canucks cannot keep riding on their mediocre defense and anemic offensive pressure. The Islanders should strike hard, fast, and often, poking holes in the lackluster Canucks defense without Hughes, and will look to press the home ice advantage to a comfortable lead while fighting for the top spot in the Metro division.</td></tr>

Crewe ML v Bristol Rovers – League Two
Odds: 1.91 / -109 (Unibet)
Units: 3u

Second post, second win?  We’re two roommates posting these <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>’s and both been tailing loads here. Surely two brains work better than one? So far so good ;)
Now honestly… what are the bookies doing with this price? Crewe at 1.91 / -109 at home against a side that’s lost 10 league matches on the bounce feels generous. Instead of just looking at results, let’s break down the form, trends, and matchup.
Crewe host Bristol Rovers in a fixture that’s all about momentum versus a team in free fall. Crewe come into this off an impressive 4–1 away win at Tranmere (15th), while Bristol Rovers were comfortably beaten 3–0 by Swindon (3rd) and never really looked competitive.
The away form is the real concern. Bristol Rovers have lost 5 away matches in a row, conceding heavily throughout that run, including a 4–0 defeat away to Barnet (13th) in their most recent trip. On top of that, they’ll be without their starting centre-back through suspension, which only weakens an already fragile defensive unit.
Crewe at home are front-foot, aggressive, and rarely allow matches to drift. They consistently apply pressure and create chances, and while they’re not perfect defensively, they tend to outscore teams rather than sit back. At home this season, Crewe have:
·       Scored 3 against Shrewsbury
·       Scored 3 against Grimsby
·       Played high-scoring draws with Chesterfield and Newport
Their home games are rarely slow or cagey. Crewe push the tempo, keep opponents pinned back, and force mistakes — exactly the type of environment where Bristol Rovers struggle.
And it gets worse for the visitors. Bristol Rovers haven’t scored a league goal in their last 5 matches. Zero. Asking a side in that kind of scoring drought to get something away from home, against constant pressure, is a big ask.
Tactically, this is a poor matchup for Rovers. They tend to concede once their defensive structure breaks under sustained pressure, and Crewe’s home style is designed to do precisely that. The longer this game stays level, the more it favours the hosts.
One final note — not something to base a bet on, but worth mentioning — Crewe have never lost to Bristol Rovers in a league fixture. History doesn’t cash tickets, but it certainly doesn’t hurt. CMON CREWE!!!</td></tr>

Record: 6-6
Net Units: -1.0 

🏒Hurricanes at Panthers , 12/19/2025 Fri, 7 pm Eastern Time

Carolina can beat Florida on Friday because the Canes have been the more consistent “win-the-math” team this season—better record, better goal differential, and a style that reliably creates more zone time and shot volume—while Florida has been closer to break-even. On the year, Carolina sits at 22–9–2 (first in the Metro  and has a strong +18 goal differential (108 GF / 90 GA), while Florida is 18–13–2 with  98 GF / 99 GA.  That gap shows why the Hurricanes’ path is straightforward: they don’t need a perfect night to win. They can win by tilting the ice, limiting clean looks, and letting their depth convert. 

Carolina just beat Nashville 4–1 for their fifth straight win, and the game flow described is basically Carolina’s identity when they’re rolling.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Astra Nowa Sol vs Kluczbork U178.5 points 1.2 units to win 1U @ 1.83 (Bet365)

Write-up: Suspiciously generous from the betting gods now with TWO wins in a row now. And wow did they make it sweaty for us. Hadera went 25-15, 25-13 up and after being on a streak of winning 14/16 points and taking a 3-0 in the third set it’s fair to say I was cursing out the Nazareth players. I can’t really blame them though as I doubt they were expecting anyone to put their money on them. Yet they somehow won the third set 25-23 (and lost the next set to 6, I won’t speculate on what happened since they all count). Absolute cinema.

If it ain’t broke don’t fix it, volleyball for a third consecutive time here we go. I was debating between this and some Czech table tennis (yes we have fully lost the plot here), let’s hope I made the right choice although I expect both to win. We move to a less obscure league (comparative to Israeli women) in Poland where Astra will be hosting Kluczbork. The home team are 9th (out of 16) whilst the travelling side are 4th. Going to keep it nice and sweet, Astra have covered the under in 7/8 (88%) of their last league matches just as Kluczbork have. Sometimes there’s no need to read into it any further than that and this fixture earlier this year only produced 130 points. BOL !

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: 🥊 Jake Paul vs Anthony Joshua over 2.5 rounds (-140).

Fight starts at 11:30pm EST. Bet 5U

Writeup: I’m just going to start by saying tail with caution. Not because I’m not confident, but because I refuse to believe these Jake Paul fights are fully legitimate and my reasoning is based on such. Jake has fought so many people who are either way smaller or way older or don’t even box, and now we have someone who’s a true professional boxer in Anthony Joshua. Paul is like +700 to win this fight which is just dumb, in reality he should be getting knocked out in the first round. There is no way Jake’s team believes he can win this fight, and they most likely signed a promotional agreement forever ago and now have to go through the motions. But like so many of these other fights, this is for entertainment on Netflix and an easy way to make a stupid amount of money for them. Netflix and Joshua both want to make a spectacle and drag this out for views. I wouldn’t even be surprised if this goes the distance to make Jake look good. If Netflix and these two fighters don’t want to be made a mockery of, they’ll make sure this fight goes a respectable distance.

__Event:__ NCAAF: Alabama @ Oklahoma 8pm EST

__POTD:__ Alabama ML (-105), 3.15u to win 3u

__Write Up:__ The 1st game of the College Football Playoffs is here, as #9 Alabama (10-3) travels to Norman, Oklahoma to take on #8 Oklahoma (10-2). Bama is looking for revenge after the 2 teams faced off a month ago, where OU used 3 turnovers (including an 87 yard <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> six), to take down Bama 23-21 in Tuscaloosa. Bama had almost double the yards as OU (406-212) but couldn&#x27;t overcome costly turnovers as they lost their 1st home game in head coach’s Kalen DeBoer tenure. OU is looking to become the 1st team in history to beat Bama twice in the same year. They’re also looking for their 1st playoff win, with an 0-4 all time record in the CFP. OU finished their season strong, winning 4 in a row &amp; 5 of their last 6. Since the Week 12 win vs Bama, the OU has won low scoring affairs over Missouri &amp; LSU. Their 17-13 regular season finale win over LSU was a lot like my sex life. Very little scoring, lacked explosiveness, &amp; poor clock management. OU scored just 3 first half points, committed 3 turnovers, &amp; had 8 penalties that kept LSU in the game. Bama is also coming off a stinker in the SEC ship vs UGA. They were held scoreless until the 4th quarter, struggling to run the ball with just -3 rushing yards. Bama was a combined 4/17 on 3rd/4th down, with UGA dominating time of possession by 14 minutes. Bama will look to bounce back vs a defense they did well against a month ago.

Alabama OC Ryan Grubb loves to move the ball through the air. Bama has passed on 55% of their plays this season (22nd), but that elevated to 59.15% (10th) over their last 3 games. Bama QB Ty Simpson aired it out on OU in their first game. __Simpson threw for 326 yards, averaging 7.8 yards per pass &amp; 5.4 yards per play, both the 2nd highest rates vs OU this year.__ All anyone remembers from that game though are his turnovers. OU was extremely lucky as they’ve been poop at forcing turnovers this year. __OU has only forced 13 turnovers on the season (94th), ranking just 116th in ball hawk rate, making a play on the ball on just 10% of passes.__ This also was uncharacteristic for Simpson as he has been incredibly efficient this year. __Simpson has led an offense that ranks 12th in the nation in EPA/play (0.176).__ He has thrown for 3,268 yards (14th), with a 64% completion rate, 26 pass TD’s (12th) &amp; just 5 INT’s (2nd fewest among QB’s with 340+ attempts). His success through the air in his 1st game vs OU was in large part due to his offensive line. __Bama’s OL only allowed Simpson to be pressured on 27% of dropbacks. Bama’s OL ranks 29th pressure rate allowed this year.__ OU’s pass rush has only gotten worse throughout the season &amp; things only got worse when star DE Mason Thomas went down with an ankle injury Week 10 vs Tennessee. __Since Thomas’s injury, OU has ranked 82nd in pressure rate.__ Thomas is projected to return this week, but reports from practices are that he’s not at full strength. Last game, to prevent Simpson from dicing them up through the air OU was unable to blitz &amp; had to drop back in coverage. But with no pressure Simpson carved them up. Against no blitz this season Simpson has a 68% completion rate (26th), averaging 7.9 yards/pass (43rd), &amp; a positive EPA on 51% of passes (17th). Against a blitz Simpson only has a 55% comp rate (113th), avg 6.9 yards/pass (98th), &amp; a 43% positive EPA (80th). __When generating pressure this season OU allows just 4.4 yards per pass (9th) compared to 7.3 yards per pass with no pressure (43rd). With lack of pressure Simpson is able to take 3 step dropbacks 59% of plays (28th most). OU allows 8.2 yards per pass on 3 step drops (92nd).__ As for their ground game, Bama has lacked one this season &amp; OU has a great run D, so Bama will keep the ball in the air as it worked in the last matchup. Take away the uncharacteristic TO’s last game &amp; Bama wins by double digits. Their defense matches up great vs a not so great OU offense as well.

OU has the worst offense in the CFP. They are just 47th in the NCAA in EPA per play (0.054). __OU hasn’t scored more than 2 offensive TD’s in a game since Oct. 25. They avg just 26.4 points per game, fewest by a 10 win team in FBS. They only scored 21.5 points vs SEC opponents (11th in the SEC).__ OU also likes to throw the ball ranking top 50 in the nation in pass rate. OC Ben Arbuckle runs a ton of spread formations, which in turn creates light boxes for his RB’s on 68% of plays. But OU’s problem is their RB’s can’t break tackles. __Despite OU ranking 42nd in yards before contact due to light boxes, they only rank 103rd in yards after contact. Facing a light box they avg just 4.6 yards per carry (103rd). Bama allows 4.9 yards per carry with a light box (40th). Oklahoma was stuffed on over half their 26 rushing attempts in Week 12, finishing with a poor 27% Success Rate on passing downs. OU RB’s finished with just 35 yards. Over the past month OU has fallen outside the top 100 in Rushing Success Rate, Line Yards &amp; Stuff Rate.__ As for OU’s QB, John Mateer hasn&#x27;t been his normal self since suffering a hand injury halfway through the season. He also made a ton of mistakes vs LSU, was off vs Missouri, &amp; hasn&#x27;t ran the ball well. __Even before his thumb surgery, Mateer completed just 34% of his 15+ yard passes (116th). Post surgery that number dropped to 26%. Bama allows just 35% of passes 15+ yards (26th). The NCAA avg for available yards gained is 44%, OU has failed to eclipse 35% of available yards since Mateer came back. Mateer also has thrown 51% of his passes less than 5 yards since his return. Bama is elite at defending short passes allowing just 4.6 yards per pass on throws less than 5 yards (21st).__ Bama held OU to just 212 yards &amp; 4.2 yards per play last game, OU’s 2nd lowest rate of the year. It was OU’s worst performance of the year on 3rd downs, converting just 23%. Bama’s defense was also playing on their heels all game as Oklahoma was spotted an average starting field position at the 42 yard line. Meanwhile OU’s punter Grayson Miller had 6 punts for 280 yards with 3 inside the 20 yard line. Bama looks a tad different from their last matchup vs OU. Up to 13 players were out or limited in the SEC title Game 2 weeks ago, &amp; many of them have returned to the field, including RB Jam Miller. Bama did everything but win that first game against OU. The result will be different this week.

Writeup: This is a pretty weird stat line, but Bayern are a team usually hitting this line in most of their matches and have also hit it in their last 6/10 games. Its a slight risk in a weir market, but i expect Koln to start strong in their home stadium, but the quality of players in Bayern are just too good &amp; they probably will open the floodgates in the 2nd half (similar to the wolfsburg game)

**Write Up:** And we back <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> with UNLEESHING having its third run for the prep and ticks every box here. Bit injury plagued this horse has been, and has never got far enough into a preparation to get out over its ideal distance, which it sees <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Both runs this prep have been grouse without winning, first up was a deadset sit and sprint which did us no favours, however still was beaten under a length; and then last start was a bit of horror watch, but again we flashed home to be narrowly beaten.    
    
Now <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> we go up in distance another 150m, down in grade from a Saturday class race to a Wednesday, stay in fillies and mares grade, and to top it all off we draw barrier  2 with the worlds greatest jockey aboard.    
    
Stable is extremely confident, and the reason for the drop in grade is purely to knock off a confidence boosting win before taking on better targets in the future.    
    
My only knock/worry is the potential position in run. From barrier 2 I’d like to be 2nd pair, however the trainer has said he doesn’t care where the horse is (even 3 pairs back the inside) that it should be winning. Now if we do get a fair way back there is always the possibility of bad luck, so I’m hoping the goat jmac shows some positivity out of the gates.    
    
All that being said, UNLEESHING is different gravy to the other horses here, and provided the breaks come (faith in the best jockey), I think we should be way too good. GL

I don&#x27;t have much to say about this one. Bayern is just playing at an absurd level right now. They are unbeaten in the league with 14 wins and 2 draws, and every single Bundesliga match this season has gone over 2.5 goals. Köln sit 11th in the table and their recent form is far from convincing: 4 losses, 5 draws and just 1 win in their last 10 league matches. That lone victory came at home against Hamburg, one of the weakest sides in the league, who have collected only 2 points away from home all season. Bayern have covered the -1 handicap in 12 of their 16 league matches this season.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** FC Cologne +2.0 Asian Handicap, -114, 1 unit

**Write Up:** Going against the general consensus here as I think **Bayern are going to rotate the squad** amidst their busy schedule, giving Cologne a great opportunity to keep the scoreline respectable. I do expect a Bayern victory, but certainly don’t think it’s going to be a blowout. Giving Cologne a 2 goal headstart just to make the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> a bit more secure (in case Bayern don’t rotate or their attack clicks again) and I certainly back them to get it done. Bayern aren’t immune to narrow results and complacency could set in after an 8-1 hammering of Wolfsburg. If you want to take the BTTS Yes, I certainly don’t mind that either. Going in with just the standard unit to preserve the bankroll ahead of some crazy exciting cup clashes I’ve been eyeing up for a while. BOL and let’s delay the 30th loss just a bit ☘️🫡</td></tr>

**Tennis: Aus Open Qualifiers - McCabe v Kjaer Total Games Over 22.5 2U** $1.84 (Sportsbet) 12:10PM AEDT

Hopefully this timing appeases everyone.

* McCabe was steam rolling in the Canberra Challenger before beaten (as expected) by Blockx. He&#x27;s done very well though and it&#x27;s all behind a very strong first service game. Being able to generate 5 BP opportunities off the Blockx service game shows the kinda form he&#x27;s in.
* Kjaer is a young up and comer making his first attempt at the AO. He&#x27;s covers the court very well and is a strong ball rallier, evident with him regularly taking more than 50% of his opponents 2nd service games. He&#x27;s had much less prep than McCabe for this one and given more games leading in, I think he&#x27;d easily win it. His recent victory over Watanuki tells me he&#x27;s almost there and is still a very good chance of winning this and deserves to be the favourite.
* At their best, McCabe is nowhere close to Kjaer in terms of talent but I think his service game is so strong right now and the fact that he&#x27;s had more time on court to start the year and is playing in his home country gives him enough to come close in this match.

I can&#x27;t decide who&#x27;s going to win this match, which is a good indicator for me it could go the distance.

**Soccer | Bundesliga | RB Leipzig vs Freiburg**

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** RB Leipzig win &amp; BTTS @ 3.00 [1 unit]

**Reason:** RB Leipzig are almost perfect at home this season, with 6 wins from 7 games (1 loss). They have, however, failed to keep a clean sheet in 4 of those 7 games. They have lost their last 2 games by 3-1 scorelines, and so will be looking to return back to winning ways.

Freiburg are on a 3 game unbeaten run in the league (2 wins, 1 draw). However, away from home, they only have 1 win in their past 5 league games (1 draw, 3 losses). Finding the net hasn’t been an issue for them though, having scored 7 league games in a row, so they should be good for at least one goal.

**Tips:** Always appreciated but not required

Cologne vs Bayern Munich, over 4.5 goals @ 2.6

Bayern Munich’s aggressive style and depth in attack make high-scoring games common, especially against teams like Cologne. The visitors push the tempo from the start and rarely settle after scoring. Cologne at home tend to play more openly and can exploit space when Bayern commit numbers forward. With Bayern capable of a big score and Cologne likely to contribute, this matchup sets up well for goals. Over 4.5 at 2.60 is a strong value play.</td></tr>

LEIPZIG VS FREIBURG

Date: 14 JANUARY 2026 at 20:30

BET ON: Over / Under- Over +2.50

Odd: 1.58



\- RB Leipzig approaches this fixture with clear offensive intent but also notable defensive vulnerabilities, a combination that inherently supports an Over 2.50 goals outcome. Coach Ole Werner has publicly framed the match as a chance to “restart the season with rhythm” and stressed that Leipzig are “well-prepared” despite the unusual break caused by the snow cancellation — his words underline a desire for a dynamic, high-tempo game rather than cautious play. Werner also hinted that attackers like Timo Werner might feature, as he remains “in discussions” with the club and could return to the squad, giving Leipzig additional firepower up front.

\- Defensively, Leipzig’s setup remains stretched: injuries to Kampl, Klostermann, Nusa, and Bakayoko force structural adjustments and weaken their ability to cope with transitions once their press is bypassed — an issue critics in Germany have repeatedly flagged as leading to goals conceded. Freiburg coach Julian Schuster, meanwhile, has emphasised his side’s confidence and offensive rhythm, praising his squad’s ability to respond and contribute goals, especially through substitutes — which underscores his intent to keep attacking rather than sitting back.

\- Schuster’s remarks and recent team news also highlight that Freiburg will not shy away from an open contest; while they struggle historically away at Leipzig, Schuster has publicly spoken about focusing on Leipzig’s strengths and exploiting spaces between the lines — language typical of coaches who plan to counter-attack and invite pressure as a pathway to goals.

\- Finally, German previews note that Leipzig’s home offensive numbers are among the league’s strongest, while Freiburg’s defensive record away is far from secure, adding a statistical backbone to the tactical picture that supports multiple goals.

\- All told, with both teams motivated to push forward, Leipzig’s injury-forced defensive shifts, Freiburg’s attacking confidence, and coaches indicating a proactive rather than cautious mindset, the conditions are aligned for a match exceeding 2.5 goals.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Bayern Munich -2 vs. Köln @ 1.91 (5u)

Write Up:

Gonna keep it simple <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> and hammering the one of the best team in the world to cover a spread.

I’m taking Bayern Munich -2 because they are in video game mode right now. They just destroyed Wolfsburg 8-1 this past weekend. Their offense is clicking perfectly with Harry Kane and Olise scoring for fun, and they are averaging nearly 4 goals per game.

On the other side, Köln is struggling bad. They are winless in their last 5 league games and have conceded a goal in 11 straight matches. Their defense is leaking, and they already lost 4-1 to Bayern in the Cup earlier this season.

Bayern is fresh off a blowout, fully healthy, and chasing records. Köln is just trying to survive. Expecting another comfortable multi-goal win here.

We have a matchup of backup goalies with a total at 5.5. For the Rangers, I’m guessing it’s going to be Quick again for his 5th straight outing. If not, it would be their 3rd string Spencer Martin. Quick has given up 3, 4, 6, and 3 in his last 4 starts.

On the other side, Ottawa has been starting their backup Leevi Merilainen who has started in 9 straight games (tonight is his 9th straight). He has even been playing in back to back games. If Merilainen doesn’t make his 10th straight appearance on Wednesday, it would be Hunter Shepard in goal, who was called up from the AHL over the weekend. Merilainen has given up 3 goals in 4 straight starts and has a .854 save percentage in his last month.

Date: 14 January 2026
Time: 20:30 (Amsterdam time)
<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Bayern Munich -2 Asian Handicap @ +100 (Bet365)
Stake: 2 units

Write Up:

Last pick didn’t get settled since Brandt didn’t start, stake back, and we move on.

I’m backing Bayern Munich -2 Asian Handicap away at Köln.

Bayern are on a completely different level compared to Köln and the recent form is scary. In their last five games they’re averaging 4.4 goals scored while conceding just 0.8. On top of that, they just sent a message this weekend by thrashing Wolfsburg 8-1 at home. When Bayern get rolling, games can get ugly fast.

Köln really struggle against top teams, especially defensively. They give up a lot of chances and don’t cope well with sustained pressure, which is exactly what Bayern bring for 90 minutes.

We’ve also seen this matchup recently. On 29 October 2025, Bayern went to Köln in the DFB Pokal and won 1-4, again showing how big the quality gap is.

Quick explanation of the line: Asian Handicap -2 means Bayern need to win by three goals or more for the bet to win. If Bayern win by exactly two goals, it’s a push and the stake comes back. Anything less and the bet loses.

You could wait for the line-ups in case Bayern rotate a bit, which is always possible with their schedule. That said, even if they do rotate, they still have ridiculous depth with players like Lennart Karl and Nicolas Jackson potentially coming off the bench. Just keep in mind that if you wait for line-ups, the odds will likely drop.

At +100, I’m happy to take this now. A 3-0, 4-1 or even bigger scoreline wouldn’t surprise me at all.

**Last:** (CBB) Michigan State -6.5 (1.5u) - Pending

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** (CBB) No. 13 Illinois (-9.5) at Northwestern 

**Start Time:** 8:30 PM ET (BTN)

**Odds:** -102 (FanDuel)

**Units:** 1.5U

**Reasoning:** Superman has his kryptonite. Achilles has his heel. Illinois has… playing on the road at Northwestern?

Yes, the Illini (13-3) have posted an impressive 145-45 all-time record against their Big Ten foe. Sure, under head coach Brad Underwood, the team is 11-5 in the series. However, Illinois is just 3-4 over its last seven trips to Evanston, including dropping each of the last three. That includes a frustrating overtime defeat last season in which the team coughed up a double-digit lead late in the second half.

Fortunately, this year’s Wildcats (8-8) have made a living snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. 

In six of its eight losses this season, Northwestern has held leads of seven or more points with under 13 minutes to go. The proof isn’t that hard to find, as the team saw second-half leads disappear in each of its past three games against Minnesota (67-60 w/ 4:39 remaining), Michigan State (45-38 w/ 12:36 remaining) and Rutgers (65-59 w/ 2:33 remaining)—the Wildcats lost all three contests. With a March Madness bid all but gone, and staring down an 0-6 start to conference play, the team appears ready to be put out of its misery.

Look for a revenge-minded, lethal Illini offense to deliver the kill shot. 

Through 16 games, the unit ranks 2nd in offensive efficiency (1.234), 30th in scoring (86.0 PPG), 55th in field-goal percentage (47.7%) and 122nd in three-point shooting (34.8%). It’s become a game of “<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> Your Poison” for opposing defenses, as Illinois boasts four players averaging 12.4 points per game or better. That has disaster written all over it for a suddenly-reeling Northwestern defense that ranks 63rd in opponent field-goal percentage (41.6%), 94th in scoring defense (71.2 PPGA) and 113th in defensive efficiency (1.014). Not surprisingly, those numbers have ballooned to 79.0 points per game conceded on 47.6% shooting over the team’s three-game slide. 

Conversely, the Wildcats have the nation’s leading scorer in Nick Martinelli (24.1 PPG) and not much else. 

On the season, the team ranks 54th in field-goal percentage (47.7%), 67th in offensive efficiency (1.127), 100th in scoring (79.1 PPG) and 294th in three-point shooting (30.8%). Over the last three games, those numbers have dropped to 73.0 points per game on just 42.7% shooting (26.9% from beyond the arc). Things won’t get any easier against an Illini defense that ranks 20th in opponent field-goal percentage (39.5%), 34th in scoring defense (67.4 PPGA), 44th in defensive efficiency (0.968) and 66th in opponent three-point shooting (30.9%). The unit has been more suffocating as of late, only conceding just 58.4 points per game on a meager 35.2% shooting (24.3% from deep) over its last five games. 

Look for Illinois to impose its size advantage on Wednesday night.

Per KenPom, the team ranks 1st in average height and 4th in effective height. That advantage has been evident on the glass, where the Illini rank 9th in total rebounding (42.3 per game), 13th in defensive rebounding (27.2) and 20th in offensive rebounding (11.9) while ranking 8th in opponent defensive rebounding (18.5), 28th in opponent total rebounding (31.3) and 208th in opponent offensive rebounding (9.3). Furthermore, the team also ranks 16th in blocks (5.4) and 18th in second-chance points (15.3). That all adds up to what could be a long night for a Northwestern team that ranks 233rd in opponent second-chance points (11.8), 247th in total rebounding (33.6) and 288th in opponent offensive rebounding (10.2). 

But the X factor in this one might just be Illinois’ ability to get to the charity stripe. 

Thus far, the team ranks 28th in drawing fouls (20.6 per game). But not only that, the Illini makes good on those opportunities, ranking 4th in free-throw percentage (79.8%). That includes shooting 27-32 (84.3%) from the line over its last two games. Conversely, the Wildcats rank 229th in fouls committed (18.5). 

Look for Illinois to finally conquer its own personal House of Horrors and cruise by double-digits.

Time: Cavaliers 4:00 PM Central | Raptors 6:00 PM Central

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Cavaliers ML + Raptors ML

Bet 2 units to win 1.2

Why: Cleveland has been beating teams comfortably, and the matchup sets up perfectly for them against a group that hasn’t been able to stay competitive or cover big numbers lately. Their offense is rolling, and the gap in recent form feels too big to ignore. Toronto is in a similar spot—playing with momentum, consistently covering, and facing an opponent that’s completely out of rhythm and struggling on both ends. The Raptors’ pace and efficiency have been carrying them, and against a team on a long skid, that usually translates into a clean win. Put the two together, and you’ve got a parlay where both sides are trending up against opponents trending down. It’s the kind of spot where the favorites should simply take care of business.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** 🇸🇮 Slovenia to Win or Draw and ⚽️ Under 2.5 goals in total @ 1.83, 3 units  
  
**Write Up:** Both teams are very solid defensively, but don’t offer much in the way of going forward. Kosovo needs at least a point to secure a play-off spot, so I can see them being even more defensive than usual. On the other hand, Slovenia hasn’t scored a single goal in their last three matches (including a 0-0 draw to Kosovo) and to make things worse, their main source of attacking threat, Šeško, is out injured. Goals have, however, eluded Kosovo in these qualifiers too, with just 3 strikes in 4 matches so far and considering they’re playing away against a slightly stronger Slovenia side, I don’t think they’re going to see many clear scoring chances. Not to mention, a draw is enough to secure at least a play-off spot, so they’re not going to have an incentive to go forward in numbers. To summarize, two defensively sound teams with underwhelming attacks are going head to head. I can definitely see this being a low scoring affair, ending in a draw or a narrow Slovenia win, so I’m very confident in this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> Under 3.5 goals if you want to play it extra safe.</td></tr>

I chose this for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, and after a lot of back and forth, settled for the simplest play.

I also like a combo of alt under and alt spread, but there is some risk that Oklahoma doesn&#x27;t pull a break if there is an early big lead, and we see something like a 134-106 win.

Everyone can find stats, injuries, and streaks. I would add a few here:
- Thunder covered the spread in the last 14/16 against teams with a losing record
- Hornets failed to cover the spread in 9/10 last games against Western Conference teams
- Last night, OT against Milwaukee, and after a big fight, such a big OT loss has to impact Hornets on some level. They know they can&#x27;t win this, and Oklahoma is a well-oiled system that crushes opponents.</td></tr>

Not much to say here other than Ireland are one of the best teams in the world, playing at home against a somewhat injured and battered Australia team who are likely to lose their 3rd game in a row.

Ireland are looking for a big performance and have brought in the big guns after starting a slightly different side last week against Japan in their 41-10 win.

Spor Toto - Giresunspor 🤾 Handball Türkiye Superlig

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Giresunspor +7.5 Handicap @ 1.85

I&#x27;ll say the most important thing right up front. The announced odds for this match are incorrect. It should have opened at +3.5, but it opened at +7.5. Now let&#x27;s move on to the information.



Spor Toto (last 5 matches)

04:10: Nilüfer 29–31 Spor Toto (D) ✅

11:10: Spor Toto 35–27 Güneysu ✅

25:10: Spor Toto 38–30 Köyceğiz ✅

06:11: Beşiktaş 38–27 Spor Toto (D) ❌

09:11: DEPSAŞ Enerji AS 34–31 Spor Toto (D) ❌

Average: 32.4 goals scored / 31.6 conceded (total ≈ 64.0), difference per match: +0.8.



Giresunspor (last 5 matches)

01:10: Trabzon BŞB 29–36 Giresunspor (D) ✅

04:10: Giresunspor 33–30 Mihalıççık ✅

11:10: İstanbul Gençlik 35–31 Giresunspor (D) ❌

25:10: Beykoz 28–34 Giresunspor (D) ✅

08:11: Giresunspor 50–25 Ankara Handball ✅

Average: 37.8 goals scored / 28.4 conceded (total ≈ 66.2), difference per match: +9.4.



Competing in the Süper Lig for the first time, Giresunspor is one of the most notable teams of the season. In their 11 matches, they have accumulated 13 points with a record of 6 wins, 1 draw, and 4 losses, and are currently in 6th place. The Black Sea team has made a significant breakthrough by winning their last three matches, particularly their last match, a crushing 50-25 victory over Ihtisas Handball. The team&#x27;s biggest goal is to secure a spot in the top six playoff spots in their first season in the league and qualify for European competitions. They aim to extend their winning streak to four matches with a win. This match will be a more competitive one for Giresun, who lost 37-45 to Beşiktaş, the league&#x27;s best team. The +7.5 handicap is unreasonable and unrealistic. There are no reports of injuries for Giresun. They will continue their progress under the leadership of Batıkan Başkök and Hakan Kımıl. They are in good form and will use their full potential in this match.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s pick</mark>: Air Force +7.5 vs UConn  -115 on FD.

Analysis: Terrible spot for UConn here laying 7.5 points after an over performance against Duke last week. Air Force comes in with one of the nation’s top rushing attacks and is second in the country in rush yards per game. UConn meanwhile ranks 107th nationally in defending the rush. The last time UConn played a somewhat similar offense it struggled and lost outright against Rice, who is significantly worse than AFA in my opinion. This game has upset alert written all over it but I’ll take the points. </td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Alabama -6 @ 1.90 (2u)

**Last Pick:** Croatia ML + Under 3.5 Goals ❌

Bit unlucky for Faroe Islands to get an early goal through a deflection but Croatia still created a heap of chances to score their goals even though only 4 of them were on target. Frustrating to lose this one as I was tossing up between it and Faroe Islands +2.5 but no excuses, moving onto the next one, let&#x27;s turn this around.

**Write Up:**  
Going with Alabama -6 here, and the stats from the preview really back this one up. Ty Simpson has been super reliable at QB - completing 66.9% of his passes with 21 TDs and just 1 INT on the year. That kind of efficiency is exactly what you want when laying points at home.

The biggest edge Alabama has is the turnover battle. They’re sitting at +10, which ranks 7th nationally, while Oklahoma hasn’t been nearly as strong in that area. Bama forcing extra possessions at home is a huge advantage.

Defensively, Alabama have been way better than they get credit for. They’re holding opponents to just 5.2 yards per dropback and only a 37.9% passing success rate, which is legit top-tier stuff. That matches up really well against an Oklahoma offense that’s been fine, but not super explosive - especially on the ground, where they’re only at 3.9 yards per carry.

And then there’s the home-field factor. Alabama have won 17 straight home games, so covering under a touchdown in Tuscaloosa just feels like the right side. Oklahoma are solid, but Bama’s efficiency, defensive pressure, and turnover edge give them too many paths to a 7+ point win.</td></tr>

**Spain v Georgia**

Spain is the obvious favorite in this matchup, so I&#x27;ve picked Liverpool goalie Mamardashvili make at least 4 saves here. **Every goalie Spain has faced in this qualification phase has made 4 saves or more**, including Mamardashvili at their earlier meeting. He&#x27;s been getting game time at Liverpool after Allisson&#x27;s injury. And with Liverpool&#x27;s recent form he&#x27;s been getting lots of shots pumped towards him to practice his saves. I see Spain doing the same and with doing so, giving Mamardashvili the chance to shine for Georgia. Adding onto this I&#x27;ve also put Spain to shoot target at least 7 times. With Spain dominating I think this is a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> that will come through. **Spain has shot on target at least 7 times in 8 out of their 10 most recent matches**. Even when facing better opponents. Only Portugal and Denmark managed to hold them off from shooting, but it was still 6 times in those matches. **They shot 7 times when they faced Georgia earlier in the group**.

Historically against pacers Barnes has averaged 36.7 PRA in his last 10 matchups.

The Pacers are undermanned and rank 27th in defensive rating (122.7) and 26th in opponent PRA allowed (207.3). This creates exceptional conditions for a player like Barnes to take advantage of.
 
I expect raps to control pace paired with Barnes ability to exploit this weaker front court with his versatility and strong leaping ability allowing him to out maneuver on the glass.

With that being said I expect Barnes to produce a well rounded stat line for this match up.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Alexis Lafreniere over 1.5 SOG (-140)

One of the more frustrating matches I&#x27;ve watched in some time as Zverev commits 27 unforced errors, including 18 in a 2nd set he had numerous chances to win.  Despite all that bullshit, he just barely loses the 2nd by a lone minibreak.  Some might call it a bad beat but honestly it was just not a great play by me and what I deserve for betting on this nutbag.

After this first loss since coming back to posting for the degen community I&#x27;m going back to my most reliable bet: Laffy shots on goal.  As a die-hard Ranger fan, this is an autobet from me every single game as I think sportsbooks severely underprice this all the time, but ESPECIALLY as of Monday.  What changed Monday?  The Rangers called up their top prospect Gabe Perreault and moved him up to line 1 with Zibanejad/Miller and got Trocheck back from injury, allowing them to reunite the line of Laf/Panarin/Trocheck which has been a staple for the past couple seasons. Having watched every Ranger game of his career, I can tell you that when Laf plays with certain linemates like Zibanejad, he overpasses into oblivion (as many Rangers have a frustrating propensity to do) and constantly defers to him.  But when he plays with Panarin, the best forward on the team and one of the most talented passers in the league, it&#x27;s Panarin who plays the part of set-up man and Laf who gets to rip one-t&#x27;s on the off wing as a lefty playing on the right side.  If you don&#x27;t play hockey just trust me; this is the good stuff you dream of as a goal scorer.  Add in the fact that Columbus games are often fast-paced slugfests and they give up the 4th most shots against per game in the NHL and you have the recipe for what should be a fun Saturday night of hockey and hopefully a cash by the 2nd period.  Personally will be laddering this up to 4 and also taking Rangers TT over 2.5, but Laf 2+ SOG is the official <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>.   Should be a fun one.

**Write-up:**  
First leg Malcolm Wellmaker moneyline. His opponent is taking this fight on less than 48 hours’ notice. Malcolm’s original opponent, Cody Haddon, was a much tougher matchup and he was preparing for that. When Haddon pulled out, the UFC brought in a regional guy who took the fight for a quick 10k contract. Malcolm should run through this guy, probably a round-one KO. I’m sticking with the ML just to stay on the safer side.

Second leg, Islam Makhachev wins by submission or on points.  JDM is the welterweight champion defending his belt for the first time, and Islam is moving up from lightweight to go for his second belt. This is a tough matchup and Islam recognises it. JDM is a clean boxer, and Islam isn’t going to stand and trade with him. He’ll try to take this to the mat and work for a submission, controlling the fight on the ground. That’s why I don’t really see a KO coming from Islam in this spot, and so I took him to win by sub or on points.

Event: Oklahoma @ Alabama (2:30pm central)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: under 47 (-120) (1U)

-everything is bet to win unit amount-

Write up: 

My <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> tomorrow is the under 47 in the Alabama game: I feel like everyone sees these two top 15 teams getting together and immediately thinks “fireworks”. When in reality Oklahoma is sporting a legit fucking defense, and although Alabama has seemed all high and mighty, they actually are super one dimensional (take it from me I go to bama) and let me be very clear, I could not care less about bama😂 my alliance is with my bankroll, and I think this game tomorrow will be closer than people expect. And low scoring.


Now let’s get into the numbers. Oklahoma’s defense is the real deal — they’re giving up just 14.1 points per game and holding opponents to about 264 total yards per game. That’s only 4.2 yards per play allowed, and their pass defense is suffocating at 182 yards per game with just 6.0 yards per attempt. This isn’t some bend-and-break unit either; inside the red zone they force teams to grind for points instead of handing out easy touchdowns. That’s the exact kind of defense that keeps totals under.


On the flip side, Oklahoma’s offense isn’t built to light up the scoreboard. They average 374 yards per game and 5.5 yards per play, which is middle-of-the-pack at best. Their QB John Mateer is back from injury, but he’s been more of a caretaker than a playmaker. Translation: this team’s identity is defense first, offense second. And if you’ve been tracking their totals, you know they’ve been an under machine — 7 of their 9 games have gone under this season.


Alabama, meanwhile, looks strong on paper with 32.8 points per game, but dig deeper and you’ll see cracks. Their run game is flat-out pedestrian at 3.6 yards per carry and only 112 rushing yards per game. That’s not the Alabama hammer we’re used to. And now they’re facing an Oklahoma run defense that allows just 2.5 yards per carry. If Bama is stuck in 2nd-and-9 and 3rd-and-7 all night, this game slows down in a hurry.


Yes, Ty Simpson has been efficient through the air with an 8.3 yards per attempt average and a ridiculously low interception rate (0.32% — second nationally), but Oklahoma’s secondary isn’t soft. They’re holding opponents to 6.0 yards per attempt and can get pressure with a 6.92% sack rate. That means Simpson has to be both careful and explosive against a defense that doesn’t give freebies.


Third downs and red zone trips are where this game tilts toward the under. Alabama converts about 47–48% on third down, but Oklahoma’s defense only allows 30% conversions. That’s a huge clash. And in the red zone, Alabama’s defense is elite, allowing scores on just 70.8% of trips, while Oklahoma’s offense cashes in at 100%. The net effect? More field goals, fewer touchdowns — exactly what you want when betting an under.


Both teams have elite defenses, both offenses have ceilings, and the market nudged this total a tick too high after Oklahoma’s recent scoring bump. Bottom line: this isn’t fireworks, it’s a slugfest. Oklahoma’s defense is too good, Alabama’s run game is too weak, and both teams lean toward lower-scoring scripts. I’m riding with the under 47 all day. Let’s keep our record of no b2b losses, as always, cheers 🍻</td></tr>

Units: 3 Units

Reasoning: Going with a two legger for this college football Saturday and well be tailing the Notre Dame Fighting Irish and the Georgia Bulldogs. Starting off I like the Fighting Irish for many reasons. This Notre Dame team has won seven straight games after dropping their first two games against really good teams Miami and Texas A&amp;M. They have crushed the teams they have beat in their seven straight wins with a win margin of over 26 points across those games. This Irish team runs the ball particularly well as they average 195 rushing yards per game and they have efficient quarterback play as quarterback CJ Carr averages over 250 passing yards a game, over 10 yards per pass attempt, 19 passing touchdowns to just 4 interceptions and 2 rushing touchdowns. The Irish are also paired with a stout defense that only allows 18 points per game which is 17th nationally. I also like the Georgia Bulldogs over the Texas Longhorns at home in this one. These teams have similar competition playing in the SEC and there are 3 teams both of these teams have played so far and Georgia has performed much better against all three of those teams. Both of these teams played Kentucky and Texas barely scraped by winning a 16-13 overtime game while Georgia completely dominated Kentucky 35-14. Similarly both of these teams played Mississippi State and Texas pulled off a late comeback forcing overtime beating Mississippi State 45-38 while Georgia blew out Mississippi State 41-21 in a game that was over by halftime. Lastly Texas played Florida and got handed an embarrassing loss 29-21 to the Gators while the Bulldogs beat the Gators 24-20 and couldve put more points on the board if they didnt kneel the game out at the Florida one yard line. Also Arch Mannings quarterback play has been inconsistent this year along with the run game struggling especially in conference play this year. They face off against a solid Georgia defense who excels at stopping the run so I think they will force the Longhorns into passing down and force Arch Manning to turn the ball over in this one. Another factor in this one is that Georgia has the home field advantage in this one and it is extremely hard to beat Georgia in Sanford Stadium in front of a sell out crowd in a night game. With all of this being said I like Notre Dame and Georgia to handle business in their contests this Saturday.

Prediction: 34-23 Notre Dame, 20-16 Georgia

Last pick:🏈Panthers ML/Bills ML💩Stinky shitty.

Best of luck to everyone tailing and remember to bet responsibly lets have a great Saturday!!🍀💜🐉

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Grimsby Town to score o1.5 vs Chesterfield. 3u @ 2.02

Grimsby are the best attacking side in the league, and even more so at home. They&#x27;ve also got great underlying numbers; best expected goals for, and best expected points total.

- Grimsby average over 2 goals at home this league season, and 1.9 in all games. 
- They&#x27;ve scored o1.5 in 71% of home games in the league and 80% of total games 
- Over the season, Grimsby&#x27;s xG ratio (how much of the xG pie they get per game) is a league leading 63.5%
- Chesterfield are a much worse team on the road, with 8 points on the road compared to 16 at home.
- Chesterfield are conceding about 1.5 xG per game over their last ten.
- They&#x27;ve have only kept one clean sheet away from home all season, which was against relegation candidates, and IMO, worst team in the league, Cheltenham

I love Grimsby to win this, I&#x27;ve got a bunch of bets with variations of this with the win - but I like the odds to score o1.5 too much considering. 

--------------------------------

Side note, extra bet. 

Bosnia play Romania in a WCQ game. I like backing them ML or double chance as a hedge because.... Well, basically to cut a long story short. 

- Romania (3rd in their group) are 3 points behind Bosnia (2nd in their group) with two games left for each. 
- Romania&#x27;s last game is vs San Marino 
- Due to some convoluted rule regarding Nations League impacting WCQ, San Marino can actually be bottom of their group and playoff for a World Cup spot if Romania come second in the group</td></tr>

Their starting 5 are fit and have played a few games together now, with different guys stepping up each night. The Pacers are missing so many players through injury, they’re 1-11 for the season and have lost 5 in a row ATS. The difference in quality is just too high, and this game could be a very lopsided affair.  No need to overthink it here, let&#x27;s just back this Raptors team that is on a solid run!

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Sport Recife +2.5 corner handicap (or +3 European handicap) vs Flamengo 2.2U to win 2U @ 1.90 (Bet365)

Write-up: Definitely the worst <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> I’ve posted on here, at least there’s no more international football for a while. The league games are a lot easier and reliable to analyse so it was a mistake on my end to go for this play. England dominated the game as they’ve been doing under Tuchel, taking the lead through Saka in the first half before an Eze goal buried the Eagles late in the second. Kostić got booked late for a foul but that was the only fight Serbia really showed, as if they didn’t realise they’re out of the race to the World Cup.

Recife were promoted to the Serie A this year following a 3rd place finish in the second division. This season has been a disaster though, sitting with just 2 wins after 32 games and a tragic 17 points amidst financial difficulty. They’re basically relegated (not yet mathematically but it would require them to win their last 6 the three teams in front of them to lose all so you get the point) so have nothing to lose. Flamengo are neck-and-neck with Palmeiras at the top of the league, only being second as Brazil implements a most wins system to settle points ties. Flamengo impressed at the Club World Cup (which was in the middle of their season) where they beat Chelsea and lost to Bayern in the RO16 in a pretty tight game.

Despite Recife’s awful form, at home they’ve averaged 5.8 corners won + 4.4 conceded this season compared to Flamengo’s 5.5 won + 4.3 conceded on average in their last 20 on the road. Using recent form and all things considered I get an expected 5.2 Recife corners and 5 from the away team. That gives this play a 76% chance of winning. Yes the Mengão should control possession which is a concern for corners but remember this is Brazilian football, teams don’t just park the bus they’re constantly attacking. These two faced off just 2 weeks ago at the Maracaña and the line was cleared (9-8) despite the 3-0 win. Recife have also covered the line in 14/16 home matches this year (even having more corners than Palmeiras, Bahia and Mirassol who are make up the other 3 of the top 4), whilst opponents have in 14/20 against Flamengo at home so I really like this spot.

Leon Edwards has never been knocked out in the UFC but he’s never faced a striker like Prates in his lengthy career.

__Event:__ NCAAF: Texas @ Georgia 7:30pm EST

__POTD:__ Georgia -6.5 (-110), 3.3u to win 3u

__Write Up:__ Want to start by saying I’m a Georgia Tech fan so choosing Georgia (UGA) as my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> makes nauseous, but it’s my favorite play of the day. With a family &amp; friends that are filled with UGA fans I’ve watched every game this season, so I went back &amp; watched all of Texas games. As for the implications of this game. If Alabama &amp; Texas A&amp;M win out, that&#x27;s the SEC Championship. As for UGA, if Bama loses to Oklahoma (game will be finishing up while UGA vs Texas is starting), or they lose to Auburn, then UGA goes to the SEC ship if they win this. For the playoffs, if they win this they’re in. For Texas, they have to win out to make playoffs. Huge game.

The #10 Texas Longhorns (7-2) are traveling to Athens, GA for the first time ever to take on the #5 Georgia Bulldogs (8-1). Texas is coming off a bye week &amp; are riding into the game on a 5 game win streak after winning 2 close games vs Vanderbilt &amp; Mississippi St. Every Texas game feels like they are trying to invent new ways to come as close as possible to losing, without blowing it. But this is a big one as UGA beat them both games last season, including eliminating them from the Playoffs. As for UGA they are coming off a 41-21 road win @ Mississippi St (same team Texas went to OT with). Their only loss came to #4 Alabama on the season (by 3 points) &amp; they have been on a tear. Mostly due to the late season surge of Junior QB Gunner Stockton.

UGA QB Gunner Stockton has played some elite football lately. __In his last 3 games Gunner has thrown for 9 TD’s (most in SEC), 776 yards, with a 72% completion percentage.__ He also has showed up majorly in big games this season. __In his 3 games vs ranked teams he threw for 62/82, 75.6% completion pct, 723 yards, 8.8 yards per pass, 7 TDs, &amp; 0 INTs.__ He’s barely being mentioned in any Heisman conversation despite is elite stats. __He ranks 3rd in QBRating in the NCAA (89.4) &amp; 2nd in the NCAA in QB EPA. He has only been intercepted twice this entire season.__ Where Gunner has excelled the most this season is on quick passes. __49% of his throws have been 5 yards or less. On those throws, UGA averages 7.0 yards per pass, 6th in NCAA.__ Huge upgrade from their 5.6 yards under Carson Beck last year. Texas sucks at defending short passes. __On throws 5 yards or less Texas has allowed 5.4 yards per pass (74th).__ One of Texas’s strengths is their DLine &amp; their ability to rush the QB. __Texas ranks 19th in opponent adjusted pressure rate. But they struggle generating pressure vs quick passes, ranking 70th in pressure.__ The Longhorns have been torched through the air their last 2 games. The last 2 QB’s vs Texas: __Vandy QB Diego Pavia: 27-38, 365 yards &amp; 3 TD’s (He set his CAREER HIGH vs Texas in yards &amp; completions) - Miss St QB Blake Shapen: 26/42, 381 yards &amp; 4 TD’s (CAREER HIGHS for the 13th/16 rated QB in the SEC).__

UGA Offensive Coordinator Mike Bobo has ran a balanced offense all season, but he most likely will lean on Gunner’s arm as Texas has a pretty good run defense. __Texas’s run d ranks 5th in yards before contact allowed &amp; 13th in yards after contact allowed. UGA RB’s ranks 53rd in yards before contact &amp; 29th in yards after contact.__ Gunner is going sling it. On the other side of the ball is Peyton &amp; Eli’s cousin.

Texas runs a pass heavy offense with QB Arch Manning, under head coach &amp; play caller Steve Sarkisian. Texas has thrown the ball at a rate 4.3% above expected. That number is going to be even higher this week as UGA’s run defense matches up perfectly vs Texas. __Georgia ranks 11th in yards before contact allowed &amp; 12th in yards after contact allowed. Texas ranks 112th in yards before contact &amp; 92nd in yards after contact.__ Normally Sarkisian can find a way to get somewhat of a run game going with his spread offense disallowing opposing defenses to stack the box. That won’t work vs UGA. __Against a light box, Georgia allows just 3.8 yards per carry to opposing RB’s, 9th best in the country.__ The Longhorns just haven’t been able to get much going on the ground. __Texas ranks just 83rd in rushing success rate.__ This game is going to come down to if Arch Manning can carry this offense. __Arch ranks 12th out of 16 QB’s in the SEC in QB Rating.__ Although he hasn’t played great this season, he has at least gotten a little better as the season progressed. But he’s got some problems that are hard to fix, &amp; one of them is handling pressure. One of UGA’s biggest problems this season has been getting to opposing QB’s. __UGA ranks 88th in opponent-adjusted pressure rate generated. However they did have to face strong SEC offenses in pressure allowed: Ole Miss 14th, Alabama 21st, Tennessee 57th. This is a game that they finally have an advantage in pressure as Texas ranks 119th in pressure allowed.__ UGA’s biggest weakness they actually have as an advantage for the first time this season. As for Arch Manning’s biggest weakness, he is a horrible decision maker when he has to sit in the pocket &amp; read opposing defenses. Like his uncles Peyton &amp; Eli, Arch has been primarily a pocket passer all season. __Arch has taken a traditional dropback of 3+ steps on 62% of his dropbacks. On those dropbacks, Manning has been pressured 53% of the time, the 12th highest rate in the NCAA.__ But that’s mostly due to Arch taking forever to make a read. Most of his pressures are his own fault. To counteract that most playcallers will run plays with quick dropbacks which makes it easier on the QB limiting decision making &amp; pressure. __But Steve Sarkisian has only used quick dropbacks 18% of the time (117th) &amp; only does it when he has a comfortable lead. Arch’s 3 worst games this season were his 3 lowest quick dropback rates: Ohio State: 8.8%, Florida: 12.2%, Kentucky: 18.8%. When trailing, Arch has used a quick dropback just 14% of the time compared to a 36% rate when winning.__ With UGA favored by -6.5 &amp; presumed to have the lead Arch is going to struggle &amp; be forced to run traditional dropbacks. __His stats vs traditional: 53% pressure rate (127th), 53% completion rate (93rd), 8.4 yards per pass (51st), 8.5% sack rate (87th). Against traditional dropbacks, Georgia ranks 13th in yards per pass allowed &amp; 46th in pressure rate.__ The Longhorns are outmatched in all aspects of this game. __With Texas being forced to pass this game &amp; their passing success rate ranking 91st in the NCAA, UGA should be able to handle them &amp; run away with it.__ 

But now to the biggest deciding factor this game… UGA head coach Kirby Smart is at Sanford Stadium. __Kirby Smart is 54-5 at home with UGA. That includes 8-0 against Top 10 opponents at home.__ Sanford is going to be rocking. Arch already can’t handle pressure, but this is going to be a completely different beast. He won’t be able to handle it &amp; UGA will pull away &amp; increase their lead in the 2nd half.

Horns down. 

__Georgia -6.5__

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s match: Delaware vs Sam Houston State (CFB) &amp; Islam Makhachev vs Jack Della Maddalena (UFC)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Delaware ML + Islam Makhachev ML (-142, Fanduel)

If you&#x27;ve tailed me a few times you would probably know that I&#x27;m a fan of fading Sam Houston State who we faded against UTEP and LA Tech. I avoided fading them last week mainly because I felt that the books started to inflate their spread too much as the line had gotten up to -21.5 for Oregon State to cover. Sam Houston State ended up sneaking a win out here in one of the weirdest games I&#x27;ve seen this year. Oregon State was up 17-0 at one point with the potential to go up 24-0 right before the half until they threw an interception with 1:20 to go in the 2nd quarter and Sam Houston was able to go into the half 7-17. Oregon State then proceeded to not score at all with a disaster class from their special teams allowing a punt return touchdown as well as blocked punt touchdown and the game ended 21-17 with Sam Houston State winning. Oregon State had 28 total first downs to Sam Houston&#x27;s 8 first downs and Oregon State also had well over 300 more total offensive yards combined than them. Needless to say it&#x27;s a miracle that Sam Houston managed to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> up their first win last week and I don&#x27;t think Delaware will make the same mistakes as Oregon State. The only worry here is it kind of seems like Delaware plays much better at home as their only win on the road is against FIU but we only need the ML here and aren&#x27;t on the -10.5 spread.

For the next leg we head to probably the best UFC card and title fight of the year. Islam Makhachev will face off against Jack Della Maddalena in Madison Square Garden. I&#x27;m gonna be honest since we haven&#x27;t seen Islam at Welterweight before it&#x27;s hard to gauge how he will do vs a guy who slightly bigger than him but off pure skill I will take Islam here. Jack is a high level striker but in my opinion I would take the wrestler over the striker most of the time. Jack managed to defend Belal&#x27;s takedowns well in his last fight and force him to strike with him but I just think Islam is way more of a threat than Belal and will definitely manage to get him down and hold him down unlike Belal and actually be a submission threat. Islam also has more motivation here as a win here would help him secure double champ and set up a potential superfight vs Topuria. Not gonna overthink it and go with the guy who was pound for pound #1 before Topuria knocked out 3 legends in a row, BOL and bet responsibly.</td></tr>

Across 25–30 legs that scoring gap converts into multiple extra breaks, so covering –4.5 lands naturally in the 16–10 / 16–11 range.

GILLINGHAM VS CRAWLEY

Date: 15 NOVEMBER 2025 at 18:30

BET ON: Match odds- GILLINGHAM

Odd: 1.80

ENGLAND

\- Gillingham arrive buoyed by momentum after their recent 1-0 away win that brought them back into play-off contention — and the return of manager Gareth Ainsworth following heart surgery has clearly lifted the squad’s morale and focus. Injuries are manageable: the Gills are without Glen Morris, Conor Masterson and Armani Little, but their opponents Crawley Town are in far worse shape. Crawley arrive seriously undermanned, missing key players Danny Cashman, Harry McKirdy, Harvey Davies and captain Scott Malone, with an additional squad member away on international duty. Tactically, Gillingham’s physical and direct approach — especially at Priestfield — is well suited to exploiting Crawley’s weakened lineup and poor away record, with the visitors having taken only four points on the road. With higher motivation, clearer structure and the opposition stretched thin, Gillingham look the solid choice to take all three points.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: OKC -10.5 @1.83 2u to win 1.66u


Write Up:  
 
We&#x27;re backing defending champions tonight , Early spread / lines and cover might be a little wide but Hornets seem vulnerable, in their last few games they’ve struggled, and given head-to-head stats show OKC’s ATS win rate has been decent ( 80%)in the last 5 . 


The Hornets is dealing with a bunch of injuries. Their starting five hardly has any real minutes together this season, so the chemistry just isn’t there. Also plagued by injuries to key players (LaMelo, Green, Grant Williams, etc.). That weakens their offensive core.


OKC is just the better team right now. Their rotation is solid, everyone knows their role, and they don’t really have any major chemistry issues. Hornets? Kinda the opposite. They’ve got injuries everywhere, their main lineup barely plays together, and the bench has to do way too much.


Stat-wise, OKC has the stronger defense and usually wins this matchup by a good margin. Hornets struggles to score consistently, especially without their full squad.


BOTTOM LINE IS :


OKC with extra rest has the stronger track record, better defense, offense , and way more lineup stability. Hornets also on B2B . 


OKC -10.5 


P.S : Only bet what you can afford , its just gambling after all ( It can go wrong sometimes ).

In his last 4 competitive matches with Georgia, he has two goals and is averaging 3 shots with 1 on target. Kvaratskhelia will chase any ball kicked his way and will With Georgia&#x27;s main striker out injured, I see our guy taking a few shots, especially on counter attacks. 

Now to Spain. They&#x27;ve been nothing short of dominant in this World Cup Qualifier and have not yet conceded a goal. However, if one can fault them anywhere, they are giving their opponents opportunities on the road. With Turkiye firing off 13 shots (3 on target) and a very poor Bulgaria team taking 4 shots (2 on target),  Spain is not bulletproof on the road. Georgia also plays tough at home, having not been shut out since October 2024. 

Make no mistake, Spain should dominate this game. But I like rooting for underdogs and I like our guy Kvaratskhelia to land a shot on target (and maybe even find the back of the net) in front of the home crowd.

Already eliminated Bulgaria, already beaten 6-1 at home, now missing notable players including their starting goalie. Turkey are a very prolific team, Spain arguably held back a bit vs Bulgaria however when Turkey start scoring they don&#x27;t stop - so far they beat Georgia 4-1, 3-2, Bulgaria 6-1 and lost to Spain 0-6. Nothing really noticeable here that shows how another high scoring game won&#x27;t occur, with score difference being very important as well.</td></tr>

France U21 just couldn&#x27;t find the back of the net! They went into half time 1-0 down and came out in the second half and had chance after chance but just kept wasting them. They managed to get one back but it just wasn&#x27;t enough in the end. England U21 had a penalty in the first half and didn&#x27;t convert it and then went into half time 0-0. In the second half they got another penalty and this time they converted it and then didn&#x27;t really do much until the 91st minute where they scored again to make it 2-0. Gonna take a break from soccer and go back to basketball for this next <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>.

***⏰:*** *4:30PM AEST (7 hours and 40mins from time of posting)*

***Reasoning:***  
***-*** *In their last game Brisbane Bullets lost their best scorer and player Casey Prather. He was the only player on their side who consistently puts up around 20+ points*  
***-*** *Melbourne United are top of the table and by far the best team with a +- 60 higher than the second place side. They have played one more game but 60 points won&#x27;t be made up in that game*  
***-*** *Brisbane are 8th (10 sides in NBL Top 6 make finals) and have really struggled lately. In their last game they lost by 29 points against 9th place, they won against 7th place but it was 83-81 so they were the winner out of two bad sides and before that they lost by 37 to 2nd place*  
***-*** *The last time these two sides met Melbourne won 95-86, Melbourne played a really bad game and still won by 9. Two players on Melbourne shot 14% and 10% who are both just below 50% average scorers*  
***-*** *10/13 games Brisbane haven&#x27;t scored 90 and that&#x27;s including a game against bottom of the league Cairns who have 9/13 of their games having 90+ scored against them*  
***-*** *Melbourne have only let the opposition score 90+ 3/12 times and that was against top 6 teams and two games where someone scored 30+ points*  
***-*** *Casey Prather usually scores about 30% of Brisbane&#x27;s points, they have played one game without him this season and they scored 82*</td></tr>

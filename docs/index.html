Chicago Bulls ML vs. Cleveland, +164, 1 Unit, 8:00 PM EST

Georgi Tech didn&#x27;t suck as badly as I thought.  I&#x27;ll still be betting against them later because they still suck.  Moving on to an NBA team that really does suck, the Cleveland Cavaliers.  This team BARELY beat the Wizards on the road and just got fucked by the Hornets at home.  They don&#x27;t care and the Bulls will win.

DD = I think both teams are fairly evenly skilled but the reason I like USF is because both teams are playing with a backup QB. OD’s Qb is a freshman playing in the biggest game of his career. USF backup is a senior Qb who was on an SEC roster for the last 5 years. The game is also in Florida 

It should be noted USF has an interim coach this game but I would like to think he knows how to coach this team being an assistant for so long.</td></tr>

Reason • 

Seems Risky (Last 5 games he went over )Wells draws a BRUTAL matchup versus this Timberwolves defense.

Wells scores 43% of his points from spot up, where the Timberwolves rank FIRST BEST defensively. We have seen Wells go under this line in 9/11 starts this season against top 15 spot up defenses, including going under in all 9/9 WITHOUT Edey.

47% of Wells shots come from C&amp;S, where the Timberwolves rank 9th BEST defensively and we have seen Wells go under this line in 7/9 matchups this season against top 15 C&amp;S defenses. Wells get’s another 30% of his shots come from &lt;10 feet, where the Timberwolves rank 8th BEST defensively.

A combined 48% of Wells points come from ATB 3’s and the RA, where the Timberwolves rank 5th BEST and 10th BEST defensively. 

Wells has gone under this line in 6/7 matchups this season against team that rank top 15 in BOTH C&amp;S and ATB 3 defense, with him recording 10 or fewer points in 6/7 of those games.</td></tr>

Celta de Vigo is the significantly stronger side here, they should win. Celta is 6th in La Liga while Albacete are 14th in Santander. Celta have won 3/4 of their last away games. I don’t see them losing this but I want to play it safe. 

Villarreal is also stronger here. They are 3rd in La Liga and Racing are 1st in Santander. Even being first in Santander, they aren’t a strong La Liga side. Villarreal are 3/4 in their last 4 away games. Racing are 2-0-2 at home in their last 4. I see Villarreal seeing this pit as well.

Parlay Both matches Over 2.5 goals @ 1.6 (1u)

Write Up : Not going to the FA cup, since both the bets i had were already posted (-1.5 City &amp; btts in the other match). So, this took some looking (didnt want to bet on Celtic), and finally settled on another risky league - the women&#x27;s CL, where nothing goes as per plan.

Still, i feel both these matches will see over 2.5 goals due to the below reasons

1. Six of the last eight games of Barcelona W ended with three or more goals &amp; Four of the last five home games of Paris FC ended with over 2.5 goals.

2. Leuven W have seen over 2.5 goals in 2 of their last 3 home matches &amp; Arsenal Women have seen over 2.5 goals in 4 of their last 6 matches

As I said, please do be careful about this bet, since women&#x27;s footy is known to be unreliable. Do bet only what you can lose.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Kfarsoum DNB +110, 3.5 units

**Write Up:** I browsed some obscure leagues and found this value play gem in the Jordan league. Kfarsoum might be sitting near the relegation zone while their opps are midtable, but the **difference in form** is staggering. Kfarsoum have **comfortably won their last two while Ma’an have 2 losses and a measly draw in their last three.** The recent uptick in form and the fact a win would put them **out of the relegation fight** for the time being, I can see Kfarsoum fighting teeth and nails and nabbing a narrow win here. Another good point about this team is that they’ve **been able to find the back of the net semi-reliably (20 goals in 12 games)** and they actually have **more goals scored than the home team**. Ma’an do boast a strong defence, allowing just 9 goals in the 12 games they’ve played so far, so I could see this game ending in a draw, hence the DNB at good odds to cover us.

Hebert struggled a bit with his draws and Jacobs&#x27; hitting accuracy was off as well which led to poor play when they had hammer. Team Epping, on the other hand, took care of business against a very good Team Muskatewitz in the opening draw and looked very strong in doing so. These are two elite teams that are typically close to a coin flip matchup anyway so based on the opening draw eye test favouring Team Epping, we&#x27;ll take the plus money value here.</td></tr>

Last Pick Reflection: Golden State −4.5 was a bad <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. I rushed into it and could have just passed. That one is on me. There were better picks that day like Hawks +2.5 first quarter, Cavs first quarter -4.5, and 76ers first quarter ML, which I did separately and all hit. Ironically, I took a break after that from posting my picks and on NFL Sunday I went 7/7… Had chargers, vikings, and broncos as upsets, and then bills, rams -5.5, and bears -2.5 first quarter and -7.5 full game… I should’ve just stuck the process and kept giving picks each day, but I needed a chance to recalibrate.

Event: NHL | Winnipeg Jets at St. Louis Blues | 7:00 PM CT

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Winnipeg Jets −1.5 (+172) for THREE units

Write Up: Winnipeg has been the more complete team in this matchup, showing better structure and consistency at five on five. They generate steady pressure and have shown the ability to turn small advantages into separation.

St. Louis has struggled against teams that control tempo and play organized hockey. At plus money, the puck line offers better value than the moneyline in a spot where Winnipeg should have chances to pull away late.

**Write up:**

**The <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>:**  
I’m playing **Home &amp; BTTS – YES** here because the match fits a **home-control profile**, but not one that fully shuts the game down.

The odds place Fortuna Sittard as a clear favorite, and this profile consistently shows the **home side winning most of the time**. However, despite being labeled a *“1-0 Specialists”* profile, the deeper numbers tell a slightly different story. In this setup, **BTTS lands in 4 of 6 matches**, which means the away team often manages to score even when the home side is in control.

Goal-wise, this profile is very reliable for **Over 1.5**, and many games move into **2–1 or 3–1 type scorelines** rather than clean, low-risk wins. The home team usually scores first, but the structure allows a response before control is re-established.

So instead of backing a straight home win or expecting a clean sheet, combining **home victory with BTTS** fits the actual behavior of this profile — **home dominance with a goal conceded**.

**My Model in general:**  
My model is built around the idea that matches follow **recurring patterns**, not randomness.  
Instead of predicting games in isolation, it groups matches by **odds profiles** and studies what *actually* happens when similar games are played.

By clustering historical matches with the same **home–draw–away odds**, I track how games usually unfold — goals, BTTS, scorelines, and game flow. From there, the model identifies **motives**: situations where teams are more likely to attack, trade goals, or avoid clean sheets.

Every <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> comes from **data-backed profiles, not opinions** — combining odds structure, score patterns, and streak behavior to find spots where the market regularly repeats itself.

**🏀 Donovan Mitchell o30.5 Points +100** vs the Chicago Bulls

Mitchell&#x27;s attempts are just insane these days. Over his L5, he&#x27;s averaging 24.8 attempts a game. He&#x27;s cashing about 44% of those buckets for an average of 31 points.

Combine that with the atrocious Bulls defense and we&#x27;re looking at a big game. Bulls&#x27; worst defensive zone is the above the break 3, where Mitchell shoots 44% of his shots. 

Overall, Bulls rank 28th overall in defensive rating and 29th in Points allowed to SGs. Mitchell averages 30 points against the Bulls on 20 attempts so with an average of 4-5 more, I see this line cashing.

Over/Under set surprisingly high at 243.5. Expecting Cavs to shoot 3s and Bulls to push pace to keep up.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **Josh Giddey over 7.5 Assists**

A lot of picks on the board, but if I had to narrow it down to one, **Josh Giddey over 7.5 assists** stands out. Giddey ranks **top three in potential assists**, averaging **16.3 potential assists per game**, while still producing **8.8 actual assists per game**. That gap matters because it shows the opportunity is consistently there even when results fluctuate.

It is no secret the Chicago Bulls are leaning into a Pacers-style offense built on pace, ball movement, and three-point volume. There has even been chatter that the Bulls may have found their own version of Tyrese Haliburton. Giddey fits perfectly into that identity as a pass-first guard who thrives when shooters are active and decisions are quick.

There are pros and cons here, but the biggest reason I like this spot is the bounce-back angle. In the previous game, Giddey got into foul trouble early and played just **eight minutes in the first half**. Chicago trailed shortly after he left the floor, which highlighted how much the offense depends on his facilitation. That game skews recent perception and helps explain why this line feels slightly deflated.

The matchup further supports assist volume. The Cleveland Cavaliers are in poor recent form, nearly losing to the Washington Wizards, losing to the Charlotte Hornets, and dropping a game to a depleted Golden State Warriors. Over their last three games, Cleveland has allowed **15.3 made threes per game** on **41 three-point attempts**, both bottom-five marks in the league over that span.

That matters because Chicago attempts roughly **37 to 39 threes per game**, and Giddey’s assist totals are directly tied to that volume. At home, he still averages **15.7 potential assists per game**, showing the creation remains strong even if conversion varies night to night. The opportunity is there, and a home shooting environment generally stabilizes outcomes.

Pace and game environment push this further. Chicago currently rank **2nd in the league in pace**, playing at roughly **103.5 possessions per game**, and the game total is set at **243.5**. That combination points to a fast, offense-friendly script with elevated possession counts, which naturally increases assist opportunities for a primary facilitator like Giddey.

The only real con here is role-based variance. If Cleveland switches Darius Garland onto Giddey, the size mismatch could encourage him to look for his own scoring more aggressively. There is also the chance some possessions end in hockey assists or teammates initiate earlier in the shot clock. None of these remove the underlying opportunity, but they do introduce some volatility.

Overall, this sets up as a strong buy-low spot. Giddey’s role is secure, his creation volume is elite, Chicago’s pace is among the fastest in the league, Cleveland is allowing heavy three-point volume, and recent foul trouble has helped keep the line reasonable. If teammates knock down shots at even an average rate, **over 7.5 assists** seems reasonable.</td></tr>

It&#x27;s easy to hate on Lonzo given the hype he received coming into the league and that abomination of a shooting form he used to have, but I actually like what he contributes as a defender and playmaker.

That said, I will gladly fade his 3-point shooting while he is on a cold-streak in an already terrible shooting season (even for him). 

Ball is under this line in 5 of L5 despite playing over 23 mpg, shooting a remarkable 17.4% (4/23) from three in that span. This stretch includes some pretty easy defensive matchups too, such as the Wizards and Hornets. A Hornets game, mind you, that went to OT and in which Lonzo played 32 minutes. Still under.

This is telling of his shooting struggles since joining the Cavs, shooting 26% from three this season, by far a career low. And it is exacerbated by other injuries to CLE&#x27;s best perimeter shooters, Strus and Merrill, who might have otherwise drawn more defensive attention and given Lonzo more open looks. 

In terms of matchup, while CHI isn&#x27;t great defensively, they do give up 8th fewest 3PM to opposing point guards. And the Bulls have some solid on-ball defenders among their bench guards in Tre Jones and Ayo Dosunmu (listed as GTD) - not spectacular but good enough to keep Lonzo to his poor outside shooting. 

Indeed, in his only prior matchup against CHI this season, Lonzo went 0/3 from three. So the &quot;revenge game&quot; theory against his former team doesn&#x27;t seem to be an issue.</td></tr>

**Reason:** Hunter has been in a slight slump compared to his production earlier this season, but this is a great matchup for him to get back to his beginning of the season efficiency. This season, **Hunter has gone over this line 12 out of 23 games.** The **first 16 games of the season, he went over this line 11/16 times**. He then went on a 5 game slump where he went under this line. 

**All this slump has really been is him not being able to find nylon.** He is averaging slightly lower field goal attempts compared to the beginning of the season, but just shooting a lot worse. **Chicago ranks 25th in defensive efficiency, and allows the 27th most points + rebounds to opponents (forwards specifically).** 

All it is going to take is for Hunter to start seeing a couple shots go down and he will start averaging a consistent 15-17ppg. A slow Chicago defense and a slight rebounding advantage overall, I believe Hunter can find his groove and be the consistent role player Cleveland would really love to use.

Write-up: This is getting downright hilarious now and I’m here to test the limits of variance.

So anyways the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> lost by 0.5 (68-95) after Jiangsu sank a 3 at the buzzer to finish with a 27 point lead. Sweet.

Ok we’ve officially hit rock bottom going for a play like this. However, the stats are mental and I couldn’t let an opportunity like this slip by. Taking our talents over to peak sports betting obscurity, Vakifbank are top of the division and are coming in as extremely heavy favourites against the home team Aras Kargo who are 7th (out of 14). The travelling side have seen this line clear in their last 17/18 matches on the road (94%) which makes up 12/13 (92%) in the league. Meanwhile the hosts have covered the over in their last 9/10 (90%) home games, 8/9 (89%) in the league . Those numbers are very convincing but I will flag that this game last year produced 129 points (I stg if this happens again). Other than that, their only previous fixture gave us 167 points. Despite all the stats involved I would still probably fade at the moment since, logically, the under is going to narrowly win. BOL!

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:**  Man City -1 Asian Handicap @ 1.75 (Usual 3 units)

We have an EFL Cup Quarterfinal match between Man City hosting Brentford at the Etihad Stadium.  I don’t have much to add other than there is a significant discrepancy in the squads of these teams.  While Brentford sit 15^(th) in the Premier League table trying to stay out of the relegation zone, the Citizens lead the league in goal differential at +22 and are just 2 points shy of league leaders Arsenal.

A Man City win should prove to be a great omen to coach Pep Guardiola’s hunt for silverware this season, as the team has actually moved on to win the EFL trophy after winning each of their last six quarter-final matches. These matches however, being a single elimination usually keep a tight scoreline and a single goal difference is all that is necessary to advance.  Therefore, City may show some rotation in their squad. 

Jeremy Doku will be out, as will John Stones, Rodri, Kovacic, Marmoush and Ait-Nouri.  Nonetheless, the depth of talent to choose from is quite remarkable and they should have no shortage of players to introduce.  Meanwhile Brentford only have a couple of shortages as Outtara nad Onyeka will be absent to play at the African Cup of Nations.

While Brentford will present mostly their strongest starting 11, that same team could not beat Leeds this past weekend.  Also in the last two weeks, they also lost to Tottenham and Arsenal in multiple goal shutouts.   On the flip side, within the last week Man City beat Real Madrid in Spain and then travelled to Selhurst Park and beat Crystal Palace by 3-0.

I will side with Man City to advance in 90 minutes here.  Should they win by only 1 goal, it’s a push.</td></tr>

Both teams are travelling west on a few days rest which means sloppy hockey is possible. Both teams are trending under in back to back games, &amp; in the last FOUR games between these teams, the total has been under 4.5, let alone 5.5.

Vegas alone have been under 5.5 in 4 of their last 5 games, and whether it’s Schmid or Hart, they seem to be confident to play defensive hockey and take their chance the Vegas way.

🕰️ Match: PSG v Flamengo

🔒 <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: PSG to score in both haves

💵 Odds: 2.4 @ PointsBet

📝 Write Up:

This is going to be an exciting match to watch, and we’ll see Flamengo trying to make a global statement against a PSG side that is built to dominate these occasion. PSG operate at a much higher competition level week-to-week, averaging roughly 2+ goals per match against elite European opposition, while Flamengo step up significantly in defensive difficulty here, meaning sustained pressure is almost guaranteed across 90 minutes. From a game-flow standpoint, if we model PSG’s scoring probability at ~70% in the first half (early intensity, quality gap, aggressive pressing) and ~75–80% in the second half (fatigue, tactical adjustments, space opening up), the combined probability of scoring in both halves still sits around 55–60%. Over 90 minutes, sustained possession, superior chance quality, and situational urgency make PSG goals in both halves a logical outcome and for 2.4, a very good price.</td></tr>

Newcastle vs Fulham – Both Teams To Score (Yes)
Odds: 1.77 / -129 (Unibet)
Units: 3.8u
 
First time posting. We’re two roommates posting these <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>’s and both been tailing loads here. Surely two brains work better than one?
Newcastle vs Fulham quietly sets up as one of the cleanest Both Teams To Score spots on the day. Newcastle host Fulham with both sides in strong attacking rhythm and neither showing much interest in clean sheets lately.

BTTS has hit in 4 of Newcastle’s last 5 matches and 4 of Fulham’s last 5, with the only miss for both teams coming against Sunderland — a side notorious for slowing games down and sitting deep. Remove that anomaly, and the trend is clear: these teams trade chances.

The head-to-head backs it up, too. BTTS has landed in the last 3 H2H meetings, including the reverse fixture at St. James’ Park on October 25, where both teams produced over 1.5 xG each, proving this matchup consistently creates high-quality chances on both ends.

Newcastle have been automatic at home. They’ve scored in every single home fixture this season, totaling 26 goals across 13 home matches — exactly 2.0 goals per game. Fulham aren’t shy on the road either, finding the net 10 times in 9 away matches, and they’ve turned it up recently.

Fulham come in hot offensively, scoring 10 goals in their last 4 matches, including 5 goals in their last 2 away games. Newcastle, meanwhile, were riding a 17-match scoring streak before their narrow 1-0 loss to Sunderland, another outlier given the matchup and game state.

All signs point to goals — but the defensive side seals the bet.

Newcastle haven’t kept a clean sheet in 8 straight matches, with their last shutout coming against Bilbao in the Champions League — a Bilbao side that has only scored in 7 of 11 away matches across UCL and LaLiga this season. Fulham are no better defensively, failing to keep a clean sheet in 4 straight matches while conceding 10 goals in that span.

Both teams are comfortable committing numbers forward, both are vulnerable defensively, and both have clear, repeatable scoring trends. This isn’t a game where one side sits back — it’s one where chances come naturally.

The price hasn’t caught up.</td></tr>

Mervyn King (+120) v Ian White ❌

Ricardo Pietreczko (-136) v Jose de Sousa ✅ 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Matt Campbell (-149) v Adam Sevada

Good stuff from our boy Pikachu yesterday, grinding out a 3-1 win against a very capable opponent. Ricardo going 11/25 (40%) on doubles really illustrates how valuable a high checkout % is in this format. 

Only four matches on the board <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, and each one fairly lopsided in terms of odds. Despite this, I will gladly back the North American #1 Matt “the Ginga Ninja” to defeat Adam “The Reaper” Sevada. 

Fairly difficult to compare these two players, as Campbell has been cutting his teeth on the PDC Tour all year, while Sevada has mostly competed on the MODUS Super Series &amp; CDC, with a few exceptions. In the end, i think one very large reason points me towards Campbell. 

If you look at the #s for each player over the last 12 months, the averages, checkour %s, TV averages, etc. are all fairly close — 91.1 Campbell vs 89.6 Sevada; 40% Cambell vs 41.1% Sevada (per DartsOrakel)

The main difference bw the two has been their competition. Sevada is a world championship debutante, earning his spot in this year’s tournament by cementing his spot as the CDC’s highest ranking player. He beat up on lesser players for most of the year, and when a big moment came up at the US Darts Open, Sevada averaged 74.6 en route to a 2-6 loss vs Gerwyn Price. 

Campbell, on the other hand, has competed at the highest level darts has to offer since 2022. He reached the final 32 in the 2024 world championship, and reached the QF at this year’s European Darts Open. Campbell also reached the QF at the PDC Players Championship 33 &amp; 34, which took place just two months ago. 

Big stage &amp; big tournament experience largely favors Campbell, and his recent success a few short months ago gives me confidence locking him in this one. Honestly consider the (-149) price tag a bit of bargain, could see this one moving higher as the match draws closer. 

Lastly - have had a few folks ask, so including details below for tipping. Absolutely no need, but always greatly appreciated 🌶️

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>**: Manchester City Moneyline + Manchester City Goals Range 2-4 (-115) 2u

**Write up**:

Don&#x27;t really feel like I need to touch on the moneyline aspect of this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> as it is pretty much a given that City win this game. They LOVE the EFL cup and have performed amazing in it for the last 10 years, winning it 5 times. I wanted to bet the straight goal range but its sitting at -150 which isn&#x27;t amazing value for me personally.

City have scored 2-4 goals in 18/25 games played this season across all competitions, going 9/11 on this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> in their home games. They&#x27;re also 2/2 on this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> in both EFL cup games played this season. City average close to 2.5 goals per match across all comps this season and have caught a lot of form recently. In their last 5 games, City are undefeated and have scored 2-4 goals in 4/5 (with the only game this not hitting being their 5 goals against Fulham). Although there will probably be some squad rotation, squad rotation for City means having first team quality players getting minutes they don&#x27;t usually get. City have also scored 2-4 goals in 3/5 of their last games against Brentford.

On the other side here we have a struggling Brentford team, being 1-1-3 in their last 5 games and 1-0-4 in their last 5 away games (with the only win being the last round of the EFL cup against a League 2 side). In these last 5 away games, Brentford have conceded 2 goals in 4/5 with the only exception being that cup game where they held Grimsby to 0. Brentford allow on average 1.37 goals per match to their opposition across all comps and 1.6 goals allowed in all away games. Brentford have conceded 3 goals a few times this season but never more, and with the probable rotation for City ahead of some important Premier League games, I don&#x27;t see the Blues scoring over 4.

City beat Brentford earlier this year 0-1 at Gtech Community Stadium, at a time that Cherki wasn&#x27;t fully proven yet and Savio + Bobb were still starting almost every week. With the loss of Doku due to injury, this could be a match for Savio to finally prove his worth to City fans and get a contribution or two. Not to mention Marmoush (I believe) will not be apart of the squad because of AFCON which means big Erling should still start up top. Even if Omar is available and starts, I almost believe that to be a better outcome because he is dying for a contribution to show Guardiola he deserves more minutes this season. If I were to make a score prediction to this game it would probably be 3-0 or 3-1 to City. The only team that Brentford have beat of real quality are Newcastle which was a home game that was 1-1 until Newcastle picked up a red and conceded 2 goals. I wouldn&#x27;t count the Villa game as this is when Villa were quite bad.

⚽️ Fulham at Newcastle, 12/17/25 Wed, 3:15 pm Eastern Time

Explanation: Newcastle can beat Fulham because St James’ Park has been a real edge for them this season, and the underlying chance numbers back it up. In the league, Newcastle are 12th on 22 points while Fulham are just behind on 20 (so overall quality is similar), but the home/away split is where it separates: Newcastle are 5-1-2 at home (16 points from 8) while Fulham are only 2-1-5 away (7 points), which is a big swing in reliability.   The performance data lines up with that too: Newcastle’s home xG is 14.90 vs 9.47 xGA across those 8 home league matches, meaning they typically create more and concede fewer “good chances” at home (the kind of profile that wins cup ties over 90 minutes).   

They’ve also already shown they can handle Fulham in this exact matchup recently, beating them 2–1 at home earlier in the season, which matters because it hints that Newcastle’s style (high tempo, pressure, and creating enough shots/chances in front of their crowd) can tilt the game.  The main worry is Newcastle’s defensive availability: Dan Burn reportedly suffered a fractured rib and lung damage in the Sunderland match and is likely out—so Howe may have to reshuffle, but this being a League Cup quarter-final at home still gives Newcastle a clear path: press early, win territory, and generate the higher-quality looks while Fulham’s away form has been shaky (they only just recorded a rare away win at Burnley).</td></tr>

Ulster has released a full pelt lineup for their first fixture of the season as opposed to Munster, who have rested a few of their own players. Ulster has also won their last four home matches as well as their last fixture away to Connacht, while Munster lost their last fixture at home to a weak Leinster team. The -3.5 handicap ensures that the margin needed should be comfortable whilst also considering Ulster are favourites for the fixture either way.</td></tr>

Last POTD: **Hibernian v Hearts: Hearts or Draw DC, Total goals u4.5, u7.5 cards @1.85** ❌

Todays <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: **Toulouse v Lens: Lens Draw No Bet @1.95**

Lens come into this one as the stronger and more reliable side and the numbers back it up across the board. They are top of the table in red hot form and generating elite attacking output with 17.6 shots per game and an xG above 2.0. That level of chance creation travels well and explains why their away scoring remains consistent even against compact home setups.

Toulouse on the other hand are a split personality team. They have shown flashes away from home but their home attacking numbers are a real concern with just 0.5 goals per game and limited shot volume. That is a serious issue when facing a Lens side that defends efficiently concedes under a goal per match and is comfortable controlling games without needing to overextend.

The model makes Lens clear favourites to win outright but the draw still carries some weight given Toulouse’s tendency to stay competitive. This is exactly where draw no bet makes sense as it backs the better team while removing the main downside risk. If Lens play to their metrics which they have done consistently over the last ten matches they win this game more often than not. If Toulouse manage to grind out a draw the stake is protected.

In short Lens have the sharper attack stronger underlying data and superior recent form. Lens draw no bet keeps the value while reducing variance and avoids overexposure to a low upside Toulouse home win.

Best of luck.</td></tr>

Going back to McBride, as his line has good value. 50% on the season covering 11 points. In the last two seasons without Josh Hart, he has covered this line 7/8 times and 3/3 this season. Atlanta is ranked 24th in opponent points per game and allow the 22nd most points to opposing point guards. Atlanta is also ranked 23rd in opponent shooting %. They rank 19th in opponent three-pointers attempted per game, and as we know, McBride loves the three. He has been on fire lately, hitting 3 threes in his last 7/10 played. With McBride getting more playing time and another great matchup vs the Hawks, I see him getting near 20 again.

NBA | Hawks v Knicks | 🏀  

B2B losses as he ends at 5, NBA has been rough no denying it..

Trae is questionable for this game although I doubt he misses a game at the garden vs the Knicks. Still like Jalen at this line, over in 8/L10 games &amp; 6/9 with Trae playing this season &amp; had 12 assists on 15 potentials last game against the Knicks just recently with Trae active.

We get a high total of 245.5 in this game, Hawks plays high pace ball hopefully should lead to a high scoring game. Saw Knicks clogging the paint whenever he drove into the paint where he would kick it out to the open three or to the cutting Hawks player, handoffs to KP and Onyeka should generate to some assists aswell.

Caught this at 7.5 should be available in some books at that line, definitely taking this 8.5 at + money though.</td></tr>

In this match, Melbourne stars are rightly considered favourites, with 4/4 wins, but the match is happening in Brisbane (Gabba), where the home side has won both their matches. So, felt it&#x27;s a little risky to go to the ML markets.

I feel, this run total is probably easy to hit, if there is no rain or a sudden batting collapse, as the ground is quite easy to score + both the previous matches in this ground have hit this target quite easily.

Tip off is 7:40PM PST. I am returning to the Luka blocks system. His record this season is not going more than 4 games without a block and this will be game 2. With Reeves being out and the way the Lakers are looking I have to assume he will be playing harder leading in to the all star break and trade deadline. That is emphasized with the comments from pundits criticizing his lack of defensive prowess as of late.

Should this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> miss I will double my units when he plays again on Sunday. As of right now this prop is not yet on the board but I suspect the odds will be +135. I will update it if need be.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Melbourne Victory Vs Perth Glory - **Melbourne Victory ML @ 1.75 (Melbet)**

**Write Up:** Melbourne Victory come into this match focusing on staying organised and in control, especially at home where games are usually close. Perth Glory return to league action after mixed results and they’ve shown they can be dangerous going forward, but still struggle to stay solid when under pressure for long periods.

Victory’s recent form shows a team that knows how to win without taking unnecessary risks. Wins at home against Adelaide United and away at Melbourne City came from staying compact and patient on the ball. Even their draws with Macarthur and Auckland FC showed how hard they are to break down. While losses to Sydney FC and Brisbane Roar came during a tougher spell, recent matches show better balance between defence and attack. At home, Victory usually keep games tight and controlled.

Perth Glory have picked up some strong wins against Melbourne City, Macarthur, and Newcastle Jets, but those results have been mixed with losses that highlight ongoing issues. Defeats to Adelaide United and Sydney FC showed how little room for error they have, especially when they fall behind. Away from home, Glory often struggle to stay organised defensively. Heavy losses at Melbourne City earlier in the season and problems sustaining pressure suggest they may spend long stretches without the ball in this match.

Perth Glory look like a classic glass-cannon side, dangerous going forward but vulnerable defensively. They also rely heavily on Taggart for goals, and with his fitness in doubt, that could be a concern. Even if he plays, Melbourne Victory should have the edge, especially at home.

Stats wise, it points towards a Melbourne win for me here. Melbourne are on a three-game winning streak, including a 5-1 win over Wellington Phoenix, and have won five straight against Perth. They also took a 2-0 win at HBF Park last time out.

**Recap:** Unfortunate situation that Sheffield Wednesday is in across the board. One that lead us to capitalize on their misfortunes.

**New Event:**  NCAAF – NAVY vs Cincinnatti

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:**  NAVY -7 @ 1.88 (Usual 3 units)

(Full Disclosure - I have the flu, can&#x27;t think straight and am using some AI to help write part of this, so I can drop some Nyquil and pass out)

Navy finished the regular season with a strong 10-2 record, going 8-1 in the AAC and narrowly missing a potential College Football Playoff berth.  Despite a blowout defeat to Notre Dame (49-10), the Midshipmen closed strong with wins over USF, Memphis (on the road), and rival Army (17-16).

Some bulletpoints as always:

* Navy boasts the nation&#x27;s #1 top rushing attack averaging 289.3 yards per game
* Service academies have won seven straight bowl games since 2021.
* Service academies do not have many opt-outs because they consider it the same as going AWOL. Big no-no.
* Cincinnati ended the season on a four-game losing streak (7-5 overall) and has been hit hard by opt-outs and the transfer portal.
* Cincinnati will be missing starting QB Brendan Sorsby, who accounted for over 2,800 passing yards, 580 rushing yards, and 36 total tds.
* The QB position replacement is completely inexpererienced.  Options include either backup Brady Lichtenberg and redshirt freshman Samaj Jones.
* Multiple defensive starters are also opting out for Cincy, leaving a depleted roster.
* Navy&#x27;s elite ground game faces a vulnerable Cincinnati run defense, while the Cincy Bearcats&#x27; quarterback uncertainty limits their ability to keep pace.
* Navy&#x27;s QB Horvath&#x27;s dual-threat ability should control the clock and exploit gaps, with Navy likely attempting fewer than 15 passes unless trailing.

Navy&#x27;s full-strength roster, dominant rushing attack, and Cincinnati&#x27;s significant absences (especially at QB) give Navy a clear edge. I expect Navy to grind out long drives and cover the spread in a relatively one-sided dominant rushing affair.  Laying the 7 points with Navy.</td></tr>

Event: Hawks @ Knicks 6:30 pm CT

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Karl Anthony Towns to have 12+ rebounds (-142); 2 units 

In <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>’s NBA, KAT may be the most feminine, estrogenic player. But dammit does he summon up his only testosterone when he plays the Atlanta Hawks. In his career he has played them 21 times averaging 24.9 points, 12.4 rebounds, and 3.9 assists. This year was no different on Trae Young’s lil ass as he played the Hawks 5 days ago and had 36 points and 15 rebounds. I can just hear KAT screaming “After all that 💅” in the locker room after that absolutely disrespectful performance while Brunson and Hart are in the back fingering each other. 

But I digress, the man has hit this line 4 times in the last 5 games (L5: 7, 12, 15, 14, 13). He is averaging 11.7 rebounds this year. I know his average is lower than the line barely, but there are key factors that are going to contribute to his rebound production. Josh Hart is out (a very reliable rebounder for NY) and Mitchel Robinson is questionable (another glass eater), KAT is gonna have to carry a heavier rebounding load than usual. The Hawks are also constantly out-rebounded by teams as they rank 25th in rebounds as a team this year. Both of these teams shoot a lot of three pointers, NY is 7th and ATL is 11th in attempts per game. 3 pointers are the lower FG% shot so there will be more rebound opportunities. I expect KAT to be inside the lane more than usual to counteract the key rebounding pieces Hart and Robinson (potentially) being out for the Knicks. I am no fortune teller, just a man.

On the other side, Anaheim has really been struggling, with a 2-6-2 record in their last 10 after a hot start to the year. Dostal has really been struggling since coming back from injury, and if Mrazek starts, he hasn’t been good this year either.

Last pick: Kevin Durant Over 4.5 Assists (-145)HR✅

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the day</mark> :Chet holmogren O 1.5 block(-138)FD


Reason • :
Draymond Green is officially OUT (rest) for the Warriors. Draymond is their defensive heart and the one player with the veteran &quot;IQ&quot; to pull Chet away from the hoop. Without him, the Warriors&#x27; interior is a revolving door, and Chet is the only person holding the keys.
Chet is averaging 2.2 blocks over his last 10 games, hitting the Over in 70% of those contests.
GSW ranks 3rd-worst in the NBA, allowing about 4.0 blocks per game

Scenario A: (Quinten Post Starts)
   With Draymond out, 7-foot rookie Quinten Post is expected to start. This is a dream for Chet. Post lacks NBA-level speed, which allows Chet to stay deep in the paint. Rookies often try to test established rim protectors; Chet’s 7&#x27;6&quot; wingspan will be waiting to swap out shots 

Scenario B: The Warriors Go Small (Speed vs. Length)
   If Kerr plays Jonathan Kuminga or Al Horford at the &quot;5,&quot; the Warriors will try to drive and kick. Since Isaiah Hartenstein is OUT, Chet has zero &quot;vultures&quot; taking his blocks. He is the only rim protector on the floor for OKC. Every drive from Steph Curry or Podziemski must eventually face Chet at the apex.

Scenario C: The Blowout (OKC leads by 20+)
   You might worry about Chet sitting early. However, the data shows Chet is a &quot;fast starter.&quot; In his 6-block masterpiece against Portland, he had 3 blocks before halftime. Trailing teams get desperate and attack the rim faster, which actually feeds Chet&#x27;s stats in the first three quarters.

Scenario D: The Offensive Slump (Ugly Shooting)
   If it’s a &quot;brick fest,&quot; the Warriors will stop settling for 3s and try to draw fouls. This funnels the game directly into Chet&#x27;s office. An ugly game for shooters is a &quot;Block Party&quot; for Chet.

DPOY Hunt: Chet is the betting favorite for Defensive Player of the Year (+150). 
And I hope he takes it from Wemby (as a thunder fan of course, I love wemby as rival competition)  He isn&#x27;t just playing; he&#x27;s &quot;stat-hunting&quot; to solidify his trophy case. 

Scenario-Proofing 
- Blowout: OKC is heavily favored (Thunder around -8 to -10 spread). Chet often racks up 2+ blocks by halftime in lopsided wins because desperate teams attack the rim more.

- Close Game: 32–35 minutes guaranteed, and GSW&#x27;s guards/forwards will challenge him repeatedly.

- Ugly/Slow Pace: More rebounding → more transition → more rim attacks for Chet to erase.</td></tr>

Love this spot to fade Cotton, will be matching up against an elite defender, Bul Kuol, who&#x27;s been locking up players as of late. Kuol is a suffocating defender who&#x27;ll force the ball out of Cotton&#x27;s hands, and in the 2 H2H matches this season Cotton has had a season low 7pts and 25pts (Kuol had early foul trouble). Cotton will know this matchup is heading his way, and will be smart enough to use it to his teams advantage, so think he&#x27;ll be dishing assists rather than forcing shots over a defensive system in place to limit him.

Tsitsipas is the superior player but has not played an ATP match (with the exception of Davis cup) since the US Open due to back injury issues. Tsitsipas had been getting very poor results. Since grass court season he is 5-11. His opponent Mochizuki does best on hard courts but is ranked 99 so definitely not an elite player. Last year on hard courts won sets against both Ruud and Michelsen and took Khachanov to 5 sets in Wimbledon.

Adam Fox didn&#x27;t get picked for the Olympics and he was definitely not happy about it when he got called yesterday. He&#x27;s pissed and wants to prove to team USA that they made the wrong choice especially to his own coach who will be the head coach for team USA in Milan. He has points in seven consecutive games (12 points btw which is insane for a defenseman) so you&#x27;re damn sure he&#x27;s gonna try to keep his streak alive to shove it in team USA&#x27;s management face especially when it&#x27;s a big game like the Winter Classic.

**Event:** Lige One McDonald&#x27;s, Toulouse v RC Lens, 14:45 pm EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Toulouse DNB -120, 1 unit

**Write Up:** We&#x27;re venturing into the French league and I&#x27;m eyeing up the match between Toulouse and a flying Lens side. But make no mistake, Toulouse are in a pretty decent spot too. They&#x27;ve quietly turned their season around and come into <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>’s clash with **real momentum of 3 wins on the bounce** and 4 matches without defeat, making them a strong candidate to stun the slight favorites on paper. After a frustrating first half of the campaign, they look much sharper, more confident, and far harder to break down. They’ve gone unbeaten in their last four matches across all competitions and have won their last three games, including a **convincing 3-0 victory over Paris FC** that boosted both morale and momentum heading into 2026.

What I think is especially encouraging for Toulouse is their **home form.** They’ve picked up points in **five of their last six home matches**, keeping **two clean sheets in their last three outings** at the Stadium de Toulouse.

Meanwhile, *Lens may be leading Ligue 1,* but they **don&#x27;t look very threatening going forward** and don’t have an overwhelming H2H edge. **Toulouse actually defeated them twice in 2025**, only conceding one singular goal across the two fixtures, and Lens have generally **rarely cruised past this opponent** recently. The hosts also have **key attacking threats like Santiago Hidalgo and Yann Gboho** in good form, giving them real scoring potential even against strong defensive sides.

Considering Toulouse’s upward curve, solid home performances and the fact that they’re not outdone by Lens, I&#x27;m leaning towards a Toulouse win, but going to cover my stake in case of a draw. BTTS Yes is a fine bet too, but I&#x27;m sticking to match results for now. Preserving my bankroll for a special Saturday&#x27;s clash I really like, so going real light on this one with just a standard unit. BOL and let&#x27;s get the first win of the year ☘️🫡</td></tr>

Aveley vs Canvey Island, Over 3.5 goals @ 2.42

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s Event:** Italy Serie A (Soccer) | Cagliari vs AC Milan (11:45 AM PST)

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Milan ML + Pulisic 1+ SoT (+100) 1 unit to win 1 units

**Write Up:** Tough day all around for EPL yesterday, only 2 goals in 4 matches, and the goals came in the one match I thought would be nil-nil. Anyways, we move on again <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> and try a different league. I don&#x27;t frequently venture out of English football, but <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> I like the value on AC Milan.

Milan head to Cagliari as a clear favorite. I like them to come away with all 3 points here and put themselves back in 1st place. I debated taking -1, but there&#x27;s a very good chance they only win by 1 goal. So we are adding Pulisic SOT to up the odds. Pulisic had been in great form, scoring 4 goals in his last 4 matches. He was out injured for a chunk of the season, but is now hitting his stride and playing much further forward than last year, leading a dual pronged attack. 

BOL everyone, remember to tail with caution and do your own research. I&#x27;m very cold, despite some decent reads. Not every good read pans out. Happy Friday!</td></tr>

Darts, 2026 World Championship 🎯

Last POTD: Ryan Searle ML vs Johnny Clayton @ 1.73 ✅

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Gian van Veen -1.5 sets vs Gary Anderson @ 1.90

Alright, I’ve been thinking what I really wanna bet here. ML doesn’t seem like a value, 180’s are inconsistent. One thing or person that has been consistent and that’s Gian van Veen. 

He almost slaughtered Humphries into a 5-1 win with an average of 105.41. I knew I was going to take the winner of their game against Anderson because Anderson didn’t turn up as much as I expected him to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Just unfortunate to see the ML is at such low odds.

Anderson has been playing great but his performance <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> was even worse than Humphries’ performance against van Veen. Of course, it’s a different opponent and everything. Still haven’t seen Anderson play as well as Gian van Veen has been doing this tournament. The guy literally smashes all of his opponents. 

I’m still convinced that Gian van Veen will be winning this with -1.5 sets. Take into account that yesterday was the first to 5 sets to win. This game is first to 6 sets to win the match. 

Gian van Veen -1.5 sets @ 1.90 it is.

BOL!</td></tr>

🏈Holiday Bowl, Arizona vs SMU , 8 pm ET 1/2/25

Record: 13-12
Net Units: +0.22 Units ✅

Explanation: I think Arizona can beat SMU tomorrow because they have been very strong defensively this season and a clear turnover efficiency advantage. Opponents have a low 95.16 passer rating average against Arizona, and turnovers are what kill you in bowl games (and any game really).

If Arizona’s defense meets their standard and their offense even just plays average , they should be able to secure the win.</td></tr>

CAGLIARI VS AC MILAN

Date: 02 JANUARY 2026 at 20:45

BET ON: Over / Under team Cards- CAGLIARI Over +1.50

Odd: 1.50



\- Cagliari over 1.5 cards is well supported by the match context, tactical setup and referee profile. Pisacane’s side are expected to adopt a compact, low-to-mid block against a stronger Milan team chasing the top of the table, prioritising intensity, duels and disruption rather than possession. With key attacking absences such as Belotti, Felici and Folorunsho, Cagliari’s main way to stay competitive is through aggression, tight marking and stopping Milan’s rhythm with tactical fouls, especially in midfield and wide defensive areas against Leão, Pulisic and Nkunku. At home, Cagliari have consistently shown they are hard to beat against top sides, but that resistance often comes at the cost of discipline. Referee Rosario Abisso is known in Serie A for a relatively high incidence of disciplinary actions — averaging around 4+ total cards per game across recent seasons and often breaking up play with frequent fouls and cautions compared to league norms, including in matches involving Cagliari and big teams like Milan. With Milan expected to dominate possession and Cagliari forced into prolonged defensive phases, the likelihood of the hosts picking up at least two cards is high.</td></tr>

Write up: Writeup about Indiana was on the money - them damn Hoosiers are legit man - Model has this as the highest confident Edge % and EV % for the day. Will add some personal information in this write-up as well.

• ⁠Model has Michigan winning this game by 23+ 

• Model projects a 100+ point game from Michigan 

• EV better betting 100$ = 7-8$ for this play

• Michigan has been rocking and rolling ALL season long - they shoot about 54% from the field and average 42 rebounds/game - they have a lot of blowout wins this season, and while bigger spreads like this scare me, they have proven multiple times this season, they can cover the big spreads - While USC is ranked and 12-1, they haven’t played many good games, if any - they rank a lot lower in a lot of important stats like PPG &amp; FG % - I can see a Michigan blowout tomorrow night, so the coin is rolling with them - I am not a big “check the public % etc… type of guy” but I do feel like a lot of people will be all over USC solely based off of their record and big spread.

Cowboys got their boys back, the stars showed out! Dak played like dak! They were motivated from the jump! That’s just class right there baby. What a way to honor kneeland.

Event: Michigan State vs Kentucky (5:30pm central)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Under 154 (-115) (1U)

-everything is bet to win unit amount-

Write up: 

Tomorrow in the first game of the champions double header classic in NYC we have two dominant programs set to face off! Izzo and the Spartans will face mark pope and his wildcats to kick the night off and I expect this to be more of a rock fight than a firework show like the public thinks. This line opened at 154.5 and has since dropped to 153.5 despite heavy public action early on the over! The public has seen Kentucky put up over 90 points in almost all of their games and they saw the absolute shootout that went down in Louisville and immediately thinks why the hell would I not take it here?!

Let’s dive into some stats here…Kentucky plays at the 85th ranked adjusted tempo in cbb and Michigan state plays at the 267th ranked adjusted tempo in cbb. For instance, being on the road in Louisville for Kentucky, Louisville was able to establish how they wanted to control the game, and they play at the 26th adjusted tempo in the nation. The wildcats rank 144th in possessions per game while the Spartans sit at a lowly 311th in the nation in possessions per game. In terms of offensive rating per kenpom Kentucky sits at 8th in the nation, Michigan state is at 57th. However both teams are elite at defense ranking 10 and 13th respectively.  

Here’s where things get even better for our under,  Michigan state is 255th in the nation in effective field goal percentage at 47% and is damn near dead last in college basketball when it comes to shooting the three ball at 353rd in the nation sitting at a lowly 21%. The funny thing is these guys still hoist up 20+ threes a game as a lot of their players believe they can shoot the rock. I have watched many of their games and they are just pitiful from behind the arc. They are 118th in the nation in two point percentage as well. Not to mention they only shoot around 67% from the free throw line as well. With all this being said Kentucky is 17th in the nation in opponent effective fg% holding their opponents to just 40.9% and teams are shooting just 26% from behind the line against them, and just 41% from two point range! 

Now you may be thinking Kentucky -5.5 is the play after all that being said (and I do like that as well) however… the Spartans and izzo do know how to beat teams without shooting the ball well and that is what makes izzo and the Spartans such a dangerous team. They managed to beat Arkansas shooting 41% from the field and just 7% from three! That game ended with a total of 135 points! Kentucky is shooting 59% effective fg% at 20th in the nation and around 34% from three which is average at about 144th in the nation. However like I said, the Spartans are relentless on defense and hold their opponents to 48% effective fg% (which is what the Spartans themselves shoot) and 31% three point range. 

Both teams have some real size and matchup very well with each other on paper as they are both top 17 in the nation in total rebounds per game. 

I do not think the Spartans can afford to turn this into a shootout and izzo without a doubt knows this. If they want to have a shot to take down Kentucky tomorrow they are going to have to slow this game down, limit possessions, relentless defense, and taking the time to actually get a quality shot up each possession which does nothing but  bleed clock. The Spartans do not have the three point range to turn this into a game in the 80s and I think they will do a great job of keeping it the way they want to play, and if shit hits the fan I don’t think they’ll do enough to force this game over the total either. 

With sharp money on our side, reverse line movement, and a clear gameplan for the under I believe we have a solid <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> for ourselves. We have been having a great year in cbb and all sports in general! As always, cheers 🍻

Last Pick: Croatia vs Montenegro. Will A Goal Be Scored In Both Halves? Yes. (-160) ✅

Fixture: Denmark vs Scotland (World Cup Qualifiers) 11:45am PST Time

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: BTTS. Yes. (-125) 

Reasoning: Scotland and Denmark are both fighting for first place in the group to atomically qualify for the 2026 World Cup. Being said BTTS has landed in Denmarks last two games against Greece &amp; Belarus. Additionally, Denmark has scored in four consecutive World Cup qualifiers. Scotland also have scored in four consecutive World Cup qualifiers &amp; BTTS has occurred in their last three qualifiers. With both teams fighting to qualifying automatically for the World Cup, both teams will be eager &amp; highly aggressive in pushing up the field and getting a lead. 

Cheers 🍻</td></tr>

A great result away from home vs Denmark has Belarus pretty inspired going into a game with no stakes for both sides. Belarus has had 3 or more corners in 4/5 games in the group, 3 and 4 vs Denmark, 2 and 6 vs Scotland and 7 vs Greece in the reverse matchup. Greece have allowed 3 or more in all group games so far. As mentioned, Belarus had 7 in Greece, although Belarus don&#x27;t exactly play at home, they definitely have enough for 3 corners here against a Greek side with nothing to lose.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s Event:** UEFA World Cup Quals | Scotland vs Denmark (11:45AM PST)

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** John McGinn 1+ SOT (+110) 1 units to win 1.1 units

**Write Up:** Love me a sweat free plus money cash! Woltemade came through in the 19th minute with a header from a corner to net Germany their first of 6 goals on the day and clinch their spot in the World Cup. We also hit a +640 ATGS Parlay in the soccer thread. Great day overall! 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> we head to Scotland where our hosts face off against Denmark in another winner take all match to decide the group. Winner goes to the World Cup, loser heads to the 16 team playoffs in March, where only 4 teams will make it in. Of additional note is that Denmark goes through with a tie, so Scotland will need to be on the attack here at home. I&#x27;m expecting an end to end match here with both teams needing (and expecting) a win here. I&#x27;d be shocked if we wind up 0-0 like the reverse fixture in Denmark back in September. 

Denmark have had a mildly disappointing World Cup Qualifier thus far, in a group that they were expecting to run away with, and are coming off a disappointing draw against Belarus at home a few days ago. Now here they are, fighting for a spot at the World Cup away from home. They will be aggressive and want the win here and likely control the ball much of the match (73% possession in their last match), which much like our Kvaratskhelia <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, suits us just fine for this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. 

John McGinn, the captain of Aston Villa and 5th most capped Scotland player of all time, is my favorite kind of player to back. If you read any of my other write ups you&#x27;ll notice a theme, but I really do like to back hard working midfielders/strikers who don&#x27;t shy away from a challenge and always sprint to attack on breaks. Our guy McGinn obviously falls into this bucket and is a fun guy to watch on both ends of the pitch. McGinn has played all 90 minutes in every world cup qualifying match here and is the back-up captain for Scotland, so I see him playing the full 90 here again. We are getting good odds here as he has only hit this line in 2 of the 5 WC qualifying matches. But I&#x27;ve noticed a pattern that he tends to take more shots in the 2nd match of international breaks, hitting 1 SOT in all 3 of these matches this year. I&#x27;m also backing the intangibles a bit here, in that I like him to leverage his experience in the big game, take a few shots, and work hard to get his country to their first World Cup since 1998.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Takuya Kumasaka +6 games -180 (b105)

Analysis: this is genuinely an egregious line and mainly a system play fading Bolt coming off a perfect weekend where he AND his girlfriend both won titles! Obviously once in a lifetime moment and Alex was rightfully posting airport beers with his girlfriend as he prepped to fly from Brisbane to Sydney. Alex Bolt is obviously the better player but I have to wonder where A) his head is at B) how fatigued his body is [this will be his 6th game in 7 days]. This line is way too wide and *at worst* I get a push off a 6-3,6-3 loss. BUT I also wouldn’t be shocked to see Alex come out flat footed and Takuya snags a sneaky S1. This is gonna be alot closer than the books are predicting. We’re on a silly streak right now come ride the hot hand and see why they NVS 🌟

__Event:__ NCAAF: Western Michigan @ Northern Illinois 7pm EST

__POTD:__ Western Michigan -5.5 (-115 on FanDuel), 3.45u to win 3u

__Write Up:__ We’ve got some Tuesday night MACtion baby! I spent the day taking care of my dog post surgery &amp; we watched Western Michigan &amp; Northern Illinois film while he was high on meds. He &amp; I both agreed that this is the play. The Western Michigan Broncos (6-4, 5-1 MAC) are traveling to Dekalb, Illinois to take on the Northern Illinois Huskies (3-7, 2-4 MAC) at Huskie Stadium. Northern Illinois has had a brutal season this year, huge 180 after having a solid 8-5 season &amp; winning the Idaho Potato Bowl. Now this season they are disqualified from the bowl eligibility &amp; have been a punching bag all season. Last week NIU blew out UMass 45-3, seems like they’re turning it around right? False. UMass is the worst team in college football, with an 0-10 record, &amp; an average scoring margin that ranks last in the NCAA (-30.0). The week before NIU lost to Toledo 3-42. Western Michigan beat Toledo 14-13 earlier this season. The week before NIU beat Ball St 21-7, WMU beat them 42-0. Week before that NIU got wrecked by Ohio 21-48, WMU just beat Ohio 17-13 last week. Ohio is a good MAC team. Ohio &amp; Central Michigan were both tied for 1st place with WMU in the MAC Standings. WMU just beat them both the last 2 weeks to take the lead in the MAC standings. WMU has only 1 conference loss &amp; their only other losses came in nonconference play against Michigan State, Illinois, &amp; North Texas. North Texas is 9-1 &amp; ranked 22nd in the country in the AP polls, &amp; they had to come back &amp; win in OT to beat WMU. Western Michigan has a good team &amp; with a win this week they’ll improve to 6-1 &amp; will lock up a spot in Detroit in the MAC Title Game. __WMU have been covering machines this year with a (7-3) ATS record. Western Michigan has covered every time (3-0) as a 5.5 point favorite or greater this year. Northern Illinois on the other hand is (3-7) ATS record so far this season. Northern Illinois has just 1 win ATS (1-3) as a 5.5-point underdog or more this year.__ The Huskies are going to have a tough time this week vs a Western Michigan team that is rolling &amp; looking to lock their spot in the MAC Ship.

Western Michigan has had a successful season this year due to an elite MAC defense. They are an incredibly defensive 1st team. __The Broncos allow 291.4 yards per game, 12th in the nation. They rank 7th in FBS in passing yards allowed (161.1), 34th in yards per carry allowed (3.9 ypc), &amp; 16th in scoring defense allowing just 18.9 points per game.__ They are even more elite in their EPA (Expected Points Added) defensive numbers. __WMU has #2 EPA defense in the MAC, one of just 2 teams that have held their opponents to a negative EPA (-0.029). They have the 2nd best EPA/run allowed in the MAC. But they rank #1 in EPA/pass allowed in the MAC (-0.055), 40th best in the nation (which is crazy for a MAC team).__ That doesn’t bode well for an NIU team that hasn’t been able to pass all year. The NIU offense has been brutal this year. __Northern Illinois ranks 130th in offensive EPA &amp; are the 2nd worst in EPA Margin in the MAC (-0.335). They have the 2nd worst EPA/pass in the nation &amp; rank just 104th in epa/run. They haven’t had a QB top 90 yards in their last 3 games. NIU is averaging just 108.1 passing yards per game, 3rd fewest in the nation. Averaging even fewer at home with 76 yards per game, 2nd fewest.__ That normally would mean that they have an elite run game. __However, they faced a defense similar to WMU in Toledo 2 weeks ago (both ranked 52 &amp; 53 in EPA), &amp; NIU had just 62 yards on 36 carries. That’s an average of just 1.7 yards per carry.__ NIU has had obvious QB trouble all season. Last week Jalen Macon (6-5, 230) took over at QB for Josh Holst. He&#x27;s thrown just 4 times all year, but he is a dual threat QB who uses his legs more than his arm. Still, it doesn’t look like this offense has any desires to pass the ball with Macon. Last week he threw just 4 passes vs the 2nd worst pass defense in the MAC. He completed 3 of those throws for 73 yards, but 67 of those yards came on 1 pass in busted coverage. If WMU takes a lead NIU doesn’t have the ability to come back with no pass game. It doesn’t help that WMU has a stout DLine either. __WMU ranks 31st in pressure rate in the NCAA &amp; will eat this weak NIU OLine alive.__ NIU’s offense just can’t do anything vs solid defenses. __Despite scoring 42 points last week, NIU still ranks 132nd in scoring offense at just 15.5 points per game.__ Where Northern Illinois struggles the most is on 3rd down. __NIU ranks 127th in 3rd down %, converting 32% of the time for a 1st down. WMU ranks 23rd in the country in 3rd down defense, allowing its opponents to convert at just 33.6%.__ They’ll have their hands full with this defense, but this game is going to come down to Western Michigan’s offense.

Last week Western Michigan faced Ohio, both teams were 4-1 &amp; were playing for 1st place in MAC standings. __Ohio had the #2 ranked EPA Defense in the MAC &amp; WMU had a highly efficient offensive performance. WMU ranked 10th in the country last week in offensive success rate (57.1%). They outgained Ohio 336-287 in yards &amp; won the turnover battle 1-0.__ There was a QB competition earlier this year between Broc Lowry and Brady Jones, Lowry took over &amp; now has a 7 to 1 TD/INT ratio with a 64.7% completion rate &amp; is the team’s leading rusher in yards, carries, &amp; rushing TD’s. Most importantly he has taken great care of the football in this rushing offense. __Lowry is the highest graded QB in the MAC with a 82.1 grade (per PFSN).__ But where WMU does their damage on offense is on the ground. __WMU has averaged 177.7 rushing yards their last 3 games, 2 of which were against the best 2 defenses in the MAC. NIU has the 132nd EPA/run defense in the nation, 114th vs the pass.__ Western Michigan’s biggest weakness on offense has been ball control. __WMU has lost 8 fumbles this year. But that’s not going to be a problem vs an NIU defense that has just 3 fumble recoveries on the season &amp; had only recovered 33% of fumbles (118th). WMU has been elite at recovering fumbles, snagging 56% of them (39th).__ NIU doesn’t have any advantages on either side of the ball. *Ran out of room but wanted to focus more on WMU’s defense.* 

Western Michigan has both a better offense &amp; defense with a +3.4 point differential, as opposed to Northern Illinois who has -6.7 point differential.

Broncos Country, let’s ride.

__Western Michigan -5.5__

Yesterday&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Netherlands v Lithuania. Netherlands -5 corners. 3u @ $1.85 ❌  

Super annoying. The Netherlands attacked the entire game. It was disappointing to see them just constantly recycle possession outside the box instead of putting a few balls in or getting some long shots away. 

I got on a hedge early in the second half, so I didn&#x27;t lose money, but I was disappointed to miss the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>. 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Belgium to win to nil AND Romania to win to nil. 4u @ $1.78

Not a hell of a lot to say here. Backing the two worst teams in Europe to not score and lose is pretty safe to me. Also, I got on this yesterday at $2.17, and it&#x27;s already down to $1.78, so I&#x27;d expect it to go down more too. 

However, for the sake of the write-up. 

Top of the group, Belgium play at home against the bottom of the group, Liechtenstein. 

Lichtenstein have lost every game and are yet to score, conceding 24 in the process. Last time these guys played, Belgium won 6-0. 

Romania had the wind knocked out of them against Bosnia a few days ago (great for us though). Even with that, I can&#x27;t see them doing anything silly vs San Marino. 

They might not be going at 100%, but San Marino to not score is always a good bet. </td></tr>

Next <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **Desmond Bane (Magic) O18.5 Pts @ 1.84**. 3U play.

Bane has been shooting poorly all season, and in fact, has shot above 50% just once in his L10 games. Why am I taking his over you ask? Because he’s gaining confidence with every game, and the missed shots aren’t reducing his FGAs nor his aggression. He’s also a near-perfect free throw shooter, and I expect he’ll do quite a bit of that against the Warriors. He’s taken between 15-20 FGAs in each of his last 4 games, and with Paolo out, he’s taken on more responsibility for the offense. He’s shooting just 27% from 3 with the Magic, but I attribute that to his adjustment to a new system and new team. It&#x27;s only a matter of time. As a final vote of confidence, he is over this line in 4 straight games for the Magic, and all 3 games against the Warriors in 2025 (with the Grizz). Between the high FGAs, free throws, 3pt mean reversion and a favorable matchup, he has many paths to get over this line.

**Flensburg - Potaissa Turda** 🤾 Handball EHF European League

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **Pințoiu Total Goals Under (4.5)** @ 1.85

This line is higher than expected! 3.5 would have been a more reasonable option. I see value here. Pințoiu is important in Turda&#x27;s 9-meter line (especially LB/CB), but he&#x27;s not the primary ball carrier. Shots are shared more evenly between Mošić and R. C. Ghiță; Kbilashvili is predominantly active on 7-meter shots. This limits &quot;easy scoring&quot; opportunities. Flensburg&#x27;s central defense and goalkeeping quality (against 6-meter and 9-meter shots) should challenge Pințoiu. Below are his goals scored this season.

PICKS: Romania -2.5 goals + Austria ML @ 1.84 (2.5U)

WRITE UP: 

Great win on the last one with Northern Ireland seeing off Luxembourg and Germany as predicted, dismantling Slovakia 6-0 to claim top spot in the group.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>..

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>PICK</mark> 1 - Romania -2.5 goals (win by 3 or more) vs San Marino. It comes as no suprise that San Marino are not given a great chance tomorrow. Sitting bottom of the group with a record of 0-0-7 with 1 goal scored and 32 goals against.. Romania on the other hand have missed the chance to qualify for the World Cup via the group and will have to settle for the playoffs. It appears they will field a strong team tomorrow and I would be suprised to see them win by 5+. However, I think the -2.5 handicap is the sweet spot, just incase they take their foot off the gas late on.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> 2 - Austria ML. Austria come into this game knowing a win or draw vs 2nd place Bosnia see’s them win the group and go to the World Cup. They come into the game with a record of 6-0-1 in the group having scored 21 goals and conceded only 3, impressively not conceding a single shot on target in their last game vs Cyprus. 

Austria are starting to look a very strong side under Ralf Ragnick and come into this game with no fresh injury concerns. Bosnia however have 3 players suspended. 

Bosnia are a half decent side but it as very much been a case of them being the best of the rest in the group and Austria should be able to take control of the game and get the job done. I predict a 2-0 win for the hosts. 

As always nothing is guaranteed in sport so bet responsibly.. but the facts point towards this being a winning play on a very regular basis.

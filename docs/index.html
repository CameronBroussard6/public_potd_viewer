**Last:** Wolverhampton/Manchester United BTTS – Always nice when plays hit before half!

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Kairat Almaty/Olympiacos under 2.5 goals

**Start Time:** 10:30 AM EST

**Odds:** \+105 (BetMGM)

**Units:** 1 unit to win 1.05 units

**Reasoning:** Two teams at the bottom of the Champions League table, both without a win.  Kairat has lost both home fixtures in this competition and has yet to score in either game.  Of their 5 games in Champions League, they scored more than 1 goal once, and that was in their last match after going down 3-0.  They added 2 late goals at a point when the game was already determined.  I think this game will be much closer as the Kazakhstan side get this game at home.  Against Pafos at home, they were unable to score despite being up a man most of the match.  At home in both the Kazakhstan Premier League and Champions League, they are conceding less than a goal per game. 

Olympiakos come in also playing strong defense in the Greece Super League, having only given up 7 goals in 13 matches.  The numbers in Champions League are not as impressive, but that is because they have played 3 of the top teams in the world, conceding multiple goals against Arsenal, Real Madrid and Barcelona.  Those matches are why I believe we are getting decent odds on this 2.5 goal total.   They shut out Pafos, a similar if not better team than Kairat and held PSV to 1 goal. 

I think Kairat will put up a good fight at home, but they are overmatched in Champions League.  As a result, I don’t see them taking many chances leading to a boring low scoring game with very few chances from either side. Both sides defend well and lack a ton of finishing quality.  Good Luck</td></tr>

(20.00 GMT) 

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Match Over 2.5 goals - 10€ to win 17.80€

**Write Up:** And we get ourselves my first win of the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> history! Thank you Manchester United heck yea! So let&#x27;s get to our next matchup and for our NEXT WIN of course and here are few reasonings of why I picked this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>.

Four out of five Chelsea’s CLgames this season have finished with over 2.5 goals.

Bets on over 2.5 goals won in four out of last five home games of Atalanta in Europe.

Nine out of 12 away games of Chelsea produced 3 or more goals.

Chelsea is on better form at the European league games, so there’s a little bit of edge to them. I see a 2-1 win being pretty realistic for The Blues. They have gotten 10 points from their last four Champions League matches and recently won against Barcelona in a very solid 3-0 win. Atalanta’s home playing has been inconsistent and that gives them weaknesses imo. Although they have been pretty solid on attacking game recently. If you want more odds, I&#x27;d happily play this as Chelsea to win and match over 2.5 goals.

They&#x27;re dropping games to legit underdogs, whereas Inter only narrowly lose to top sides (Atleti, AC Milan, Napoli) and still look disciplined and competitive throughout.

**Writeup:** Raptors are suffering from the loss of RJ , poor coaching and more.  They are bad at rebounding and I see Robinson taking advantage. I think he gets 7 at least matching his season average. KAT is questionable with calf strain so he might not even play which pretty much guarantees the bet. Otherwise, minutes are split with Yabusele.  Either way, I would do this. Maybe I&#x27;m missing something, but can&#x27;t see it. Sorry for the messy writeup, doing this before work.</td></tr>

Lublin - Halkbank 🏐 Volleyball Champions League UTC: 17.00

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: 175.5 Over @ 1.70

Lublin, last season&#x27;s Polish champions and Challenge Cup winners, are a meteoric rise under Leon&#x27;s leadership, competing in the CL for the first time this season. The team&#x27;s perception, both internally and at the CEV level, is very positive; the rhetoric of &quot;they could surprise in their first season in the CL&quot; is boosting motivation. At the same time, this expectation is increasing the internal pressure. The match will be at Hala Globus in Lublin (with a capacity of approximately 4,200). As Lublin&#x27;s first CL match, the arena is expected to be packed, and the atmosphere is expected to reach playoff levels.

Halkbank; They are a wildcard team, playing in the CL Final Four last season but finishing 8th in the domestic league, and aiming for the top spot again with the return of Stoytchev and Sokolov. Halkbank faces the challenges of traveling from Ankara to Lublin, the climate, and the gym adaptation; however, these are manageable disadvantages for a squad with this level of CL experience.

Both teams are in the upper echelon of their respective leagues in terms of attack. Lublin has a tempo attack that focuses on Leon and Sasak, but can also use middle blockers effectively. Halkbank, with their Sokolov, Leal, and Kaziyski trio, is very physical and experienced, a bit more high-ball-oriented, but their finishing quality is exceptional. I expect the match to go at least four sets and be a close game.</td></tr>

**Montreal Canadiens vs Tampa Bay Lightning at 7pm EST (Hockey/NHL)** : Lightning over 2.5 goals (-170)

I&#x27;m a Habs fan but this game screams like a bounce back game offensively for the Lightning. I said over 5.5 goals total yesterday vs Leafs in the NHL thread but even if they had some great chances, Hildeby and the Leafs defense looked solid. I don&#x27;t expect them to get shutout vs the Canadiens. Habs goalie and their defense are very leaky. Lightning ML looks tempting but they lost 4 in a row so the Habs could make a comeback.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Bayern Munich vs Sporting CP – **Bayern Munich -1 Handicap @ 1.72** **(3 Units)**

It&#x27;s the last Champions League week of the year, so let&#x27;s enjoy it and hopefully make some money.

I am confident that this matchday will bring a few surprises, due to the constellations. A Barcelona victory against a struggling Frankfurt side is a strong possibility, but the bookmakers have already factored this in. The situation in Liverpool makes Inter vs. Liverpool a mystery, and I don&#x27;t trust Chelsea at all at the moment. I see PSV having a chance at home against Atleti, but even there, according to the model, there is no clear value; the bookmakers have done their job.

There&#x27;s only one outcome I am kind of expecting: a dominant home win for Bayern, after they convincingly beat a good Stuttgart side 5-0 at the weekend with a rotated team. A win will virtually qualify Bayern for the round of 16. The next game isn&#x27;t until Sunday, so there&#x27;s no need to rotate or rest players <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. The best team will be on the pitch. A little note though: Diaz is suspended and he has been crucial to Bayern&#x27;s offence in recent weeks.  
  
Another small psychological detail: Alphonso Davies will be back on the bench for the first time after a long knee injury, but their manager Kompany has said that he will only be used if it is not a close game. Davies is very popular in the dressing room, so his teammates will definitely want to give him some minutes in front of the home crowd in the Champions League, if possible.

Sporting are a tough opponent, but they have a few problems away from home and have already conceded 1.5 goals per game there. Yesterday, the press conference delivered bad news: Quenda, Trincao and Goncalves will be missing from this game. Almost the entire starting offence will be absent. Ignacio&#x27;s participation in the game is also in doubt. These are all bad omens against a Bayern team that has a value of 2.53 xGoals in the Champions League (the second best value in the entire Champions League). 

My model, adjusted for the squad situation, predicts a win by at least two goals with over 70% probability. Given the circumstances, I am confident and am betting three units. Over 2.5 goals seems like good bet at first, but it doesn&#x27;t offer much value given how depleted Sporting&#x27;s offense is and how solid their defence is (only 0,8 xGa in the Champions League).   
  
It is clear that anything can happen in a game. An early red card or penalty (like yesterday&#x27;s) can quickly change the situation. You must only bet what you can afford to lose comfortably.   
**There are no 100% sure tips, so don&#x27;t act like it.**  
  
**Please only bet money that you can afford to lose. BOL to all of you!**</td></tr>

Event: Illinois Vs Ohio State NCAAB

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Ohio State Moneyline (+140) 5 units

Rationale: Illinois is fresh off an emotional win and it’ll be a tough test for them here. While Illinois has the better coach and the overall better players, they have not impressed me in the film that I’ve watched of them this season. Yah, the stats tell a different story but I don’t buy their offensive success thus far based on watching them play. On the other end, Watching Ohio State on the court, it’s clear they’re firing on all cylinders. In their last outing, a tight 86–82 road win over Northwestern, Brandon Noel dominated with 29 points on near-perfect shooting, and Bruce Thornton orchestrated the offense with 10 assists. The Buckeyes showed composure in crunch time which was really impressive, improving to 7–1 overall and 1–0 in Big Ten play, and their cohesion offensively and poise are evident every time they hit the floor. Offensively, Ohio State looks nearly unstoppable with their motions and offensive schemes. They move the ball effortlessly, average over 88 points per game, and Thornton drives the team with consistent scoring and sharp shooting from deep, while Christoph Tilly and Devin Royal provide reliable interior production. John Mobley Jr. spaces the floor with his perimeter shooting, and Noel’s breakout performance shows the team’s depth. Defensively, they’re equally impressive. Ohio State limits opponents to just over 69 points per game and makes life difficult inside with their size, while holding teams to a very low % from three-point range. Their combination of disciplined defense and balanced offense is intimidating, especially at home where they remain unbeaten. For Ohio State, this will be a terrific litmus test for them and a great chance to showcase their talents. I think Ohio State is being severely undervalued here and I’m expecting an electric performance and environment tomorrow.

Just to reiterate, in conjunction with my model, I use the eye test as well as my gut feeling to play what I believe is the most-valuable <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> on the slate. Cheers to a great game, and please remember to gamble responsibly and to only wager what you can afford to lose.

**Write up:** Inter Milan enter tomorrow’s Champion’s League matchup with multiple statistical and form-based advantages that make their moneyline <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>’s **Lockdown <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick Of the Day</mark>**. Inter are coming in with strong momentum after a dominant 4–0 win over Como, a performance that showed both attacking prowess and defensive stability. Inter have conceded under 1.0 goals per match at home across European appearances, and their xGA trend at the San Siro has consistently been one of the lowest among top Italian clubs. Liverpool, meanwhile, arrive in notably unstable form. Their recent fixtures show a defense conceding well above their season average, with multiple matches allowing 2+ goals, and they have struggled to keep clean sheets away from home. Inter’s attack, which features a high-conversion front three and a midfield creating above-average chance quality, matches up well against a Liverpool back line that has been consistently exposed in transition. The historical head-to-head is balanced, but with both sides taking one win each recently, the situational edges matter more here: Inter’s home performance metrics, their dominant form, and Liverpool’s inconsistency and internal issues. With Inter controlling possession more effectively in recent fixtures, generating higher xG than opponents in four straight matches, and Liverpool trending downward defensively, the data suggests that Inter Milan ML is a high EV <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. All factors together point to Inter Milan ML as the sharper, analytically supported side.

Write Up: 

The Privateers get it done in Lakefront Arena on a small Monday slate on the hardwood.

Transitioning into Tuesday, again a relatively smaller schedule with finals week, but Penn State and Indiana get together in Bloomington for a clash in the BIG10.

Penn State is 8-1 heading into this game with a weak strength of schedule while flirting with close games against Fairfield and Harvard. Indiana is 7-2 coming off back-to-back losses against Minnesota on the road and Louisville on a neutral.

Penn State’s only true road test this season was a blowout win at New Haven, a game I don’t takeaway much from given the talent gap and the Chargers first year in D1. They also played a so-so Providence team on a neutral and lost by 12 in that one.

With Indiana coming off two losses on top of playing their BIG10 home opener with Darian DeVries in Year 1 under the helm, I think this a smash spot for the team that’s played the tougher schedule with wins against Marquette and Kansas State.

Hoosiers win this game in Assembly Hall by 20+ and avoid going 0-2 in BIG10 play.

Write up:

The Sabres enter this matchup again on a b2b having dropped three games in a row. You can refer to my previous write up link to see the stats on the Sabres in their last 10 and their current state. If it ain’t broke don’t fix it. Staying in the state of Canada I believe the Sabres will want to get up for this one! They will be highly motivated to get back in the win column but with tired legs this will be no easy feat. Goaltender instability isn’t going to bode well again. The oilers present an even bigger opportunity for the over here. They enter this matchup scoring the 6th most goals in the last 10 game span of NHL and have allowed the 5th most goals during that same span. This will be their 4th home game in a row having posted 15 goals in their last two games! This will be even easier against a Sabres team that has allowed 4+ goals in 4 of their last 5 road games. In their last 10 games both these teams are top 7 in shots on goal for and the oilers are bottom 10 in shots allowed on goal. And on top of all this… both are 1st and 2nd respectively in high danger shots for over their last 10 games. This has all the makings of an over and I believe at even money we have great value!

Write Up:

The Oilers head into tonight’s matchup with the Sabres riding legitimate momentum. They crushed the Seattle Kraken 9-4, with Connor McDavid netting a hat-trick and contributing an assist, and Leon Draisaitl piling up points as well. Then the game after that… BOOM! 6-2 score against the Winnipeg Jets. This kind of offensive explosion shows they’re dialed in.

Meanwhile, Buffalo has looked increasingly shaky defensively, as they just gave up 7 goals in a 7-4 loss to the Calgary Flames, marking their third straight defeat. Their ability to stop an elite offense like Edmonton’s seems in question right now.

Buffalo hasn’t shown consistency. Their recent losses have been by 3+ goals and this reflects on their poor puck management, defensive breakdowns and no answers when teams bring pressure, which Edmonton does very well. 

Given Edmonton’s offensive firepower, Buffalo’s defensive lapses, buffalos travel as they are on a back to back, and Edmontons confidence at home…. I’m backing Edmonton to take this one by at least two goals.

Take the Edmonton Oilers -1.5 🏒</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:  Soccer Parlay : Barcelona v Eintracht Frankfurt (Barcelona -1.5 goals) + Inter v liverpool (Inter and draw double chance)**

**Start Time:** **Barcelona v Eintracht Frankfurt 3:00 PM ET, Inter v Liverpool 3:00 PM ET**

**Odds:** \-122 (fanduel)

**Units:** 5U

**Reasoning:**  
**Leg 1: Barcelona vs Eintracht Frankfurt — Barcelona -1.5 Goals**  
Barcelona come into this matchup with a major quality gap in their favor. Their attacking trio has been in strong form, and at home they consistently generate high-quality chances. Frankfurt’s back line has struggled against top-tier offenses all season, especially on the road. A -1.5 handicap means Barcelona needs to win by at least two goals, and based on the matchup dynamics—possession dominance, expected goals advantage, and defensive mismatches—Barcelona is well-positioned to cover this margin.

**Leg 2: Inter vs Liverpool — Inter or Draw (Double Chance)**  
Inter have been one of the most balanced teams in Europe, combining elite defensive structure with efficient counterattacking. At home they rarely lose, and Liverpool come in with inconsistent form and key vulnerabilities in midfield transition. The double-chance protects against a narrow game where Inter control tempo but a draw remains in play. Given Inter’s home strength and Liverpool’s inconsistency away, this provides strong value.

**Why This Parlay Works**  
This parlay pairs a heavy favorite expected to dominate (Barcelona) with a statistically safer leg built around home-team stability (Inter double chance). Together, it blends high probability outcomes from two different matchup styles, creating a balanced, analytics-driven play for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>’s slate.

Write up: Bayern vs Sporting - Sporting have key players missing and Bayern rested Kane, Tah, Neuer in their last league game. They still won 5-0 away at Stuttgart. Bayern cleared -1.5 handicap line in every game they played at home except one ( Dortmund 2-1 win). After Arsenal loss, they would want to show a strong reaction and I expect them to score goals for fun. 

Barcelona vs Frankfurt: This is an absolute nightmare match up for Frankfurt. Their defense is non existent and conceded 6! vs Leipzig last weekend in Bundesliga. They already conceded 14 from 5 matches played in UCL and it isn&#x27;t going to get any better when they face an attacking team like Barca. They scored 3 vs Betis away and are the clear favourites. 

I just find so much value in this bet considering both teams playing at home and their opponents quality is questionable at the moment. Anything could happen;) Good luck if you&#x27;re tailing!</td></tr>

Bittersweet win as he doesn’t cash the bump or the alt but ends on exactly 9 RA. 13 potential assists for him where he only manages to get 4 but gets the work done due to the rebounds, horrible shooting night from the Cavs. We move

Cup game. #1 options have absolutely torched the Magic this season mainly due to their 1 on 1 coverage in defense where they don’t send help and focuses on playing man to man defense. As a result they’re ranked bottom in the league in ISO points allowed where Herro gets 20% of his points from, has taken 42% of his shots from the paint so far where Magic are ranked 27th.

We’ve seen Brunson drop 30, 33 &amp; 31, Fox 30, Cunningham 39, Harden 31 &amp; Curry 34 etc..

Magic does a good job of limiting assists but the scoring upside will always be there for the high usage guys due to their scheme.

Herro is over this line in 4/5 games this season avg 23.8 PPG and dropped 30 points in his latest meeting against the Magic last season where he had 28 FGA.

15+ FGA in all games this season, with 15+ FGA over in 16/L20 games dating back to last year.

Good matchup for Herro to get buckets, as long as we get the volume needed im fairly confident he’ll get it done. Currently probable which is a good indicator he’ll play.</td></tr>

For tomorrow&#x27;s slate, we have Heat vs Magic. This is an important match, so we can expect the key players to get more minutes and usage. Heat&#x27;s offense runs via Bam in a leverage situation. We can expect him to have \~35+ minutes and high usage.   
In his games this season, where he had 30+ minutes, he has hit this line 7/10 times, i.e, 70% hit rate. Now, factor in the importance of the match and his usage, and I would expect the hit rate to be above 75%.  
In his last matchup against Magic, he went 39 PR with 40 minutes of playtime. He also went 27 PR with 34 minutes in October this season, but those were comparatively in less leverage situations with the rotation testing phase. So, I am inclined to look more into recent data.

I’m a blues fan. This line doesn’t make sense. The Blues lost 5-2 to the Bruins last week on Thursday. The blues won 2 games in a row on Saturday and Sunday, making tomorrow their 3rd game in 4 days. The Bruins on the other hand are pretty well rested, as their last game was Saturday where they beat the Devils.

As far as goaltending is concerned, neither Binnington or Hofer have played particularly well this year. Swayman on the other hand has had a good year and had the day off on Saturday, so he hasn’t played since Thursday when they beat this St Louis team.

The Blues are 5-6-4 at home this year. They have a -27 goal differential, which is the worst in the Western Conference. The Bruins are a respectable 6-8-0 with a +2 goal differential on the season.

Simply put, the Bruins are the better team, and they are plus money.

**Writeup:**

* FORZE Reload was on a crazy run of good form recently and we took them around 10 days ago as a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> when they were running hot, their recent spell of great form has seemingly dried up after their 9 win streak.. In the last week they are 2-5 in matches overall with a map score of 6-12 while losing to VP prodigy, and struggling against NEXUS who are both well below their skill level
* Fire Flux have really started to put the pieces together with their new roster and have been finding much more consistency, in the last two weeks they are 6-1 in matches overall with a map score of 13-4 overall in those matches, their only loss was a close loss to Nuclear TigeRES who have been in great form. They have won each of their last 7 map picks in the last 2 weeks 7/7 cover rate
* These teams did face off previously h2h and FORZE Reload beat them 2-0 in a relatively close game, most important to me is FORZE Reload were using their previous roster as it was2 months ago, and it was when Fire Flux was still early on and adjusting to their roster. Despite losing 19-17 and 13-7, they lost 3/4 pistol rounds and had a really awful start on Dust 2
* FORZE Reload are the higher seeded team and they will have side choice in this match, similar to last time these teams faced off in October, FORZE also had side selection and chose to veto second, as do 95% of teams, see no reason why this changes meaning Fire Flux map <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> should be first

**Projected Veto:**

* Fire Flux ban Nuke, FORZE Reload ban Inferno
* Fire Flux <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> Dust 2 (chance of Mirage)

**Dust 2 Stats:**

* Fire Flux are 65% winrate on 23 maps of Dust 2 in the L3 months, they are 4-2 in the last month
* FORZE Reload are 45% winrate on 31 maps of Dust 2 in the L3 months, they are 6-7 in the last month,
* FORZE Reload are on a 4 map loss streak on Dust 2, Fire Flux 2W streak
* FORZE Reload have been struggling on Dust 2 despite winning over 53% of pistol rounds, they are negative winrate on CT side averaging only 45.6% of rounds
* Fire Flux have been even more dominant on Dust 2 then the stats show, they are winning only 39% of pistol rounds which subsequently often lead to 2 rounds of pistol buys which are very easy to win, despite this they are 51.8% winrate on CT Side and 59.1% winrate T side</td></tr>

Here we have a matchup where I think the underdog has a great chance of winning this match. 

Bassols is more experienced in the WTA and her playstyle is focused around resilience and baseline tolerance. She played last week in Angers and was knocked out by Zhang, where she was able to contest the match but struggled against the aggressive playstyle of the Chinese player, who was not at her best after a previous long week but still won in straight sets. 

Leonard has less experience at the pro level but is having a great year, now already ranked 50 places higher than Bassols. She plays well in hard courts and had a phenomenal month of October, winning two ITFs in a row, even against decent opposition like Dodin. With this, she&#x27;s on a 10 match winning streak. The French player likes to take the ball early which on an indoor surface, should be a good tactic against Bassols who often relies on prolonging points with heavy spin and a classical Spanish approach to the game. 

Last year in this specific tournament, Leonard reached the quarterfinals and she seems to perform well in front of her home crowd. Due to this, I really like her odds to win this match.

Good luck!

__POTD:__ Illinois -3.5 (-110), 3.3u to win 3u

__Write Up:__ Illinois (7-2, 0-0 Big Ten) is headed to Columbus, Ohio to take on the (7-1, 1-0 Big Ten) Ohio State Buckeyes on Tuesday night in a huge Big Ten rivalry matchup. Ohio St opened its conference schedule with an 86-82 win at Northwestern on Saturday. Was a much needed win after they had lost their previous game on Black Friday against a bad Pittsburgh team who has now lost their last 4 games vs teams outside of Ohio State. Despite their 7-1 record, Ohio State has only played 3 teams ranked inside the top 242 ranked teams. They beat #62 Notre Dame 64-63, lost to #109 Pittsburgh 66-67, &amp; recently beat #59 Northwestern 86-82. Their only 2 wins they had vs decent teams, of which have a combined 12-8 record, they barely squeaked by. Now they face an elite Illinois team that is coming off biggest win thus far this season. Illinois is coming off a huge win as underdogs vs #13 Tennessee, a team that has made back to back Elite 8’s the last 2 seasons. Illinois waxed them 75-62. Tennessee has a great squad this year too, having handed #8 Houston their only loss this season &amp; with KenPom having their defense ranked #12 in the nation. That didn’t stop 4 Illinois starters from scoring in double digits. Illinois’s biggest issue has been health. Now with a team almost fully healthy, they look like one of the best teams in the country. 

Illinois finally has almost all their guys back, but the biggest one is Tomislav Ivisic. Illinois rebuilt their front court around the returning 7’2 Croation big man this offseason, including bringing in his 7’2 twin brother Zvonimir from Arkansas in the transfer portal. Tomislav injured his knee earlier this season &amp; is finally back to full health, &amp; it showed vs Tennessee. He had 16 points on 7/13 shooting (including 2 threes) &amp; a team best +17 plus-minus. The Illinois front court dominates the paint &amp; gets all the rebounds, as they always have done under head coach Brady Underwood. In 2023 Illinois ranked 5th in rebounds in the NCAA (40.9). Last year Illinois ranked #1 in the nation in rebounds (42.6). __Illinois is top 10 in nation in rebounding this season averaging 43.1 per game. That’s bad news for an Ohio State team that ranks just 107th, averaging 37.3 rebounds per game. OSU was out rebounded by Northwestern 29-34 (ranks 245th in Reb’s), Pittsburgh 38-39 (151st in Reb’s), &amp; Notre Dame 28-36 (117th in Reb’s).__ Ohio State has a big man themselves, Santa Clara transfer, 7’0 big man Christopher Tilly. But he is a horrible rebounder. He is averaging just 5.0 rebounds per game this season, his career high. Ohio State doesn’t have a single guy averaging more than 5 rebounds per game. Illinois is going to absolutely demolish them on the boards. But neither of the Ivisic brothers are even the leading rebounder on this team. That would be 6’9 250 pound Freshman David Mirkovic from Montenegro who is averaging nearly a double double this season, with 13.8 points &amp; 9.6 rebounds. He became the 8th Big Ten player in the last 8 seasons to have a 20-20 game earlier this season. He rounds out Illinois’s dominant front court. Not only are they big, but they are versatile. While will be key vs an Ohio State offense that loves to get in the paint. Ohio St coach Jake Diebler runs a pace &amp; space offense that is guard driven focusing on screens, dribble handoffs, &amp; getting to the basket. This has resulted in Ohio St leading the nation in 2pt FG% at 65.5%, including 49.1% from mid range (although against horrible opponents). This is how Ohio St wins games. __But that’s an issue vs a long lengthy athletic Illinois team who excels on defense at shutting down 2 point shots, ranking 12th (41%) in the NCAA in opponent 2pt FG % in their last 3 games that include #5 UConn &amp; #13 Tennessee, who they held to 35% from 2.__ On the other side of the court down low, Illinois has been electric in the post as well. __Illinois shoots 60.3% from 2 pointers, 22nd in the NCAA. Ohio St ranks just 181st in opponents 2 point percentage allowed (51.7%).__ This is where the biggest separation is between the 2 teams. Ohio State’s defense is not good. They have one of the worst post defenses in the NCAA. __OSU has just a 4.7% block rate, 348th in the nation per KenPom. To put it in perspective, Illinois averages a 13.7% defensive block rate. Facing an Illinois offense that ranks in the 10 in the nation in rim attack averaging 1.06 PPP that’s a recipe for disaster.__ Ohio St’s offense is led by one of the best players in the country though, Bruce Thornton, who I got to watch play in high school down the road from my house. He is talented guard averaging 20.1 points per game this season, with 5.1 rebounds &amp; 4.3 assists. He’ll be matched up with Illinois’ Kylan Boswell. These 2 are both dawgs &amp; it’s going to be one hell of a back &amp; forth. Not only has Boswell been good on the defensive end, but he also has been elite on offense. Boswell leads the team with 17 ppg &amp; 3.8 apg. He also controls the ball well. After having a turnover rate at 18+% his first 3 years, he has vastly improved this season with a TO% just below 11%. Illinois has been efficient as a whole controlling the ball, as evident last game vs Tennessee where they finished with just 6 TO’s, having 0 TO’s over the final 12 minutes of the game. __Illinois ranks 14th in the nation in offensive turnovers at just 11.7%. Ohio St won’t be getting very many steals as they rank 211th in the NCAA in defensive takeaways. Their offense turns it over a lot too, turning it over at the nations 154th highest rate (14.6%).__ To round out the Illinois offense they have an elite shooter in NBA Legend Peja Stojaković’s son, Andrej who is a 6’7 wing that can snipe from 3 just like his dad. Keep an eye on Keaton Wagler, too. I think Illinois can expose a big mismatch in size, as Wagler has played both the No. 1 &amp; No. 2 guard spots this season while standing at 6’6. Ohio State’s biggest guard is 6’2. That is something Illinois can expose as they’re filled with wings all above 6’6. Illinois has so many weapons on offense &amp; defense this Ohio St team will struggle to keep up. 

Illinois is simply the much more talented team. Even on the road at Ohio State’s home court I think they have the capability of running away with this one. Give me the team that’s bigger &amp; better on defense, rebounding, &amp; in the paint.

__Illinois -3.5__

**Last:** (CBB) Arizona -7.5 (1u) - W

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** (CBB) No. 13 Illinois (-3.5) at Ohio State

**Start Time:** 7:30 PM ET (Peacock)

**Odds:** -108 (DraftKings)

**Units:** 1U

**Reasoning:** Pot meet kettle. Illinois meet… Ohio State?

At least that’s what the stats might lead you to believe. 

Through nine games, the Illini (7-2) have proved to be among the nation’s best offensively, ranking 9th in offensive efficiency (1.238), 20th in scoring (88.7 PPG), 54th in field-goal percentage (48.1%) and 182nd in three-point shooting (33.2%). Not to be outdone, the Buckeyes (7-1) bring in a high-flying offense of their own, ranking 3rd in field-goal percentage (53.0%), 16th in offensive efficiency (1.213), 27th in scoring (88.4 PPG) and 59th in three-point shooting (36.9%). If that’s not the statistical translation of “hold my beer,” it’s pretty damn close. 

But the mirror images don’t slow down on the defensive end of the floor.

Thus far, Illinois has been a formidable out for opposing offenses, ranking 40th in opponent field-goal percentage (39.9%), 69th in defensive efficiency (0.968), 73rd in scoring defense (69.3 PPGA) and 130th in opponent three-point shooting (31.9%). Conversely, Ohio State has the statistical edge, ranking 11th in opponent three-point shooting (26.7%), 46th in defensive efficiency (0.949), 69th in scoring defense (69.1 PPGA) and 85th in opponent field-goal percentage (41.8%).

I can hear you now: “Sooo…uhhh…if they’re both essentially the same team, why aren’t be backing the side receiving points AND playing at home?”

Valid question. Let me explain. 
 
Although the numbers may look gaudy, who exactly have the Buckeyes played? Offensively, the team has yet to face a defensive unit ranked in the Top 100 in defensive efficiency. Besides Notre Dame (106th)—a game in which Ohio State scored just 64 points on 19-of-50 (38%) shooting—five of the team’s other seven opponents rank 181st or worse in the category. Compare that to the Illini (69th), who have faced three Top 100 units in defensive efficiency, including in each of their last two contests—UConn (10th) and Tennessee (30th). In fact, the unit ranks 2nd in the entire country in effective possession ratio (1.043) while the Buckeyes rank just 231st in effective possession ratio (0.943). 

Defensively, it’s much of the same. 

In eight games, Ohio State has only faced two opponents who rank in the Top 140 in offensive efficiency. Those two opponents—Northwestern (59) and Notre Dame (98th)—shot 48% and 47% respectively. Meanwhile, Illinois has already faced five units that rank Top 100 in the category. Only one of those teams managed to shot over a 45% clip from the field with all but two finishing under 41%. To no surprise it all adds up to the Illini posting a strength of schedule net rating of +4.90 (71st) compared to the Buckeyes rating of -6.25 (330th) per KenPom.

That edge continues on the glass. 

Illinois rebounds as good as any other team in the country, ranking 7th in offensive rebounding (13.0 per game), 10th in total rebounding (43.1) and 19th in defensive rebounding (27.4) while ranking 38th in opponent defensive rebounding (19.6), 56th in opponent total rebounding (32.1), 242nd in opponent offensive rebounding (9.8). Conversely, Ohio State ranks 29th in defensive rebounding (26.9), 107th in total rebounding (37.3 and 297th in offensive rebounding (7.6) while ranking 6th in opponent total rebounding (29.3), 8th in opponent defensive rebounding (17.8) and 94th in opponent offensive rebounding (8.3). But the key will be whether or not the Illini can continue to flex their muscle on the offensive glass—14th in second-chance points (16.2 PPG; 96th percentile)—against a susceptible Buckeyes interior (118th in opponent second-chance points; 69th percentile). 

Illinois is riding some momentum following a stellar close out of then-No. 13 Tennessee, 75-62, on Saturday. Over the final 11 minutes of the contest, the Illini outscored the Vols 27-13 while committing 0 live ball turnovers. It was a flawless outing that showed just how talented this team can be.

Look for that to continue Tuesday night.

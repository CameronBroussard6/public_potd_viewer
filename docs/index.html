**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Chelsea TT O2.5 Goals (+100)  1 unit to win 1 unit

**Write Up:** Well I will say Ouattara had a great game for Brentford, but opted to pass/cross the ball every time he got it in a dangerous area, including one time where he had a close chance at goal he could have scored. Disappointing but I still think it was a good read and I&#x27;d play it again. 

FA Cup action is back and we&#x27;ve got one Friday match where Championship side Hull City host EPL side Chelsea in this 2nd round matchup. In the previous round, Chelsea beat Charlton (another Championship side) 5-1 away. I actually backed Chelsea for a similar play in that match. While Hull City is significantly higher up on the Championship table than Charlton was, they actually have a worst defensive record and have conceded 5 more goals than Charlton this season. 

Chelsea will likely follow their typical early cup round blueprint, they will send out almost their entire 2nd team and hope they can do the job. If at halftime they aren&#x27;t up by a few goals, they&#x27;ll bring in their big names and take control of the game. Last round they scored four 2nd half goals, as an example. With that said, don&#x27;t be shocked if they don&#x27;t score much in the first half, but having been knocked out of the Carabao Cup, they&#x27;ll take this game seriously as coach Rosenior will want silverware in his first season.

I love the value here for Chelsea to get 3 goals at even money. BOL and happy Friday!</td></tr>

Write Up: Time to start getting a streak going. <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> we’re going with Canada v Switzerland. Macklin Celebrini is a young gun who’s going to show he has what it takes to keep up with the best. Last time I picked him to score a goal in the NHL season it didn’t go right for me. That game though, he didn’t have Conor Mcdavid on his line. He scored on Thursday and played very well. He’s on a line with Connor Mcdavid (the best player in the league right now) and Tom Wilson. Mcdavid seems to be choosing to be a play maker over a goal scorer which helps this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> even more. I’d also like to add this was this teams first time playing with each other. You could see from the start to the end the progression they had playing with each other.

Don’t have a ton of facts or numbers to back this one up, more of a gut feeling play. FAA is in top form coming off a tournament win in Montpelier, where he loves playing indoor, anywhere. On the other side, Griekspoor loves playing at home and all we are asking for is 2 service holds from each to start this one. I don’t expect this one to be one sided but a pretty competitive match.

Time: 9:00 AM EST 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Parlay: Falcons ML + Yandex vs Heroic Over 3.5 Maps @ 1.88 odds (5u)

Write Up:

Team Falcons are simply the better team. In a Best-of-5, you can&#x27;t cheese your way to victory, you need a deep hero pool, strategy and superior macro. Falcons have all of &#x27;em. Liquid might steal a game or two, but Falcons will win the series.

On the other hand, Yandex is playing with Malik instead of Noticed. While Malik is good, playing with a stand-in usually causes some communication breakdowns. That makes a clean 3-0 sweep for Yandex very unlikely. Heroic just beat Tundra by playing pure chaos Dota. They are scrappy enough to take at least one map off anyone. We don&#x27;t need to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> a winner here. We just need both teams to win at least one map. Given Yandex&#x27;s firepower and Heroic&#x27;s momentum, a 3-1 or 3-2 scoreline is almost guaranteed.

Falcons win, and the other series turns into a brawl. We cash.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Borussia Dortmund Win + Over 1 corner in the 2nd Half for Borussia Dortmund - 1.95 (Bet365)

*Recap: Arsenal just had to bottle the lead. Oh well. On to the next.*

Write Up:

I&#x27;m headed for the league with clearly defined hierarchies and a status quo that doesn&#x27;t deviate often.

Dortmund are phenomenal at home having not lost a single game there (8W-2D-0L). They drew against Stuttgart and Leipzig, two very strong opponents. However, their opponent <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> is far from strong.

Mainz have managed just 2 away wins in the Bundesliga and honestly, I don&#x27;t see them even managing a draw in this game. I expect a barrage of attacks from Dortmund that&#x27;ll hopefully lead to goals and a good number of corners in each half.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Switzerland vs Canada 3:10 pm EST (Olympics/Hockey)

Under 6.5 goals (-135)

Although Canada has the better team, Switzerland (#3 in IIHF world rankings) has always been a threat on the international level. With now notable NHL players like Roman Josi, Timo Meier, Nico Hichsier, Nino Niederreiter and J.J Moser on the team, I expect Switzerland to put up a good fight and keep it under 6 goals especially after a great 4-0 performance against France yesterday. I know France isn&#x27;t Canada but Canada has always struggled against Switzerland in the Olympics so I expect them to not take their opponents lightly and not go for a super aggressive game.

In net for Switzerland will either be Leonardo Genoni who is a Swiss legend and has brought Switzerland to a 2nd place in 2024 and 2025 at the IIHF World Championships while dominating the Swiss league over the years or it will be Akira Schmid who although hasn&#x27;t had the best stats this year in the NHL has played very well with the Swiss team in 2024 with a 3-0 record .946 percentage and 0.86 goals allowed on average.

Also only one of the men&#x27;s hockey game in this year&#x27;s Olympics went over the 6 goals line!

Milan is back after a long break, unfortunately they have a lot of injuries in attack, Leao will miss the game most likely, the only other alternative is Loftus-cheek as per the last game, that&#x27;s why the odds are so juicy, but Pisa is a very weak team defensively, Inter scored 6 against them just a few weeks ago, I expect Milan midfield to step up, with Rabiot and Modric shooting and serving balls all over, Allegri struggles against defensive teams so we might see goals until the second half (I will probably sprinkle something at halftime)  Pisa has no arguments to get a draw like they did in the previous match between these 2 teams, they are one of the teams that will get relegated, Milan will at least win by 1, if we get a push I&#x27;ll take it but the odds are too good to let it pass.

___

ADM is, understandably, the heavy favorite here but I do think he&#x27;s overvalued.  Van de Zandschulp has been playing some of his best tennis lately.  In the AUS Open, despite losing in straight sets, he frustrated the hell out of Djokovic — who was playing out of his mind.  He has a remarkably high court IQ, which shows in his ability to manipulate his opponent&#x27;s position on the court and create tough angles.  ADM owns the H2H here 3-0, but their last meeting a year ago ended 6-4, 6-4, which would net us a win here.  Van de Zandschulp just surprised bettors in his massive upset of Tsitsipas, and I expect him to maintain that momentum going into these quarterfinals.  He should be able to overpower and outplay ADM in a sufficient number of points in order to keep this one close and get us back into the win column.  BOL.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>: France | Ligue 1 | 305pm Eastern | Monaco vs Nantes | Monaco to win &amp; O 1.5 goals | 3U @ -136

Monaco have historically had the edge in this matchup and are typically much stronger at home. They create more chances, score more consistently, and usually control games against mid-to-lower table sides like Nantes. From a win probability standpoint, Monaco are generally in that 55–60% range here.

As for the goals, this fixture regularly produces at least two. Over 1.5 goals hits at a high rate in their head-to-head history, and Monaco alone are often capable of covering that line. With Nantes tending to concede on the road, a 2-0 or 2-1 type result feels statistically aligned with the trends.

Overall, you’re backing the better team in a matchup that usually sees multiple goals — a logical and data-supported angle.

Their opponent, Denmark, were dominated by Canada in their opener and managed to squeak out an extra end win over Japan, despite being outplayed. Sweden looked very strong day one but Denmark looked like the weakest team in the field.

Write-up: Back with Dota 2 Blast slam VI playoffs, very excited because this is a **Best of 5 (Bo5)** match and value parlay. For the &quot;Over 3.5&quot; to hit, we simply need the underdog in each match to win at least **one map**.

Since it&#x27;s Bo5, I don&#x27;t like to bet on maps over/under without seeing the draft live. However both of these matches are closer than the odds suggest. Team liquid won against Falcons in their group stage match a couple of days ago. Heroic as well; they took a map off of Yandex in a 28-minute stomp game. Both of the underdogs won their matches in the group stage. Falcons have also been very shaky and inconsistent after their TI win; I can totally see Liquid putting up a good fight. at the same time Heroic has been the biggest trap team in Dota; they always somehow turn up in Bo3-Bo5 playoffs and play great. We just need both matches to not finish 3-0. BOL!</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>:
League of Ireland Premier Division.

Derry City vs Dundalk

Derry City win and over 1.5 goals

(1.95) 3 units

The Candystripes host their 2nd game of the season, after a strong performance that even got the better of Sligo Rovers.

Derry City have a ridiculous financial advantage over the rest of the teams in the league of Ireland who outside Shamrock Rovers general struggle to generate any revenue.

Derry is owned by a self made Billionaire, who has bailed them a few years back and invested not a crazy amount but they did have a solid transfer window bringing in local legend James McClean and the impressive James Clark in midfield from Bohemians.

They finished last season very strong, if it wasn&#x27;t for a poor start to the season they would have challenged Shamrock Rovers for the title, with the squad they have assembled they could very win the league this season.

Dundalk managed to get promoted back to the top division, but they have had financial issues the past few years which is why they got relegated last season, they have not managed to sign anyone that  stands out on paper, and they would do well to not finish bottom imo.

The weather in Dundalk has been absolutely brutal the last couple of weeks, they had their first match with Shamrock Rovers postponed due to a waterlogged pitch

Derry have 2 competitive match under their belt, looking strong from the small sample so far. Dundalk haven&#x27;t played since their friendly loss to Shelburne 23 days ago, they will lack that sharpness and the very heavy rainfall has left training facilities in poor condition also.

Between the clear gulf in class, Dundalk&#x27;s obvious lack of preparation and match fitness and the ridiculous financial gap between these sides, I see this being a one sided match. I would be very surprised if Derry didn&#x27;t manage at least 2 goals and they should manage a comfortable win at home to make it 2 wins from 2 in the league to add to the win against rovers before that in the Super Cup.

**CET 20:00 Football Eredivisie**

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>: Volendam vs PSV. **First half result 0-3** at **12** odds

Explanation: Not alot to explain, other than PSV being on a completely different level compared to their opponents and leading big on H2H record. I do believe that they will end this game in the first half by going all out, and not do the same mistake as last time. They were losing 1-0 vs Gronningen in their last game and then managed to win it in the second half. The scenario here is that they will be focused to the max and dominate in possession, chances created and xG. They will have at least 2-0 here in the first half. But I do suspect a 3-0 score more. Let´s get this one in!

On the side note: My tactics won’t change by lowering the odds. The goal is to find high odds to play here. I’m trying to keep track of the results in all of the top leagues.

GKS KATOWICE VS LEGIA

Date: 13 FEBRUARY 2026 at 20:30

BET ON: Match odds- LEGIA

Odd: 2.23



\- Backing Legia Warsaw to win against GKS Katowice is strongly supported when combining injuries, motivation, and tactical signals from recent Polish media coverage. Coach Marek Papszun has made it clear in press conferences that excuses are over — despite absences like Rafał Augustyniak, Jean-Pierre Nsame and Rúben Vinagre, he has emphasized visible structural progress, improved defensive organization, and intensive work on set pieces and compactness within the 3-4-2-1 system. Legia’s recent performance in Gdynia showed better spacing between lines and greater midfield control, suggesting the breakthrough is close. Crucially, the motivational edge lies with the Warsaw side: the pressure to collect points has created a “reaction game” mentality, with players publicly speaking about responsibility and restoring standards. Meanwhile, GKS Katowice are also weakened (Jirka, Paluszek, Rejczyk absent), limiting their pace in transition and defensive stability, and their recent messaging has been more cautious than assertive. With Legia tactically tightening up, drilling defensive discipline, holding historical superiority in head-to-head meetings, and entering this fixture with heightened urgency, the value clearly leans toward a Legia victory.

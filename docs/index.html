Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> : Football - UCL - Totenham Vs Copenhagen - Under 8.5 Shot On Target - Odds : 1.81 ( 4 Unit ) - Time 20:00 ❌

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> : Football - Serie A - Pisa Vs Cremonese - Under 8.5 Shot on Target - Odds : 1.61 ( 2 Unit ) - 19.45 UK Time

Both Pisa and Cremonese are fairly average Serie B sides that tend to cancel each other out. Neither team creates a high number of clear chances, and their games are often cautious and tight. Betting on draw in this game might be good but to damn risky. Low odds so going for 2 unit only.</td></tr>

Season Record: 7-5 | Profit: +6.44u | ROI: 15.3%

 

Last Pick: Jamal Murray (Nuggets) O30.5 PRA @ 1.89. 3U. ❌

Murray has been an excellent shooter all season but went just 1/8 on 3s, many of which were good looks. He still ended with 25 PRAs, so I don’t think it was a terrible read, just a bad shooting night.

 

Next <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **Kristaps Porzingis (Hawks) O6.5 Rebs @ 1.84**. 4U play.

Returning to a Porzingis prop for the 3^(rd) time this season because I still believe the Hawks are being careful with his minutes (&lt;27 in each game) and he’s had poor shooting to start the season. Despite that he has put up decent numbers. With Trae out, and him adjusting to life as a Hawk, I expect him to take on more offensive responsibility and play bigger minutes. The Raptors will have Poeltl and Barnes so Porzingis will need to be more aggressive on the defensive glass, similar to the Cleveland game. Also, with Poeltl who operates entirely in the paint, he’ll be near the basket more than usual. He’s over this line in 4/L5 games against the Raptors. This is expected to be a close game, so with big minutes and a 3 day break, I will back Porzingis to cover this line.</td></tr>

WATFORD VS BRISTOL CITY

Date: 07 NOVEMBER 2025 at 21:00

BET ON: Match odds- WATFORD

Odd: 2.16



\- Watford look well placed to win against Bristol City, with Javi Gracia’s return restoring structure and belief. The Hornets’ recent home form — including wins over West Brom (2–1) and Middlesbrough (3–0) — highlights their growing attacking cohesion and defensive solidity. Bristol City, on the other hand, arrive depleted, missing around ten players including both first-choice wing-backs Neto Borges and Mark Sykes. The visitors’ morale is low after consecutive defeats and a heavy 5–1 loss to Stoke. With Watford motivated to push into the top eight and tactically sharper under Gracia, they look primed to capitalise on City’s injury crisis and fragile confidence.</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>Record: 221-207 Net Units: -21.89 46-50 on 1.5u plays, 36-38 on 2u plays, 1-2 on 3u plays. All picks 1 unit, unless stated otherwise.


Last event: Soccer/Football, [Conference League] Samsunspor vs Hamrun
Last pick: Asian total corners over 9.0 @ 1.85 - 1.5 u lost


Event: Soccer/Football, [Denmark Superliga] Odense vs Silkeborg


<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: BTTS + Over 2.5 goals @ 1.83 - 2 Units


A great meeting for goals as both teams top the table in total goals per game. Odense have managed to cover this line so far in 11/14 games, at home in 6/7. Silkeborg have covered in 8/14, and in 5/5 away games. The two sides already met earlier in a 2-1 win for Silkeborg, they also met earlier this year in a 2-2 draw. Both sides have no struggle to score either as they&#x27;ve scored on all kinds of teams, even on the strongest ones in the league.</td></tr>

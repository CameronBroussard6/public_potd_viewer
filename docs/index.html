Last Pick: Bayern Win or Draw✅

Event : Uefa Champions League ⚽

Club Brugge vs Barcelona

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> : Barcelona to Win + Total Over 2.5 Goals @1.78 for 3u

Barcelona are coming off a big 3-1 win over Elche in La Liga and just thrashed Olympiacos 6-1 in their last Champions League outing, showing their attack is firing and their confidence is high. In their last ten games, every Barcelona match has ended with more than 2.5 goals and their team scores an average of 2.4 goals per game while conceding 1.4, so goals are almost always guaranteed when they play. Brugge can be dangerous at home and are on a three-game winning streak domestically, but they were soundly beaten 4-0 by Bayern Munich and are not at Barcelona’s level in terms of defense or quality. Barcelona have never lost to Brugge in European competition (three wins and one draw in four meetings), and even with few players missing out, they still have lots of attacking options, Lamine Yamal and Marcus Rashford are in great form, and Hansi Flick’s tactics mean they create plenty of chances every match. Also all the UCL matches of both Barca and Brugge this season had over 2.5 goals.

CHELSEA VS QARABAG

Date: 05 NOVEMBER 2025 at 18:45

BET ON: Over / Under Corners- Over +8.50

Odd: 1.68



\- Both sides bring tactical setups that strongly favour a high number of corners. Qarabağ line up in a compact 4-2-3-1, sitting deep and soaking up pressure before launching wide counterattacks and targeting set-piece situations. This approach invites Chelsea’s full-backs to push high and overlap, leading to repeated sequences of blocked crosses and deflected shots that naturally produce corners. Chelsea, under their current setup, operate in a flexible 4-2-3-1 or 4-3-3, focusing on wide build-up play through aggressive wing-backs and inverted forwards. Their dominance in possession and emphasis on stretching the pitch often pins opponents deep, generating sustained pressure and multiple corner situations. Meanwhile, Qarabağ’s counterattacking transitions and reliance on crosses from advanced wide areas also create chances to win corners of their own. With both teams committed to attacking down the flanks and forcing play into the final third, this match profiles as one with strong corner potential — making Over +8.50 corners a convincing and value-driven bet.</td></tr>

Shanghai Shenhua are the biggest corner generating team in China. They&#x27;ve been averaging 8 corners for, above 12 total so far, with overwhelming majority of their games going over 9.5. They now meet Johor, who dominate their domestic league completely, however they still generate a lot of corners, despite scoring huge - they&#x27;ve averaged above 10 corners for themselves and above 12 total per game. In the AFC CL, in 3 games played, Johor have covered in all 3, with 11 total vs Chengdu (another Chinese team), 15 vs Machida and 12 vs Buriram. Shanghai have done similar with 2/3 AFC CL games covering, failing only against Gangwon who are not a good corner matchup at all (with a 8.70 total average in South Korea).</td></tr>

Last Pick: Coventry City U6.5 corners vs Sheffield United ✅

Event: Championship ⚽️

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Sheffield Wednesday most corners vs Norwich City (or -0.5 corner handicap) 4U @ 2.00 (Bet365)

Write-up: Very sweaty <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> but a good match between two sides on opposite sides of the table, the leaders Coventry consolidating their spot at the top of the league. Sheffield United took the lead early which really wasn’t ideal as Coventry were already on 2 corners and would step up their pressure to salvage a result. Despite throwing attacking as well as they have all season, the Baldes weren’t backing down and the corner count surprisingly ended 6-3 to Sheffield at the half. Piling even more pressure and two goals not long after the break, the Sky Blues wouldn’t step their foot off the gas and we had to hold on for 10 minutes for no more corners as the count was at 6. Thankfully the seventh never came and Coventry ended up scoring a third deep in stoppage time.

Moving from one Sheffield to the other, Wednesday aren’t faring much better than their rivals as they’re on… -5 points. One of the oldest clubs in the world, the situation is quite sad as they’ve entered administration for failing to pay wages. I have to commend the Owls as in spite of the obvious off-field issues and whole bunch of injuries woes the players have shown a lot of heart in their performances. Though they haven’t won since September they haven’t necessarily been playing terrible football - keeping games close in spite of all the issues and Hillsborough remains a tough ground to visit. The players seem fired up for a result and there’s finally some optimism as offers are close to being made to buy the club - a huge attendance is expected tomorrow to make good impression on potential new owners. What better way to bounce back than facing Norwich, who have had none of the issues yet all of the troubles just sitting a spot above Wednesday. That’s now no wins since August and for a team that usually yo-yo’s between the Prem and Championship they could very well end up being in League One next year for the first time since 2009.

Anyways enough of the context, the Owls have averaged 5.9 corners for and 4.6 corners against in their last 20 home matches. The canaries have been averaging 3.7 for and 6.1 conceded in the same period on the road. Even using recent stats is flattering to Wednesday’s corners (both for and against) despite the financial troubles so no concerns on that end. I get an expected 6.3 corners for Sheffield and 3.8 for Norwich using all factors. Just a note though that in this fixture last season Norwich had more corners though was a year ago (exactly) so I’m not necessarily worried. That gives this play an estimated 75% chance of winning. BOL, let’s get to 50 wins !

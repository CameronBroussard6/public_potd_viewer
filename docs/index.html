**Anthony Black OVER 7.5 AST+REB (-127 DK) 4 Units**

￼Write Up: Black has been on fire lately. In his past 5 games he’s put up 15, 14, 12, 12, and 8 P+A. This includes 14 against Miami on Friday. 

He’s also been scoring a lot lately, and now with the absence of Franz Wagner, Orlando will be sure to keep his minutes above 30 even with the recent return of Banchero. 

I see this line possibly changing to 8.5 soon so lock it in while you can!

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: __Tyler Herro O21.5 P @1.86 1U (Bet365)__

NBA | Heat vs Magic | 🏀  

Bittersweet win as he doesn’t cash the bump or the alt but ends on exactly 9 RA. 13 potential assists for him where he only manages to get 4 but gets the work done due to the rebounds, horrible shooting night from the Cavs. We move

Cup game. #1 options have absolutely torched the Magic this season mainly due to their 1 on 1 coverage in defense where they don’t send help and focuses on playing man to man defense. As a result they’re ranked bottom in the league in ISO points allowed where Herro gets 20% of his points from, has taken 42% of his shots from the paint so far where Magic are ranked 27th.

We’ve seen Brunson drop 30, 33 &amp; 31, Fox 30, Cunningham 39, Harden 31 &amp; Curry 34 etc..

Magic does a good job of limiting assists but the scoring upside will always be there for the high usage guys due to their scheme.

Herro is over this line in 4/5 games this season avg 23.8 PPG and dropped 30 points in his latest meeting against the Magic last season where he had 28 FGA.

15+ FGA in all games this season, with 15+ FGA over in 16/L20 games dating back to last year.

Good matchup for Herro to get buckets, as long as we get the volume needed im fairly confident he’ll get it done. Currently probable which is a good indicator he’ll play.</td></tr>

Bayern in their domestic league have covered this line regularly, especially at home they&#x27;ve hit this in 6/6 home games and in 10/12 league games total.

**NBA | Heat @ Magic (NBA Cup East Quarterfinal)**

For tomorrow&#x27;s slate, we have Heat vs Magic. This is an important match, so we can expect the key players to get more minutes and usage. Heat&#x27;s offense runs via Bam in a leverage situation. We can expect him to have \~35+ minutes and high usage.   
In his games this season, where he had 30+ minutes, he has hit this line 7/10 times, i.e, 70% hit rate. Now, factor in the importance of the match and his usage, and I would expect the hit rate to be above 75%.  
In his last matchup against Magic, he went 39 PR with 40 minutes of playtime. He also went 27 PR with 34 minutes in October this season, but those were comparatively in less leverage situations with the rotation testing phase. So, I am inclined to look more into recent data.

Tuesday’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> - Boston Bruins ML +134 vs St Louis Blues

I’m a blues fan. This line doesn’t make sense. The Blues lost 5-2 to the Bruins last week on Thursday. The blues won 2 games in a row on Saturday and Sunday, making tomorrow their 3rd game in 4 days. The Bruins on the other hand are pretty well rested, as their last game was Saturday where they beat the Devils.

As far as goaltending is concerned, neither Binnington or Hofer have played particularly well this year. Swayman on the other hand has had a good year and had the day off on Saturday, so he hasn’t played since Thursday when they beat this St Louis team.

The Blues are 5-6-4 at home this year. They have a -27 goal differential, which is the worst in the Western Conference. The Bruins are a respectable 6-8-0 with a +2 goal differential on the season.

Simply put, the Bruins are the better team, and they are plus money.


Good luck!</td></tr>

**Writeup:**

* FORZE Reload was on a crazy run of good form recently and we took them around 10 days ago as a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> when they were running hot, their recent spell of great form has seemingly dried up after their 9 win streak.. In the last week they are 2-5 in matches overall with a map score of 6-12 while losing to VP prodigy, and struggling against NEXUS who are both well below their skill level
* Fire Flux have really started to put the pieces together with their new roster and have been finding much more consistency, in the last two weeks they are 6-1 in matches overall with a map score of 13-4 overall in those matches, their only loss was a close loss to Nuclear TigeRES who have been in great form. They have won each of their last 7 map picks in the last 2 weeks 7/7 cover rate
* These teams did face off previously h2h and FORZE Reload beat them 2-0 in a relatively close game, most important to me is FORZE Reload were using their previous roster as it was2 months ago, and it was when Fire Flux was still early on and adjusting to their roster. Despite losing 19-17 and 13-7, they lost 3/4 pistol rounds and had a really awful start on Dust 2
* FORZE Reload are the higher seeded team and they will have side choice in this match, similar to last time these teams faced off in October, FORZE also had side selection and chose to veto second, as do 95% of teams, see no reason why this changes meaning Fire Flux map <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> should be first

**Projected Veto:**

* Fire Flux ban Nuke, FORZE Reload ban Inferno
* Fire Flux <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> Dust 2 (chance of Mirage)

**Dust 2 Stats:**

* Fire Flux are 65% winrate on 23 maps of Dust 2 in the L3 months, they are 4-2 in the last month
* FORZE Reload are 45% winrate on 31 maps of Dust 2 in the L3 months, they are 6-7 in the last month,
* FORZE Reload are on a 4 map loss streak on Dust 2, Fire Flux 2W streak
* FORZE Reload have been struggling on Dust 2 despite winning over 53% of pistol rounds, they are negative winrate on CT side averaging only 45.6% of rounds
* Fire Flux have been even more dominant on Dust 2 then the stats show, they are winning only 39% of pistol rounds which subsequently often lead to 2 rounds of pistol buys which are very easy to win, despite this they are 51.8% winrate on CT Side and 59.1% winrate T side</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** **Bassols vs Leonard - Leonard ML @ 2.19**

Here we have a matchup where I think the underdog has a great chance of winning this match. 

Bassols is more experienced in the WTA and her playstyle is focused around resilience and baseline tolerance. She played last week in Angers and was knocked out by Zhang, where she was able to contest the match but struggled against the aggressive playstyle of the Chinese player, who was not at her best after a previous long week but still won in straight sets. 

Leonard has less experience at the pro level but is having a great year, now already ranked 50 places higher than Bassols. She plays well in hard courts and had a phenomenal month of October, winning two ITFs in a row, even against decent opposition like Dodin. With this, she&#x27;s on a 10 match winning streak. The French player likes to take the ball early which on an indoor surface, should be a good tactic against Bassols who often relies on prolonging points with heavy spin and a classical Spanish approach to the game. 

Last year in this specific tournament, Leonard reached the quarterfinals of this specific tournament and she seems to perform well in front of her home crowd. Due to this, I really like her odds to win this match.

Good luck!</td></tr>

__Event:__ NCAAB: Illinois @ Ohio State 7:30pm EST

__POTD:__ Illinois -3.5 (-110), 3.3u to win 3u

__Write Up:__ Illinois (7-2, 0-0 Big Ten) is headed to Columbus, Ohio to take on the (7-1, 1-0 Big Ten) Ohio State Buckeyes on Tuesday night in a huge Big Ten rivalry matchup. Ohio St opened its conference schedule with an 86-82 win at Northwestern on Saturday. Was a much needed win after they had lost their previous game on Black Friday against a bad Pittsburgh team who has now lost their last 4 games vs teams outside of Ohio State. Despite their 7-1 record, Ohio State has only played 3 teams ranked inside the top 242 ranked teams. They beat #62 Notre Dame 64-63, lost to #109 Pittsburgh 66-67, &amp; recently beat #59 Northwestern 86-82. Their only 2 wins they had vs decent teams, of which have a combined 12-8 record, they barely squeaked by. Now they face an elite Illinois team that is coming off biggest win thus far this season. Illinois is coming off a huge win as underdogs vs #13 Tennessee, a team that has made back to back Elite 8’s the last 2 seasons. Illinois waxed them 75-62. Tennessee has a great squad this year too, having handed #8 Houston their only loss this season &amp; with KenPom having their defense ranked #12 in the nation. That didn’t stop 4 Illinois starters from scoring in double digits. Illinois’s biggest issue has been health. Now with a team almost fully healthy, they look like one of the best teams in the country. 

Illinois finally has almost all their guys back, but the biggest one is Tomislav Ivisic. Illinois rebuilt their front court around the returning 7’2 Croation big man this offseason, including bringing in his 7’2 twin brother Zvonimir from Arkansas in the transfer portal. Tomislav injured his knee earlier this season &amp; is finally back to full health, &amp; it showed vs Tennessee. He had 16 points on 7/13 shooting (including 2 threes) &amp; a team best +17 plus-minus. The Illinois front court dominates the paint &amp; gets all the rebounds, as they always have done under head coach Brady Underwood. In 2023 Illinois ranked 5th in rebounds in the NCAA (40.9). Last year Illinois ranked #1 in the nation in rebounds (42.6). __Illinois is top 10 in nation in rebounding this season averaging 43.1 per game. That’s bad news for an Ohio State team that ranks just 107th, averaging 37.3 rebounds per game. OSU was out rebounded by Northwestern 29-34 (ranks 245th in Reb’s), Pittsburgh 38-39 (151st in Reb’s), &amp; Notre Dame 28-36 (117th in Reb’s).__ Ohio State has a big man themselves, Santa Clara transfer, 7’0 big man Christopher Tilly. But he is a horrible rebounder. He is averaging just 5.0 rebounds per game this season, his career high. Ohio State doesn’t have a single guy averaging more than 5 rebounds per game. Illinois is going to absolutely demolish them on the boards. But neither of the Ivisic brothers are even the leading rebounder on this team. That would be 6’9 250 pound Freshman David Mirkovic from Montenegro who is averaging nearly a double double this season, with 13.8 points &amp; 9.6 rebounds. He became the 8th Big Ten player in the last 8 seasons to have a 20-20 game earlier this season. He rounds out Illinois’s dominant front court. Not only are they big, but they are versatile. While will be key vs an Ohio State offense that loves to get in the paint. Ohio St coach Jake Diebler runs a pace &amp; space offense that is guard driven focusing on screens, dribble handoffs, &amp; getting to the basket. This has resulted in Ohio St leading the nation in 2pt FG% at 65.5%, including 49.1% from mid range (although against horrible opponents). This is how Ohio St wins games. __But that’s an issue vs a long lengthy athletic Illinois team who excels on defense at shutting down 2 point shots, ranking 12th (41%) in the NCAA in opponent 2pt FG % in their last 3 games that include #5 UConn &amp; #13 Tennessee, who they held to 35% from 2.__ On the other side of the court down low, Illinois has been electric in the post as well. __Illinois shoots 60.3% from 2 pointers, 22nd in the NCAA. Ohio St ranks just 181st in opponents 2 point percentage allowed (51.7%).__ This is where the biggest separation is between the 2 teams. Ohio State’s defense is not good. They have one of the worst post defenses in the NCAA. __OSU has just a 4.7% block rate, 348th in the nation per KenPom. To put it in perspective, Illinois averages a 13.7% defensive block rate. Facing an Illinois offense that ranks in the 10 in the nation in rim attack averaging 1.06 PPP that’s a recipe for disaster.__ Ohio St’s offense is led by one of the best players in the country though, Bruce Thornton, who I got to watch play in high school down the road from my house. He is talented guard averaging 20.1 points per game this season, with 5.1 rebounds &amp; 4.3 assists. He’ll be matched up with Illinois’ Kylan Boswell. These 2 are both dawgs &amp; it’s going to be one hell of a back &amp; forth. Not only has Boswell been good on the defensive end, but he also has been elite on offense. Boswell leads the team with 17 ppg &amp; 3.8 apg. He also controls the ball well. After having a turnover rate at 18+% his first 3 years, he has vastly improved this season with a TO% just below 11%. Illinois has been efficient as a whole controlling the ball, as evident last game vs Tennessee where they finished with just 6 TO’s, having 0 TO’s over the final 12 minutes of the game. __Illinois ranks 14th in the nation in offensive turnovers at just 11.7%. Ohio St won’t be getting very many steals as they rank 211th in the NCAA in defensive takeaways. Their offense turns it over a lot too, turning it over at the nations 154th highest rate (14.6%).__ To round out the Illinois offense they have an elite shooter in NBA Legend Peja Stojaković’s son, Andrej who is a 6’7 wing that can snipe from 3 just like his dad. Keep an eye on Keaton Wagler, too. I think Illinois can expose a big mismatch in size, as Wagler has played both the No. 1 &amp; No. 2 guard spots this season while standing at 6’6. Ohio State’s biggest guard is 6’2. That is something Illinois can expose as they’re filled with wings all above 6’6. Illinois has so many weapons on offense &amp; defense this Ohio St team will struggle to keep up. 

Illinois is simply the much more talented team. Even on the road at Ohio State’s home court I think they have the capability of running away with this one. Give me the team that’s bigger &amp; better on defense, rebounding, &amp; in the paint.

__Illinois -3.5__

<tr><td class='post'>**Record:** 31-16-1 (+13.43u) 

**Last:** (CBB) Arizona -7.5 (1u) - W

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** (CBB) No. 13 Illinois (-3.5) at Ohio State

**Start Time:** 7:30 PM ET (Peacock)

**Odds:** -108 (DraftKings)

**Units:** 1U

**Reasoning:** Pot meet kettle. Illinois meet… Ohio State?

At least that’s what the stats might lead you to believe. 

Through nine games, the Illini (7-2) have proved to be among the nation’s best offensively, ranking 9th in offensive efficiency (1.238), 20th in scoring (88.7 PPG), 54th in field-goal percentage (48.1%) and 182nd in three-point shooting (33.2%). Not to be outdone, the Buckeyes (7-1) bring in a high-flying offense of their own, ranking 3rd in field-goal percentage (53.0%), 16th in offensive efficiency (1.213), 27th in scoring (88.4 PPG) and 59th in three-point shooting (36.9%). If that’s not the statistical translation of “hold my beer,” it’s pretty damn close. 

But the mirror images don’t slow down on the defensive end of the floor.

Thus far, Illinois has been a formidable out for opposing offenses, ranking 40th in opponent field-goal percentage (39.9%), 69th in defensive efficiency (0.968), 73rd in scoring defense (69.3 PPGA) and 130th in opponent three-point shooting (31.9%). Conversely, Ohio State has the statistical edge, ranking 11th in opponent three-point shooting (26.7%), 46th in defensive efficiency (0.949), 69th in scoring defense (69.1 PPGA) and 85th in opponent field-goal percentage (41.8%).

I can hear you now: “Sooo…uhhh…if they’re both essentially the same team, why aren’t be backing the side receiving points AND playing at home?”

Valid question. Let me explain. 
 
Although the numbers may look gaudy, who exactly have the Buckeyes played? Offensively, the team has yet to face a defensive unit ranked in the Top 100 in defensive efficiency. Besides Notre Dame (106th)—a game in which Ohio State scored just 64 points on 19-of-50 (38%) shooting—five of the team’s other seven opponents rank 181st or worse in the category. Compare that to the Illini (69th), who have faced three Top 100 units in defensive efficiency, including in each of their last two contests—UConn (10th) and Tennessee (30th). In fact, the unit ranks 2nd in the entire country in effective possession ratio (1.043) while the Buckeyes rank just 231st in effective possession ratio (0.943). 

Defensively, it’s much of the same. 

In eight games, Ohio State has only faced two opponents who rank in the Top 140 in offensive efficiency. Those two opponents—Northwestern (59) and Notre Dame (98th)—shot 48% and 47% respectively. Meanwhile, Illinois has already faced five units that rank Top 100 in the category. Only one of those teams managed to shot over a 45% clip from the field with all but two finishing under 41%. To no surprise it all adds up to the Illini posting a strength of schedule net rating of +4.90 (71st) compared to the Buckeyes rating of -6.25 (330th) per KenPom.

That edge continues on the glass. 

Illinois rebounds as good as any other team in the country, ranking 7th in offensive rebounding (13.0 per game), 10th in total rebounding (43.1) and 19th in defensive rebounding (27.4) while ranking 38th in opponent defensive rebounding (19.6), 56th in opponent total rebounding (32.1), 242nd in opponent offensive rebounding (9.8). Conversely, Ohio State ranks 29th in defensive rebounding (26.9), 107th in total rebounding (37.3 and 297th in offensive rebounding (7.6) while ranking 6th in opponent total rebounding (29.3), 8th in opponent defensive rebounding (17.8) and 94th in opponent offensive rebounding (8.3). But the key will be whether or not the Illini can continue to flex their muscle on the offensive glass—14th in second-chance points (16.2 PPG; 96th percentile)—against a susceptible Buckeyes interior (118th in opponent second-chance points; 69th percentile). 

Illinois is riding some momentum following a stellar close out of then-No. 13 Tennessee, 75-62, on Saturday. Over the final 11 minutes of the contest, the Illini outscored the Vols 27-13 while committing 0 live ball turnovers. It was a flawless outing that showed just how talented this team can be.

Look for that to continue Tuesday night.

History: Took a 6-month break from sports betting. But we back boys 😎

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: Moussa Diabate, Game Leaders: Most Rebounds (-134)

12/25/2026 4:00pm PST / NBA / Charlotte Hornets @ Orlando Magic 

Narrative: CHA starting rookie center, Kalkbrenner has only missed 4 games this season. In those four games, Diabate garnered 11, 11, 14, and 16 rebounds respectively. In the first 3 of those 4 games, Charlotte’s other big man, Plumlee played 10, 22, and 10 minutes, and got injured following the third game, leaving Diabate as the only serviceable Center on the roster, in which in on Dec 23 he grabbed 16 boards and logged 36 minutes in this scenario. Diabate hasn’t gotten extensive run this season as CHA has been running with rookie Kalkbrenner and as noted he hasn’t missed much time. Despite averaging about 20min a night, Diabate has grabbed 10+ rebounds in 10 of 29 games this season. You get my rational here. I could go on, but with starter minutes, and no back up center, Diabate should clear 15+ boards with ease and probably double the next highest rebound count in the game, making this a max play for me. GG!</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: Miami Heat +4 (-118) &lt;- Risk 1u 

Taken on Betrivers. It doesn&#x27;t look that great for the Hawks here or the Heat, both have lost four out of their last 5 but I think the Heat come out of the break as the more disciplined team. Since 2023, the Hawks are 4-13 ATS and 5-12 SU when they have 2 or more days of rest and their opponent is also on 2 or more days of rest. As a fav they are 1-5 in this spot. Since 2023, the heat are 9-5 ATS hwen they have 2 or more days of rest and their opponent is on the same amount of rest, and are 6-2 as a dog in this spot. Bam could sit out for this game as they play the Pacers tomorrow, I hope my math is okay but I value Bam in this spot at 0.65 points on the spread, which is great to scoop up the +4 here. I actually have the Heat winning this game outright by 1 point, so this line should be <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>&#x27;em. At the end of the day the Hawks are 0-7 this season at home as a fav, so let&#x27;s hope they don&#x27;t get their first cover as a home fav tonight.

Yesterday’s Pick: (NFL) Dallas Cowboys -6.5 alternate spread vs Washington Commanders (-180) ✅

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: (NBA) Toronto Raptors vs Washington Wizards under 232.5 alternate total (-198) (7:10 PM EST)**

Reasoning: We have strong trends, strong line movement, injuries and stats favoring the under in this game tonight. In the last 10 meetings between these two teams, the under in 7-3. We are seeing reverse line movement as well. The line opened at 234.5 ➡️ 225 currently despite heavy public bet percentage on the over 👀RJ Barrett is out and the Raptors best player, Scottie Barnes is listed as questionable with an illness. The line was already trending downwards on the under before Barnes was listed as questionable early this morning. Toronto is ranking 18th in offensive efficiency and if Barnes doesn’t go, it should impact an already below average offense. The Wizards are bottom of the league, ranking 27th in offensive efficiency🤮As for defense, Toronto are 4th in defensive efficiency which should cause problems for a weak Wizards team. The Wizards are last in defensive efficiency but again, with a below average Raptors offense that’s dealing with injuries should help  the Wizards defensively in this game. Some other trends, Toronto are on a 6 game under streak and Washington have gone under in 4 of their past 5 games. With that being said, let’s expect this game to stay below 233 total points. BOL to those tailing 👊

<tr><td class='post'>**POTD Record:**  101 – 65 - 10

**Previous:**  Senegal vs Botswana Both Teams to Score NO &amp; Over 1.5 goals – WINNING!

**New Event:**  EPL – Manchester United vs Newcastle

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:**  Newcastle Draw-no-bet @ 1.93 (Usual 3 units)

Boxing Day brings us a single EPL match on the slate for the first time ever and which team better to play <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> than the one that has won more Boxing Day matches in history, Manchester United (MU).  I suspect MU may not feel so fortunate to have to play <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> as their recent matches have not shown much promise and their squad is relatively depleted due to AFCON tournament commitments as well as injuries, most notably a hamstring injury for Captain Bruno Fernandes. 

On the opposing side of this fixture, visitors Newcastle have also shown some signs of inconsistency with their results.  They sit just 3 points and 4 places below MU on the EPL table and a win <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> would signal a major step towards a top 10 finish this season.  Newcastle is not without its share of absentees either, but their attacking core remains strong and that should make the difference here.

Fun facts:

* Since 2022 MU has played 7 matches without Bruno and have lost 6 of them with 1 draw.
* MU have lost their last 3 home matches in the EPL
* MU have conceded at least a goal in their last 10 EPL matches
* Newcastle have also conceded in their last 10 EPL matches
* Newcastle have the 3^(rd) lowest number of goals scored on the road with 10.
* Not only is playmaker Bruno Fernandes out for this game, but his natural replacement Mainoo is also out, leading to probably Sasko who does not inspire much confidence at the moment.
* Yellow card magnet, Casemiro will most likely be at center mid, but he can hardly keep up for a full 90 minutes.

Bottom line is we are looking at a MU side missing key players across the board mainly in attack and midfield, while the visitors are missing key defenders.  This should favor Newcastle from a possession standpoint as their mid and forwards are mainly intact.  Yes, Newcastle are vulnerable at the back, but if they maintain control of the game they will have more chances to score and not lose.</td></tr>

Model&#x27;s top 2 picks of the day. Trae Young has been getting many assists since his return from injury, with 10 9 and 15. Both teams play fast and we have a high total with low blowout risk. Trae should continue his recent form in this game. Deni has become the PG for POR after Jrue went down. Over this in 5 of L6. In what should be a tight game against LAC, Deni should continue form. LAC is missing Zubac, which can provide more opportunities for assists to players in the paint.

NBA | Hawks v Heat | 🏀  

Anthony kept his word and came thru for 30, and even 40 as he ends with 44 points in OT. Cheers Ant!

Trae Young gets a top tier matchup against the Heat and has looked really good since returning dropping 15, 9 &amp; 10 assists. Well known about the pace Heat plays with by now and his minutes are ramping up having 31 minutes most recently. With those minutes last game he had 15 assists and a whopping 25 potentials meaning we’d need less than half of those potentials to get converted to cash.

Fast pace &amp; more possessions should lead to more potentials for Trae here and with the upside of seeing more minutes this game. Davion will guard Trae tight so definitely seeing Trae keep dishing in this one.

Trae has had a DD in 5/L6 against the Heat so definitely a matchup he’s done great against previously aswell. Heat is top 5 in assists allowed to PG’s this season.

Love this game for Trae, would just run 10+ assists if the odds aren’t better on him to get a DD in your book.</td></tr>

**Odds:** 2.3 | +130 | 2units to win 2.6

**Write up**: Bet1 - we just watched denmark get absolutely dismantled by canada. 13:2. Their goalies looked like they were trying to catch smoke with their bare hands. They gave up 50 shots. Now they have to turn around a couple of days later and face fins. This is a finland team that just lost to USA. their power play was embarrassed (0-for-5), and they have a point to prove. They aren&#x27;t going to take it easy. They need to get their mojo back before the real games start. And then we look atthe net. Finland has Rimpinen, literally the best goalie in the tourney. I think Fin is getting a shutout. Fins are going up against a defense that just gave up 13. Emil Hemming and the boys are going to treat this like a shooting gallery. The Danes are tired, their confidence is shattered, and their goalie can&#x27;t stop a beach ball right now.

  
Bet2 - The USA just absolutely dismantled this same german team 8:0 in the pre tournament literally five days ago. We aren&#x27;t just looking at one lucky game either. the trend here is massive blowouts. In last years opener, the USA hung a 10 goaler on them (10:4), and the year before that it was 11:1. The americans essentially treat this matchup like a track meet to pad their stats before the medal round, and with the game being played on NHL sized ice in minny, the usa speed advantage is going to be even more lethal against germans slower defense. sure the germans is starting their better goalie (Vieillard) this time, but he&#x27;s going to face 40+ shots. Getting the line at -4.5 gives you a nice cushion just in case germany sneaks in a garbage goal or two, but all the data points to the usa winning this by at least 6 or 7.

Game: Newcastle United @ Manchester United 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Newcastle United Tie No Bet (-108)

Units: 3.0

Explanation: Disclaimer, I’m a Manchester United, and I don’t feel confident heading into this game. United is missing key players to AFCON (Amad, Mazraoui, Mbeumo) and injury (Fernandes, De Ligt, Macguire), making the line up especially vulnerable to goals. The back line didn’t have a great game vs. Villa last weekend, and Dalot and Ugarte (both of which will likely start this afternoon) struggled as well. Their attacking options will be further constrained by the loss of Fernandes and the use of Sesko, who has arguably been out of form so far this season. 

Newcastle is also missing some pieces — especially in defense — to injury (Burn, Lascelles, Trippier, Botman, Livramento), but put a decent performance together last weekend home vs. Chelsea. I expect Manchester United to struggle with Newcastle’s currently stronger midfield and attack. 

I don’t have enough confidence in either side to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> a winner, but I think selecting Newcastle Tie No Bet at -108 is a safe option all things considered.

**Event:** English Championship (Soccer) - Coventry vs Swansea (15:00 GMT) / (2 hours from posting)

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Coventry win + over 1.5 goals @ 1.75 (1 unit)

**Write Up:** Hey all, and happy Boxing Day. Hope everyone had a great Christmas yesterday. This is my first time posting, although I’ve been lurking here for a while, so let’s see how it goes. Quick note before we start: every <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> I post will be for 1 unit, with the occasional 2‑unit play only when I’m extremely confident. Personally, I don’t see the value in going higher if your unit sizing is right, but of course that’s up to you.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s match takes us to the CBS Arena, where league leaders Coventry host 19th‑placed Swansea City. Coventry have been outstanding this season under Frank Lampard, already **scoring 53 goals** — and it’s only Christmas. For context, the next closest side is **3rd‑placed Ipswich with 38.**

Coventry have hit a slight dip recently, collecting just **5 points from their last four league matches**. Even so, they’ve **only lost once in that stretch**, bringing their total to just **two defeats in 22 games**. That loss came away to 3rd‑placed Ipswich, hardly a disastrous result. They drew 2 against **Preston (5th), and Southampton (11th)** — the latter played mostly with 10 men after a red card and won 1 against **9th place Bristol City**

The biggest factor behind <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today’s pick</mark>, though, is Coventry’s home form. They’re unbeaten at the CBS Arena this season, turning it into a complete fortress. They’ve **won 8 and drawn 2 at home, scoring 26 and conceding only 7.** They’re also the league’s best away side, but if we’re nitpicking, their 3-0 loss to Ipswich last month did come on the road.

Statistically, Coventry average **2.41 goals per game this season, rising to 2.6 at home**. Defensively, they’re the second‑best unit in the league, **conceding 1.05 per game overall and just 0.70 at home.** They’ll be without Jay DaSilva after his red card, but three first‑team players return after missing the Southampton match through illness.

Now to Swansea. After finishing 11th last season, they find themselves down in 19th — not quite in the relegation scrap, but far from the playoff picture. Since appointing Vítor Matos at the end of November, they’ve improved noticeably, **winning 3 of their last 4 after losing the previous 5**. However, their away form remains a major concern. Their only defeat under Matos came away at Stoke (8th), and overall this season they’ve played **10 away matches, losing 6, winning 2, and drawing 2**, with a goal difference of **9 scored and 14 conceded.**

Swansea score an average of **1.09 goals per game** this season, dropping to **0.90 away from home**. Defensively, they concede **1.36 per match overall**, rising slightly to **1.40 on the road**.

All things considered, Swansea do look improved under Matos, and this won’t be the walkover it might have been a month ago but Coventry’s dominant home form combined with Swansea’s struggles away should give the league leaders the edge on Boxing Day. As for the over 1.5 goals, the numbers speak for themselves backed further by the fact that **82% of Coventry’s matches** and **73% of Swansea’s** have gone over that line, and that trend hasn’t changed under the new manager.

I expect Swansea to make this competitive, but Coventry’s attacking quality should still see them through with something like a 2-1 or 3-1 win at the CBS Arena to extend their lead at the top of the table to 9 points.

Feel free to drop any thoughts or suggestions — like I said, first time doing this. Enjoy the rest of your Boxing Day, and best of luck if you’re tailing.

# Reasoning:

This matchup profiles much more like a tactical, half-court game than a high-scoring one, especially given the current rotations on both sides.

Monaco, even at home, are not a fast-paced team by default. With **Cory Joseph out**, their guard rotation becomes shorter and more ball-dominant through **Mike James and Okobo**, which usually slows the game down and leads to longer possessions rather than early offense.

Real Madrid, on the other hand, are a team that clearly reduce tempo on the road. They prioritize defensive balance, limit transition opportunities and are comfortable playing through structured half-court sets. Against Monaco’s physical perimeter defense and switching schemes, easy points should be limited.

From a matchup standpoint, there is a lot of defensive versatility on the floor: Diallo, Blossomgame and Theis for Monaco, and strong positional defenders on Madrid’s side. This usually translates into contested shots, fewer fast breaks and a game decided more by execution than rhythm.

The total at **174.5** feels a bit inflated for a game where both teams are likely to control pace, especially in the second half. Barring an unusually hot shooting night from both sides, this sets up well for an **under**.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Dubai to win and cover -15.5 handicap, 1.90, 1u ✅️

I like all 3 favorites in ABA <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, and I played all 3. I chose this one as the obvious one, first team on the table against the last one, Krka 2-8 score, Dubai 9-0.

Although I like it more when I play Dubai as guests since it makes no difference to them and the handicap is more generous, this should also be covered.

They played their last game on the 23rd, also at home, so they should be rested.

I like to look for some extra reasons, and maybe the fact that a good number of Krka players had Christmas yesterday and had to travel to Dubai is not going to sit well with them. On the other hand, a good number of Dubai players didn&#x27;t even have Christmas yesterday, I counted 8 of them.

Will this matter? I have no idea, but I like it.</td></tr>

BTTS @ 1.99

Writeup : Birmingham have been outstanding at home this season and are extremely difficult to beat. They’ve lost just once at home, scored in all 10 home matches, and have hit 2+ goals in 6 of their last 7 there. Defensively, they’re not perfect though — they’ve conceded in their last 3, which has opened the door for BTTS outcomes.  
Overall, Birmingham’s recent matches have been very goal-friendly, with BTTS landing in 7 of their last 8.  
Derby County arrive in excellent scoring form, having scored in 12 straight matches, showing remarkable attacking consistency, and their games have followed the same pattern — BTTS has landed in 9 of their last 10. Derby rarely fail to contribute to the scoreboard, even away from home.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Man United vs Newcastle - Matheus Cunha &amp; Nick Woltemade 1 SOT - 2.15 Odds on Bet365 (1 U to win 1.15 U) 

Cunha has recorded 2, 3, and 3 shots on target in his last three games, and with Amad, Bruno, and Mbuemo missing, he will likely be United’s main attacking outlet. Because of that, it’s reasonable to expect him to be the primary shooter, and I even see some value in backing him for 2 shots on target.
Woltemade, after the disastrous own goal against Sunderland, responded with a brace against Chelsea, and I can see him continuing that form. United are still missing De Ligt and Maguire, and with Yoro struggling for form and Heaven lacking consistency, I expect the German to be heavily involved in the attack.

**Write up:**

**The <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>:**  
This is a **Balanced Neutral** profile — exactly the kind of setup where **both teams usually get on the board** rather than one controlling the match.

Birmingham have a slight edge, but Derby have enough attacking threat in this profile to respond. The sample we have shows **100% BTTS and 100% Over 1.5** support in similar odds ranges, with typical scorelines like **2–1**. That’s a strong indicator of a **competitive game with goals on both sides**.

The tempo shouldn’t be slow either — the model flags **early goal likelihood**, which helps open things up before the match turns cagey.

At **2.00**, the pricing gives us **full value** for a game that doesn’t project clean sheets.

**My Model in general:**  
My model is built around the idea that matches follow **recurring patterns**, not randomness.  
Instead of predicting games in isolation, it groups matches by **odds profiles** and studies what *actually* happens when similar games are played.

By clustering historical matches with the same **home–draw–away odds**, I track how games usually unfold — goals, BTTS, scorelines, and game flow. From there, the model identifies **motives**: situations where teams are more likely to attack, trade goals, or avoid clean sheets.

Every <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> comes from **data-backed profiles, not opinions** — combining odds structure, score patterns, and streak behavior to find spots where the market regularly repeats itself.

Todays <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: **Sheffield Wed v Hull City: Hull City ML @1.90**

Sheffield Wednesday are in serious trouble at both ends of the pitch. They’re scoring just 0.8 goals per game with an xG of 0.81, while conceding 2.2 goals per game and allowing 2.35 xGA; all well below league standards. They sit 24th, have 0 wins in their last 5, and haven’t kept a single clean sheet.

Hull City, on the other hand, are flying. They’re 4th in the table, scoring 1.8 goals per game, generating 1.67 xG, and taking 11 shots per match. Defensively they’re solid too, conceding only 1.2 goals per game with a strong 1.02 xGA and a 40% clean-sheet rate.

Our model gives Hull a 51% chance to win, compared to just 25% for Sheffield Wednesday. Bookmakers price Hull at 1.91 (52% implied), which is close to fair but still playable given the massive gap in form, quality, and momentum.

Though tempted to fade the Hawks again, the prior loss has soured me on point spreads for now. So I will move to a hopefully more reliable player prop with a short/simple explanation.

Trae may be a defensive liability, but he is an excellent passer/playmaker and thrives in fast-paced games.

He is over this line in 5 of L5, which includes the 3 games since returning from injury and the 2 games prior to the injury (I am not including the game in which he got injured as he only played 7 minutes). Overall for the season, he is over in 6 of 8 total games played.

The Heat have the highest pace rating in the league this year meaning lots of possessions and high-scoring game, and they are tied for 4th in most assists given up to opposing point guards. They haven&#x27;t faced off this season yet, but against a similarly fast-paced team, Chicago, Trae was over in 3/3 this season.

**Write up**:

In Egypt&#x27;s last game against Zimbabwe Marmoush had an insane 4 SOT, one of which ending in a goal. As a City fan, I know Marmoush is going to be using this tournament as his proof to Pep that he deserves more game time at City, and the first game of the tournament proved that. Marmoush was by far the best player on the pitch that day and I see that run of form continuing for the Egyptian. Not many stats to back this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> given there has only been 1 game in the tournament but looking at last game in addition to Omar&#x27;s motives I can see this play does very well, and won&#x27;t be surprised if he wins player of the tournament if Egypt go far.

**Edit Post Match**: Super unlucky with that red card. Egypt practically stopped trying to score and Marmoush came off at half. Sadly, reds are part of the sport and completely change the entire outcome of a game. Will be back to my roots with the Prem for Saturday, probably not betting this tournament anymore lol</td></tr>

**Event:** AFCON, Angola v Zimbabwe, 7:30 am EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Zimbabwe Win or Draw + Under 3.5 goals +130, 4 units

**Write Up:** Despite both Angola and Zimbabwe losing their opening AFCON group stage fixtures - Angola narrowly went down 2-1 to South Africa while Zimbabwe were dramatically beaten 2-1 by paper favorites Egypt - there are solid enough reasons to back **Zimbabwe to avoid defeat <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>**. Angola’s AFCON history shows they’ve **only won one of their 10 opening games** at the tournament and have often dropped points in their second fixture after an initial loss, with draws in 1996 and 2006 following opening defeats. Meanwhile, **Zimbabwe have historically absolutely held their own against Angola**, and the overall **H2H is well balanced,** with both teams winning **eight times apiece and registering three draws** across their numerous encounters.

Zimbabwe’s squad is certainly not noticeably weaker than that of Angola, and it carries momentum from the recent goalscoring form, including **Prince Dube**, who scored a silky goal against Egypt, and they’ve shown they can score in successive matches. Angola are missing striker **Zini** through injury, which could blunt their attack and give Zimbabwe a tactical edge. Add to that Angola’s inconsistent form and Zimbabwe’s resilience in tight games, and a **Zimbabwe win or draw** looks like a sensible, value-backed prediction for this crucial AFCON group game. There&#x27;s also the possibility of neither team wanting to risk it ahead of the important Egypt - South Africa clash, thus making the draw even more likely (works for us). I&#x27;m certainly loving this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> and **pairing it with an Under 3.5 match goals** leg (I&#x27;m very positive this will be a **low scoring affair,** *personally feeling a 1-1 or a 2-1 Zimbabwe masterclass).* They&#x27;ve **nearly stunned Egypt,** so why can&#x27;t they take it a step further? Exactly, there&#x27;s no reason they can&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve spent hours researching the underlying data behind this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, so I&#x27;m feeling very confident that it&#x27;s gonna hit and finally release me out of the shackles of the horror run that I&#x27;m having atm - staking 4 units on this. Covering two outcomes and sprinkling an Under feels like great value for these odds, and the more I look at it, the better I feel about this. I don&#x27;t mind the BTTS Yes <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> either, but I&#x27;ve gone with the outlined <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> in the end.

This combination targets value while keeping risk controlled, rather than forcing aggressive lines.

**Write Up:** Happy Boxing Day! Oddly enough there&#x27;s only one match <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, but it&#x27;s bound to be an entertaining one as 7th place Man United hosting 11th place Newcastle. This is an important match as both teams are vying for spots in European football next season. 

Manchester United has been a mixed bag this year. They score a lot of goals and concede a lot of goals, in fact they have the highest # of total goals per match in the EPL. They are currently missing a ton of players, including their leading Goalscorer and leader of assist with Mbuemo,  Bruno Fernandes, and Amad all out due to AFCON/injury. They&#x27;re going to be looking for creativity and Cunha looks tocbe the guy to try to fill those shoes. 

Cunha has been on a year lately, after some injuryy struggles early in the season. In his last 3 games, he has really turned it on. In these last 3 matches, he has averaged 7.3 shots/game, 2.7 SOTs per game, and scored 2 goals. With Bruno now out, I see him getting even more of the ball and taking more shots. The books currently have his as Man U&#x27;s most probable Goalscorer, most probable shot taker, but behind Sesko and Zirkee in probable SOTs. I think this line is mispriced based on these trends, but we will certainly take it. 

Newcastle is a decent team defensively, but play much better at home than on the road. They have not had a lot of tough road tests this season, but notably they conceded 7 SOTs on 15 shots away at Brentford, 9 SOTs on 15 shots away at West Ham (who only had 38% possession). Predicting a lot of shots and goals here - love this line in this spot.

New Mexico is hot on 6 game winning streak and set a school record of 484.5 total yards per game. I foresee and conclude too many things that can go right for New Mexico , and too many things that can go wrong for Minnesota.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: USA vs. Germany | USA -5.5 (-110)

Time: 6:00pm EST

What’s going on everyone, I&#x27;m back again for my favorite week and a half of the year. If anybody&#x27;s been around, we’ve been on a roll the past few years and looking to continue with more of the same. It’s a pretty even split this year as far as the playing field goes. A clear top 5, a Slovakia team that can be a little scrappy and the last 4 fighting to stay out of relegation.

With that being said, we’re going to start the slate off with the US covering against the Germans. The Americans have the Germans number in this tournament, routinely dominating them year in and year out. The US didn’t bring a gold favorite to the tournament like last year, but they should still comfortably fight for a medal. The Germans on the other hand will be fighting to stay in the top division for another year.

We only have a few pretournament games to go off of for both teams, but luckily for us they already played eachother 4 days ago, with the Americans winning by 8. Germany did start their backup in this game, but it wouldn&#x27;t have mattered much. USA also sat a few of their returnees to get some looks at depth players before the final round of cuts. Expect a pretty big mismatch between a gold medal hopeful and a team trying to just stay afloat to start us off</td></tr>

MIDDLESBROUGH VS BLACKBURN

Date: 26 DECEMBER 2025 at 16:00

BET ON: Match odds- MIDDLESBROUGH

Odd: 1.79



\- Despite their slip-up at Bristol City, Middlesbrough remain the form side and a strong bet to win at Riverside. Under Kim Hellberg, Boro have climbed to second in the Championship thanks to consistent performances and an aggressive, possession-oriented tactical setup that sees them dominate games and control midfield play — a philosophy Hellberg has publicly praised for its intensity and control in recent press comments after big wins like the 4-1 rout of Hull. At home they are particularly dangerous, with seven wins in ten league matches this season and a habit of starting games strongly, making them favorites in front of their supporters. Injuries to Lenihan and Fry are a concern, but Boro’s defensive reinforcements and creative balance — including form attackers Strelec and Conway — mean they have more depth than struggling Blackburn. Conversely, Blackburn’s squad is stretched with key absences including potential issue with Gudjohnsen and other regulars, and coach Valérien Ismaël has recently admitted attitude issues in training, undermining consistency and preparation. With Boro’s clear motivation to consolidate an automatic promotion spot and Blackburn still fighting just to climb away from the bottom, the hosts have both the tactical edge and psychological incentive to take all three points.</td></tr>

Last pick:

Brighton Vs Sunderland 

Brighton win and under 4.5 goals (1.90) ✖️

A game which never looked like producing too many goals, Brighton did finish the game very strong and had Sunderland hanging on but couldn&#x27;t find a way to break them down as time ran out. Ending 0-0.

Premier League 

Manchester United Vs Newcastle 

Matheus Chuna 2 or more shots on target.

(2.10) 2.5 units 

Both teams come into this game with a good portion of missing players, United missing some key attackers, Newcastle missing a lot of key players in defense.

With so many players on international duty or out with injuries, Chuna should get the full 90 minutes here to find these shots on target. He&#x27;s been in good form as of late coming back from an injury, 2 goals and an assist in his last 3 games.

Shot wise his breakdown is as followed for the past few games.

Aston villa away: **6 shots 3 on target**

Bournemouth at home: **8 shots 3 on target**

Wolves away **8 shots 2 on target**

Newcastle are also a team that really struggles to perform well away from home , they average about 7 shots on target conceded away from home if you take out the derby game against Sunderland last away game, which was a hard watch, constant fouls as it was a fierce rivalry match,  which meant there was very few chances for either side.

Chuna is a very direct player, great at picking up the ball from deep and going on a run and getting shots away, he should again get plenty of shooting opportunities to cover this line again like he has been for the past few weeks and for the price were getting it&#x27;s too good for me to pass up a bet on this.

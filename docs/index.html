<tr><td class='post'>**POTD Record 38-35-1**

Last play was an easy winner. Houston dominated, with 7 guys scoring double figures and shot 65% from 3 (19/29). 

Todays write up will be short but don’t let that make you think I don’t have 7 paragraphs to write about , just busy this weekend but had to get it on here. I fucking love this play.

**76ers -5.5**

Read my play a few days ago talking about Philly for what I like about them, but Brooklyn is the key factor in this play. They are one of the worst NBA teams I’ve seen in a very long time. I’m not joking when the season started they had guys playing big mins I’d never heard of, and I watch a lot of basketball. Aside from the names they just make no sense together, and a group of guys trying to get buckets. 

I watched the entire Brooklyn / Cavs game a few games back, and they cut a gigantic lead by getting insanely hot from 3 (Zaire 6 3s - he’s out tomorrow) and made it very interesting in the final few mins. Honestly they should have beat Cleveland that night however down the stretch they played some of the worst basketball I’ve ever seen. MPJ &amp; Cam taking turns trying to create buckets on their own. When it wasn’t them w the ball, the other players on the team were doing the same fucking thing.

Anyways I could see BKN winning 10 games this season, and tomorrow against Philly isn’t going to be one of them. Also, I worked at Barclays center for 3+ years, and there is absolutely no home court advantage. Yes die hard basketball fans go to these games, but few are actually invested in the Nets.

PS: Wemby on 2 days rest against a terrible suns team. I’m laying them -6.5 too</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Utah jazz ML(+135)
Start time &amp; TV: 6:00pm

Reasoning: personally i believed that jazz are the better team in this match 
1.fatigue and Back-to-Back: The Charlotte Hornets are playing on the second night of a back-to-back, which is a statistically significant indicator of player fatigue and decreased performance, creating a highly difficult energy spot.
2.The Hornets are significantly short-handed, with key players such as Gray Williams, Josh Green, and Brandon Miller ruled out, and others questionable. This depletion of talent further compounds the fatigue issue.
3.The Hornets have a poor track record at home from a betting perspective, failing to cover the -3.5 point spread in a significant 17 of their last 20 home games.
4.: The Utah Jazz have been excellent against the spread (ATS) recently,</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: NBA Cavaliers v Hawks 

1U Jalen Johnson O4.5 1Q P @ $2.35 (+135 American), B365 

Write-Up (brief): 12, 4, 7, 5, 6 (4/5) in his 5 games this year. No Trae Young. Averages 8 minutes per 1st quarter, 4.2 field goal shots, and has gotten to the FT line in 3/5 1st quarters. 

Cavs concede 30.2 points in 1st quarters. They’re good but still only mid range as their game gets going. 
The Hawks average 31 points per 1st quarter. 

He did cover this only 1/2 last year v the Cavs but had multiple assists in the game he didn’t hit and that was with Trae playing. Mobley, Allen &amp; Mitchell played too - Okoro was the match-up, probably gets Hunter now. 

Johnson is the main man in this team, and I’m happy to take the higher odds - his actual line is O3.5 @ $1.66 (-152!); I’ll take a big jump to O4.5 for 1 extra point @ $2.35 all day (nearly 70 cents extra for that extra 1 point). The amount of games where he gets 4 points will not be equal to 70 cents per dollar, it’s just ridiculous. Better off taking 3 for $1.50 if you’re playing safe! 

As always with the last few 1Q plays - the caution is that streaky things can happen! At 2.35 units returned per unit spent, you don’t need to go big if tailing - more often than not this bet would lose by the odds (being &gt;+100), but I’ll take it due to the large jump in odds, and hence value.</td></tr>

The Suns currently rank 23rd in the league in pts allowed (121 PPG) indicating a below average defensive team 

They allow opponents a shooting percentage of around 47.3% on 2 pt FG’s, which is among the worst in the league.

——————————————————

**Chiefs @ Bills 16:25 EST**

——————————————————

**Rashee Rice 60+ receiving yards (-210)**

Rashee Rice played 84% of the snaps last week, up from 41% in his debut vs Washington the week before.

His target stats are elite.

Overall, he’s being targeted on 39.1% of his routes run, which is #1 out of all WRs in the NFL. 

Versus the Raiders he was targeted 10 times and caught 7 of them for 7 / 42 / 2

Last week vs the Commanders he caught all 9 targets for 9 / 93 / 1

Since his return, he has 5 receptions on 6 targets for 3 touchdowns in the red zone, which leads or is tied for the lead for all WRs in every category. That was with playing only 41% snaps in the first game.

The Bills secondary is pretty solid, but has allowed some big performances to opposing #1 WRs.

Drake London: 10 / 158 / 1

Zay Flowers: 7 / 143 / 1

Stefon Diggs: 10 / 146

Tetairoa McMillan: 7 / 99 

Taron Johnson, the Bills primary slot cornerback is banged up and listed as questionable, with only one practice for the week — a limited practice on Friday. If he plays, he could be hampered a bit, and his stats aren’t great anyway, being targeted on 18.8% of routes run and giving up 0.31 FP per route run. Rice plays all over the field, but a significant amount in the slot — 37% of his routes. 

This game has the highest Over Under on the slate at 52.5

He should see another 9-10 targets and hit 60 yards with no problem.

——————————————————

**Josh Allen over 7.5 rushing attempts (-140)**


Josh Allen rushing lines vs Chiefs:

2025 (Playoffs) : 11 / 39

2024 (Playoffs) : 12 / 72 / 2

2024: 12 / 55 / 1

2023: 10 / 32 / 1

2022 (Playoffs): 11 / 68

2022: 12 / 32

2021 (Playoffs): 7 / 88 

2021: 11 / 59 / 1

2020: 8 / 42

Josh Allen has cleared 7.5 rushing attempts vs the Chiefs in every regular season game  he’s played against them in his career, and all but one post-season game. Clearly he likes to run against them, and does so with great success.

**The Chiefs give up the most rushing attempts to quarterbacks this season** and the 3rd most rushing yards per game to QBs this season

Some notable stat lines 

Justin Herbert - 54
Trevor Lawrence - 55
Lamar Jackson - 48
Russell Wilson - 27
Marcus Mariota - 29

Don’t bet more than you can afford, and keep in mind that it is a long odds <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, keeping with my strategy. Not every <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> will hit, and I only need 45-50% to make solid profit in the long run.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Kimani Vidal Anytime Touchdown (-150 FanDuel) 3 units

Write Up: Devon Dampier came through with passing touchdowns in 1st and 3rd as predicted 🔥 - onto Sunday. 

While I don’t usually play odds this high, Kimani Vidal anytime touchdown is a great straight up play against the Titans as they rank last in the NFL in rushing touchdowns allowed to running backs. 

Vidal has stepped up as the Chargers lead back and is coming off a breakout performance. Since Omarion Hampton went on injured reserve in Week 5, Vidal has taken over as RB1 and made an immediate impact. He’s averaging 5.2 yards per carry and has scored two total touchdowns in just three games since being activated. With Najee Harris also out for the season and Hassan Haskins sidelined, Vidal is the only healthy back on the Chargers roster, making him the clear goal-line option.

The matchup couldn’t be better. Tennessee has allowed the most rushing touchdowns to running backs in the NFL, surrendering 13 scores through eight games. Their run defense ranks 26th overall, giving up 142.6 rushing yards per game, and they’ve struggled to contain explosive runners. With the Chargers favored and likely to lead the entire game, Vidal has a great opportunity to find the end zone again.

Start Time &amp; TV: 1:00pm EST (CBS)

Units: 2.5 Units

Reasoning: Welp, its come to this. After a couple rough <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> losses I have to turn to my lifelong favorite team, the Tennessee Titans, to do what they do best this year, play absolutely horrendous football. This team has been an embarrassment and it pains me to fade them but my gut knows they wont be competitive in this one and Ill explain why. After trading away our two best corners (L’jarius Sneed doesnt count hes made off glass and has been on IR all year and will miss this one) Jarvis Brownlee and Roger McCreary this secondary is basically a practice squad secondary and I think Herbert will be able to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> this defense apart. The pass rush will most likely be nonexistent as interior defensive lineman Jeffery Simmons and edge rusher Arden Key will be out in this one as well. On the offensive side of things it doesnt get much better. Cam Ward doesn’t look NFL ready and how could he, he has no weapons. Wide receiver Tyler Lockett literally quit on the team and demanded a trade and Calvin Ridley will be out in this game as well and it would be hard for any rookie quarterback to succeed behind the offensive line who blocks for him. Cam Ward also has more interceptions than touchdowns along with a couple inexcusable fumbles to go along with it. I have to go with my brain over my heart in this one, I think the Chargers make the Titans look like a high school team yet again in this one.

Prediction: 28-13 Chargers

Last pick:🏈Washington State -3💩Defense played great but offense and special teams was a different story. Sorry about that one guys.

Best of luck to everyone tailing and remember to bet responsibly! Lets get back on the right track with this one and happy NFL sunday to everyone!

Write-Up:

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> we keep things simple with a two-leg heavy favorite parlay. Both Barcelona and Manchester City are in comfortable home matchups where anything short of three points would be a shock.

Barcelona vs Elche
Barcelona come into this one in excellent form, especially at home, where they’ve averaged over 2.5 goals per match and conceded just once in their last five league games. Elche are sitting bottom of the table, struggling to defend set-pieces and leaking goals early. Even if Barcelona rotate, their bench depth is enough to dominate possession and create endless chances.

Man City vs Bournemouth
Man City at the Etihad is almost automatic.

They have won 16 of their last 17 home games in all competitions, and Bournemouth are simply outmatched on both sides of the ball. Bournemouth haven’t beaten City since 2015 and have conceded 3+ in five of their last six visits.

India also comes into this game winless, which adds that extra hunger and Australia missing their most reliable bowler, India ML, to take us back to the green column.

Event: Premier League ⚽️

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: West Ham +2 asian handicap corners vs Newcastle 3U @ 1.80 (Bet365)

Write-up: Bayern completely outplayed Leverkusen who were struggling to breathe in that first half, conceding three along the way despite the hosts resting their key players. By that point they were on six corners to Bayer’s 1 to pretty much already kill the bet. With Grimaldo confirmed on the bench the odds drastically swung the wrong way as he was the main threat at gaining corners and Hjulmand set up his team too defensively for this encounter which increased deflections. To be fair they stepped it up in the second half, reflective of earning 3 corners to Die Roten’s 4 and more possession but was too late.

West Ham have had a shocking start to the season, currently in 19th spot with just one win all season. They sacked Potter and replaced him with Nuno Espirito Santo which hasn’t given a true boost to the Hammers so far. The players simply look disinterested and if the situation continues like this they could very well be looking at a season in the Championship. Newcastle are currently sat in 13th which on paper doesn’t sound good as they should be fighting for those European spots but they’ve had some pretty tough opening fixtures to play and are passing the eye test at the moment. Over their last 20 home matches West Ham have won an average of 4.8 and conceded 5.2 corners whilst Newcastle away from home have averaged 4.6 won + 5.5 conceded. Adjusting for more recent data to fit Espirito’s stats at West Ham gives a mean of 5.2 corners for the Hammers and 5.0 for the Geordies.

That gives this play an estimated 71% change of winning. This line also cleared in last year’s fixture. BOL !

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: Lugentz Dort Under 2.5 Made Threes/Mikal Bridges +12 Points (-108 DraftKings)

Reasoning: Similar to my last two picks I’m going to exploit poor shooting, and lines that haven’t caught up. Dort is averaging 5.5 attempts from three and is shooting 18%. Unless he has his best game of the year from beyond the three line, this cashes. Mikal Bridges has taken on a leadership role in NY and is considered a veteran among the team. The Knicks lost to the Bulls on Friday night, but they play again tomorrow. Bulls are 5-0 and the Knicks look to avenge the loss. Bridges scored 23 points on Friday, shooting 64% from the field and making 4 threes. He’s averaging almost 3 made threes a game, so 12 points in a crucial rematch (as a veteran leader) this line should cash. Bridges is averaging 19 and hasn’t finished below 12 yet all year.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Todays pick</mark>**: Tucker Kraft 60+ Receiving Yards (+105 on DK) 2U to win 2.1 U

**Writeup:** Kraft&#x27;s really grown into a core member of the Packer&#x27;s offense and this isn&#x27;t changing here. Kraft has just come off a major game in Pittsburgh getting **143** yards. He&#x27;s been averaging 4.3 receptions at 14.2 Yards per Reception, with 67 Average Receiving Yards. He also leads the league for TE&#x27;s in yards after the catch.

The Panthers allow an average of 11.9 yards per reception for tight ends with around 67.9 receiving yards in total.  Their defense against TE&#x27;s are a very real vulnerability, which with Kraft, the packers will not be scared to exploit. 

Another smaller factor i&#x27;d look at is the windy weather getting up to 17 mph during the game, which will incentivize short to medium passes (Think Yard after Catch here). which along with his stats and usage, is why I think he&#x27;ll get more receptions than normal, which should be able to clear this number. Im predicting between 60-70 yards.

Event: Broncos @ Texans  (12pm Central)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Texans ML (-130) (1U) 

-everything is bet to win unit amount-

Write up: Without a doubt the biggest sharp/square divide of the nfl slate this Sunday. The broncos are flat out overdue for a loss, the absolute miracle comeback against the giants was something, and the blowout win against Dallas has everyone in their mother jumping at the chance to get this team at plus money against a “bad” Texans team. Nico Collin’s is back and so is Christian Kirk. CJ stroud has been on fire recently (passing for nine touchdowns with two interceptions in the past four games (three wins)). Not to mention, surtain is going to be out at least a month and the broncos will be going up against a Texans team with the number one scoring defense in the nfl (14.2). Houston is #1 in the league in opponent-adjusted points allowed, and while Denver is top 10 in points scored, when you opponent-adjust those numbers, that falls to 16th. 

Another thing I find interesting, When both teams are coming off a win, as is the case here, the non-division home favorite is 73-24 (75%) straight up with an 11% ROI since 2022.

Home favorites are 53-21 (72%) straight up with a 3% ROI this season. If they also made the playoffs last season, home favorites improve to 32-10 (76%) straight up with a 6% ROI this season.

The Texans have remained at home since last week and I expect them to come out and take care of business yet again now that they are regaining their health. 

What a comeback win for us with miss state, I said it exactly in my write up, Arkansas can and will score but they sure as hell can’t stop anyone, miss state had no business being over a 3 point favorite

I like this one especially because Flacco is battling a shoulder injury and if he isn’t slinging it to Jamar then the bengals don’t have a chance. 

The data doesn’t lie. The bears literally are better in every yardage category through week 8. The bengals have figured it out a little more as of late but the bears have too much talent on the offensive side of the ball against the leagues worst defense for the gimped Flacco led Bengals offense to keep pace.

Start time: 8.30am EST / 14.30 CET

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: FC Groningen to score over 1 goal (odds 1.60)

Units: 3

Been a while since I posted on here but after losing so many bets on player props, we&#x27;re definitely done with that. Too inconsistent. Instead I&#x27;ll be looking at value picks with little risk.

* Groningen are 5th in the table with 18 points from 10 games. Twente are in 8th place with 14 points.
* Groningen play at home, a place where they are usually very strong. In their last two home matches, Groningen lost 0-1 and 0-2 without scoring. In the cup midweek they got knocked out by Sparta in a trashing 5-2 loss. After such a big loss, teams usually bounce back. I also really don&#x27;t see Groningen failing to score for a third consecutive home game.
* Twente have conceded at least 1 goal in every away game this season. In their last Eredivisie away game, they even conceded 3 goals to NEC.

The good thing is about this bet that we only lose if Groningen don&#x27;t score at all. If they score 1 goal, we get a refund. If they score 2+ goals, we win the bet. Simple as that. I really like the odds for this one at 1.60

Good luck and bet responsibly 🍀

**Game:** NFL: Jaguars @ Raiders, 4pm EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Parker Washington o3.5 receptions (-148)

**Reasoning:**

The Raiders come into this game allowing 6.4 targets per game to primary slot receivers, and Washington has operated primarily from the slot throughout his tenure in Jacksonville.

Washington himself is averaging 5.8 targets per game this season, with several games of 7+ targets. 

The big news here is that Travis Hunter (along with Tim Patrick) are out for this matchup. Travis averaged 6.5 targets per game up until being placed on IR. Those targets have to go somewhere, and I would bet several will go to Parker Washington.

I also think this game will be competitive with Bowers and Crosby back for the Raiders, and the Jags have struggled mightily to run the ball since Brenton Strange&#x27;s injury about a month ago. They&#x27;re going to have to throw the ball tomorrow.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: 🏈 J.J. McCarthy under 30.5 passing attempts (-105).

Game starts at 1pm EST. Bet 4u

Writeup: There are a lot of picks I like for Sunday&#x27;s games and had struggles picking just one, but I&#x27;m going to deviate from my typical Colts <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> for this week. 

I&#x27;m going to try to keep this simple and sum up what I&#x27;m about to say with this - McCarthy is really bad.

During the very beginning of the season, a couple of my bets were for McCarthy to score under his projections, and they cashed laughably easily. He only played 2 weeks before getting injured (and in all honesty I think the Vikings kept him out longer than they could have because at least their backup gave them somewhat of a chance). During those 2 games, he looked good for 1 quarter - the other 7 quarters was some of the worst QB play I&#x27;ve seen. Additionally, he only had 20 and 21 pass attempts in those games. Even with the Lions secondary being banged up, opposing QBs actually are still performing slightly below average against them. While the Vikings are heavy underdogs and will be playing from behind thus needing to throw, I simply don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s possible for McCarthy to throw 31 times after coming back from injury and looking incompetent during his first two starts. The Vikings will probably rely on their run game a bit in order to get McCarthy feeling comfortable again and now that the Vikings have both of their running backs healthy. I have him throwing somewhere between 21-25 times, which is a huge gap from the line. 

Remember to only bet what you can afford, and BOL!</td></tr>

The London Stadium is starting to become a fortress for the away teams, as West Ham are winless at their home stadium this season. They have also managed to concede 12 goals in 4 games at home, and sit in 19th place on the table. The club is also undergoing issues between the fans and the board and initiated a boycott last home game against Brentford leaving the stadium fairly empty. 

Newcastle on the other hand have won 5 of their last 6 and scored 2+ goals in each of those games (across all comps) and despite a slow start, they are looking pretty solid especially with Nick Woltemade. Their slow start was characterized by key injuries and the whole Isak situation, but they have looked past that and been performing well ever since.

Write Up: First <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick of the day</mark>! Been regularly checking this thread lately so decided I’d contribute for once. Colts are going into Pittsburgh Sunday on a seasonal run that none of us expected, maybe especially us Colts fans. Pittsburgh has looked shaky at best this season and when looking at the stats -3 almost feels disrespectful to the Colts. Indy is currently leading the league in total yards per game (385.3) behind a remarkable turnaround for Danny Dimes and an MVP caliber season from Jonathon Taylor. The Steelers on the other hand rank 30th in yards allowed per game (386). Meaning if the Colts put up their league-best 385 yards per game it would be an improvement for a sorry Pittsburgh defense. Pittsburgh also ranks in the bottom 10 for offensive yards per game (297.1). While the Colts don’t have a top-tier defense, I still trust them much more than Pittsburgh’s defense. If this comes to a shootout, I don’t see Pittsburgh keeping up. I’d take Colts -9.5 if I were a bolder man. BOL everyone!</td></tr>

Porcinos loss to La Capital is misleading. La Capital gained an early edge by fielding two professional-level players against two non-footballers from Porcinos. On top of that, Porcinos missed *two penalties* and still dominated possession and chances—they had their opponent completely suffocated for most of the match.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> : Inter Milan Win + Total Under 4.5 goals @1.68 for 3u

Inter have a huge historical advantage and are much stronger than Verona this season. Inter have not lost any of their last 20 games against Verona and have won 9 of the last 10 meetings between the clubs, showing how dominant they are in this fixture. They have won their last 5/6 away matches this season and are fighting for the Serie A title with a solid team. Verona, meanwhile, are near the bottom of the table, struggling for results, and have only scored 9 goals from 8 matches while conceding 18, making them weak at both ends of the pitch. Verona are winless in last 10 games. All this suggests a win of the visitors and Inter scores 1.75 goals per game while Verona conceds 1 goals per game, making under 4.5 goals more probable.

**Utrecht v NEC Nijmegen**

Utrecht is a very attacking side with amazing set pieces. With **left-back Soufiane El Karouani at the top of the assists chart** in the Eredivisie they are looking to get more goals <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> against NEC. NEC is probably the most attacking side in the Eredivisie, of the 11 players their coach puts in the squad, 8 are attack minded. With only the centre backs and goalie thinking defensively, NEC&#x27;s matches are goalfests. **46 goals in 10 matches so far in matches that NEC has played in**. Utrecht have covered over 2,5 goals in **4/5 most recent domestic matches.**

**Rennes v Strasbourg**

I&#x27;ve personally watched Strasbourg&#x27;s game against Lyon last weekend as it was the last game that I needed goals from in a big parlay. This time I&#x27;m using the over 2.5 goals market again for a Strasbourg game, but this time its being used in the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>. Strasbourg have **topscorer of the league Panichelli**, and he really impressed me in that game. They were the better side against Lyon until their red card. Over 2.5 goals has hit in **6/9** of **Strasbourg&#x27;s games**. It also hit in **6/9 games for opponent Rennes**. Combine those goalscoring qualities and lackluster defenses and this is a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> I&#x27;m fairly confident in.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Broncos ML +105 (1 unit)

Write up: These two elite defenses collide in an AFC showdown that could be a potential playoff matchup. Denver enters this game on a 5 game win streak featuring clutch defensive performances (holding the defending champ Eagles to 17) and impressive offensive showings (they’ve put up 33 and 44 points over the last 2 weeks). Bo Nix appears to be taking the second year leap, sporting a TD/INT ratio of 10/2 during the win streak. Houston has struggled against quality competition this season, with their most impressive win coming against a banged up 49ers team. CJ Stroud and the offense have been their biggest weakness, with the former Buckeye posting a passer rating below 100 during each loss.

Quarterback play will be the key difference maker here, and the choice seems obvious. I expect Sean Peyton to limit Stroud through the air while Nix does just enough to secure the win. BOL to those who tail. Let’s do some winning!</td></tr>

__Write Up:__ Back at it again going for 50 wins &amp; 69% win rate. The Chicago Bears (4-3) are traveling to Cincinnati to take on the Bengals (3-5). The Bengals are coming off an embarrassing loss, giving the New York Jets their 1st win of the season. The Bears had their 4 game win streak snapped in their last game vs the Ravens. __There are going to be a lot of points scored this game as both the Bears &amp; Bengals are tied for 30th in points allowed per drive on possessions without a takeaway (3.08). Cincinnati has allowed a TD on a league high 37.7% of opponent drives when they fail to get a turnover. The Bears rank 30th at 36.7%. The Bears (6.8) &amp; Bengals (6.1) are the 2 worst defenses in yards allowed per play on early downs.__ The Bengals have had some life in them after acquiring Joe Flacco from the Browns. The Bears have won 4 of their last 5 games &amp; are looking to keep their offense hot vs the Bengals. 

Going into their Week 5 bye the Bears had a weak run game &amp; Bears Head Coach Ben Johnson went to the lab &amp; started cooking. __Before the bye, Bears RB’s averaged 3.4 yards per carry &amp; 1.18 yards before contact. After the bye, they’ve averaged 5.9 yards per carry &amp; 3.17 yards before contact.__ The Bears have deployed a RB tandem with both D’Andre Swift &amp; Kyle Monangai. Monangai only has 1 game with 10+ touches this season, in Week 7 vs the Saints. Monangai had 13 carries for 81 yards. Over the past 2 weeks, Monangai has had longest rushes of 25 yards &amp; 15 yards, his 2 longest rushes of the season. In these 2 weeks Monangai has a 39% rush share, compared to just a 23.6% share in Week 1-6. This week Bears RB’s D’Andre Swift &amp; Roschon Johnson are out, leaving Monangai in a bellcow role. He’s going to see at least 18-20 touches this week. The Bears took Monangai in the 7th round of this year’s draft. Monangai is 5’8″ 211 pound rookie out of Rutgers, who faced elite competition in the Big 10. He played in an awful offense with an awful OLine, &amp; he still but up big numbers in back-to-back seasons as he was their entire offense. He had 270 touches 1364 yds, 14 TDs in 2024, &amp; 250 touches, 1340 yds, 8 TDs in 2023. __Monangai’s 139 forced missed tackles over in his last 2 seasons at Rutgers were the 8th most among FBS RB’s, &amp; he didn’t fumble once his college career with over 670 carries.__ Monangai hasn’t had many chances to show his skills much so far this year, but that’s going to change Sunday as he is the only healthy RB on the Bears roster vs a horrrible Bengals run defense. But he has still put up big numbers. __His 4.4 yards per carry ranks in the Top 24 of RBs this season, &amp; his 5.1 Yards per Touch is 17th. Fantasy Life’s Ian Hartitz created a stat called “Cool Sh*t”, a list of RBs with 50+ opportunities &amp; what % of those went for TDs/explosive plays/avoided tackles, &amp; Monangai ranked 8th with 39.2%. He has a 4.8% explosive rate &amp; averaged 0.17 mossed tackles per rush.__ He now faces an atrocious Bengals run defense that has been torched on the ground this year. Here is how opposing RB’s have faired vs the Bengals this season:

Breece Hall 18/133, Isaiah Davis 7/65

Jaylen Warren 16/127

Josh Jacobs 18/93

Montgomery/Gibbs 30/119

JK Dobbins 16/101

Jordan Mason 16/116

Etienne/Tuten 22/113

__The Bengals have given up 132 rushing yards per game to opposing RB’s this season. The Bengals are 30th in defensive success rate (52.8%). 89.8% of the rushing plays against the Bengals have gained yardage, the highest rate in the NFL.__ They have a tough matchup this week as Chicago has been elite on the ground this season. __16.2% of Chicago&#x27;s run plays have gained 10+ yards, 2nd in the NFL behind the Ravens (17.8%).__ The Bengals haven’t been able to stop an RB’s this year. __They are currently 31st in EPA/Rush allowed &amp; are allowing the 4th most yards per carry (5.00). They are allowing the 4th most yards before contact per attempt in the NFL, which won’t improve this week facing a Chicago OLine that is generating the 4th most yards before contact per run in the NFL (2.61).__ Schematically Monangai is set up for a big day as well. The Bengals have been horrible against zone rushing concepts. __Monangai runs zone carries at the 12th highest rate among RBs. Cinci is allowing both the 2nd highest yards per carry (5.71) &amp; 2nd highest success rate (56.0%) in the NFL against zone attempts, as well as the most yards before contact per run (2.65) on these rushes.__ The Bengals also struggle defending exterior runs. __Cincinatti allows the 5th most yards per carry (6.04) &amp; 3rd most yards before contact per carry (2.99) vs outside runs. The Bears offense runs outside on 54% of their attempts, 6th highest rate in the NFL. It works well for them too as they rank top 10 in both YPC &amp; success rate.__ The Bears have been running it a ton over the past few weeks. __Chicago ranks 5th in the NFL in Run Rate Over Expected since Week 4.__ With the Bears favored by 3 points, that should continue this week against a struggling Bengals team.

In a bellcow role vs a horrible run defense, there’s no one I trust this week more than Kyle The Run Guy Monangai. 

__Kyle Monangai over 73.5 rushing yards__

Went exactly as I expected, probably should have just taken the regular spread knowing the huge gap between these teams but usually its better to be safe than sorry betting on the bottom tier teams in college football.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s match: Man City vs Bournemouth (Soccer/EPL) 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: BTTS + Over 2.5 Goals (-110, MGM)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> we head to Etihad Stadium where Man City will host Bournemouth in a matchup that is historically one-sided with Man City winning 17 of their 18 H2H matches and undefeated in all home matches. Both teams were top 3 in goals scored before this weeks slate of games started with Man City scoring 17 goals and Bournemouth scoring 16. Even though this matchup is predominately one-sided their last 6 games against each other have seen BTTS over 2.5 in 5 of them. Bournemouth also enter this game in good form starting the season fantastically and sitting 2nd on the table while scoring in every game this year besides one game against Newcastle, similarly Man City have also scored in every game this year besides last game against Aston Villa where we also saw Haaland&#x27;s 12 game scoring streak come to an end. I&#x27;m expecting Man City to get back to winning ways tomorrow being at home but I expect Bournemouth to net at least one goal. BOL and bet responsibly.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: BYU vs Baylor/ BYU ML -148 (2u)

Write up: BYU has been nothing short of horrific these last couple weeks. So why not bet them.. But in all seriousness Baylor has lost 11 straight vs ranked opponents. BYU has won 22 of 23 against unranked opponents. Baylor has also struggled in the first half of games in the Big 12. Falling behind on a team who can run up the score like BYU? That’s a recipe for disaster for Baylor. And you gotta imagine BYU knows how big of a moment in the season this is. A loss here derails everything. Not only does BYU have the potential number 1 <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> but they have a very solid supporting cast in Saunders and Wright who both can be trusted late. I just don’t think Baylor has enough to beat this team at this spot. I trust Dybantsa in crunch time with my life. Let’s put our hard earned on the Cougars tomorrow. Let me know if you’re tailing!

Mirandés just constant fouling to kill the flow of the game here. 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>: England | Premier League | 230pm Eastern | Everton vs Bournemouth | Everton DNB 3U @ -128

Everton Draw No Bet against Bournemouth is a value-driven <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> that balances form, matchup dynamics, and game state risk. Everton’s recent performances have shown a clear upward trend, particularly in defensive structure and midfield control. They have been far more compact without the ball, conceding fewer high-quality chances and forcing opponents into lower-percentage shots. This defensive improvement is crucial against a Bournemouth side that relies heavily on transition moments and wide overloads rather than sustained possession.

At Goodison Park, Everton’s underlying numbers traditionally improve, especially in terms of expected goals conceded. The home crowd tends to amplify Everton’s intensity, leading to stronger pressing phases and fewer defensive lapses. Bournemouth, meanwhile, have been far less consistent away from home, where their attacking output drops and they struggle to dictate tempo. When Bournemouth are forced into a slower, more physical match, their effectiveness noticeably declines.

From a tactical perspective, Everton’s direct approach and set-piece threat pose a persistent problem for Bournemouth’s back line, which has shown vulnerability against physical forwards and second-ball situations. Everton do not need prolonged dominance to create danger; their ability to capitalize on moments, particularly from dead-ball situations, gives them a clear edge in tight matches.

The Draw No Bet angle strengthens the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> by mitigating Everton’s tendency to grind out narrow, low-margin games. If the match turns cagey or ends level, the stake is protected, while Everton’s superior defensive stability and home advantage still provide a realistic path to victory. Overall, Everton Draw No Bet represents a disciplined, analytically sound selection that aligns with form trends, matchup edges, and risk management principles rather than relying on outright result volatility.</td></tr>

Reasoning: -Villanova has had much more success in conference play with a 9-3 record in Big East play while Marquette has been struggling with a 4-9 conference record. -Marquette has not won a single road game this year. -Villanova defeated on the road already so I think they have repeat success at home. -Iowa State has an edge over TCU in points per game, points allowed per game, field goal percentage, rebounding, steals, three point percentage, three point defensea and turnovers per game. -Iowa State has performed much better against common opponents and TCU has suffered poor losses like giving Utah their sole conference win, and losing to Notre Dame and New Orleans. -TCU is 0-4 against ranked Big 12 opponents.

Prediction: 79-70 Villanova, 76-68 Iowa State

League of Legends (LOL) | LPL 2026 Split 1 playoffs | 1:00 AM EST. | Teams: ThunderTalk vs. LNG

**Writeup:**

* LNG are massive favorites in this one and for good reason, TT are the worst team in the league, 1-12 game record and yet to win a series with just 1 map win. LNG are 12-2 in game record and 6-0 in matches, complete inverse of TT, while TT was still in the harder group, I still think this is a compelte mismatch, most of LNG group was bad but LNG roster is very good, they have a ton of talent and should roll over TT, expecting a 3-1 if im being generous, 3-0 if LNG play serious throughout.
* LNG in map wins die the 2nd least/14 teams in the LPL, and rank 12th/12 in deaths per game amongst playoff teams at only 6.6 deaths per game, while also having 12 map wins overall meaning this is quite a strong sample to go off of. They don&#x27;t die a lot and play very cleanly in their games, at a 6.6 average (round up to 7 to be generous) Ryan3 would need 4/7 kills to go over or a roughly 57% kill share. He is currently averaging a 33.6% kill share overall meaning this number will be very hard to achieve.
* In map losses, Thundertalk don&#x27;t really do much either, their pace of play is extremely slow, they average just 8.8 kills per map loss, even at this number still very hard for Ryan3 to hit this line, they often just rollover and let teams dictate pace of play against them and they aren&#x27;t proactive at all. Ryan3 is often left farming in side lane for the grubs fight early
* LNG in map wins don&#x27;t give up many kills to enemy adc&#x27;s at all, In map wins this split, LNG are only giving up 1.58 kills to enemy adc&#x27;s in their 12 map wins overall, well below this line, they also have a massive advantage in bot lane with 1xN/missing up against Ryan3/Feather.
* Ryan3 is averaging 2.42 kills per map in losses this split for Thundertalk, has gone O in 2/12 map losses. However this average is inflated from a very high kill loss which he dropped 8 kills, factoring that out, in the other 11 losses, he is averaging 1.91 kills per map loss overall</td></tr>

This is a classic set up of a horse racing well but not getting a stakes win, coming back to a maiden in its next prep and proving far too good for its opposition. I would typically never back something this short, however I have this horse marked closer to $1.30, so the $1.60 on offer is appealing.     
      
This distance is short of its best, however class goes a long way in a Tuesday country maiden, and we will be winning here.</td></tr>

**CS2: OG ML, 1u, +100** \[[IEM Atlanta 2026 Closed Qualifier](https://www.hltv.org/events/8909/iem-atlanta-2026-closed-qualifier)\]

I like OG here just playing for one unit but might increase, following rationale:

* fnatic have lost four straight matches and haven’t played for 3 weeks
* OG are a new roster but they played yesterday and won the last two matches convincingly albeit to weaker teams
* OG’s players are well established and three of them are cracked whereas on Fnatic I’d say they have one maybe two players with big firepower
* Overall I’d line OG more like -125 to -150 range so see upside on the new roster and assume they&#x27;ve been putting the practice in which is why they started the new season so hot

The only watch out is both teams are experienced and there’s a lot at stake.. might go to three maps (in a bo3) but I like OG to prevail nonetheless. Another couple of side tangents why we might be seeing value on OG: both teams are popular and their fans will bet on them regardless and I&#x27;d say OG&#x27;s IGL (in-game leader) is a little unpopular with some bettors maybe fading him but it&#x27;s just perception imo I think he&#x27;s a very solid IGL fwiw.

Xinyu Wang - Elena Rybakina

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Xinyu Wang +5.5 games at @1.80 (-120), stake 100$ (1U)

Xinyu Wang has looked solid in almost every match this season. For example, at the Australian Open she caused Anisimova quite a few problems, in a match where she could have won the first set. Here, in her opening match, she cruised past Arango, only facing some difficulty in the second set when her serve dropped below her usual standard. However, she possesses one of the best serves in the world, and I don’t think she will concede breaks easily <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.


Elena Rybakina comes into this match after winning the Australian Open title, where she defeated Sabalenka in the final. She is an exceptional athlete, but I expect a slight dip in her level. Often, after winning a Grand Slam trophy, players tend to be more relaxed at the next tournament and somewhat less motivated. I believe this could be the case here as well, leading to a more modest performance.


Therefore, I believe Wang will not lose by more than a 5-game margin, and my prediction is based on this idea.</td></tr>

Tuesday’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>- Manchester United win AND Bruno to score or assist +133 (1u to win 1.33u)

Who is ready for a haircut? ManU are going for their 5th straight win and currently sit in 4th in the premier league standings. They will be motivated to keep this streak going. After this match tomorrow, they will be off until 2/23, so they have a bit of a break coming up after this one. 

Since coming back from injury, Bruno has been outstanding. In their 6 matches played in 2026, he has scored or assisted in all of those games.

West Ham have actually played pretty well as of late and are also equally motivated to get out of the relegation zone. These two teams played in December at Old Trafford and they drew 1-1. With that being said, ManU controlled a lot of that game and I think it’s safe to say this team is currently playing with a different confidence level than they were in December.

Good Luck!</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Enzo Fernandez 1 + SOT (-125) 1.25 units to win 1 units

**Write Up:** Back in the green yesterday as our guy Malen came through clutch with 2 goals on 7 shots. Got a touch sweaty as Malen had a bunch of shots blocked, but he came through for us again. Appreciate the love friends, and good to see a lot of you cashed yesterday! Let&#x27;s see if we can start a streak. 

We&#x27;re playing back one of our favorite plays <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> and backing Enzo Fernandez to land a shot on target. Enzo, as many of you know, is one of my favorite players to back and fits the style of player I love to back to a T. He&#x27;s always working hard, chases every fast break, takes free kicks frequently, crashes the box well, and isn&#x27;t afraid to shoot from distance. This is lower odds than I usually like to take him, but I absolutely love this spot for him so we&#x27;re not going to overthink it. 

Leeds sit 16th in the table and sit right at 16th defensively as well. They just conceded 6 SOTs at home to Forest and 9 SOTs at home to Arsenal. The reverse fixture at Leeds ended 3-1 in favor of Leeds, and while Enzo didnt have an SOT he did have 3 shots which is rare for him to not find the target. 

Enzo has been on a tear lately and is in the running (maybe favorite?) for midfielder of the year in the EPL. He has scored 4 goals in his last 7 matches, and landed an SOT in each of his last 3 matches. I expect Chelsea to dominate the ball here at home and im turn get their shots in. I&#x27;m also thinking there&#x27;s a chance Palmer is rested in this game and Enzo will play further forward where he has thrived this season. Even if he plays further back, I still see him getting his shots in.

Al Ittihad vs Al-Gharafa, over 10.5 corners @ 2.38

Al Ittihad and Al Gharafa are two very attacking teams that play fast, wide football. Both sides rely heavily on crosses, set pieces and constant pressure in the final third. Recent matches for both clubs have regularly produced high corner counts due to their aggressive styles and open games. With plenty of attacking talent on the pitch, this contest should see many goalmouth situations. Over 10.5 corners @ 2.38 looks excellent value.</td></tr>

**Write Up:** Never back Manchester United when the matchup seems favorable for them. **The last time United strung 5 wins in a row was over two years ago** and I think West Ham have enough in their locker to stop them from repeating this feat.

Yes, *Manchester United are playing well at the moment* and there&#x27;s a sense of optimism in their ranks that hadn&#x27;t been felt in *(what feels like)* forever, but West Ham come into this game in great form themselves. **They&#x27;ve won 4 out of their last 5 games,** proving they&#x27;re going to be anything but a pushover. Their forwards seem to be in great form, with the always incredible **Bowen scoring 3 goals in the last 5 games against Man United,** while **Summerville&#x27;s scored in 5 games on the bounce in all competitions.** In contrast, while Manchester&#x27;s attack certainly isn&#x27;t looking too shabby at the moment, they still have **issues fitting the likes of Sesko into their system.** Here&#x27;s an even better stat though: **Manchester United have lost all of their last 3 games at West Ham&#x27;s ground.**

This <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> is essentially **West Ham to win or draw,** but my book offers slightly higher odds on the Asian handicap versus the +105 on the double chance.

Even though I am tempted to go for a 2-0 win, I am playing it a bit save here as we haven&#x27;t been too lucky with our 2-0 bets.

Good luck!

&gt; **Write Up:** This <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> is from my soccer model that I&#x27;ve been using for the past two years. It assigns ELO ratings to players and projects a win chance based on the combined ELO ratings of the players on each team. TeamReddit is projecting a 62% win chance here which creates value here on the ML.</td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>

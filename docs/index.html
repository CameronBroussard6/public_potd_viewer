Girona* truly *came out swinging and gave Barcelona one hell of a game, and ended up beating them 2-1. Honestly, they really should&#x27;ve scored a couple more, judging by the fact Barca&#x27;s keeper even won man of the match. I&#x27;ll keep riding this wave in the most daring way possible - by going back to the team that had handed me the most Ls to date. Yes, whilst I mostly focused on the &quot;Barca curse&quot;, one team has been consistently killing my picks one after the other, whilst somehow staying relatively under the radar. I&#x27;m talking about Real Madrid. No matter what, whether I backed or faded them, they&#x27;d always find a way to break my heart come the end of the game. But after surviving this Barcelona madness, I think the next logical step is to come for Real Madrid. Character progression and all that.* ***This is it, the final boss battle, if you will. Let&#x27;s get to it!***

**Last Five:** ✅✅❌✅✅

**Event:** Champions League, Benfica v Real Madrid, 3:00 pm EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Benfica +0.5 Asian Handicap, -103, 5 units

**Write Up:** I don&#x27;t think I need to explain myself too much here. Real Madrid just haven&#x27;t impressed me enough to back them in a big Champions League game like this one. The **previous meeting between these two sides saw Benfica beat Madrid** in a spectacular fashion after a stunning headed goal from their goalkeeper (yes, you read that right) helped them beat the Spanish giants 4-2 and secure a spot in the play-offs. Benfica thus proved they can absolutely compete against elite teams, and truthfully, 4-2 might have even flattered the guests a bit.

After that match, Madrid also got knocked out of the Spanish cup by a second tier side in Albacete, but they have managed to find some consistency since. Still, Benfica have more than enough quality to at least snatch a draw here. Keep in mind, this is the **first leg of a knockout tie, and neither team is going to come out swinging,** especially not Madrid. They&#x27;re going to be more than happy to **settle for a draw** here and hunt for a win at the Bernabeu, depending on how the on-field balance looks. As a reminder, we&#x27;re talking about a team that celebrated a narrow first leg defeat to Manchester City, as they anticipated a comeback at their home ground (which they, in fact made happen).

However, I&#x27;ve not even come to my favorite part about this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, which is the **Real Madrid absences.** In case you forgot, the guests collected two red cards in their last match (ironically, against Benfica), meaning **Raul Asencio and Rodrygo** are out of the picture for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>&#x27;s clash. And if these aren&#x27;t some crucial absences, **Jude Bellingham** is also set to miss the match due to a hamstring injury, while **Eder Militao** still doesn&#x27;t look ready. And for that final blow, **Kylian Mbappe is still recovering** and is possibly not going to feature for the whole 90 minutes. That&#x27;s a crazy amount of key first team players missing, and whilst *Benfica are missing Alexander Bah and Fredrik Aursnes* themselves, they just aren&#x27;t on the same level of importance as the aforementioned players.

Unlike the league phase clash, goals aren&#x27;t going to rain in this one, so Under 2.5 goals is a good angle if you want to boost the odds further (or go more conservatively with a 3.5). This is essentially a Benfica double chance, but once again, the odds are tastier if I head over to the AH section of my book (-103 v -111). Another max unit play here because the confidence is absolutely sky high and I just think these odds are too good in this context. BOL and let&#x27;s enjoy this European classic and maybe a cheeky hattrick from the Benfica keeper ☘️🫡</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>Dubai/Doha/Delray: 0-2 (-7.4 units)

Australian Open: 8-3 (+17.8 units)

2026 record: 12-10 (+0.9 units) | 2025 record: 55-41 (+26.5 units)

Event: ATP Delray Beach R32 🎾

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Brandon Nakashima 🇺🇸 ML vs Marin Cilic 🇭🇷 5 units to win 3.3U @1.66 (Bet365)

Big respect to Cilic for holding his own out there at 37 after years of injury problems. One of the most underrated players ever in my opinion simply due to the fact that no one really speaks of him despite winning a grand slam in the toughest era of tennis, players who have achieved far less get more recognition than Cilic. He’s had a pretty good start to the season, losing in R16 of Hong Kong to Borges, R3 of AO to Ruud having beaten Shapovalov in straights and last week lost to Fritz in the semis of Dallas having defeated Tien in round 1. Nakashima started the season on fire by reaching the finals of Brisbane and beating the likes of Davidovich Fokina in straight sets before falling to Medvedev 2-0. He then suffered an upset to VDZ in Melbourne in four tight sets to put a dent into his strong start to 2026 and last week lost to Fritz in R16 of Dallas.

So both players have had decent season openers but it’s the conditions that are going to heavily favour Nakashima in this match. Unlike Dallas which is one of the fastest tournaments, Delray plays fairly slow so Cilic’s big serve becomes less of a weapon. More neutral balls is going to force more errors from Marin who will be forced to attack to try and end points early. This is going to play exactly into Brandon’s gamestyle who has great rally tolerance and depth to keep rhythm going. Considering Nakashima’s strong serve and Cilic’s relatively poor returning I’m not optimistic on the Croatian’s chances at creating many opportunities on return but on the other side if Cilic’s first serve dips even slightly I expect him to get punished by the American’s depth. Nakashima plays very tactical tennis (his play style is stylistically very similar to Djokovic who Marin struggled against greatly) and if he can force backhand-cross exchanges this could be a quick win for him. Not only does Nakashima’s patient game match well against Cilic’s error-proness on these courts but there’s also going to be questions of the Croatian’s fitness. At 37 playing 5 matches in 7 days is going to take its toll and I can see this being a UE fest once the match goes on. I would have fairer odds at around 1.50. Cilic did beat Nakashima in November 24’ on the way to winning Hangzhou but the courts there are also amongst the fastest on tour so I’m not worried by it. BOL !</td></tr>

### ⚽ <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Tigre -1.5 Asian Handicap @ 1.72 (-139) - 2 Units

**Kids watch the Champions League, real men watch the Copa Argentina.** 🇦🇷⚽

* **The Hierarchy Gap:** Tigre is currently one of the most aesthetic and well-drilled teams in the Argentine Primera División. Their ball movement and offensive patterns are top-tier. 
* **Top Flight vs. 3rd Division:** They are facing an opponent from the third tier. Even if the underdog is in a &quot;good moment&quot; in their league, the physical intensity, speed of play, and individual quality of a Primera side are usually too much to handle for 90 minutes. Third division in argentina is almost amateur.

We need a 2-goal margin win to clear the -1.5 line.

**Games: Australian A League -  Sydney FC VS Auckland FC - 3:00 am EST**

**---**

**Sydney FC played Auckland away 10 days ago and got 7 corners while losing 1-0, now they get a rematch at home and I expect them to be up for it performance wise.**

Sydney have played 6 home games this season and covered this line in **5/6** with an average of **5.83 corners per game.**

Sydney have lost 4 of their last 5 games yet a win will have them second and just above Auckland. I expect heavy field tilt from Sydney while Auckland punch on the counter, Auckland are better defensively but should find themselves having to deal with more dead balls than they&#x27;d like.

**Last Pick:** Goztepe ML (vs Kayserispor) ❌

**Football | Champions League | 20:45 UTC+3**

**Match:** Galatasaray vs Juventus

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Galatasaray Over 0.5 Goals

**Write Up:** Juventus have played 4 away matches in the Champions League this season, and apart from the 0-0 draw against Monaco, they conceded at least 1 goal in every single one of them. Galatasaray, on the other hand, managed to score at least 1 goal in 3 out of their 4 home games.

Galatasaray usually have big problems on the road in Europe, but at home they’re different. Especially with the crowd behind them pushing them to score and win. The fans will be roaring again tonight, no doubt, and I’m confident they’ll get at least one goal on the board.</td></tr>

Ireland v Zimbabwe 

Zimbabwe win @ 1.66

Starts in about 11 Hours ⏳

Units: 5

Reasoning:

Zimbabwe beat Australia in their last match. Biggest upset of this World Cup.

High in confidence and to make sure they qualify to next stage Zimbabwe will deliver this win.

They are batting very sensibly. Muzarabani’s bowling and Sikandar Raza’s all round performance can cause problems for Irish team.</td></tr>

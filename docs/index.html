**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: (NCAAB) Iowa State Cyclones -4.5 vs Kansas Jayhawks (-178) (1:00 PM EST)**

Reasoning: Laying 4.5 points on 5th ranked Iowa State at home vs Kansas <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Reason being, Iowa State has a better offensive efficiency and defensive efficiency. They also have a better rebounding percentage. Iowa State is clearly the better team here, going with the numbers. No questions. Line movement has also favored Iowa State so far.

Result: LOSS ❌ (Combined score: 148)

Review: When a slow team shoots 52% from three, pace almost doesn’t matter. Threes are high-efficiency possessions. If even 3–4 of those don’t drop, this total probably lands in the low 140s.

College Basketball | NCAA Men’s Basketball
Yale @ Harvard | Time: 6:30 PM ET

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Full Game Under 142.5 

Odds: -110 (FanDuel)

Write-Up: 

It’s been a couple days, but I’m back. I took a couple of days off to reevaluate my model. 

I started off hot at 4-0, but then had to reevaluate after I went 2-5 over the last 7 games I selected. 

One time I made a spread play, which was ill advised and out of fear because the under the previous game missed by so much (the irony is the under on the spread game would have hit). Another time a game went to OT which messed up the under. Another game went over because the team that plays suppressive defense also got hot shooting 3’s.

Sometimes games are going to miss, but I felt like a 2-5 stretch showed that there were something’s on my end I needed to work on. It made me take time to go over the model and modify it - which it essentially is another model entirely now. 

A lot of hours put in but I am happy with where it is and ready to start making picks again. 

That was my Ted Talk. Now - to the game.

Ivy League teams often play back to backs on Friday-Saturday. That can help the under. 

Yale and Harvard played earlier this year and totaled 132 points at Yale.

Both teams are comfortable in the half court. They’re not built on transition chaos or early-clock threes — they execute, work through sets, and make you defend for 20+ seconds. When you have two teams like that facing off, possessions naturally compress. Fewer trips = fewer scoring opportunities. That alone makes 142.5 feel a bit inflated unless efficiency spikes.

The other piece here is game flow. The spread is competitive, which lowers the risk of extended foul sequences late. Neither side profiles as a volatility-heavy offense that can randomly drop 15 points in three minutes off turnovers and runouts. If this stays within structure — which is the most likely outcome — this game projects more mid-130s than mid-140s.

Nothing flashy. Just two disciplined teams, controlled tempo, and a number that looks a little high relative to how this should actually play out.

Best of luck!!

Let&#x27;s start off this journey with a banger! 🧨

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: English League 2, Shrewsbury Town vs Swindon Town ML (+137)**  
**Kickoff: 3:00 PM GMT** (2hours from now)

Have been following people&#x27;s picks for a good one month, and I think it&#x27;s about time I get  started in contributing my fair share of picks as well.

We have a massive gulf in class here. Swindon Town is currently sitting 2nd in the table, hunting for automatic promotion and coming off a string of dominant performances. On the flip side, Shrewsbury is languishing in 21st, fighting for their lives just above the drop zone. While Shrewsbury just secured a vital win against Barrow, they are now stepping up several weight classes to face a Swindon side that has won 4 of their last 5 league matches.

We should see Shrewbury parking the bus to try to scrape a draw, but Swindon should prove to be too efficient for Shrewbury&#x27;s liking. The race for promotion will likely give them that extra push, especially against a bottom-four side. </td></tr>

POTD Record - 0W 0L ( ON THAT WINNING STREAK )

MY <mark style='background:#fff59d'>PICK</mark> - REAL MADRID WIN AGAINST REAL SOCIEDAD  / AL-NASSR WIN AGAINST AL FATEH - 1.81 ODDS / -***123 ODDS FOR AMERICAN MARKET***

\- For Real Madrid CF, the match is definitely tougher than the bookmakers suggest, but LOS BLANCOS are fully focused and locked in for this challenge.  
\- Santiago Bernabeu Stadium is an exceptionally tough stadium, and Real Sociedad should be pinned back in their own half for most of the match.  
\- Vinicius Junior and Kylian Mbappe are looking incredibly sharp, despite the early challenges at the start of the season. When they’re fully locked in, it’s game over.

  
\- Even though Al Fateh SC have pulled off some surprises this season — including a draw against Al Ittihad Club - this feels like the moment for things to return to normal. Al-Nassr FC have more quality, more experience, and far greater attacking firepower. If they impose their tempo from the start, this one should be over before full time.    - Al-Nassr will likely try to control possession and press high as usual, using their offensive firepower to unlock Al Fateh’s defense. If Ronaldo and his teammates are sharp, Al-Nassr should close this fast, but the most important to close it until the final whistle.  
\- Al Nassr&#x27;s winning streak says a lot, LET&#x27;S LOCK THIS IN .

GOOD LUCK &amp; LET&#x27;S GET IT.

Last Pick: NCAAM - Boston University @ Army 1H points 65.5 ended up 69 at the half. ✅

Write Up:  classic big game - Virginia is on a 5-0 run, and Ohio State is on the bubble for the tournament.

KenPom ranks both teams in the top 30 in adjusted offensive efficiency, which supports scoring even when possessions are slightly compressed.  Looking at Virginia’s KenPom profile before and after Ryan Odom is night and day.

Adjusted offensive efficiency: OSU 22nd; UVA 30th. Adjusted defense: OSU 81st; UVA 17th

Both teams score about 82 ppg full game, and recent first-half splits point to a high-scoring early environment.  Among <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>’s games, the model puts this one in the 90th percentile for blended first-half pace. 

Risks: Virginia’s recent 61–58 road win against FSU shows they can still play defensive grind especially against a slow opponent. It was also one of their few recent games well below their average. Brandon Noel is out, which could reduce OSU’s interior scoring and second-chance points.</td></tr>

**Event:** NCAAB // 20 Clemson @ 4 Duke 12:00 pm EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Clemson +13.5 

**Odds // Units:** BetMGM (-105) 2u

**Write-up:** Are we really giving Clemson 13.5?? A team that is 2/2 with 1 push ATS vs ranked opponents. Clemson in the last two seasons has stayed within 13.5 points in 59/59 of their games….in ACC road games, they are 17/17. Hell, they even beat Duke last time they played. Dating back to last season, Clemson has won 14 straight road games. That is the longest active streak in the country,….but I don’t think they win here. It is never easy playing in Cameron Stadium, where the Devils remain undefeated.

This game is going to be a war. Two of the best teams in the ACC, and both rank top 10 in defense. Clemson ranks 21st in points per possession allowed, whereas Duke ranks 238th in possessions per game. Duke has been mediocre on the three this year, ranking 173rd in 3-point shooting % - Clemson ranks 36th in opponent 3-point shooting %. The strength of Duke&#x27;s offense is inside the perimeter, ranking 4th in 2-point shooting %. However, Clemson ranks 14th in defending 2-point shots away from home. The Devils also have a slight turnover problem, while the Tigers take care of the ball.

This Clemson team is built to make elite teams uncomfortable. Everybody from Clemson can get buckets. I’m talking a consistent 10 points. It is hard for coaches to have a defensive game plan, since nobody is “that guy”. This team excels in set plays. They are not flashy - they are methodical. Clemson likes to get back and set up their half-court sets on defense. They make you work for every possession, every point. They value execution, pressure, controlling tempo, and defensive rebounding. In this type of matchup, there is no need to overthink it. Duke should win this game, but Clemson&#x27;s style of play is going to force drawn-out possessions, where buckets will come at a premium. This game is going to be ugly, but I don’t think Clemson is going to be intimidated in this spot. Get ready for a classic ACC-style game that will be gritty and physical. GL

Match: Werder Bremen v Bayern Munich &amp; Al Fateh v Al Nassr

Time: 15:30 &amp; 18:30 CET

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Bayern ML + Al Nassr ML (1.62)

Reasoning: 

Bayern Munich remain one of the most consistent home and away performers in the Bundesliga. They average strong goal output, apply constant pressure through wide play and quick transitions, and generally overpower mid-table opposition. Bayern’s depth allows them to maintain intensity for 90 minutes, and historically they handle these types of fixtures with authority. When they click offensively, they’re very difficult to stop — making them one of the stronger favorites on the board. They are only 3 points ahead of Dortmund now, so there is no time to mess around. 

Al Nassr come into this matchup with clear attacking superiority and far more individual quality across the pitch. They typically dominate possession in domestic games and create a high volume of chances, especially against sides outside the top tier. With their firepower up front and overall squad depth, they rarely drop points in fixtures where they’re the stronger side on paper. If they control tempo early, this is the type of game they usually grind out professionally.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>: Leverkusen vs St. Pauli. **First half result 2-0** at **7,5** odds

Explanation: &quot;I&#x27;m tired of losing, boss&quot;. Had some ugly losses recently and we want to break this trend now. Going for this reasonable bet, but only 2-0 first half this time around as it sounds more logical. 3-0 is way out of my head and 1-0 pays too little to even bother. Leverkusen is a lot better than their opponents and aiming for the Champions League spot by trying to be top 4 here. St. Pauli is fighting relegation as things stand right now. They need a lot to stay in this league and I have a hard time seeing them keeping alive, as this division is too ruthless compared to 2. Bundesliga (second division).

On the side note: My tactics won’t change by lowering the odds. The goal is to find high odds to play here. I’m trying to keep track of the results in all of the top leagues. We will **always aim for** **long term** gains here and make sure to manage your bankroll. I will try to post another <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> in the coming days.

Unit:+11.80

Last: Charlton vs. Qpr gg@1.93❌

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>: Southampton vs. Leicester 1@1.76

Southampton made a dream comeback on Tuesday night at the King Power, where they celebrated their victory (3-4) of the season so far mainly due to the development of the match. Leicester took the lead in the 9th minute, just four minutes later (13&#x27;) they doubled their lead, while in the 29th minute it became 3-0. Southampton threatened during this period but failed to score. The second half started with a triple change for the &quot;Saints&quot; who took the ball and showed a desire to dominate. Stewart, who came on as a substitute, reduced the deficit in the 62nd minute, Stephens scored in the 83rd minute, Manning, who came on as a substitute, equalized in the 87th minute and Charles, who also came on as a substitute, completed the turnaround in the 90+6th minute.

&quot;We have to enjoy what we have achieved. The season is so long and you don&#x27;t have many nights like this. We will be well prepared to play a different first half and continue the second half like we did on Tuesday,&quot; said Eckert in his statements, who with his changes played a huge role in the turnaround. In the Championship they are in 9th place, just -1 from 6th place Wrexham and look ready to take the fight to the end. They have won four of their last five (4-1-0), while in the previous round of the cup they beat Doncaster 2-3 away from home.

Last Tuesday, the two teams gave us the best game of the Championship season so far. The closing stages of the match found Southampton attacking and finding a victory capable of boosting their morale even more. Leicester&#x27;s image is problematic, with many gaps and the cup, compared to the battle for relegation, garnering less interest.

Last Pick: NK Slaven Belupo-NK Lokomotiva BTTS &amp; Dortmund/draw @ 2.05 ❌



Last Pick Write Up: Lokomotiva was just bad and didn&#x27;t score. I don&#x27;t regret the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, remember, we are gambling, just invest into bonds if you want something safe. After two different 5+ win streaks, we&#x27;re having a bit of a rough patch with 1W3L in my last 4 picks. That doesn&#x27;t mean we stop, we keep going with picks we like.



Now for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>..



<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Zurich-Luzern BTTS&amp;O2.5 @ 1.75



Write Up: Even though our last Switzerland BTTS&amp;O2.5 didn&#x27;t hit, I&#x27;m going to keep going because I usually make a good profit with Switzerland overs.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>, Zurich is hosting Luzern. Some stats:

Zurich at home has scored 22 and conceded 23 goals in 12 games. O2.5 has hit in last 6/7 Zurich matches and BTTS has hit in last 5/7. 

Luzern away has scored 18 and conceded 19 in 12 games. O2.5 has hit in last 8/10 and BTTS has hit in last 7/8. 

BTTS has hit in their last 5/5 H2H and their four H2H matches in 2025 went 3-2, 1-1, 3-2, 3-1. Both matches where Zurich was at home went 3-2. 

Let&#x27;s get back on track - and for extras:

**Safety angle:** you can get just O2.5 at 1.53. I&#x27;m adding a unit on that (plus a unit of course on my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>).

**Degen angle:** I&#x27;m going to do a few degen small-stake side bets. 0.25 units on O3.5 at 2.3 and 0.25 O4.5 at 3.96. 0.25 units for BTTS + O2.5 + U11.5 corners at 2.4, and 0.25 units for Luzern/draw + BTTS + O.25 + U11.5 corners + O 0.5 1h goals corners at 3.9. I won&#x27;t ask you to tail any of the degen angles.

Matchup: Navy at Towson
Time: 12:00 PM ET
<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Towson ML (-160)
Units: 3U 

Long time viewer of this sub and finally decided to start posting. I played D1 lacrosse so I&#x27;m going to stick strictly to that since it&#x27;s a niche market where you can sometimes find a slight edge on the books.

I sat out the first two weeks because I wanted to see how the new rosters actually look on the field before putting money down. I&#x27;m going to keep my write ups short. My picks usually come down to personnel turnover, conference match ups, and venue.

For the first <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> I&#x27;m going Towson -160 for 3 units (I usually roll 1-5 scale).

Reasoning is pretty simple. Navy lost a ton of their core starters from last year. Towson is coming off a really close loss to Hopkins where they actually looked like the better team for most of the game. Their offense is built to hammer the cage and they&#x27;re playing at home where they&#x27;ve historically been way better. I expect them to bounce back big <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> and outclass Navy&#x27;s defense.

Good luck if you&#x27;re tailing and let’s see if we can get something going here.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>: Switzerland | Swiss Super League | 12pm Eastern | St. Gallen vs Graashoppers | St. Gallen to win + O 1.5 goals | 3U @ -115

St. Gallen have been one of the more reliable attacking teams at home. They consistently average around 1.7–2.0 goals per game in league play, and a large majority of their matches clear the 1.5 goal mark. In fact, over 80% of their recent league games have gone over 1.5 total goals. That alone covers half the bet in most scenarios, because even a 2–0 or 2–1 type of win gets it done.

Grasshoppers, on the other hand, have struggled defensively away from home. They tend to concede more than a goal per match on the road, and their away games regularly see multiple goals. Even when they lose, it’s often by scorelines like 2–1 or 3–1, which still cash the over 1.5 portion comfortably. Defensively, they’ve had trouble containing higher-tempo sides, and St. Gallen play with that kind of attacking intensity.

Head-to-head trends also support this angle. Recent meetings between these two have frequently produced at least two goals, and St. Gallen have had strong results in this matchup, including multi-goal wins. The 1.5 total is a relatively low bar, and given both teams’ scoring and conceding patterns, it’s statistically likely to be cleared.

When you combine St. Gallen’s stronger form, better home performances, and higher goal output with Grasshoppers’ defensive inconsistency away, the probability leans toward a home win in a game that sees at least two total goals. Something like 2–0 or 2–1 feels like the most realistic outcome based on the data.

**Form:** LWWWWWWWWLLWWW

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: NBL (Phoenix v Jackjumpers) Majok Deng under 15.5 points 4u** $1.86 (Sportsbet) 8:00PM AEDT

* Simply too high for a guy that is now 4th option on offense behind Bannan, Johnson and probably Marshall now as well.
* He&#x27;s now in the center position given Magnay&#x27;s injury. Over the last 10 games, only 4 bigs have eclipsed this mark against the Phoenix and they all play in the post - Cooks, Froling, JLA, Mennenga. One look at that list and you can tell they have very different games to Deng who is more of a spot up shooter than an off the dribble player. Soares is the best comparison and he&#x27;s gone 6 and 9 the last 2 games against the Phoenix.
* Deng scores 30% of his points from behind the arc. The Phoenix dont allow a lot of 3PA to opposing big men and cover well when they do. Soares got up 1 attempt last game. Mennenga got up 1 attempt. Rob Loe got 4 attempts but only hit 1. Deng is going to have to be very effective from the field to cover this.
* Deng has cleared this line against the Phoenix 2/3 games this year but they were very different Jackjumpers lineups. With Hamilton and Magnay out, the spacing won&#x27;t be there and help coverage isnt required for Bannan if John Brown or Malique Lewis are guarding him.
* He also had a lot of FT attempts in those games - 8 per game. The Phoenix gave up 30 FTA per game those 2 games. Their opponents average 27 on the season and over the last 5 games this has regressed to 24. They&#x27;ve cleaned up the defense and this should be emphasised <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> with their coach coming out and saying:

*&quot;If you want to win a championship, it has to be at the defensive end and when we get stops and get out and run, we can beat anyone, but our defence has to be a focal point.&quot;*

Another cash! Let’s keep them coming!

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: Purdue vs Iowa/ Iowa +3 (-130) 2u

Write up: To keep it concise, Purdue has been incredibly streaky recently. They’re coming off a good win but even that ended up being very ugly. These last few weeks have been mean to them and Iowa is in an amazing spot here. Moving forward this game could put them in an incredible spot for March. And remember we don’t need a win, we just need a cover. Purdue is 2-8 in their last ten against the spread and yet 80+% of the money is on them.. Purdue’s struggled to find offense in a number of these past games and that’s a nightmare on the road. Especially when the opposing team has a battle tested veteran guard on the level of Bennett Stirtz. I just flat out don’t see Purdue blowing the top off this game unless they go ballistic from the 3 point line (knock on wood) so we’re gonna bet our money Iowa can lose by less than 3 points tomorrow. Let me know if you’re tailing! Thanks fellas and have a good Saturday

<tr><td class='post'>Record: 2-1-1 (+1.54 U)

Yesterday&#x27;s play: East Carolina ML &amp; UNC ML (College baseball) parlay

UNC took take of business and ECU had the bases loaded in the bottom of the ninth and couldn’t score. It is what it is. 

Play of the Day:  Kentucky vs Florida over 153.5 (-110 FD) 1U

I like the over 153.5 in this matchup because the tempo and scoring profiles both point toward a high total. It’s not necessarily that either Kentucky or Florida plays bad defense, but both teams give up a lot of points largely because of how fast they play and how many possessions they create. The pace leads to more shots, more transition opportunities, and naturally higher scores on both ends. With each team averaging over 80 points per game, the baseline projection already flirts with this number. If this turns into the up-and-down game it projects to be, 153 is very attainable.

Good luck to anyone tailing!</td></tr>

Gonna go with a plus-odds <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> again. Slafkovsky is clearly the go-to player on the Slovak team. He leads the team with 4 points and among forwards in TOI in the first 2 games. Slafkovsky was also the leading point-getter in the 2022 Olympics.

Slovakia is going up against a Swedish team that gave up 2 to an Italian team expected to finish last, then 4 to a Finnish team that gave up 4 themselves to Slovakia. The team total for Slovakia is at 1.5. I can think they can score at least 2. It would be hard to imagine Slovaks having any offense outside the top two lines.

Note: Don&#x27;t play this on DK. Terrible odds. If you don&#x27;t play on BetRivers, I&#x27;d go as low as -110.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Scotland vs **England -5.5 + Cardiff ML** vs Luton **(4u)** 

**Odds:** \+190

**Write Up:** A little bit sweaty on the Milan game but won comfortably in the end, Dortmund put 4 past Mainz to clear the second <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. Appreciate anyone who tailed - once again apologies about the late post.

First up we have a fixture in the Six Nations rugby, we travel to Scotland where they host England at Murrayfield. My <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> of -5.5 handicap for England comes from, despite their poor recent form in Edinburgh, England are coming off the back of a 48-7 win against Wales whilst Scotland enter off a 15-18 loss to Italy. Whilst these score lines are not indicative of the result watching both I do believe England posses better form (currently winning 13 fixtures in a row), better depth and kicking control which is pivotal in these kind of matchups. Scotland were weak in their lineouts and even with practice I do think England&#x27;s quality in this area will give them problems a plenty just as Italy did; to slow down England&#x27;s attack they need to neuter their offensive power, especially forwards, which will be difficult for the Scots. It must be said that Scotland have won 5/8 encounters with one draw, 3 of which are coming from Murrayfield - international fixtures in autumn tend to prove better results for this England team oddly enough. Simply put it will come down to depth and form, both of which England have an advantage. Original line is -8.5 but I have bought it down a little bit for a buffer, safe <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> for me would be the ML.

Secondly, we go to League One where Luton are winless in their last 6 away games going 0/1/5 (total record of 4-2-8), with the hosts Cardiff going 12-1-2(W/D/L) from 15 home games. Cardiff are unbeaten in 10, sitting nicely in 1st in the league and Luton sit 7th - but home/away forms are currently very important. The bluebirds only posses 2 points more than 2nd place Lincoln so they will be wanting to take all 3 away from this fixture. The reverse fixture ended in a win for Cardiff on the road, no overthinking here I reckon they take all 3 much important points from a poor travelling Luton side.

I’ll keep riding the Houston under, especially at 148.5. Season is coming to an end so I think the intensity picks up for them as well. Houston defends the 3 fairly well so if they can keep KSU under 10 made we have a fair chance. KSU scores in the mid 60s if that happens.</td></tr>

* **Odds:** 1.77 
* **Unit Stake:** 3 Units

Recap: Easy win; let&#x27;s keep the streak going 

Write up: We are moving into the best of 5 semifinals. Just like my last pick, this line depends on the match being a competitive series rather than a sweep. However, the data for **Liquid vs. OG** is even more aggressive than the previous matchups. In their last four competitive maps, these two teams have averaged **52.5 kills per map**. Their Bo1 during the group stage of this tournament on February 3rd was a bloodbath, ending with **56 total kills** in just 38 minutes.

To hit **Over 186.5**, at their current average of **\~52 kills/map**, they only need the series to go **4 maps** (4 x 52 = 208) to clear this comfortably. If OG continues their giant-slaying form—they already beat Liquid 1-0 this tournament—it is highly unlikely Liquid finishes this in a 3-0 sweep. So we&#x27;re basically betting OVER 3.5 maps again but with better value

**Reasoning:** High historical kill average (52.5/map) + high probability of at least 4 maps + OG’s aggressive tournament form.

Update: Unlucky, if OG made the comeback on Map 3… :( 

Parlay option:  Team Liquid vs. OG  OVER 186.5 total kills + Navi vs Yandex (Player Watson over 4.5 kills map 1)  (@2.50)</td></tr>

Last pick – N/A (First post)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the day</mark> – Marin Čilić ML vs Taylor Fritz ATP Dallas +142

Čilić comes into this one playing really clean tennis and has been rolling through the draw in straight sets, including a solid win over Learner Tien. He’s holding serve comfortably and shortening points, which is ideal on fast indoor courts in Dallas.

Fritz is favored, and I would say take a slight edge on a fast surface with his serving, but he’s had more court time during the tournament and had an elbow injury come up during his match in the quarterfinals that he may have to deal with.

Fritz mentioned after his last match that he felt “really sharp pain” in his elbow and needed treatment plus painkillers to finish. Even if that only limits him 10–15%, that’s significant in a serve-dominant matchup like this. A slight dip in serve velocity or forehand pop could be the difference in one tight set or breaker.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** West Ham -1.5 (+105)   1 unit to win 1.05 units

**Write Up:** Back in the win column yesterday as Chelsea played almost exactly as expected. A bit of a slow start, 1 goal in the first half, and two quick goals after halftime to cash us hype the 60th minute. They ended with 4 goals, really should have been 6 or 7 with some of the chances they missed. We went 4-1 during the week, lets see if we can carry some momentum into the weekend.

Happy Valentine&#x27;s Day for those who celebrate, here&#x27;s a too late reminder to go buy some flowers and chocolate. <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> we&#x27;ve got another FA Cup match, this time as League One side Burton host Premier League side West Ham. As confusing as it is, League One is actually the 3rd tier division in English Soccer. Burton, is ranked 21st in that division, meaning there are 47 teams in the hierarchy between West Ham (18th in EPL) and Burton. That&#x27;s a huge talent gap in soccer. Burton are both bottom 5 defensively and offensively in League One, and are winless in their last 5 matches. 

I get it, for those who follow the EPL, you&#x27;ll note that West Ham is bad and be cautious to back them. They&#x27;re neck deep in a relegation battle. However, they have won 3 of their last 5 and seem to have turned a corner the last few weeks. The team is clicking, and they&#x27;ll see this match as a chance to continue to build momentum and maybe have a chance to make a deep cup run. They&#x27;ve brought in some attacking players during the January window and have genuinely looked good the last few matches (going up 2-0 away at Chelsea). So I really like the odds here given the talent gap on paper and form of both teams. Lets hope West Ham show up.

Firstly BASSETT BABE, this horse put up a 6 length win on debut and posted a massive WFA rating. The number it put up is simply rare air for such a young horse, and we could be witnessing one right out of the box here. Draws perfect in barrier 4 and we’re down on 52.5kg after the claim.

Bombproof horse with tactile versatility, and with the best jock aboard I can’t poke any holes. We lob perfectly outside lead, or a pair back, and we win worry free.

**Event:** LaLiga, Real Madrid v Real Sociedad, 3:00 pm EST

**Write Up:** It seems like I&#x27;ve finally managed to tame Barcelona a bit (kinda), but my ambitions are loftier. I&#x27;m coming for the other Clasico side, Real Madrid. They&#x27;re matched up against Real Sociedad, who, in case you forgot, **actually beat Barcelona earlier in the season.** How poetic would it be if they could get one over Real Madrid too? They certainly **have the squad to do it.** Not only that, but they&#x27;re coming into this matchup in great form, remaining **unbeaten in the last 11 games, a run that includes 8 wins** in that span.

Real Madrid are still very much finding their feet after a turbulent beginning to 2026, and I think they&#x27;re definitely there for the taking. I absolutely love these odds as they&#x27;re in the absolute upper limit of what&#x27;s allowed in these threads, but after that Barca shocker, my confidence is sky high so yes, I&#x27;m putting down three whole units on a +200 odd play. I just see terrific value in these odds. Not expecting a high scoring game, so something like Under 2.5 goals sounds reasonable too, if you want to go down that route. Expecting a big game from Oyarzabal, who loves turning up against Barcelona and Real Madrid specifically. For those of you who are wondering about the fade, you can go with something like a Real Madrid -1.0 Asian Handicap or even a Real Madrid -1.0, -1.5 Asian Handicap for some decent odds (I think the Madrid divas are getting clapped though).

* FUT are 89% winrate on 18 maps of Mirage in the L3 months, they are on a rampage run, I would argue maybe the best Mirage team in the world strategically, they have been running Mirage as their home map forever. They first <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> this map in 70% of their games and for good reason. FUT dominance on Mirage as mentioned is not new, they went 51-20 on this map in 2025, an insane run of form
* Aurora are 29% winrate on 7 maps of Mirage in the L3 months, they have heavily struggled on this map, this is their only map in the pool currently they are &lt;50% winrate on.
* FUT are on a 10 map winstreak on Mirage, and while for a while they were mostly farming tier two teams, recently they have been dominating tier one teams on the map as well. They have beaten Astralis, G2, FURIA, as well as some strong tier two teams on the map like OG, EYEBALLERS and BetBoom.
* FUT are extremely well rounded on this map, they win 64% of pistol rounds, they average a 73.3% winrate on CT side/defense, and a 53.4% winrate on offense as well. In the last month despite a drop in pistol round win % down to 40%, they are 5-0 in this time including the win against FURIA where they won 13-11 despite losing both pistol rounds
* Aurora struggles really started for them in October and to close out the year but a lot of their Mirage maps back then were still close, but in 2026 these struggles have been much worse then previous, they are not just losing Mirage but getting dominated by teams, they lost to FURIA 13-4, Falcons 13-10, PARIVISION 13-5, GamerLegion 13-5 in 2026 so far which is when they picked up Soulfly.
* Aurora are 20% winrate in their last 5 mirage games, they have lost them by a total score of 59-37 winning just 39% of rounds overall. They have really struggled on CT side recently generating only 40.3% of rounds on this side in the new year, despite a 50% winrate on pistol rounds, their offense has always been shaky on Mirage going back 6 months, they average 42.1% winrate on T side over a 24 round sample, but in the past were able to win close maps due to their strong CT sides and often sneak win close maps, without good CT sides, they will never stand a chance against strong Mirage teams in my opinion

**Football | Turkish Super League | 20:00 UTC+3**

**Match:** Trabzonspor vs Fenerbahce

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** BTTS Yes &amp; Over 2.5 Goals

**Write Up:** Actually, my main prediction was on yellow cards, but I noticed that most sites don&#x27;t offer this option for this match, so I had to change my prediction.

In Trabzonspor&#x27;s last 8 matches, 7 ended over 2.5 goals, and in 6 of them both teams scored. Similarly, in Fenerbahçe&#x27;s last 5 matches, both teams scored in 4.

Looking at the H2H (head-to-head), a similar situation applies: In the last 6 matches, 5 featured both over 2.5 goals and both teams scoring (BTTS).

Btw that was good to start with a win to that series ❤️</td></tr>

Write Up: Time to make it 3 in a row. <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> we’re going with Germany v Latvia. This game should be fairly competitive but I think Germany has the edge. Lead by Leon Draisaitl and Tim Stutzle who combined scored all 3 goals in Germanys game against Denmark. Draisaitl who is one of the best in the NHL has recorded 80 points in his 55 games played this NHL season. Latvia lost to the states 5-1 in their last game. This’ll probably be a sweaty <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> but it should hit!

Time: 9:00 AM EST

​<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: OG ML @ 2.05 odds (5u)

​Write Up:

Team Liquid plays a very structured, high-tempo game. They want to win lanes, group up, and suffocate you with perfect efficiency. They are the best &quot;front-runners&quot; in Dota.

But, this new OG roster is pure SEA chaos. They don&#x27;t respect structure. They constantly force bad fights that turn into chaotic trades.

​Liquid historically struggles when they can&#x27;t play perfect Dota. When the game becomes a scramble, they hesitate. OG thrives in the scramble. We are betting on OG to turn the game into a bloodbath and force Liquid out of their comfort zone.

​BOL.

Slovakia over 1.5 total goals (-120)

A must win for both teams. Slovakia to secure their quarterfinal and top spot in the group and Sweden to try to at least qualify for the next round. Although Sweden has more firepower than Slovakia, they have not played to expectations and I don&#x27;t see them getting that much better on a back-to-back. They give up some great chances and they allowed 4 goals against Finland and 2 goals vs Italy with zero NHL players. Slovakia meanwhile has played really well in this tournament by beating that same Finland team that beat Sweden 4-1 and beating Italy 3-2. They should be able to at least score 2 goals against a fragile Sweden team.

BOL!

Stuttgart vs Cologne, Over 3.5 Goals @ 2.08

Over 3.5 goals is a strong play in this clash. Stuttgart are aggressive going forward and usually create plenty of clear chances at home. Köln’s defensive record on the road is often shaky, and when they concede, the game tends to open up. Both teams are capable of scoring, which increases the pace and intensity. A 3-2 or 4-0 result would not be surprising here.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the day</mark> - Werder Bremen V Bayern Munich. Bayern Munich ML &amp; over 2.5 goals @ 1.57

16th place Werder Bremen host league leaders Bayern. With Borussia Dortmund winning already this match week and closing the gap between 1st and 2nd to 3 points I&#x27;m hoping for a motivated Bayern outfit to come out and secure 3 points.

They are scoring plenty so I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they covered this goal line by themselves although I expect Werder Bremen to score which could help also.

The only absentee from BM is Olise but I expect the difference in class to be on show here.</td></tr>

**Write Up**:

FC Tokyo was actually very good against last year&#x27;s league winners Kashima Antlers and should maybe have won the game in regular play instead of on penalties. Urawa Reds beat regional rivals JEF United 2-0 away, but how the fuck that game didn’t AT LEAST see a third humanity will never now, just how the fuck didn’t the ball go in one more time! The chances both teams had!  

Both meetings in the league last season ended with 3-2 wins for the host. The teams also faced each other in the Emperor Cup where FC Tokyo knocked Urawa out with a 2-1 win at home, but Urawa was the better team in that game and should at least taken the game to extra time. 

The bookies are not really feeling this game that strongly and while neither side saw three goals in their opening match, if they come into this game that they did in those opening games this should have no problem seeing 3-4 or even more goals.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: South Africa Vs New Zealand Total Extras Over 17.5 @1.83 . Units: 4U


Write Up: Hi Friends, I thought id share my knowledge in the hopes of all of you benefiting from it too. I am new here but find the insights very interesting (especially from jaysial) and sharing is caring.

Stating of with a high confidence wager in 
SA vs NZ for extras (b,lbs,wides,nb - for the non cricket players) to hit over 17.5. Multiple reasons for the conviction as below.

1. Match is played in Ahmedabad , the pitch is extremely flat meaning bowlers need to alter the lengths significantly and be more aggressive and hence prone to mistakes.

2. SA bowling attack is notoriously wayward in bowling , past 2 matches they have given away 11 &amp; 12 wides respectively. Not to mention 2 no balls in each innings as well. New Zealand are also susceptible bowling 7 &amp; 9 wides in their last 2 games.

3. This is a highly competitive game and a high scoring one resulting in the full over quotas being close to completion.

4. The conditions - The match is played at night in India where dew will come into play, the balls will slip out of the hands easier for the team bowling second increasing the number of errors. Also, weather is clear so the innings won’t be truncated.

Hope to be off to a good start and best of luck!</td></tr>

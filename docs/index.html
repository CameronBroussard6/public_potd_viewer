Reasoning: Deni has been balling this year. Top candidate for most improved, however anyone who has watched the Blazers last year saw this coming. He’s gone over this line 10/14 games they’ve played in November. His avg. this year is 25.8. Playing the wizards at home on the second night of a back to back for them I see Avdija clearing this line. Blazers are rested and The Wizards had a tough fought game last night against the Bucks and got the win. Let’s hope this one goes as well as the last 3!!!!</td></tr>

<tr><td class='post'>**POTD Record:**  97 – 63 - 9

**Previous:**  Coventry City -1 AH vs Charlton Athletic – WINNING!

**Recap:**  Coventry City remains formidable at home and still 10 points clear at top of the league.  Doubtful we don’t see them next year in the Premier.

**New Event:**  Premier League – Newcastle vs Tottenham &amp; Fulham vs Manchester City

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:**  Newcastle Draw-no-bet &amp; Manchester City Draw-no-bet @ 1.80 (Usual 3 units)

Full disclosure here… I am gunning for the 100^(th) win.  In doing so, I’, trying to have some safer bets just like <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>’s.  However, I will disclose some information to let everyone choose their bet flavor based on risk tolerance for higher payouts.

**Leg 1:**  Newcastle Win/Draw (Draw-no-bet) vs Tottenham

Newcastle are coming off a huge road win this weekend vs Everton by a convincing 4-1.  The team shows continued cohesiveness and momentum especially at home where their record is quite formidable even against strong opposition..

* Newcastle have 13 wins in their last 18 home games.
* Last 6 matches Newcastle has scored 14 goals when playing at home at St James Park.
* Newcastle’s last home loss was vs league leaders Arsenal by 2-1.  Since that loss, they have beat Forest 2-0, Benfica (UCL) 3-0, Fulham 2-1, Tottenham 2-0 (EFL Cup), Athletic Club (UCL) 2-0 and most recently Manchester City 2-1.
* Newcastle have won their last 3 meetings vs Tottenham.
* Tottenham are in shambles with just 1 win in their last 6 matches with 3 straight defeats allowing 11 goals.
* Tottenham manager Thomas Frank, is under huge pressure and the fans don’t like him, the players aren’t performing for him, and there are rumors he is losing the locker room quickly.
* Tottenham have many significant injuries as well.

A Newcastle DNB, win or even -1 at plus money odds on the Asian Handicap is not out of the question.

**Leg 2:**  Manchester City Win/Draw (Draw-no-bet) vs Fulham

History suggest City tend to play very well against Fulham both home and away.  In the last 24 head-to-head matches, City has scored at least 2 goals in 23 of those matches.

Haaland has scored 6 goals in the last 6 matches vs Fulham.

Manchester City is the chalky play here but given their squad and talent with the best manager at their helm, it is hard to fade them in this spot against a Fulham Side that is simply trying to stay out of the relegation zone.

Some of City’s players, mainly Foden, are showcasing themselves to secure a spot on England’s starting 11 ahead of the World Cup.  His 2 goal performance this weekend was a step in the right direction but I expect more of the same <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.   

City to win outright and/or to score over 1.5 goals is not unreasonable either.</td></tr>

-everything is bet to win unit amount-

Write up: I got this last night at notre dame -115 but this is a clear sharp square divide. Opened at Missouri -1.5. Public hit Missouri but we’ve seen this flip completely to the other side. Yes Missouri is 8-0 but dig deeper you will find they have had the 2nd easiest schedule in all of division 1 basketball. They have played 7 home games except a lone trip on the road to Howard to open the year (Big deal!) this notre dame team has some real talent and they hung in there with some legit contenders away from home in Vegas and losing by 1 up in Columbus is nothing to scoff about. They’ve been battle tested and although Missouri has been lights out this year I think that is more about the soft schedule they’ve had and I believe they are due for some likely regression here against a much better notre dame defense and Missouri’s first true road test after playing essentially 7 home games against weak competition. Let’s get back on the board. As always, cheers 🍻</td></tr>

Write up:

I feel like I need to be super confident with every <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> i post here from here on because of the recent hooks which is why I havent posted daily. The reason is so that I can maintain my healthy record but obviously variance exists but the whole keeping a good record thing is just for fun and prestige but in reality I place a lot of picks every day as long as I see EV and around 30% of my picks come from this sub specifically.

Derik Queen is 2/17 from the 3-pt line this season which is insane but even more insane is that the books are even offering it (might dip from time i post) for this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> which is even more insane. Queen just isn&#x27;t a floor spacer YET and I don&#x27;t even think he will attempt one which he hasnt the last 2 games. Yes I think he will play for around 28 mins but the odds are just too good to pass up here.

Anthony Edwards has hit this line in his last 5 in a row going over 30 in all of em and going over 40 thrice adn I don&#x27;t see him stopping right here. Pelicans allow the 2nd most pts to shooting guards so honestly i expect a 35 piece from ant here and even if its a blowout, Ant should still hit this. I mainly picked this as a booster to the Queen <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> but still good odds compared to the peformance recently from edwards relative to the matchup

Write Up: Its a short week &amp; December is going to be packed with matches. Ideally, would like to go with a City with -1.5, but their weekend performance doesnt give me confidence &amp; it being such a short period between the matches. So going to the goals market. City have scored in atleast 8/10 previous matches. While Fulham scoring may look a little difficult, they have performed reasonably well at home, scoring atleast a goal in 7/8 previous games (the only one they didnt score was against Arsenal, who look dominating for this stretch of the season). 

Hope we turn around &amp; BoL

Man City has beat Fulham 18 straight times, the last draw came in the 2011-2012 season. Overall, I know the odds are juiced because the game is being played in Fulham&#x27;s home grounds; but still, odds are ridiculous. 

City is in the fight for the EPL (surprisingly) and they don&#x27;t want Arsenal to keep chipping away. Squad is just overall better, and model makes this line closer to 1.40 (-255). 

BOL. As always, full transparency.

These played in the middle of October, Monaco won 99-94. They are to meet, probably at least 5-6 more times this season, so this game, at this point in the season, I don&#x27;t see it as some really important, big stakes, let&#x27;s tighten up our defense and slow down the tempo.

I see it more as a shooting training for both teams, before the real battles begin.</td></tr>

Last Pick: Aston Villa ML + o1.5 goals in Brighton vs Forest (-110) **Kaching!**

Recap: Wolves are showing more life but unlucky once again. The fade continues and we win on it once more. Screamer from Villa and game ends 1-0. Second game Brighton nicked their second goal near the end when Forest really looked the more likely to score. Good reads. We move.

Event: Atletico Madrid at Barcelona (LaLiga) 3:00pm EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: o2.5 Goals + BTTS (-150)

Read: Barcelona have been all over the place defensively but are still the highest scoring team in the league and sitting on top of the table. On the other hand, Atletico have only lost one La Liga game all year. Which they lost back on Matchday 1. Personally, I lean Barcelona to win here, but I can’t help but think Simone and Atletico show up to fight in a big game against the league leaders.

What I am seeing on the Barcelona side is positive. Seven wins in seven home games in La liga. Starboy Pedri will be likely to start after getting some minutes at the weekend for the first time back since el classico. Raphina will start only his second game since coming back from injury. He got an assist in his first start back on the weekend also. This makes me comfortable trusting the attack from Barca. Which is very important even for a team at this caliber when facing a team like Atletico who love to defend. We also will likely need Barca to score two.

Deigo Simone is the founder of Haram Football. He will not make it easy. Barca will still break through. I imagine scoring multiple goals. At this point I would typically take Barca to win (still probably will) but I just can’t fade this sneaky hot hand. As haram as they can be, Atletico have scored in every game this season apart from away at Arsenal in the UCL. Combine that with Barca’s defensive struggles and I don’t see Barca stopping Atletico from getting at least one. From sheer desire. It just feels like they will not go down without a fight.  

Hoping for a shootout. Let’s see it. 

BOL.

NBA | Spurs vs. Grizzlies  
**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Keldon Johnson Over 19.5 P+R @ 1.85 (-118) | 1 Unit**

I like Keldon Johnson point and rebounds. The Spurs are without Victor Wembanyama and Stephon Castle — their two biggest usage guys. That’s a huge amount of scoring, rebounding, and on-ball responsibility suddenly up for grabs, and Keldon is one of the first players who steps right into that void.

When both Wemby and Castle sit, Johnson has a 100% hit rate on this exact P+R line. Every time he’s been put in this expanded role, he’s delivered. He’s also quietly been rebounding really well off the bench. That gives him two clean paths to the over: volume scoring and effort on the glass. Add in that this matchup with Memphis is usually fast and high-scoring, and the opportunities only increase. He already put up 18 points and 7 rebounds against them earlier this season.

With the Spurs lineup still thin, and a friendly pace, he should be heavily involved from start to finish,so i think he should get this done.

**🏀 Jalen Brunson o2.5 Threes -115** vs the Boston Celtics

Brunson&#x27;s role has changed since last season with Thibs. He&#x27;s putting up an average of 7.5 Three attempts this season up from 6.1 last season.

Dominant against the Celtics. Cashed in L8/10 in their matchups, including 3 against them at the start of the season.

Celtics have terrible 3FG defense. They rank 13th in Opponent FG% but 27th in Opponent 3FG%. In particular, vs PGs, they allow 3rd MOST Threes.

Brunson&#x27;s cashed in L3/5 and L6/10 but he&#x27;s still averaging 7+ attempts in those timespans. Given Celtics weaker 3FG defense and Brunson&#x27;s matchup history, expecting Brunson to cash for us here.

Ottawa Senators vs Montreal Canadiens (NHL/Hockey) at 7pm EST

Cole Caufield over 0.5 points (-190) 

Write up:
Going back to Caufield since he&#x27;s been on fire getting points in 7 games in a row. In these past games he seems to want to prove to Bill Guerin that he belongs on team USA for the Olympics even though his chances are slim (Guerin doesn&#x27;t like small players). Hence why I believe he&#x27;s trying even harder nowadays to force his hand.

Reason why i&#x27;m confident with this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> is because Caufield loves to play against the Senators. He has 14 points in his last 15 games versus them (10 of them came in the last 8 games which is even better for us). Another reason I like this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> is because of the new winger that now plays with him and Nick Suzuki on the first line. Ever since Zach Bolduc replaced Juraj Slafkovsky, that line has now 7 points in 3 games in 5v5. And that&#x27;s only 5v5! Caufield also can get a point on the powerplay as he is on the first PP unit and usually either scores or makes a great pass to his teammates (8 primary assists out of 12). 

Senators this season allow 3.36 goals per game. Canadiens this season score 3.42 goals on average per game (top 4 NHL) so I expect Caufield to contribute to what will probably be a high scoring game.

Canadiens should be well rested as they last played Saturday and they lost 7-2 to the Avalanches(Cup favorites vs up-and-coming team) so they should be fired up for a bounce back game at home vs a division rival!

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Celtics moneyline (-105) 5 units

Really feel like the Celtics are a lot better than their record indicates. Mazulla has his squad playing hard gritty basketball and I anticipate an electric performance from White and Pritch tomorrow. They&#x27;re fresh off a win playing undermanned against the Cavs and return home to play the Knicks. The Knicks haven&#x27;t played a solid NBA team aside from the Bucks in the past 3 weeks and didn&#x27;t look all that impressive to me against Milwaukee in the NBA cup game. Expecting the Celtics to win as a dog as I feel like it is a great buy low spot for them. 

Just to reiterate, in conjunction with my model, I use the eye test as well as my gut feeling to play what I believe is the most-valuable <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> on the slate. Cheers to a great game, and please remember to gamble responsibly and to only wager what you can afford to lose.

VJ has a Great matchup against this wizards team coming off a b2b and i expect him to have alot of FGA with embiid being out. Vj will be left open on alot of plays with players like Pg and Maxey drawing most of the defensive attention and it all comes down to if VJ will knock down the open looks or not, but i like him to be efficient at home on a bounce back after droppin a stinker in a tough loss against the Hawks.</td></tr>

Last pick: Anthony Davis o 2.5 Assists (-120 DK)✅


<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the day</mark> : Chet Holmgren OVER 15.5 Points(-120 HR)



Reasoning :

Hart, Caruso and Dort are all out in this game!

Chet has been great once again this season and he’s taking a leap in development as well avergaing 18.2 PPG on 12.3 FGA per game compared to last season where he averaged just 15.2 PPG on just 11.3 FGA per game and he’s a lot more consistent this season clearing this line in 10/17 games this season and he’s over in 8/10 games when playing 30+ minutes.

In Chet’s last 2 games without Hart he’s over in both with 23 points and 19 points in those games on great usage seeing 13 and 15 FGA in those 2 games on 30+ minutes in both.

With Caruso and Dort also being out this is only going to add to Chets usage here, in 5 games without Caruso Chet is over in 4/5 games avergaing 21.8 PPG on 12.6 FGA, and in 2 games without Dort when playing just 22+ minutes he’s over in both with 21 and 23 points in those games with one of those being against the Warriors.

Chet has always cooked the Warriors, he’s over in 4/5 games with his only under coming in a game he recorded 13 points on just 27 minutes in his rookie season.

Chets gets a great matchup here versus the Warriors who allow the 7th most PPG to transition where Chet scores 16% of his points, when looking at scoring zones Chet scores a majority 45% of his points from the RA where the Warriors allow the 13th most PPG and the Warriors have no one with height that can stop Chet from scoring down low so I’m expecting him to bully the Warriors down low here.

We just saw Chet clear this line versus the Suns who are a way tougher matchup than the Warriors ranking 5th best against transition and 11th best versus the RA.

When playing just 26 minutes Chet is over this line in 5/6 games versus teams that rank inside bottom 15  in RA points allowed avergaing 22.3 PPG.

Im expecting Chet to take on a heavy load for the Thunder here with a lot of their key players being out, so I expect him to easily shoot 13+ times here. When seeing that kind of usage Chet has been amazing clearing this line in 7/8 games this season avergaing 21.8 PPG with his only under coming in a game he played just 27 minutes.

When seeing 13+ shots Chet is over this line in 25/29 (86.2%) of games dating back to April of last season averaging 20.8 PPG, and  Chet should easily clear 13 FGA in this as he did In both games this season without Hart and is now without Dort and Caruso as well so I could see him shooting the ball 15 or more times here.</td></tr>

* As the point table shows Man city is at number 2 and Fulham at 15. But Man city has shown vulnerability in their defense and weakness in away matches. They won only 2 away matches out of 6. They scored 27 and conceded 12 goals. Their attacking is good, but defense also not that strong.
Fulham have scored 15 goals and conceded 17 in the league. They won 4 matches, drew 1 and defeat in 1 home match. They have won four of their last matches in all competition. They&#x27;re confident at this moment. Based on those analysis, this match must produce 2-4 goals.

*  Pervious match stats shows that Newcastle likes to concede corners. Their games have an average of 11.08( won and awarded to the opponent). I&#x27;m going with Over 8.5 corners in this match.

￼Write Up: This line is too low for a guy who just got a triple double against the Cavs. If you’ve been watching Celtics games over the past two weeks you’ll know that he’s playing the very best ball of his career to date. He’s all over the boards, his midrange jumpers are hitting, he’s getting to the line, and he’s passing the ball and creating plays.

His average PRA Is 45.8 over the last 5 games and he is playing with amazing fire and clarity right now. It would be a shock to me if he didn’t hit this line given his recent play, even if the matchup isn’t super juicy.

**Reasoning:** Man City has scored over 35 goals this season while Fulham&#x27;s defence has been quite vulnerable. Also, key injuries to player like Antonee Robinson further make the defense vulnerable. Man City has been strong on the road this year. They have scored 2+ goals in the 8 of the last 10 matches. Also, Halaand has been a beast this season - expect him to exploit the weak Fulham defence. I see 70%+ chances for this bet to hit. 

**Risk:** Fulham has shown some capability at scoring at home (8/10 matches). This could affect the spread taken.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: William &amp; Mary +7 @ Duquesne 

Odds: -110 (Fanatics) 

Write Up: If you want an electric basketball game to watch that’s flying under the radar on a stacked Tuesday slate; this is the matchup for you. You guys will see very quickly a lot of my handicapping style involves diving into teams tempo styles, second chance opportunities (FGA, Rebounding +\-, FTA/FTM and Assist to Turnover ratio). But of course I also look deeply into recent form and similar matchups against other teams played so far this season. 

Both these teams head into this matchup as Top 30 tempo squads in the country on the offensive end. (W&amp;MU 3rd, Duquesne 26th). If you look these two teams up and down metric wise these are probably two of the most similar teams in the country. It’s actually scary how close these teams are on the offensive end. But here’s the ticker and the difference in the game and why I believe William &amp; Mary +7 is the play. 

William &amp; Mary on the defensive side is more disruptive and more effective. William &amp; Mary according to KenPom (one of my favorite tools to use) ranks 65th in effective FG % Defense (Duquesne ranks 134th), 40th in Turnover % (Duquesne ranks 94th, 11th in the country in 3p Defense (Duquesne ranks 39th), the list goes on for defensive advantages pointing towards William &amp; Mary. If William &amp; Mary can keep up the defensive fortitude they have shown this season vs Duquesne and disrupt their rhythm this game slowly starts to become a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> em before our eyes. 

William &amp; Mary also makes on average 3 more Free Throws a game, they get 5 more rebounds a game, 2 more assists a game, and 2 more blocks a game than the Duquesne Dukes. All of these stats above = more scoring opportunities. Add in the data showing William &amp; Mary as the better defensive team and I think laying 7 points here is extremely high. 

Recent Results

William &amp; Mary (7-2 SU), (6-1 Against the Spread)
Notable Wins: Norfolk State, Bowling Green, UTEP, Abilene Christian, Old Dominion. 
Notable Losses: Richmond by 4, St. John’s by 33

Duquesne: (5-2 SU), (2-4 Against the Spread)
Notable Wins: Niagara, Sacred Heart, Queens, Loyola MD.
Notable Losses: Villanova, Northeastern

Duquesne hasn’t beat anyone noteworthy. 

Meanwhile William &amp; Mary beat teams all expected to finish at the top to middle of their respective conferences. Fun Fact Bowling Green just whooped Kansas State into oblivion earlier. 

I have this game handicapped at William &amp; Mary +3.5 . I think we are getting 3.5 free points here. Don’t be surprised seeing William &amp; Mary win outright. You’ll also really enjoy their style of ball. 

Do well and good luck.

Alright lads, next <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick of the day</mark> and we’re keeping the momentum rolling! Vasco are coming into this one buzzing after an emphatic home win over Internacional, snapping that rough 5-game losing streak. With only two matches left, they know this is a golden chance to lock down three massive points before that crucial final-day showdown with Atlético-MG for those Sudamericana spots. 

Mirassol, on the other hand, are sitting a bit too comfy in 4th, already booked for the 2026 Libertadores. Their form on the road’s been shaky, 3 losses in their last 5 away (W1, D1). Nothing to fear there, lads. 

With everything on the line and the crowd behind them, I’m backing Vasco to push hard for the win in this late-season charge for Sudamericana football in 2026.

Sport: English Premier League - Newcastle vs. Tottenham @ 3:15pm EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: BTTS + Over 2 goals = +100 (5 units)

Write Up: I want to make a bet on the Atletico vs. Barcelona game as that’s the game I’ll be watching, however I think the odds in this match are better. Both Tottenham and Newcastle are inconsistent teams, they both pull out a win in a game seemingly stacked against them, and then they can lose any match. They both have offence potent enough to score and defence shaky enough to let a goal in. They are tied in the Premier League standings, both teams will see this as a must win, and I believe both teams think they’re better than the other, meaning they’ll be looking to attack instead of park the bus. Newcastles form as of late has been better, I do think they’ll win, however I also think Tottenham
will sneak in one goal.

Will update based on lineup announcement.

Last: (NFL) TreyVeyon Henderson over 60.5 Rushing ✅

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Tennessee -6.5 vs Sryacuse 

2 Unit Play

Reasoning: 

The Logic:
I’m riding with the Vols to cover the number on the road, and honestly, this line feels short given the context. Here is the breakdown:

1. The &quot;Angry Rick Barnes&quot; Spot
Tennessee is coming off a gut-wrenching 81-76 loss to Kansas in Vegas where they blew a double-digit lead. Rick Barnes teams historically bounce back hard after games like that. They aren&#x27;t just looking to win; they are looking to re-establish their identity. Before that Kansas collapse, they beat #3 Houston physically. They are battle-tested; Syracuse is shell-shocked.

2. Syracuse is Decimated (The Donnie Freeman Factor)
This is the biggest edge. Syracuse’s leading scorer and best player, Donnie Freeman (17.8 PPG), is OUT (foot). You cannot replace that production against a top-tier defense. They are also dealing with a banged-up JJ Starling, who has been battling leg issues. Even if Starling plays, he isn&#x27;t 100%, and without Freeman, the Orange have zero interior presence to handle Tennessee’s physicality.

3. The Defensive Mismatch
Tennessee enters this game with one of the most efficient defenses in the country (KenPom top-15 AdjD). Syracuse just gave up 95 points to Iowa State in their last outing. If Iowa State can hang 95 on them, Tennessee’s offense—which is averaging ~86 PPG—should feast. On the flip side, I don&#x27;t see how a Freeman-less Syracuse offense scores enough to keep up.

4. The &quot;Fraudulent&quot; Record
Syracuse is 4-3, but look at the losses. When they step up in class, they get smoked.
• Lost to Iowa State by 31.
• Lost to Kansas by 11.
• Lost to Houston (closer game, but Houston controls tempo).
They are 0-2 ATS in true road/neutral tough spots recently. Tennessee is a legitimate Final Four contender; Syracuse is struggling to find an identity.
The Prediction:
Tennessee suffocates them early. The Vols&#x27; physicality on the glass will be too much for a depleted Syracuse frontcourt. 


This feels like a 15+ point blowout.
Score Prediction: Tennessee 84, Syracuse 68.
TL;DR: Tennessee is angry, Syracuse is injured (No Freeman), and the talent gap is massive. Lay the points</td></tr>

**Write Up**:

Bro, Penn State –12.5 is basically the “I’m not saying it’s free, but it’s kinda free if nothing stupid happens” <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> of the night.

Penn State is coming in red-hot, dropping 90 pieces like they’re trying to open a chicken restaurant. Meanwhile Campbell shows up to road games like they accidentally got on the wrong bus. They’re 0–4 away from home, and half those losses weren’t even competitive as they were more like “hey, thanks for coming, here’s your participation ribbon.”

PSU’s offense is clicking, the ball is moving, everyone’s smiling, and Kayden Mingo is out here hooping like he’s auditioning for a freshman All-American nod. Campbell? They’ve got one main scorer, D.J. Smith, and after that the offense turns into an improv show nobody asked for.

The biggest mismatch? Energy and tempo. Penn State runs like they had two espressos and a pep talk. Campbell plays like someone woke them up from a nap. That’s exactly how double-digit spreads get covered ,fast team vs sleepy team.

And dEpth? PSU can go to the bench and still score. Campbell goes to the bench and immediately wishes they hadn&#x27;t. This is how you avoid those nightmare backdoor covers when the starters sit, the lead doesn&#x27;t die.

If Penn State starts with a 10–0 burst, don’t be shocked. They’ve got all the tools to stretch this one out until it looks like a CVS receipt.

So yeah PSUwill win by like 15, maybe 20 if they hit threes. Campbell might put up a fight early, but eventually the wheels come off, the vibes collapse, and PSU goes on that inevitable “welp, this is getting out of hand” run.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: 🏀 Tennessee -6.5 (-110).

Game starts at 7pm EST. Bet 2.5U

Writeup: Going back to college hoops for this one, and we’re taking the Tennessee Volunteers to cover the spread against Syracuse. Tennessee is currently 7-1 and the #13 team in the nation. They recently finished 2-1 in the Players Era tournament with a very impressive win over #3 Houston. Their senior guard Ja’Kobi Gillespie leads the Volunteers with 18.5 PPG along with star freshman Nate Ament having 18 PPG. With their offense averaging 86 PPG, it’s even more impressive that their defense is even better than their offense, conceding only 65.5 PPG.

On the other side, we have the Syracuse Orange at 4-3 this season, and recently lost all of their games in the Players Era tourney. Their top scorer Donnie Freeman is out for this game due to injury for an offense that was already inconsistent. They have also struggled keeping up pace of play against better opponents, as the Players Era tournament clearly showed. 

To add to this, if you look at KenPom rankings, Tennessee is rated the 12th best team while Syracuse is rated 71st. On Haslametrics, this difference is even larger, with Tennessee being rated 7th while Syracuse is 93rd. This is an extremely significant gap for a 6.5 point spread, especially compared to games with a similar spread. Michigan State is favored by 5.5, but they are ranked 15th while their opponent is ranked 21st. 

Both teams are playing with a chip on their shoulder, but the better team should come out on top and do so in a decisive manner with a least a 7 point victory.

A lot of money is going into Sonmez with these odds opening at a higher price, but it&#x27;s still worth taking her to win. She&#x27;s a really nice player who had a fantastic 2024 season before dropping her form a bit in 2025. Kasintseva is a decent opponent but still needs to improve a lot of things in her game, and Sonmez has the advantage on this surface. If we look at these players&#x27; careers, we can see that most of the tournament success has come on hard courts for Sonmez, while Kasintseva won the majority of her titles on clay. Sonmez also had a great upset win against Eva Lys recently at the Billie Jean King Cup on this surface (Indoor Hard).

Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t post my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> for yesterday (Santi Castro 2+ SOT), as I was waiting for Bologna lineups and didn&#x27;t catch them until 30 minutes before kick off. So we are back to mid-week EPL action after a day off as Fulham host Man City. Fulham play really tough at home, going 4-1-1, having only dropped points to Arsenal and Man U. If City want to make a title run again this year, these away matches against mid-table teams are must win games. I expect a close match here, but really can&#x27;t read the goals.

As I was finishing my research here, I actually changed to a different <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> than my initial <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> of a City player. City seems a bit tired, they are struggling to rotate players for mid-week matches, and are conceding goals/possession more than typical - especially mid-week. 

Harry Wilson should get another start at right winger here, after a goal on two shots against Tottenham over the weekend. If you watched that match, you saw why I&#x27;m on Wilson - he&#x27;s a guy who can shoot from anywhere with his left foot. Seriously, go watch his goal if you haven&#x27;t seen it, I know the keeper was out of position, but it doesn&#x27;t make the finish any less impressive. Wilson has only had 3 SOTs in his last 5 matches, but he&#x27;s taken an average of 3 shots per match. This includes 4 against Arsenal at home and, honestly, it was unlucky that none of those hit the target. He also had 2 SOTs in this fixture at the end of last season in May (against a fairly similar City team that I expect to see tomorrow). Wilson also scored 3 goals for Wales during the international break 2 weeks back. The man is in form and I like him to take a few shots <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> and land at least one on target. 

BOL and have a great Tuesday!</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>1-1 (0u) ❌✅

Last pick- ✅ Darius Slayton longest reception o17.5 yards -115 (1.15u to win 1u)

Tuesday’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> - Chicago Blackhawks +1.5 puck line -108 vs Vegas Golden Knights (1.08u to win 1u)

Vegas does not deserve to be this heavy of a favorite. I like the Blackhawks ML also, but the odds are too high for this thread. The Knights are 6-4-4 at home this season and it seems as though Carter Hart will be making his first start of the season after serving his suspension. 

Chicago got a big win over Anaheim on Sunday and they have a respectable team for the first time in a while. Their season goal differential is actually better than the Knights. Simply put, these teams aren’t that far off from each other, but the betting lines make this seem like a long shot.</td></tr>

I&#x27;m thrilled to see midweek Premier League games again; I truly missed that sense of pressure on a random Tuesday or Wednesday. Bournemouth started the season out so so well, but they&#x27;ve entered a 4-game slump and will look to get back on track tomorrow. Last home game they got 10 SOT and 9 corners (and drew), expecting less this round but considering they need a win even more… let&#x27;s back it.

GLADBACH VS ST PAULI

Date: 02 DECEMBER 2025 at 18:00

BET ON: Match odds- GLADBACH

Odd: 1.81



\- Gladbach enter the cup tie with clear upward momentum and a strong sense of purpose, as Polanski has repeatedly stressed that the DFB-Pokal is a priority both for sporting continuity and the significant financial incentive of progressing. Despite missing Neuhaus and several squad players, the team’s 4-2-3-1 structure remains stable, reinforced by the returns of Hack and Kleindienst and the reliability of Tabakovic up front. Polanski warns against relying on the recent 4–0 league win over St. Pauli, calling this a “dangerous match,” but he underlines that his side’s defensive solidity and form give them control over the tie. St. Pauli, meanwhile, approach the match from a position of crisis, with Blessin viewing the cup primarily as a mental reset after a long run of Bundesliga defeats. Their squad is significantly weakened: key striker Hountondji is ruled out with a muscular injury, while multiple defenders remain unavailable, forcing a conservative 5-4-1 setup designed more for survival than proactive play. With limited attacking options, structural defensive problems, and confidence issues, St. Pauli’s priorities lie in stabilizing rather than competing on equal terms — giving Gladbach a clear motivational, tactical, and personnel advantage.</td></tr>

West ham Vs Liverpool 

Both teams to score and over 2.5 goals

(1.83) 3 units ✖️

Just a very disappointing West ham performance, 9 goals in their last 3 games but never really looked like scoring here, Paquetta with the most ridiculous red card I&#x27;ve ever seen just killing any chance of them scoring late on as we fall a goal short with Liverpool winning 2-0

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>:
 
Premier League 

Newcastle United Vs Tottenham Hotspur 

Newcastle win and over 1.5 goals 

(1.90) 3 units

Two teams in completely contrasting forms here. Newcastle also have an exceptional home form with **6 home wins in a row, scoring at least 2 goals in all those wins** only losing at home narrowly to Arsenal before that. Not only just a great home form at the moment but long term it&#x27;s been a very hard place to go for the past few years for teams.

This is also the middle of the very congested schedule for both sides, this is Tottenhams 4th game in 9 days, Newcastles 4th game in days 10 so a crucial extra recovery day for Newcastle also an edge for them.

Defensively Tottenham have been awful the past few weeks, **they&#x27;ve conceded a ridiculous 13 goals in their last 4 games**
Vicario in goal in particular has really struggled but the whole defence as a unit has been very unorganized.


Newcastle are without Pope in goal, however Ramsdale is a more than suitable replacement, pipe wasn&#x27;t playing particularly well anyway, other than that they have no significant injury concerns, Tottenham have definitely been missing Madison in particular in midfield, and Solanke up top also.

I think Newcastle have just far too much for Tottenham here, in particular they are just a much better midfield and they should win the key battles there and Voltemade and Barnes are both in excellent form in attack.

**Last:** (CBB) Florida -6.5 (1u) - L

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** No. 13 Tennessee (-6.5) at Syracuse 

**Start Time:** 7:00 PM ET

**Odds:** -110 (DraftKings)

**Units:** 1U

**Reasoning:** Sometimes, there’s nothing deadlier than a team playing with its back against the wall. Other times, that team is the 2025 Syracuse men’s basketball team.

The Orange (4-3) accepted an invite to last week’s Player’s Era Festival with one thing in mind: an opportunity to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> up a crucial non-conference Quad 1 victory. With matchups lined up against Iowa State (7th in NET ranking), Kansas (17th) and Houston (18th), the opportunity was there for the taking. However, what started with promise—a 78-74 overtime defeat to the Cougars—quickly ended in disaster with 11 and 31-point losses to the Jayhawks and Cyclones respectively. 

And while No. 13 Tennessee will provide Syracuse with one last chance on Tuesday night, don’t hold your breath.

The Vols (7-1) enter this matchup on the heels of a disappointing 81-76 loss to Kansas last Wednesday. It’s a defeat that will have the team kicking itself, as Tennessee led by 12 with 14 minutes to go before watching the wheels completely fall off. So while the Orange will be out looking for respect, the Vols will be looking for something to take out their frustrations on. 

Offensively, Tennessee comes in ranked 32nd in offensive efficiency (1.186), 50th in shooting (48.8%), 52nd in scoring (85.9 PPG) and 114th in three-point shooting (35.4%). While Syracuse’s defensive numbers might look respectable at first—20th in opponent shooting (37.8%), 27th in scoring defense (65.3 PPGA), 30th in defensive efficiency (0.908) and 99th in opponent three-point shooting (30.7%)—a closer look will reveal a chink in its armor. In three games against top-ranked opponents during last week’s aforementioned tournament, the team saw those numbers drop to 81.3 points per game allowed on 46.4% shooting (39.7% from the perimeter). Look for Maryland-transfer Ja’Kobi Gillespie (18.5 PPG) to take advantage of that.

The mismatch should continue on the other end of the floor as well. 

Through eight games, the Vols rank 12th in opponent shooting (36.8%), 27th in defensive efficiency (0.903), 29th in scoring defense (65.4 PPGA) and 51st in opponent three-point shooting (28.7%). It all adds up to what should be a very long night for an Orange offense that only ranks 114th in shooting (46.2%), 171st in offensive efficiency (1.041), 177th in scoring (74.9 PPG) and 290th in three-point shooting (29.3%). That includes scoring just 66.0 points per game on 37.9% shooting over their last three showings. And did we mentioned that the team will be without its leading scorer in forward Donnie Freeman (17.8 PPG? Yikes. 

A strong advantage on the glass will be another X factor in the matchup. 

Tennessee comes in ranked 10th in total rebounds (43.6 per game), 10th in offensive rebounds (13.0), 20th in opponent rebounds (30.0) and 199th in opponent offensive rebounds (9.4). Conversely, Syracuse ranks 152nd in total rebounding (36.3), 223rd in offensive rebounds (8.6), 293rd in opponent rebounds (38.7) and 304th in opponent offensive rebounds (10.9). 

Trust the Vols to make the Orange their punching bag.

Last Pick: Cross ML v Heta

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: Rock -1.5 ML v Rydz 

Sport: World Championship Darts

Reasoning: Over the season, Rock is ranked top-15 vs Rydz outside the top-40, averages -98 vs -94, and matches Rydz on finishing (-40% checkouts), so the edge comes from sustained scoring rather than volatility. In this tournament, Rock’s two matches combine to a 95.8 average with clear leg control, while Rydz’s combine to 92.5 and relied on a 41% peak finishing game that still went five sets, showing finishing spikes don’t translate into set control—supporting Rock -1.5 sets.

Event: Rams vs. Falcons, 8:15 pm


<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Drake London over 11.5 1Q receiving yards


Odds: -118 BetMGM


Reasoning: London is listed as questionable, but he&#x27;s covered this line in 9/10 games this year. And last week, his first game back from injury, he had five targets in the first quarter alone, second most of the season. On passing defense, the Rams are middling to poor, ranking about 11th-13th worst in the major stats. This bet seems like a no brainer, and if London doesn&#x27;t play it&#x27;ll just be a push. FYI, the other books I&#x27;ve seen have the line at 13.5.</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>**POTD Record:**  101 – 66 - 11

**Previous:**  EPL – Nottingham Forrest vs Manchester City -1 – PUSH

**Recap:**  City did what City does.  Dominate with 66% possession and have more than twice as many shots and shots on target than their opponents.  In this case, even as an away team City gets the win but did not win by more than 1 goal, so we pushed.  All we can do is try to be on the right side of things.

**New Event:**  Liga Portugal – Porto vs AVS

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:**  Both teams to score NO &amp; Over 1.5 goals @ 1.75 (Usual 3 units)

Another chance to use some negative correlation to our advantage. 

The Portuguese league features Porto at the top with 43 points, a +29 goal differential and only 4 goals conceded after 15 matches.  At the bottom of the table in last place sits AVS with 4 points, a -28 goal differential and 39 goals allowed after 15 matches.  The odds for a Porto win are so short, that it makes no sense to consider them.  However, a little creativity may pay off in this one.

AVS’ chances of scoring are slim to none as a single goal pays 2.5.  Therefore, the Both Teams To Score NO becomes more attractive at 1.48 because we know that Porto will certainly score.  Given that they have scored more than one goal in their last 5 matches, Porto is playing at home, have conceded only 4 goals all season, and are hosting the worst team in the league whose defense allows 2.6 goals per match, we can surmise that Porto should score more than 1 goal which pays 1.15.

Combining the two options of Both Teams to Score No (1.48) and Porto to score more than 1.5 goals (1.15), gets us to a 1.75 odd total for this bet.  It will probably be more than 2, but playing it safe with Porto Over 1.5.</td></tr>

**American Football** | **NFL** | **12/29 7:15pm** /**CST**

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Spread - Los Angeles Rams -7.5 (-6.5 alt-line better if available) -105

**Write Up:** 1st off, full discolsure, I bet on Robinhood Prediction Markets, so I bet the alt-line of -6.5 for $0.56 a contract and I have 170 contracts.

This line should be -10.5 but it isn&#x27;t for a few reasons I believe are bad. The Rams have a couple OL injuries and Davonte Adams WR1 is Doubtful for tonight. The Falcons Head Coach was the Rams Defensive Coordinator for 2021-2023 so he is seen as having a &quot;unique insight&quot; into the Rams defense. Falcons are currently on a 2 game win streak despite simply playing for pride and glory, and the Rams have been shut out of their division and instead are playing for a better seed in the conference; a win tonight will likely put them at the 5 seed playing against Carolina and a loss I believe gets them to play against the Eagles.

If you&#x27;re reading this then you probably know the matchup here is wonkey. The Rams will win this one unless they just screw up big time. Rams are a serious contender for the Superbowl. Their Offensive DVOA is #1; their defensive DVOA is #3 but their Run Defense is #6, nothing to ignore considering the Falcons have Bijan Robinson and Falcons are averaging something like 130 rushing yards per game.

Meanwhile, Falcons are around 15th in DVOA overall, and their rushing defense is 24th, playing worse than average defense by about 2.4%. The Rams RBs are averaging around 5 yard per carry (I am biased here as I am a Blake Corum fan since Michigan). And the Rams pass game is really good (lol).

The real reason I am picking the Rams is the Quarterback matchup, and the doubts I have that anything in paragraph 1 matters. Falcons are still with Kirk Cousins, while Rams have Matthew Stafford. Kirk Cousins has a passer rating of 97, Stafford&#x27;s is 110. More importantly, Cousins rating when Blitzed is 103 and when pressured is 64. Guess where the Rams rank in terms of blitzes and QB presssure. Rams are ranked 26 when it comes to blitzing, and 6th when it comes to QB pressure, averaging 40% across the season, and only blitzing 24% across the season.

Matthew Stafford on the other hand has a passer rating of 121 when blitzed, and guess what team seems to specialize in blitzing. The Falcons have a blitz rank of 4 doing so 35% across the season. Their blitz packages are a core feature of their defense. Stafford has a passer rating of 80 when pressured, but the Falcons time to pressure is 2.5 seconds and they rank 13 in pressure in the league.

So, you have a mismatch between the QBs and the defensive packages they will be playing against. The Rams are an elite team facing off against a team who is 6-9 on their 2nd string QB. Even if we were going to give the Falcons a shot and say the Rams OL injuries and the Head Coach situation, it still would not warrant a reason why the Rams don&#x27;t win by a touchdown tonight.

Game Script: I fully expect to see a totally normal competent game from the Rams. They score a few opening drives, they 3 and out the Falcons just one too many times for them to catch back up, and the game ends with a 14 point lead by the Rams, maybe a 10 point if the Falcons kick a field goal in garbage time at the end. Final Total: 31 - 17</td></tr>

LAST PICK: FAU vs UCF -8.5 LOSER

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>TODAYS PICK</mark>: McNeese State vs Michigan -24.5

Location: Crisler Center, Ann Arbor, Michigan

Start time: 7:00 PM Eastern Standard Time on B1G+

The #1 team in the nation, the Wolverines of Michigan, are coming off an 8 day break and have been red hot this year. Michigan has scored 94+ points in 6/7 games and will continue their offensive barrage tonight. McNeese State enters this battle at 10-2 and 1st in the Southland Conference. Propelled by their leading scorer Larry Johnson, averaging 16 ppg on nearly 60% shooting from the field. That&#x27;s about all McNeese State will have in their corner this match up. Michigan is a juggeranut right now and coming off of 8 days rest I fully expect the Wolverines to break the 100 point mark tonight. KenPom ranks Michigan as the #1 team in the nation ranking 5th in overall offense and 1st in overall defense. The McNeese State Cowboys simply do not have the horses to offensively compete with Michigan. Wolverines play great defense and can produce buckets from any of the 5 players on the field. Lastly, this is Michigan&#x27;s last match up before Big Ten play and they will be looking to make a statement. Go Blue!

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: (NCAAF) Georgia Southern -6.5 vs Appalachian State (-162) (2:00 PM EST)**

Reasoning: Georgia Southern beat App State earlier this year, 25-23. Georgia State are 4-1 ATS in the past 5 meetings. App State have a losing record and are filling in a empty bowl spot passed by several other teams while Georgia Southern are trying to be the first team ever to beat a team in the regular season and a bowl game in the same season, from the same conference. Yes, Georgia State won by 2 in the regular season game however App State were full roster. App State are without their top 2 QB’s to portal. Southern Georgia is fully healthy. App State have motivation and revenge on their side but Southern Georgia already beat App State at full strength and App State are relying on a third string quarterback and a short handed roster for this second matchup. Give me Georgia Southern ATS

Earlier this season, against the Spurs he dropped a 30pr stat line. Now I&#x27;m aware Wemby didn&#x27;t play this game, but I dont think that will matter as he just dropped 24 against the Pelicans, 22 vs the Knicks, and 38 against the Rockets.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Giannis Antetokounmpo o26.5 points (-125)


Reasoning: Bucks coming off a win vs the Bulls and playing a tough Hornets team at home. Giannis looked great on limited action vs Chicago scoring 29 in 25 minutes of action. Before the recent injury, he was an MVP front runner, and is looking to get the bucks back in the playoff race. Just going off the intensity that ended the game in Chicago, I see Giannis being super aggressive tonight against Charolette who doesn’t have a defensive stopper for The Freak. Also really like the bucks ML at -150, but like the better odds for his over on points. For those who want to make it more interesting Giannis 25+ points &amp; Bucks ML is +120. The Hornets are better than their schedule suggests, but they have dealt with many injuries this year and are now fully healthy. So I anticipate a close game. I think Giannis has over 20 points at halftime and the game remains close. Let’s get the win tonight everyone!!! BOL!!!

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Justin Hood to Win &amp; Most 180s ❌

Odds: 1.80

Stake: 5 Units

Reasoning:
Hood has stronger scoring averages and should see more looks at T20. His aggressive T20 approach and willingness to stay on the treble gives him a strong edge in the 180 count (doesn’t switch to T19 often). His scoring power should help him gain match control and ultimately the win. 

Meikle is capable of competing in patches, but his game is generally more rhythm-based and less explosive in the scoring department. If Hood imposes his scoring early, Meikle is more likely to be reacting than dictating and that brings pressure which he doesn’t react great to. IMO Meikle has had a lucky way through the first couple of rounds but that run comes to an end <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>!

Reason • 
The Warriors just played a grueling overtime game in Toronto last night. 
Jimmy logged 38 minutes and finished with 30 PRA (19 pts, 6 reb, 5 ast). 
That’s a lot of mileage for a 36-year-old on the front end of a back-to-back. 
Brooklyn has been playing much better defense lately and with Steph Curry expected to carry the scoring load, Jimmy will likely focus more on his defensive assignment and facilitating, which caps his scoring ceiling. Jimmy has gone Under 33.5 PRA in 4 of his last 5 games. His average over this stretch is roughly 31 PRA, leaving very little room for error tonight.</td></tr>

Keeping it simple again.


This feels like a good spot for Morocco.


They’re playing at home, they control games well, and the gap in quality here is pretty clear. Morocco are comfortable dominating possession and creating chances, while Zambia usually struggle when they’re pinned back for long periods.


If Morocco score early, Zambia will have to open up, which suits Morocco even more. Even if it takes a bit of time, the pressure should add up over 90 minutes. I’m not expecting anything flashy just Morocco doing their job and winning by a couple.

A large part of their scoring success is their ability to draw fouls and make FTs. ORL **leads the league** in FTA (28.8) and FTM per game (22.7), creating a source of high percentage shots while stopping the clock.

ORL&#x27;s ppg drops a bit without Wagner (who is still injured) to 114.9 ppg. However, in the last 8 games without Wagner, they are over this line in 5/8. Two of the misses were against CHA (#1 in fewest FTA given to opponents) and GSW (#7, and generally good defensive team). The third miss was against the Blazers (Magic scored 110) which was just a poor shooting effort. 

Toronto, for their part, commit the 10th most fouls per game, so ORL should get at least their average in FTs. 

And while the Raptors are generally a good defensive team this year, giving up 112.9 ppg, a few additional factors come into play. 

First is TOR&#x27;s aforementioned propensity to foul and give up FTs. Second is that TOR&#x27;s opponent ppg goes up to 113.4 at home, and 114.4 with RJ in the lineup. And third, Raptors are now on a second game of a back to back, following a game against GSW that went to OT and drew heavy minutes and effort from TOR&#x27;s best defender Barnes. With just a little extra fatigue, we should see TOR&#x27;s starters a little slower to get back on transition defense and a little more prone to making defensive mistakes/giving up FTs.</td></tr>

**Write up:**

**The <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>:**  
This matchup fits a **High Probability** attacking profile — exactly the kind of Pro League game where both teams create a lot and clean sheets are rare. Al Ittihad carry the stronger attacking pressure, but Al Shabab have enough firepower to respond rather than sit deep.

These teams don’t play slow, and once a goal goes in this profile tends to **open up quickly**, pushing games into the **3+ goal range** with both teams involved. Score patterns like **2–1 / 3–1 / 2–2** fit perfectly with this combo.

Given the game flow and lack of defensive stability on both sides, relying on goals instead of picking a winner is the smarter angle here.

**My Model in general:**  
My model is built around the idea that matches follow **recurring patterns**, not randomness.  
Instead of predicting games in isolation, it groups matches by **odds profiles** and studies what *actually* happens when similar games are played.

By clustering historical matches with the same **home–draw–away odds**, I track how games usually unfold — goals, BTTS, scorelines, and game flow. From there, the model identifies **motives**: situations where teams are more likely to attack, trade goals, or avoid clean sheets.

Every <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> comes from **data-backed profiles, not opinions** — combining odds structure, score patterns, and streak behavior to find spots where the market regularly repeats itself.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>

Angola vs Egypt BTTS 2.05(3u)

Tremendous value here and I fucking love this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> and here is why.

Angola have scored in both their matches, despite picking up only one point. They aren&#x27;t just a pushover and they&#x27;re hungry for goals tonight since a win would almost guarantee their chances to qualify for the playoffs.

Egypt are already through and although there is a permutation of results where South Africa could leapfrog them in the rankings, they are expected to rest a few of their key players.

This is where this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> looks nastier, Angola already needing a goal will push for it while Egypt need a draw to guarantee a place in the playoffs too so they aren&#x27;t going to allow Angola to win either, goals should come from either side.

Again, this is a value <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, at 2.05 I sincerely believed that the line is overpriced and this should be taken advantage of.</td></tr>

Stake: 1u
<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: BTTS – Yes
Odds: 1.91

Write-up:
Originally, the idea was Leicester Win + Over 1.5 Goals, mainly due to Leicester’s home advantage, stronger head-to-head record, and slightly higher attacking threat. On paper, Leicester are marginally favoured and should find the net. However, when digging deeper into the underlying data from my AI sports analysis model, BTTS – Yes emerges as the smarter and more resilient angle.
Both teams are showing similar expected goals (around 1.5 xG each), which suggests Derby are capable of scoring despite being away from home. Leicester’s defensive form has been far from convincing, while Derby’s recent performances indicate they can find goals even in difficult fixtures. With both sides in poor overall form, this matchup profiles more as a scrappy, open game rather than a controlled home win. Leicester may still edge the result, but Derby have enough attacking threat to punish defensive lapses — which is why the BTTS angle provides better coverage than forcing a result-based play.
Given the inconsistency on both sides, confidence is intentionally reduced, and the stake is adjusted to 1 unit to reflect the added variance.</td></tr>

Write up: Rams play in Atlanta, nothing significant on the line as rams can’t win the division anymore. Still think rams offense will move the ball comfortably but curious to see if mcvay pulls starters early. Regardless, like Corum this week. He’s averaged 44yards/game, and 70/game in the last 5 off of 10.2 carries/game. His share of carries has increased and only see him getting a larger role if that changes at all with kyren having a potential rest spot. The falcons run D has been ok lately but still ranks 26th in the league for rush ypg allowed. Kyren and Corum have combined for 9 tds in the last 5, and the 3rd option on the goal line was really davante Adams who is out.</td></tr>

NBA | Pelicans v Knicks | 🏀  

Finishes at exactly 22 PR after absolutely dominating in the first half, should’ve been much more and random minutes didn’t help either. Bam news a couple of hours after bumped it massively but was still at 21.5 for a long while, hope some got that.

KAT gets a great matchup against the Pels who’s been very vulnerable to defending opposing centers this season, allowing 4th most points in the league to centers &amp; 6th most points allowed within 10 ft where Kat takes 60% of his shots from.

Mark Williams had 37 PR, Sengun 39, Gobert 39 &amp; AD 52 PR just to name a few bigs they’ve matched up against as of late..

No Hart or Robinson available for Knicks here aswell leaving huge upside for KAT in minutes &amp; rebounds as they’re big volume rebounders. Pels have allowed 4th most rebounds to centers this season aswell.

Without Robinson he’s over in 3/L4 games with 53, 49, 34 &amp; 46 PR

I also like Giddey, but be aware of the higher line. If he puts up numbers along the lines lead guards such as Kolek, Murray, or KPJ, he will cover. I think this should be a pretty close game throughout, and the **over/under of 239.5** suggests a higher scoring, faster paced game. <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> whichever you like more, but I am slightly more confident in White tonight.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> :** Soccer/Football, **Leicester vs Derby County - BTTS  YES (1.83) 1u.**

I&#x27;ve been betting for a couple of years and this past few weeks i have been betting purely on bets backed up by stats with a daily success of a 60/70% winrate on picks that go from a range of 1.50 to 2.00 odds. Anyways, the reality is that i found myself being better at inplays but i wanted to give it a try with pre-bets and post some here when i think its good enough.

Reasoning:

Leicester at home has seen btts in 8/11. (73%)

Derby away from home has seen btts in 8/11. (73%)

Both teams in the last 8 games (home/away) have seen btts on 7/8. (88%)

Both teams have lower than 20% on clean sheets and failed to score stats.

So basically i&#x27;m expecting both teams to be able to score and concede a goal. I&#x27;m expecting a 1-1 final score but at the end of the day this is soccer so u never know what can happen! Let&#x27;s see if i&#x27;m right on this one. Good luck to anybody who tails with me! Let&#x27;s get it.</td></tr>

**NFL: Los Angeles @ Atlanta**

*Kyren Williams o69.5 APY (-163) 1.5u*

Dipping into the alt market <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> for Monday Night Football, as the LA Rams head to Georgia to visit my (sigh… yes, my) Atlanta Falcons. The Rams still have a lot to play for, so we are going back to a trusty friend - Kyren Williams - to snag **70 all purpose yards.**

Yes, this is juicy, but I need some insurance for what is my favourite <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> on an otherwise dry slate. Math is math: he’s **over this line 12/15 this season**, 2 of those 3 missed by a combined 6 yards. Throw the extra half unit on it.

Kyren had **26 touches last week** (only one in OT) and **6 targets** in the passing game - once again showing his usage is returning to normal.

The *roadblock* as always is the Blake Corum effect™️ - however I think it may be weaning: he **only had 12 touches and no targets** in regulation last week. He’s trending downward in his YPC, but he’s still getting scoring touches and double digit runs.

It may be too early (or, late?) to assume, but LA appears to be leaning 70/30 Williams in early down situations. I have no facts, just observing.

Adding to this, The Falcons have been susceptible to big games by opposition RB’s this season. After a strong start to the season, the Falcons rush D’s gradual decline (**25th in rush yards per game**, I’ve had a front row seat, it’s been brutal) has spiralled out of control.

The Rams should get into the trenches to try exploit their clear advantages they possess in the passing game. The Falcons have been susceptible to big games by RB’s this season, **but have also been bitten by the play action recently - the Rams league leading weapon.**

There’s a lot of ***FEELING*** (uncle Roger voice) going on here, I admit. It’s a gut play, hence the insurance - It’s always a risk to bet on a guy against an opponent AND a teammate - BUT, Kyren has rarely let me down this season, and I wanna end the Monday Night Football slate with a trusty bet.

Last play review:

Christian McCaffrey o67.5 Rush Yards (-111) 2u ✅

(It’s always nice to go to bed early… this could have hit in the 1st quarter, and sniped early in the 2nd on CMC’s 9th carry of the game. Sure, a 41 yard rush helped get us here, but the game plan I predicted SF to show, came early and often for our 10th win in 2 weeks)

Game starts at 8:15pm EST. Bet 1.25u

Writeup: Taking a calculated shot at a solid plus money play with Rams running back Blake Corum scoring a tuddy. 

Corum has scored in 4 straight games with 5 touchdowns in those games. This is largely due to increased usage over the 2nd half of the season. He is currently getting 30% of the carries for the season, and this number is much higher over the last few weeks as the Rams look to take some work off of their starting running back, Kyren Williams, before the playoffs. Corum has also had over 25 touches inside the 20 yard line this season, and again, all of these numbers have been inflated due to increased usage over the last 5 weeks or so.

The Rams are going up against the Atlanta Falcons, whose run defense is much weaker than their pass defense. They have given up rushing touchdowns at one of the higher rates in the league this season, with 8 different teams scoring a rushing touchdown against them.

The Rams are also favored by over a touchdown in this one, giving Corum even more rushing opportunities and opportunities to score. Even if Kyren Williams gets more of the work and the yards, the Rams have really liked using Corum near the goal line to smash it up the middle for a touchdown right after.

50 total points are expected in this one, and it wouldn’t surprise me if both running backs find the endzone. Give me the one who’s been taking a lot of the redzone work recently as the Rams look to keep everyone healthy before the playoffs.

Remember to only bet what you can afford to lose, and BOL!

**Write Up:** Back in the green yesterday as Calvert-Lewin scores a goal just after halftime to make it 6 games in a row with a goal. Truly incredibly stuff by the guy and a great +185 cash for us to end the weekend. 

No EPL <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, but I do like this huge England Championship (2nd tier) match between 1st place Coventry and 3rd place Ipswich. As you guys know, I try to find the best value in our plays and try not to take picks under even money (this is only our 2nd play less than +100). That said, I really like this play and, while I&#x27;d normally add the Coventry striker and make this a Parlay, it&#x27;s a toss up between who will start so I&#x27;m just going to take this straight. Definitely staying away from ML here as this could go either way. 

Jaden was sold to Ipswich from Aston Villa last year as Villa wasn&#x27;t using them and Ipswich had to clean house after being demoted to the Championship. He has really come into his own for Ipswich as he is currently their top scorer with 8 goals, having started 17 of 22 matches. I like the value on this play because Jaden has cleared this in 3 of his last 4 games, hitting 2 SOTs in two of these games including one a few days ago. This is likely one of the biggest games of the season for Ipswich, as they are in the thick of the promotion end of the table. Jaden has been a real bright spot for Ipswich and I expect him to have a big game <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. 

Jaden did just start a game on Boxing day, making this a 2nd game in 4 days for Ipswich. But he came off at 60 minutes and I really can&#x27;t see them resting him in this massive game. That said, I will repeat, if your book does not void SOT plays for a player not starting, **please wait for lineups 1 hour before kickoff**. We have been hooked by some very strange lineup exclusions and there&#x27;s a nonzero chance this could happen here again. All that said, this has hit in one of the matches he did not start, so I dont hate it if he comes on as a sub.

**Event:** AFCON, Zimbabwe v South Africa, 11:00 am EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Zimbabwe Win or Draw +110, 1.5 units

**Write Up:** Does Zimbabwe ring a bell? Well, they helped break my losing streak by snatching a point against Angola, so just from that angle alone, I really enjoy having them in my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>. While South Africa do enter this match as favourites on paper, Zimbabwe might very well be there to spoil the party in this crucial Group B tie. These two sides are meeting in the AFCON finals for the first time, but their H2H history outside of this tournament shows how tight their rivalry truly is. Here&#x27;s a fun stat for y&#x27;all: Out of 19 previous encounters, Zimbabwe have won six, drawn five, and lost eight, proving time and time again that they’re far from pushovers when they meet South Africa.

Zimbabwe arrive with **momentum and real scoring confidence,** despite a tough opening loss; they earned their first point of the tournament with a **1-1 draw against heavy favorites Angola**, with striker **Knowledge Musona continuing his important role in attack**. Musona is now among Zimbabwe’s all-time AFCON scorers, and his presence upfront gives the team a genuine goal threat - he&#x27;s super difficult to mark and should have a couple of pops at goal <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Meanwhile South Africa, for all their technical quality, sure have shown vulnerability at the back, **conceding in three straight matches** and failing to assert control in some key phases of the build-up play, as well as **struggling to break down defensively lined up teams,** as we saw against a 10-men Egypt, where they&#x27;d **continuously cross the ball to nobody in particular,** shoot from ridiculous angles, and even attempt an overhead kick from outside the box. Against a disciplined **Zimbabwe side that can sit compact and break quickly** on the counter, that defense could crumble.

Importantly, this match matters equally for both teams’ progression hopes. Zimbabwe can edge into the knockout stages with a positive result, giving them extra motivation and belief. South Africa’s inconsistency with just the one solitary win in their last five AFCON matches in open play suggests they’re not immune to an odd slip up despite being favourites.

In a match likely to be tight, tactical, and low-scoring *(but nope, not touching the goal line after yesterday&#x27;s debacle),* Zimbabwe might just have enough in their tank to avoid defeat. I do like the BTTS angle too, so if you take that, I don&#x27;t mind it, but I&#x27;m not sticking any extras to this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> - learnt my lesson the hard way. Despite everything that&#x27;s been going on as of late, I&#x27;m pretty confident in this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. It&#x27;d be perfect if Zimbabwe could bail us out yet again. BOL and let&#x27;s get a grip on this AFCON madness once and for all ☘️</td></tr>

Sunday’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> - ❌ Saquon Barkley TD +100 (1u to win 1u)

Monday’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> - Matthew Stafford o2.5 passing TDs +147 (1u to win 1.47u)

With Drake Maye’s big game on Sunday, the Rams will want to get Stafford TDs through the air to help with his chances to win MVP. He is currently the betting favorite, but there is still a chance it goes to Maye if they get the number 1 seed and Stafford has a couple down games to end the year. I expect to see more passing along the goal line to bump up those numbers.

As far as their opponent, they’ve been giving it up through the air at a pretty high rate and they don’t have a ton to play for. That said, they’ve also played up to their opponents at times throughout the year, so they could also keep this close and give Stafford more opportunities to score TDs

Good Luck</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Bradford to win @ 1.66 (1 unit)

**Write Up:** <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> I&#x27;m going down to League 1 which is usually the lowest I&#x27;ll go in the English pyramid before it starts to turn into a bit of a free for all. **3rd place Bradford City** host **bottom of the table Port Vale** as they continue their positive start to life in League 1 following their promotion from League 2 last season. They sit just **4 points behind league leaders Cardiff City** and only **1 point behind second place Lincoln** who they&#x27;ll be hoping to leapfrog due to their game in hand. Port Vale too came up from League 2 last season but now sit bottom of League 1, **10 points from safety** and **without a league win since late September**.

Bradford City sit **2nd in the current form table** winning **4 of their last 6** games whilst **drawing 1** and **losing 1**. Their loss came to **12th place Leyton Orient** whilst they drew to **6th place Bolton Wanderers** at the end of November. The Bantams left it late to beat 18th place Wigan on boxing day and a win here <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> will make it 4 home wins on the trot. Bradford are the **4th best home team** in league 1 winning **8 of their 11 games** played on home turf this season and only **losing 1** which was against 21st place Burton Albion (not their best day at the office clearly). They have **scored 19 and conceded 10** at their home ground bringing their goal scoring numbers to **1.73 a game** at home whilst only **conceding 0.91**. Despite being in much better form than the visitors, they have only beaten them in **2 of their previous 10** encounters which they&#x27;ll be hoping to make 3 after <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>&#x27;s game.

Visiting Port Vale are the **least in form team in the league** winning none of their last 6 whilst drawing 2 and losing 4 in the process. Most recently being thumped **5-0 by 7th place Huddersfield**, they&#x27;ve lost back to back games and as mentioned previously are **without a win since September**. They have actually **only won 3 games** **all season** having played 21, **losing 12 of those**. The only positive for Port Vale going into this game is that 2 of their 3 wins have come on the road but they are still the **5th worst travelling team** in the league. Their defense actually hasn&#x27;t been completely awful considering their position in the table as they **concede 1.38 goals** per game with that **rising to 1.55** when playing on the road. Where Port Vale have failed this season is scoring goals. They&#x27;ve scored **the least amount in the entire division** averaging an extremely underwhelming **0.62 goals** per game rising slightly to **0.73 when playing away**. Overall this has amounted to an abysmal **13 goals scored all season** across their 21 games. For comparison the next worst scoring team is Exeter City with 21. Combine this with the **3rd best defense in the league** in Bradford City and hopes are not high for the visitors.

Whilst this shouldn&#x27;t be a trouncing by Bradford they should have enough to get over the line for a comfortable 1 or 2-0 victory especially with the added motivation of chasing Cardiff in first and Lincoln in second who have a difficult fixture away at 9th place Barnsley which the Bantams will want to capitalise on.

NHL 🏒Capitals at Panthers, 7 pm ET 12/29/25

Net Units: -3.61 Units

Explanation: I like the Panthers against the Capitals because Floridas been playing solid this season overall and have been playing hot, 8-3 in their last 11 games. 

Florid’s got a strong penalty kill (82.2%), and that matters a lot against a Washington team whose biggest flaw is a bottom tier power play (~15%).

I think Florida can force the Capitals into more defensive-zone time, and they just gotta cash in on any PPs that arise.</td></tr>

**League - AFCON**

**Game: Angola VS Egypt**

**Time: 11:00 AM EST**

**---**

**Going back to the main markets and were taking a trip to Africa <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>!**

Egypt are one of the favourites for the competition, and with the likes of Salah and Marmoush, you just have to love their attacking force. In their last match, they got 3 shots on target, but they received a red card at halftime, causing the pace to shift. Match before against Zimbabwe, they managed 11 shots on target total and I&#x27;m seeing them back at their best <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.

Angola have played 2 games so far in AFCON, and their opponents have both had 4 shots on target. Now facing the best side in their group, I see the over being our friend here and great value. Even with Egypt qualifying for the next phase I see them having too much talent for an Angola side that cannot qualify.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Al-Rayyan to win and cover -18.5 handicap, 1.86, 1u ✅️

Somewhat exotic compared to standard plays, but when I found it and researched it, I liked it the most for a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.

I never watched this league, and I never intend to. This is solely based on stats. 

Al-Rayyan, 1st place in the league - 8-1 score, and 5-0 at home, Al-Gharafa 2-7 and 1-4 as guests. The home team is a power house in the league, 18 titles, and they have a 7 win streak against Al-Gharafa. The latest win was on 04.12, where they won by 16 points as guests. Both teams have 2-3 US players and 1 or 2 other international players.

The interesting part in the league, if I checked it correctly, is the fact that Al-Gharafa plays all their games with 7 players in the roster (at least in their last 5-6 games I checked). I have no idea why, or if only these players and not all that played are listed on the scoreboard (flashscore).

They for sure do use players in Thibodeau style, 38-40 minutes of playing time seems to be a common thing in this league.
Al-Rayyan seems to do better there.
They use at least 9 players, and their top 2-3 players are simply put, much better, and this gives them a big advantage.

Edmonton Oilers ML (-125)

Last game between them 3 weeks ago was a complete domination from the Oilers (6-2 victory). The Jets looked old while the Oilers kept making plays after plays. I know Hellebuyck wasn&#x27;t in net for the Jets but Oilers had Skinner in theirs at that time who was garbage. Things since then haven&#x27;t gone better for the Jets with now 5 losses in a row with Hellebuyck starting in net for all of them. Meanwhile the Oilers are looking back to form with McDavid dominating the league again and Connor Ingram being pretty good ever since he replaced Jarry. They lost vs the Flames yesterday but they played a sloppy game after coming back from their Christmas break and I don&#x27;t expect them to do the same this time especially since the Oilers tend to put a way better effort after a loss (they won 5 games in a row after a loss). Jets are also 1-4 in their last 5 at home.

<tr><td class='post'>Last 5 &gt; WWLLL // Profit: €1028.55

Coventry City @ 2.34 - €100.00

One of Frank Lampard’s biggest hurdles this season. 1^(st) placed Coventry will take on Ipswich who are 3^(rd) themselves. There is a huge contrast between home and away form for both sides.

At home Coventry are yet to be beaten and are #1 ranked with a 9-2-0 record. They also tally for the best goal diff with a 27:7. Of their last 5 home games they have won all of them. Ipswich though are 12^(th) as away side with a 3-4-4 record, they have a 16:13 goal diff. Ipswich have only won 1 game from their last 5 road trips where they lost 2 and drawn 2.

Now for H2H it does not look convincing for tonights’. Kieran is 2-0-0 against Lampard and in the last 10 games Ipswich are 6-2-2. Even with these stats, Coventry are heavily overperforming this season which makes me lean towards them for tonight.

2-1 Coventry</td></tr>

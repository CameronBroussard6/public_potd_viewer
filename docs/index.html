It&#x27;s a b2b game rematch, so books have sharpened the line of course, but same logic and conditions apply.  Wizards are total ass cheeks vs opponent rebounds...

**NBA - Pacers @ Wizards - odds currently at Draftkings**

**Jarace Walker 8+ Rebounds = -115**

Wizards are league low against rebounding, and when Sarr is out, they approach historically bad levels... Sarr is out.

Meanwhile Siakam is out and Zubac is still tbd to play for the Pacers - Jarace should see considerable boards here.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: (NCAAB) Green Bay Phoenix +8.5 vs Oakland Golden Grizzlies (-188) (7:00 PM EST)**

Reasoning: Laying 8.5 on Green Bay on the road. Oakland comes into this game on a three game losing streak while Green Bay are playing much better over the past month. This is a revenge game for Green Bay having lost 88-63 earlier this year. Looking at the numbers, despite Oakland having the better offensive efficiency, Green Bay shoot better from two, from three and the free throw line. Oakland are better on the offensive glass and committing less turnovers. Oakland also has the better defensive efficiency but not by much. Green Bay is the much better team on the defensive glass. The efficiency numbers between these two teams aren’t wide enough to say Oakland wins big here. Line movement is currently moving in favor of Green Bay as well. Lay the +8.5 on Green Bay here in a revenge conference game.

Last Pick: van Veen -1.5 ML v Bunting

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: Springer ML v Reyes 

Competition: European Tour 

Sport: Darts

Odds: 19/20

Reasoning: I like Niko Springer for this one because he holds a significantly higher world ranking (#53 vs. #108) and has already proven his ability to win on the big stage with a PDC title at the 2025 Hungarian Darts Trophy. While Reyes is in the midst of a resurgent comeback, Springer’s consistent scoring and high-pressure experience against top-20 opponents give him a tactical edge in a race-to-6 format.

NBA | Hawks vs Clippers | \[7:30 ET\]

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Norman Powell Under 25.5 Points + Rebounds (-114) | 1 Unit

This play comes from my simulation-based NBA prop tool that weights season production, recent form, projected minutes, pace, opponent adjustments, and return-from-absence adjustments before running Monte Carlo simulations to estimate probability versus the posted line.

Powell is projected at 21.3 P+R with a modeled 70+% probability of staying under 25.5. While his season average is 26.6, projected minutes are reduced to \~23.7 following some absence, and a small absence haircut (-1.8%) is factored into efficiency.

Even with a slight pace boost (+2.7%), the reduction in expected minutes materially lowers his median outcome. With variance at ±5.4, the distribution centers well below the posted number

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Kyle Filipowski o 9.5 rebounds (-114 on DK)

**Wager:** 4 units 🏀🏀🏀🏀

The tanking Jazz are without Nurkic, putting Filipowski at the starting center spot where he has been showing some real development lately. He is over this line in 4/L5 as a starter (had 9 rebounds in the one miss against Clingan and the Blazers).

The tanking Grizzlies are playing without a center, starting Kyle &quot;Slow-mo&quot; Anderson at the 5. As a result, Grizzlies are ranked last in the league in terms of most rebounds given to opposing centers across the last 7 games (ranked #21 on the season overall).

In one previous matchup this season where Flip started, he had 13 rebounds.

Utah really has no other legitimate rebounders in their starting lineup, unless you count Lauri who is GTD with an illness, so we should see quite a bit of usage from Flip.

In a Kyle vs Kyle tank-off that doesn&#x27;t mean much to either team, I&#x27;ll back Flip to play hard and continue to take advantage of his development minutes.</td></tr>

Lore:

We’re heading to the Fortuna Sittard Stadion for the opening of Matchday 24 in the Eredivisie, a direct clash for mid-table peace. Fortuna (11th) and Excelsior (12th) arrive tied at 26 points, and if there’s one thing the Dutch league guarantees in these &quot;no man&#x27;s land&quot; contexts, it’s a constant exchange of blows.

What we are looking for in this opportunity is for both teams to score and for more than 2.5 goals to be scored. A line that, in my view, is undervalued by bookmakers considering Fortuna has turned their box into a constant &quot;viva el fútbol&quot; festival.

I like this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> because we have odds of +105 for a scenario that current trends strongly validate. Fortuna Sittard comes in with a streak of 7 consecutive matches going over the 2.5 goal line. Their defense is made of glass: they haven&#x27;t kept a clean sheet in their last 12 matches. However, their offensive output is notable, having scored in 13 of their last 14 games. They record an average of **1.48 goals scored** and **1.83 goals conceded**, with a **home  of 1.73**, reinforcing their aggressive stance at home. Furthermore, they are missing key defensive pieces <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> (Sinkgraven and Branderhorst), which should facilitate the opponent&#x27;s transitions.

On Excelsior&#x27;s side, although their overall numbers are more modest (**1.09 GF** and **1.70 GA**), their recent trend shows an allergy to defensive order. They have conceded 2.09 goals per game as visitors, an alarming figure that Fortuna, with Kaj Sierhuis (8 goals) and the individual quality of Ihattaren, will know how to exploit. Excelsior is coming off a battle against the big teams, such as the recent 2-2 draw against Ajax, proving that they know how to find the back of the net against permissive defenses. With both teams needing points to definitively distance themselves from the relegation play-offs, I expect a broken game from the start.

Futbol | Ligue 1  
2:45PM EST **Brest vs Marseille**

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **Both Teams to Score &amp; Over 2.5 Total Goals**

1U @ -110 (1.91) BETMGM

**Stade Brestois 29** have quietly built a strong scoring rhythm, finding the net in 10 of their last 11 matches. Their approach is proactive and vertical, often pushing fullbacks high and committing runners into the box, which increases attacking output but can also stretch their defensive shape. That balance between ambition and vulnerability has led to open contests, particularly against sides willing to play at tempo.

**Olympique de Marseille**, meanwhile, continue to produce high-event matches. A coaching change is unlikely to significantly alter their aggressive offensive structure, especially with Mason Greenwood providing consistent end product in the final third. Marseille have seen over 2.5 goals land in each of their last 10 outings, but they’ve also conceded in 9 of their previous 10 league fixtures — a trend that reinforces the expectation of goals at both ends rather than defensive control.

With both teams carrying reliable scoring patterns and visible defensive gaps, the stronger angle here is **BTTS &amp; Over 2.5 Goals**. The tempo profiles, recent data, and tactical setups all point toward a stretched, chance-heavy encounter. Implied score model has it at **0.98 - 1.81**.

Event: NBA - Utah Jazz @ Memphis Grizzlies - 7:00 PM eastern

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Kyle Filipowski o9.5 rebounds (+100)

Write Up: Both the jazz and grizzlies are openly tanking as well as both front courts being heavily depleted. Grizzlies allow the 2nd most rebounds to centers at 15.5 Rebs/game. Filipowski should assume that role if markkanen is out. Even if he still plays, Filipowski should have a lot of opportunity especially if the game gets out of hand or in the 4th where Lauri usually sits.</td></tr>

Last Pick: Tiafoe ✅

Event: ATP Doha

I just built this model based on my own custom algorithm that shows the win percentage for each game as well as my tennis knowledge.

Mensik&#x27;s game is basically built for these Doha conditions. He&#x27;s got the height, the reach, and the &quot;big match&quot; temperament that we saw when he turned things around against Choinski and closed out Sinner. While Fils was impressive against Lehecka, he hasn&#x27;t faced a serve this dominant all week. I&#x27;m backing the Czech to stay composed, lean on that monster delivery, and use this momentum to punch his ticket to the final. Right now, Mensik is playing like he belongs at the very top of the game, and I don&#x27;t think Fils has the defensive range to stop him.</td></tr>

Backing the underdog could easily bite me in the ass here, but I&#x27;m not convinced Rose can cover this spread. Hive (3-8) are having a rough year with league worst point differential of -103 points. Hive&#x27;s offense is prone to cold streaks during games and team has league lowest 718 points scored, compared to 821 points scored on them. Rose (5-6) traded Azura Stevens to Hive and are bringing back Angel Reese for the first time this season. But Rose have also had their struggles on defense. While Rose have scored 787 points this year, they&#x27;ve somehow allowed more points scored against than the Hive at 829 points. Rose still have a solid forward in Shakira Austin and top guards in Gray and Copper, but it hasn&#x27;t consistently translated on the floor this year. I think if the Hive can avoid a bad scoring drought during the game, Rose will need to play well on both sides the ball to cover this spread. Hive actually beat Rose earlier this season 78-75. While the books have plenty of confidence in Rose winning this game (ML is -325) and I&#x27;m not expecting Hive to win this time around, I do question whether Rose can beat Hive by 3+ possessions.

Portland has been vulnerable to opposing playmakers. Since Feb 1, Craig Porter dropped 12 assists on them, Collin Gillespie had 10, and both Collier and Mitchell put up 9. Model projects Murray at 8.97 tonight and Pinnacle is lined at -113/-117 leaning over, so getting +100 at BetPARX/FanDuel feels like a good number.

**Analysis:**

Canada is underestimated in the betting market <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> after relatively poor offensive performance for their standards against fantastic Czech team effort. 

Finland is of course a respectable and worthy opponent but I believe Canadians &quot;regress to the mean&quot; <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> and score 4 goals easily.

This is not a &quot;statistical&quot; <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> as I can&#x27;t really back it up with hard numbers, it is more of a hunch. I just can&#x27;t see 2 underwhelming attacking performances in a row by the team featuring best hockey players in the world, and my eye test suggests that after the narrow escape against the Czechs they are going full throttle <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. 1.83 is very solid odds, you would never see these if Canada scored 5-6 in the previous game.</td></tr>

Looking at the standings and stats for Perrot and Christiansen there are a lot of interesting plays I&#x27;ll be taking here but the odds are too high for a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>. This parlay is what I consider super safe and I&#x27;ll be going in heavy on it. Perrot totals two gold and one silver medal across the different biathlon disciplines so far in the 2026 Olympics, whereas Christiansen has two silver medals. I have an extremely hard time seeing Perrot finishing any lower than top 6 and Christiansen any lower than top 10.

**Write-up:** Bit of a cold stretch lads. I still like the reads. Yesterday our bet went from +155 to around -120 before tip-off, so we were definitely on the right side. 

Tonight I’m rolling with Kyle. He will be starting and handle the bulk of the minutes between centers. The Jazz have most of their starters out in Keyonte, Nurkic, and JJJ. Without those guys Kyle went 4/5, averaging near 12 boards on 16 chances. Grizzlies literally have everybody on the injury report, and do not have a true center, as Kyle Anderson - a small forward, is filling the role. Against the Grizzlies in the last few games, Clingan grabbed 17 and 19 in back-to-back games, Al Horford grabbed 9, and Joker got 15. In the last two weeks, the Grizzlies rank dead last in rebounds allowed to centers. This should be our get-back spot. GL

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: James Harden &quot;O&quot; 8.5 Assists (+105) HR

Reasoning:  Harden is currently averaging 8.2 APG on the season and has seen a playmaking bump since joining Cleveland, where he is surrounded by elite finishers like Donovan Mitchell and Evan Mobley. Against Charlotte, he transitions from &quot;Scorer&quot; to &quot;Maestro.&quot;

🕵️ Detective clues:

Evidence 1: The &quot;Mitchell&quot; Factor: Since Harden arrived in Cleveland, he’s cleared 7+ assists in 9 of his last 10 games. He is averaging 8.7 APG as a Cavalier because the team has actual scoring threats that convert his passes at a high rate.

Evidence 2: The B2B Cushion: Cleveland blew out Brooklyn last night, allowing Harden to sit the entire 4th quarter and finish with only 28 minutes. His legs are fresher than a typical back-to-back would suggest.

Evidence 3: Historical Matchup Edge
 In his last 10 games against Charlotte, Harden has averaged 9.9 assists. He has recorded 10+ assists in 6 of those 10 games, including a 10-assist double-double just last month (Jan 12).

Scenario Playbook 

Scenario A (The Ideal):Harden runs the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>-and-roll with Jarrett Allen/Mobley early. Charlotte collapses on the drive, and Harden kicks to Mitchell for three &quot;easy&quot; assists. He hits 8 assists by mid-way through the 3rd.

Scenario B (The Grind):Harden’s jumper is flat due to travel. He stops shooting and focuses entirely on playmaking to stay impactful. He finishes with a 12-point, 10-assist &quot;workmanlike&quot; line.

Scenario C (The Outside Influences): Charlotte goes &quot;Box-and-One&quot; or doubles Mitchell, forcing the ball into Harden’s hands as the primary decision-maker. This increases his &quot;Potential Assists&quot; (passes that lead to a shot).

Scenario D (The White Flag 🏳️) Cleveland is winning by 25+ in the 3rd. Harden is pulled early, but his efficiency in the first half (where he usually racks up 5-6 assists) gets him over the hump before he hits the bench.


Scenario E (Cold Night):The Cavs&#x27; shooters (Mitchell/Garland) have an abysmal night. Harden delivers the passes, but the teammates don&#x27;t finish. (This is the &quot;Teammate Variance&quot; risk).

Scenario Proof: Harden has a &quot;floor&quot; of 7 assists in this matchup. Looking at his Jan 12 game against Charlotte, he had 10 assists in 37 minutes. Even in a 25-point blowout win against Washington on Feb 11, he managed 11 assists in only 28 minutes.</td></tr>

Last Pick: Jakob Poeltl o6.5 Rebounds (-122)❌

Event: Cleveland Cavaliers @ Charlotte Hornets 7:00pm EST

Season NBA Record: 0-1 (-1.00u)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Evan Mobley o6.5 Rebounds (-114) 3u

Write up: Horrible and unlucky look by me there, don’t know when it happened but at some point late afternoon yesterday Poeltl was scratched as a starter and didn’t even see 20 min of play time. We move on and recoup.

Straight back to rebounds tonight with Evan Mobley, a center playing as the team’s PF. Mobley leads the Cavs in rebounds at an average of 8.8/game, which is also the 15th highest avg in the NBA this season. Mobley has hit this line 5/L5 games and in this same matchup a month ago (1/21) recorded 14 boards. CHA just allowed Jabari Smith Jr to grab 7 rebounds (who I had paired with Poeltl last night in a two man funnily enough) and are in general allowing 10.4 rebounds a game to PF over the last 30 days.

Main reason why I also love this look is because the Hornets have shooters on shooters. Over the last 5 games, Brandon Miller is averaging 9.6 3 point attempts, LaMelo is averaging 11.2 3PA, and Kon Knueppel is averaging 8 3PA. They allow more than enough opportunities for Mobley to cash. This is another play I see a lot of value in laddering at 8+ rebounds (+158) 0.75u, and to record a double double (+460) 0.25u. Let me know of any questions or concerns.

Best of luck

Myles Turner is out for this game meaning more run for Bobby here against a Pels side that has struggled against bigs all season.

Without Turner he’s over in 3/3 games with two of those coming against OKC which is a much tougher matchup than the Pels. 15 points in both matchups against OKC and 14 against the Timberwolves, with Giannis playing who’s out aswell.. played 37 &amp; 29 minutes most recently without them both.

With 27+ minutes he’s over in 9/11 games this season which is a very realistic floor time with the players missing.

**Writeup:**

* NAVI take on MOUZ in a repeat from their group stage game, MOUZ won a pretty comfortable 2-0 against NAVI in group stages, and while I do think they are a better team, I think picking Mirage last time into MOUZ was a mistake since it has always historically been a great MOUZ map I think this time they make the adjustment and change the veto. Makazze played very poorly last time against MOUZ and will be looking to bounce back in a big way, he went 1/2 on the over last time dropping 19 kills in 2 maps.

**Projected Veto:**

* NAVI ban Overpass, MOUZ ban Anubis
* **NAVI <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> Ancient**

**Ancient Stats:**

* NAVI are 100% winrate on 5 maps of Ancient in the L3 months, and 10-4 as a roster since adding Makazze. One interesting thing about this map is since December NAVI haven&#x27;t just been winning this map but dominating top teams on Ancient. They beat PARIVISION 13-6, B8 13-4, FaZe 13-5, PARI 13-5, and G2 13-9
* MOUZ are 100% winrate on 1 map of Ancient in the L3 months, they are 5-5 in the L6 months, this isn&#x27;t a bad map for them but one they are clearly much less comfortable on then others in the pool, they&#x27;ve had some big struggles against certain teams, and a lot of their wins are very close regularly giving up 9+ round

**Makazze Stats + Ancient Stats:**

* Makazze is averaging a .68 KPR L3 months for NAVI, a .69 KPR in the last month and at this tournament so far. It would take Makazze a \~20-21 rounds normally to hit this line with his regular KPR
* One of the reasons NAVI Ancient became so dominant is because of Makazze, he is a monster on this map, this isn&#x27;t a new thing, this was always his dominant map back on NAVI junior and even further back, he runs this map on both sides offense and defense and has been putting up massive results.
* Makazze is averaging a 1.06 KPR in the L3 months on Ancient, a .83 KPR in the L6 months (the time he joined NAVI) making it his highest rated map overall and a .83 KPR in the last year as well. Taking a .83 KPR, it would take \~17 rounds for him to hit this line on average at this KPR.
* Makazze has dropped 21/22/21/17/19 in his L5 Ancient games overall
* Makazze has gone O in 9 straight Ancient games, with an overall hit rate of 14/17, two of his misses were hooks at 13 kills, and one miss at 11 kills, meaning he has never dropped less then 11 kills on this map in tier 1
* Since joining NAVI Makazze is averaging 18.5 kills per map on Ancient

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>**: UNDER 241.5 (-110) *Bet365*
  
1.65u to win 1.5u

This number just feels a bit too high for how this game should realistically play out. Utah likes to run, but Memphis doesn’t live in that tempo for four quarters. At home they’re much more comfortable in the half court, and that alone can shave a few possessions off what books are expecting here.

Memphis also isn’t efficient enough offensively to support a 240+ total for a full game. They go through scoring droughts and rely heavily on jump shooting, which creates cold stretches. If they land somewhere in the 108–115 range, Utah would need a ceiling shooting night to push this over.

If Utah leads, Memphis slows it down. If Memphis leads, pace drops naturally. If it’s tight late, you get more half-court possessions and clock burn. Most realistic paths point under this number.

One of those spots where they’re just going to have to beat me if it flies over.</td></tr>

It’s always a bit scary going against Alcaraz, but this feels like the right play. Rublev is the defending champion here in Doha and he has made it to the semifinals without dropping a set. While Alcaraz has won the last 3 matchups, he’s been competitive in all of them. He’s won a set in their last 2 matchups and covered the 4.5 game spread in all but one of their 2 out of 3 set matches.

4.5 games is a lot for Alcaraz to cover in a 2 out of 3 set match, especially against a motivated and confident Rublev.

Game: Winter Olympics Hockey- Canada vs Finland (9:40 AM CST)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Mitch Marner over 0.5 pts -110 (FD)

I&#x27;m going with the hero of the QF game against Czechia. Marner is having himself an excellent Olympics. He has a point in every game so far, 5 total in 4 games. Unconfirmed, but I&#x27;ve read projections that he&#x27;s getting moved to the 2nd line. With this being the semis, the lines will be shortened and he should get a small boost to playing time. I&#x27;d estimate at bare minimum, 16 solid minutes, ideally 18+. With him also on the 2nd PP line, the opportunities will be there.

Finland has one shutdown defenseman in Mikkola and one very good defensive forward in Roope Hintz, but the rest of the squad is average to below average in xGA/60. Canada&#x27;s team total is set at 3.5, with the over being favored. If Canada scores 4, I like the chances of Marner getting involved.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Paravision vs Falcons Map 1 Jame o13.5 kills -118 1u
Write Up: Out of the 10 maps Paravision has played on de_dust2 this year, Jame has hit this line in 8/10 of them (17.7 avg kills). The only two times he went under were due to blowouts wins (13-1, 13-4). Paravision boasts a 78% win rate across 14 matches of Dust 2, due in part to Jame’s stellar calling and AWPing.  Paravision is just about guaranteed to select this map and I do not see them blowing out a top 5 team with superstar talent such as Falcons. De_dust 2 is Paravision’s playground. A map in which they are capable of defeating any team in the world. Jame is Parvision’s AWPer and captain. De_dust 2 also lends itself to the AWPing role quite well, with it historically being a pop off map for AWPers given the long site lines on each lane of the map. Without a strong AWPing performance, your chances of winning Dust 2 decrease significantly. With Jame being the captain and IGL, he will put himself in positions to succeed with the AWP in order to give his team the best opportunity to win the match.  The only negative factors I am able to locate regarding this wager are the blowout potential (low) and an AWP H2H vs a top 3 player in the world mOnesy (doesnt directly affect Jame’s kill total). Jame Map 1 o13.5 Kills -118 to win 1u</td></tr>

&gt;**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Switzerland -2.5 @ 2.0

&gt;Switzerland came out of the round robin unbeaten but lost in the semis to world #1 Great Britain. Their opponent for this bronze medal match is Norway who somehow snuck into the playoffs before losing to Canada in the other semi final. Switzerland has been the best team all week while Norway has been one of the worst when looking closer at their stats. The Swiss will have a significant advantage at every position except fourth where they still have a slight heads up on Norway. Switzerland came into the event with a 46-16 season record, including 16-1 against teams outside the world top 25 (such as Norway). Norway came in at 37-26 and 1-6 against top 10 teams. Their most recent match before the Olympics, Switzerland won 7-4 at Worlds last year. In their round robin match at these Olympics, Switzerland won 10-4. Should be an easy cover.</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>**POTD Record:** 18-43-5 *Sigmabale classics are back y’all. The team we backed, Drita, was down 2-0 by half time, before taking the game under full control and scoring two goals themselves. They were millimetres away from the third, but then Celje hit them on a counter and scored in the literal last second. That was a real bad beat, so bad in fact, it made me switch sports for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Still more hits than losses in the last 5 so gotta at least look at the positives. Plus, <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>’s Friday so that’s a positive in itself*

**Event:** Winter Olympics, Canada v Finland, 10:40 am EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Finland +2.5 Spread, -137, 1 unit

**Write Up:** *I’ll preface this by saying Canada might be the big favorite,* but we’ve seen far too many underdogs turn up in these Olympics recently. In the light of that, I just can’t help, but think Finland should easily cover the spread. It’s an important game with a lot at stake so neither team is coming out all guns blazing, and I think a blowout is unlikely.

Canada have **struggled big time in the previous round,** requiring a late equalizer to send the game to overtime where they just about overpowered the spirited Czech Republic. Meanwhile, Finland showed grit themselves by completing a **stunning comeback** before dumping Switzerland out of the competition. Finland have troubled the Canadians in the past, so I don’t think this is going to be a straightforward one. *Make no mistake, I think team Canada is winning this,* but not by 3 or more goals. **Jordan Binnington is far too unreliable** in net and they just **can’t find a solid defensive pairing.** Finland can be tricky and should never be counted out, as they showed against Switzerland, as well as in their most recent H2H where the Canadians were already up by 4 goals before Finland scored 3 in quick succession, making the final few moments very nervy for the Northern Americans.

These Olympics have been absolutely mental and I can see another big struggle incoming. We’re taking some juice here, but a +2.5 handicap feels like a very safe line so I’m dropping a unit on it. Under 5.5 goals also sounds like a viable market, in case y’all want to explore that side of the coin. I also like the odds on Celebrini ATGS, the man’s on fire. BOL and let&#x27;s enjoy another underdog story ☘️🫡</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: FK Akademija Pandev vs FK Rabotnicki Skopje - Akademija Pandev ML (-110) 1u (Hard Rock Bet)

Note: The teams might be listed differently depending on where you look. Sofascore has this matchup listed as AP Brera Strumica vs Rabotnicki. 

Write Up: I know almost nothing about the Macedonian Football League. I don’t know any of the players, formations, or history. But, I do know that Rabotnicki are bad. 7 points from 18 games with a -22 goal differential. They haven’t won a competitive game since before Halloween. They tied the last place team in the league and gave them their only point this season. 

This <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> is less about Pandev and more about fading Rabotnicki. Pandev won the reverse fixture 4-3. I expect them to beat a dogshit team on their home turf.</td></tr>

Anderletch ii vs Genk ii, Over 3.5 goals @ 2.26 (3u)

I like Over 3.5 goals in Anderlecht II vs Genk II at 2.25. These reserve teams usually don’t play too cautiously, it’s more open and attacking, and defending isn’t always the main priority. Games in this league can get pretty wild, especially with young players who take risks. One early goal can really open it up. At this price, four goals feels very possible.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** **FC Nordsjaelland ML** v Vejle **+** Athletic Club v Elche **BTTS - YES (4u)**

**Odds:** **+178**

**Write Up:** 2-1 Pegula sees first leg done, as I thought Tauson put up a fight but Pegula ultimately the better player. Hull actually see out a win against Brisbane, seeing no real stress against this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> either. We are on a nice streak here folks, appreciate all the input in comments and happy to be cashing you out - lets keep it going!

First up we go to the Danish top league, where Nordsjaelland (6th) host Vejle (12th/bottom of the league). Nords home record is 6-0-4 W/D/L, Vejle&#x27;s away record is 0-2-7 W/D/L. Since 2008 when they first faced off their head-to-head record is 12(Nord)-5(draw)-2(Vejle) in their 19 fixtures, going FC Nordsjaelland&#x27;s home ground this is taken to 7 wins for Nord and 1 draw, with 4 wins for the home team in a row. In their reverse fixture in October it finished 3-0 with Nord winning it away. Current form has Nordsjaelland on a 3 win streak, with 4 wins in the last 5 in this league - Vejle is currently 1-4 in their last 5. I would also like to point out that against similar position opponents FC Fredericia (11th) and Silkeborg (10th) at Nordsjaelland&#x27;s home ground BOTH finished 5-0. I do see a similar outcome for an away team that have historically struggled against this team, as well as them being in poor recent form, FC Nordsjaelland being in better current form, having the home advantage and them proving them to have the ability to beat these kind of teams at their home ground. I&#x27;m going to guess a 3-1 finish for FC Nordsjaelland here - fingers crossed they take away the 3 points <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.

You might remember I accidentally got the dates mixed up the other day, thinking this fixture between Athletic and Elche was on Monday instead of Friday as I misread it - we go to it <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> as I still like this line. Secondly, we go to the Spanish top flight, where Athletic sit 9th and Elche in 16th. Important stats you should know this fixture has seen LESS than 2.5 goals 6/8 meetings - HOWEVER here&#x27;s why I am backing BTTS: it historically has a 3/6 hit rate at Athletic. The reverse fixture at the start of the season ended 0-0 at Elche, but current forms are my motivator for this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. First and foremost, the current records are that BTTS hitting 9/10 for Athletic and 7/8 for Elche. The last 7 fixtures for Athletic have seen BTTS and 6/last 7 for Elche have seen BTTS. At home Athletic have seen BTTS in 4/8, but noticeably their last 3 (since December 22nd) they have seen this clear against weaker opponents in Levante (19th) and similar quality in Real Sociedad (8th). Elche&#x27;s away record is woeful at 0-4-7, however that has not been for a lack of trying, they have seen goals both ends in 9/11 of their away games. Over 2.5 goals has been seen in 8/10 last Athletic games and 5/6 Elche games. Averages for each team are as follows: Athletic goals for 27(1.13 per game) and goals against 34(1.42 per game) - Elche goals for 31(1.29 per game) and goals against 35(1.46 per game).

Thank you for all the input in the comments, I appreciate those who tail! Also I would like to remind people I do this for fun, I am not a professional and therefore sometimes my writeups can be lacklustre I am aware. Anyways have a great day folks!

Recap: Yesterday was a bit rough at 5-5, but overall 28-13 this dreamleague major and a few CS2 picks. A few people in the comments asked why we didn&#x27;t just take PARIVISION 2-0 yesterday. We got our answer when they dropped a map to Yandex. That 1-1 draw would have ruined the parlay, which is exactly why we played it as a Double Chance/ML anchor instead. We are staying disciplined with our reads to keep the main record climbing.

Huge thanks to everyone following the heat.

WRITE-UP: NAVI is the primary focus of this parlay. They are currently fighting for their lives in Group B and absolutely must win this series 2-0 to secure a spot in the next stage. They are facing Execration, who have struggled all tournament with a 2-10 record. NAVI has a perfect head-to-head history against them. The motivation gap here and the skill difference are just huge.

Pairing them with Team Liquid to bring the odds to a solid 2.20. While Liquid is already safe for the next round,  and even though they are safe for the next stage, they still need the better ranking in this current stage to qualify for RIYADH MASTERS, so there are not going to be any cheese picks to fuck up our parlay. They are facing a paiN Gaming squad that is already eliminated and recently had roster instability after kicking their carry (Parker and his dramas). The skill difference between the current BLAST champs and a demoralized paiN roster is too wide to ignore. This is a high-probability combo to keep the streak alive.

If you have any trouble finding these lines or need help with your slips, feel free to reach out. I am always happy to help.

🎾 WTA Dubai , 16:00 CET  
⚽️ Serie A, 20:45

I was really impressed by level of play of Coco in the match against Eala.  
Svitolina is definitely a more challenging opponent, but i see Gauff having more winning chances than the odd seems to say, also considering the fact that Svitolina comes from two long and struggling fights against Bencic and Ruzic in the last two rounds.  
Coco is the better player, the more rested one and also the one that seems to get along better with the peculiar surface of Dubai courts, from what i&#x27;ve been able to see in this week.  
  
I like just as much Guaff ML at 1.65, but i preferred being a little bit more safe combining it with Sassuolo to score at least one goal: they produce a lot of goal chances (especcialy since Berardi - their best player - came back from injury), <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> playing agasintan awful team such as Verona, which defense have been tragic this year.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Casper Ruud 🇳🇴 ML vs Sebastian Korda 🇺🇸 5 units to win 5.5U @2.10 (Bet365)

You will never see me post women’s tennis ever again, way too volatile. The books love Korda don’t they? This does seem a bit over the top though. Both players came through really tough matches in the last round, Korda had to save 4 SP’s in the second set to Michelsen whilst Ruud battled back from a set down to Giron. Casper recently became a father which explained his absence since AO but really started finding his rhythm against Giron after the second set which is going to be a big positive coming into this match as he was obviously slightly rusty to kick things off, especially against a player he’d struggled against in the past. Korda has been playing a lot of tennis but I don’t think the match fitness edge is going to have too much of an impact since Ruud is simply the better player in my mind. 

The slower and bouncier courts should favour Ruud’s heavy topspin game more than Korda’s flatter strokes. That means that he should be able to reset Korda’s attacks with a deep ball that is difficult to control and will have the upper hand once rallies are dragged out as his rally tolerance is simply better. Can Sebi hit through this? Absolutely as he’s an excellent ball striker but the more he receives, the more he’ll be prone to miss. The topspin on Ruud’s shots also means that the American will have to be in the right strike zone to have a clean hitting point and whilst his anticipation is generally quite good, his lateral movement is poor which might make it difficult to truly attack every shot and being off balance is going to invite Casper to come in and finish the points. I have seen a lot more offensive intent from the Norwegian as well recently to take even more time away from his opponents plus has slightly tweaked the serve, fired 20 aces past Giron last round which is going to be a welcome addition. Korda is going to cause some issues on the serve + 1 and with the shorter points which is why I think the match will be relatively close but I still think Ruud will have more looks on return especially if Korda’s 1st serve percentage falters in a game and therefore can take initiative especially if he can force the game on to his elite forehand. Casper leads the H2H 2-0, both matches being last year including in Stockholm where Korda theoretically had a better chance of winning on a fast court compared to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Most importantly though is the fact that Christian Ruud (Casper’s father) defeated Petr Korda (Sebi’s father) in 1999 so it’s only logical that the Ruud’s will continue to have the Korda’s number. I would have fairer odds closer to 1.8 adjusting for a very slight concern on Casper’s sharpness. BOL !</td></tr>

**Reasoning:** First game back for both of these teams coming out of the all-star break who are trending in opposite directions. The Mavs have now lost 9 straight, only covering the spread in 2 of those games and are now without Cooper Flagg for this matchup. Their second best scorer, Naji Marshall left before the end of the teams last game, and appears to be playing tomorrow but he will struggle to orchestrate the offence due to Gobert&#x27;s paint presence. The Mavs front office also appears to have deemed this season a wash after selling at the deadline and shutting down Kyrie for the rest of the year. Coming out of the break, the team doesn&#x27;t have anything to play for except a lottery <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. The timberwolves have won 7 of their last 10, and are itching towards a top 4 seed. At home, their defence is ranked third in defensive efficiency, while Dallas ranks 4th last. Im backing the healthier, deeper, more talented, and more motivated team at home to cover against the tanking Mavs. BOL.

We just cleared the Saudi parlay easily! That&#x27;s 6 wins in a row. Now we are heading back to my home turf, Argentina, for a high-value Double Chance parlay. Let&#x27;s keep this streak alive.

Boca Juniors vs Racing Club: Boca has only managed to win 1 of their last 4 matches, and that was against a Newell&#x27;s side that has won only 1 of their last 10 games. Their most creative player is out with an injury, and their #9 couldn’t score to save his life right now. They are entirely dependent on individual brilliance from Leandro Paredes. They are facing a Racing team that, despite a shaky start, has secured 2 consecutive wins and has a consolidated manager who knows exactly how to play these types of &quot;Clásicos.&quot; Racing is the more balanced team here.

Rosario Central vs Talleres: Not much more to say about Rosario Central—we’ve backed them several times and they are a powerhouse at home. I’m taking the double chance (1X) to secure the parlay. They are playing against a weak Talleres side that has only won against lower-division teams in the Cup recently and has looked very poor at the start of this tournament. Central has a high-quality squad and often gets the &quot;benefit of the doubt&quot; from the referees when playing at home.

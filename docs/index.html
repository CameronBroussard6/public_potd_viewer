<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Lakers -2.5 v 76ers

I’ve been on a roll right now. I should’ve started posting a week ago. 

For tomorrow’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, my money is on the purple and gold due to several things.

For my perspective: 

They’re at home, Austin is back, and regardless of how bad the teams they were up against, they showed how dominant they can be and I believe they’ll continue to showcase it against one of the best teams in the east. 

For stats: 

On the last 5 games, the Lakers ranked 8th, while the 76ers ranked 18th in net adjusted efficiency.

At home, the lakers are ranked 8th in net adjusted efficiency.

On the road, the 76ers are ranked 21st in net adjusted efficiency.

The line is at -3.5 right now, but I want to kinda play it safe. 

Best of luck! Hoping we continue the streak.</td></tr>

Anderlecht does not seem to be at its best at a crucial point in the season and the change on the bench comes to act as an &quot;electric shock&quot;. On the other hand, Antwerp is coming off a great performance and it remains to be seen whether its performance can last. Today, the &quot;first half&quot; is played between two teams that have the cup as a priority, with the purpose of entering the equation of the match. It is possible that the goal difference of 2-3 goals will be confirmed and that &quot;open accounts&quot; will remain in view of the replay next week.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **Royce O&#x27;Neale u3.5 assists** (-147); 2 units to win 1.36 units

Write Up:  
First, the Suns and Warriors have played three times already this season. In all three games, Royce has gone under. To me this really isn&#x27;t that surprising. I always thought of him as more of a play finisher. However, looking into the stats, he disproves this somewhat. He averages over 40 passes a game and around 4.5 potential assists a game. Those are pretty high numbers especially for a three-and-D specialist like him.  
Even then, I believe in the Warriors defense. Most of their team roster is smaller (and versatile). Thanks to this, they run people off the three point line pretty well; their length, hustle, and IQ also help a lot. A lot of Royce&#x27;s assists come from the three, so if the Warriors do what they usually do, I expect the people receiving his passes to put the ball on the ground and do something of the dribble.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Telstar-GA Eagles BTTS Yes @ 1.53

Write Up: I can&#x27;t lie to you guys. Finding a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick of the day</mark> <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> was harder than normal. I almost decided to skip a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>, but f it, let&#x27;s go with this.

These dutch teams just love to spam goals. Telstar has hit BTTS in last 4/5 and GA Eagles has hit BTTS in last 7/8. Their last H2H in September went 4-2 (Telstar won there). 

If you absolutely refuse to do 1.53 odds, then I don&#x27;t hate BTTS + O 2.5 for 1.82 odds. I will do that as a side bet. But both of these teams are kinda poor and a 1-1 draw wouldn&#x27;t surprise me, so I&#x27;m staying with BTTS Yes as my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>.

Somehow this one stuck when looking at todays games, the ideas are that Fener needs a win, and Fener has a good defense. I gave up on total points under since analysts predict another run and gun from Paris, and that they can&#x27;t repeat the terrible % they had in the last game. I think they can if Fener defense forces them, and they have the best defense in the league.

Still took the safer spread option for here, since the big picture is that Fener is in great form and they need a win to keep up with a top of the table, and Paris needs nothing here.

I also played some interesting combo ML + alt total under, though I am not a big fan of that.

NBA | 76ers v Lakers | 🏀  

Brunson cashes with ease, even gets 7 as he ends with 9. Wish he got that last one but I’ll take 5.5 and 7+, hope some took it too.

Oubre has been cooking lately and especially in games without Paul George who’s suspended for a long time. I know my Lakers and I know that we have a hard time guarding the wings, Oubre should get some good looks from three here and has been hot from the 3 point line lately with 4, 3 &amp; 3 threes in his L3.

With 16+ minutes and no Paul George, he’s over in 14/18 games this season.

With Embiid active and no Paul George he’s over in 8/9 games &amp; 8 straight this season.

Embiid is questionable for this game, but I still like this one even if he sits. Just had 15 on 4/12 shooting without Embiid against GSW and is getting great volume in games without PG regardless. Doubt Embiid wants to miss this game tho, players rarely do (Lakers bias) 

Oubre gets a top tier matchup aswell as Lakers have allowed the MOST points to his position this season. Dropped 20 points against the Lakers in his most recent meeting (last season) where he had 18 FGA without Embiid.

Great spot for Oubre, love his 15.5 PA aswell if you have that available. Time to feast big dawg</td></tr>

Now that Reaves is back, that means better offense to an already good lakers offense and worse defense to an already bad defense.

Dougie Hamilton over 3.5 shots (+135) 

He went over that line for 3 games in a row now ever since Jack Hughes has been out of the lineup and with him still not available tonight, I expect another big game for Dougie. 

New Jersey shoots **a lot** when they play against the Islanders. In their 3 games against each other this season, the Devils have averaged **37 shots on goal**. Dougie had 7 shots in the last game between them. 

So by looking at the last 3 games without Jack and the fact that he went over that line easily in 2 out of his last 3 games against New York makes me confident he will go over again tonight!

Last Pick: South Alabama @ Appalachian State — Full Game Under 129.5

Result: ✅ WIN (Final total: 122)

Review: The game stayed under 129.5 because it played exactly to a mutual pace-suppression script rather than relying on missed shots alone. Both teams operated almost entirely in the half court, with limited fast-break opportunities and no sustained transition pressure. Shooting efficiency was modest on both sides, but more importantly, neither team generated easy points in the paint or at the line to inflate scoring late. The absence of foul escalation and the lack of urgency-driven tempo kept possessions long and scoring capped throughout. This was a clean structural under that won because the game never sped up.

College Basketball | NCAA Men’s Chicago State Cougars @ Central Connecticut State Blue Devils Wednesday, February 5, 2026 | 7:00 pm

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Full Game Under 138.5

Odds: -108 (DraftKings)

Write-Up:

This matchup sets up well for an under because the scoring ceiling is naturally capped by Chicago State’s offensive profile. Chicago State has struggled all season to generate efficient offense, especially on the road, and those issues are not pace-related — they stem from shot quality, finishing, and an inability to create easy points. When that type of offense travels, it tends to stay limited regardless of how the game unfolds.

CCSU doesn’t need to dominate or play slow for this under to stay intact. They typically operate in a controlled offensive structure and don’t push tempo aggressively when holding a lead. That matters here, because even if CCSU scores at a reasonable clip, Chicago State’s lack of scoring reliability keeps the overall total from inflating quickly. This is the type of game where one team doing “just enough” is still sufficient for the under.

The risk is clear and worth acknowledging: this under depends on Chicago State remaining inefficient. If CCSU has an unusually strong shooting night or Chicago State overperforms offensively, the margin narrows. Still, with the total sitting at 138.5, the market is pricing in more consistent offense than this matchup typically produces. Structurally, this game favors an outcome where the weaker offense sets the tone, not the other way around.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: Under 6.5 Goals (-135) 2.7u To Profit 2u

Write-Up: Jet Greaves gets a shutout and it ends 4-0, sweat free! Onto the next one, The Florida Panthers are coming to Tampa to play the Lightning. In net for the Panthers is Daniil Tarisov, he is having a good season for the 18 games he has been in net for them. Tarisov has a .904 save percentage and a 2.61 goals against average. For the Lightning, we have Alexander “The Great” Vasilevsky, he is a monster every season and this one is no different. This season, Vasilevsky has a save percentage of .918 and just a 2.14 goals against average which is insane. On the offensive side of things, the Lightning are strong ranking 2nd in the league in goals, but they are only 16th in shots on goal. On top of that, they are facing a Panthers goalie who’s been on fire and has a good save percentage. On the other side of offense, panthers aren’t really anything to be in awe of, ranking just 19th in goals. Both teams are great at limiting the shots which is going to be a key component. The Panthers defense is very good, with them ranking 5th in least shots allowed on their goalie, despite them not actually being in the opponents offensive zone as much as last year, so being that good at limiting shots is impressive. The Lightning are also great at limiting shots on goal, ranking 7th in least shots allowed on their goalie. With both goalies having high save percentage’s and both teams being elite at limiting shots on goal, there won’t be many opportunities to score, and these great goalies will be able to stop a big chunk of those shots that do get on net.

Take The Under 6.5 Goals!</td></tr>

**Write Up:** Italy is by far the favorite to win the Gold Medal. It&#x27;s their first game at this Olympics and will be looking to come out strong especially playing in front of the home fans. They are playing South Korea who lost yesterday to Sweden 10-3. They started off strong against Sweden going 2-1 up before falling back. A little bit of controversy happened when they called the game early because they were told it was mathematically impossible to win with 2 ends left which was not true. It&#x27;s common to admit defeat early in Curling but normally it will only happen if it&#x27;s going into the last end or it&#x27;s mathematically impossible to win.   
  
Anyways Italy should win this one Handily but the Handicap of -7.5 is too much for my liking. I like the over in this one. Italy should have a couple of 3-4 point ends and South Korea might even score a point or two.

BOL anyone who&#x27;s tailing Looking Forward To a Great Olympics 


Edit: Terrible Bad Beat. Italy 8-4 South Korea going into the final end and South Korea Concede with 2 stones left to go so no points go up on the board and it finishes 8-4. Sorry about this one lads. And Congrats to anyone who got Italy -3.5</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Borna Gojo vs Tristan Boyer | **Gojo ML at -152 (DK). 1 unit.**

Write-up: Friend closed at around -220, so I feel okay about that loss. On to the next one.

Borna Gojo is a talented player who stands at nearly 2m tall and possesses a powerful game reminiscent of Marin Cilic. Injuries and inconsistency have been major themes in his career, but when he&#x27;s timing the ball well, it can be extremely hard to stop him. In the first round here in Cleveland, he scored a dominant 6-0, 6-0 win over the 17-year-old Jack Kennedy (7.64 performance rating). It was clear that Kennedy was overmatched, but I didn&#x27;t feel that he gave the match away with unforced errors; rather, Gojo was able to take control from the start, earning free points on serve and taking a strong court position in rallies. 

On the other hand, Tristan Boyer only earned a 6.64 rating for his 4 &amp; 4 win over Garrett Johns. I will say that I think the rating slightly underrates his performance, as his forehand was doing a lot of damage, and he showed some good resilience to not get broken back at 4-3 in the second set. Boyer has the serve and physical attributes to succeed on fast courts, but actually developed his game on South American clay. The result is that he has developed a one-two punch game with a heavy forehand, but doesn&#x27;t approach the net as much as he maybe should. However, once you&#x27;re able to target Boyer&#x27;s backhand, things start to fall apart. Johns isn&#x27;t a bad player, but he doesn&#x27;t have the weapons for these conditions, and found himself constantly on defense in their match. In comparison, Gojo has the weaponry to dictate, and his serve into the Boyer backhand should score pretty often. Boyer&#x27;s topspin also tends to fall in the strike zone of taller players, and he actually holds an 0-7 record against players 6&#x27;2&quot; or taller in the last 52 weeks. Overall, I see Gojo having the advantage in the serve and backhand departments, and I think Boyer will need to make a lot of first serves and clip a lot of lines if he wants to win this. Gojo won&#x27;t win with a double bagel this time, but he should be able to move on here.</td></tr>

&gt;We are playing against Czech Republic again tomorrow, this time with a team that looked very strong in the opening draw, Sweden. The Czech team looked completely outclassed against Canada and Chabicovsky was particularly weak. Sweden is another very strong experienced team that will put a lot of pressure on the young Czech team. The bigger advantage for Sweden is actually with the women; Isabella was the best player on the ice in the opening draw and she should easily outshoot Zelingrova with draws and hits. Sweden are coming off a 10-3 win over a Korean team that I have ranked higher than the Czechs. Sweden won 10-4 in the only career head-to-head match between these teams. Should be another easy win for Sweden.

EDIT: FD put up -1.5, which is crazy so please hammer that if you see it but I&#x27;ll keep my -3.5 as my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark></td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** 2. BANJORA - WIN - $1.80 (Betting 4 units)    
**Write up:** <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s pick</mark> is BANJORA who is resuming for its second preparation and second race start. On debut was slowly away but mustered to sit 4th/5th, and showed great grit to wear down the leader BENEVAC, who has since won and run in much tougher races.      
     
Since that run BANJORA has trialled on two occasions. Firstly finishing 2nd after showing great gate speed and leading the field, and was applied absolutely no pressure. The second he again began brilliantly and sat 4 wide round the turn, finishing full of running without being tested at all. This improved ability to ping the gates implies maturity and development, and bodes well for us in the race since drawing barrier 4. The likely leader is one gate inside us, so I imagine us sitting just outside and in plenty of clear air.     
     
BANJORA is also yet to see a firm deck, but with the trials coming on ground that was borderline soft/good, I have no doubt we’ll handle it fine, and there’s even the potential of an improved showing on such a track.     
      
I think we’re a clear standout here, and the only horse we’re gonna have to get past is JUST AWESOME, which I’m fairly confident we’ll be able to do. GL!</td></tr>

* If anyone needs help finding the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> or a place to bet esports can always reach out!

Game/League/Time: Counterstrike 2 (CS2) | Nodwin Clutch Series #4 | 7:00 AM EST.

**Nuclear TigeRES:**

* Ended 2025 on a crazy run of form really solidifying themselves as a top tier two team after rising from relatively out of nowhere in the middle of the year. 2026 so far has been relatively the same, they have a 14-7 record in overall matches to start out the year, they are 33-20 in maps played overall at a \~62% win rate
* They were a playoff invite to Nodwin so they did not have to get thru group stage, they have played two playoff games to make it to semi finals, they beat UNiTY 2-0 (13-8/13-2), and upset 9INE <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> in a dominant 2-0 (13-7/13-9) as 2.20 underdogs
* Roster is built well overall, solid IGLing from Senka, strategically they have some really cool strats for a tier two team, they have clear star players/strong fire power at the top with z1k4/flouzer the Russian duo, and m1quse/ayuki as more supportive players
* TigeRES are currently at #42 in the world rn, they desperately want to keep stacking wins and gaining VRS points to try to crack the top 30, every win counts a ton and losses would hurt significantly adding even more incentive

**illwill:**

* illwill roster really seemed like a thrown together PUG team but has actually been performing better and more consistently as they get more reps in tier two, a weird mixture of russian IGL nEMANHA, french rifler hAdji, Romanian&#x27;s adamS and 7kick who randomly became an AWPer and has actually been doing a great job at it, and ukrainian fostar
* illwill have a very strong record this year at 15-5 overall, they have been farming lower tier  teams/tournaments relative to TigeRES, beating some tier 3/low tier two teams while Nuclear TigeRES is mostly in the mid-high tier two, but still a very strong record none the less. They have a 31-15 record in maps this year so far. They won a forfeit in RO16, and beat Betclic 2-0 in quarter finals (13-8/13-3)

**Projected Veto:**

* Nuclear TigeRES are the higher seed, they have side choice, 90-95% will <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> to choose second, they had side choice in the R016 against UNiTY and chose to veto 2nd as well
* illwill ban Ancient, Nuclear TigeRES ban Overpass
* illwill <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> Mirage, **Nuclear TigeRES <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> Inferno**

**Inferno Stats:**

* Nuclear TigeRES are 84% winrate on 19 maps of Inferno in the L3 months overall. It is their third highest played map in the pool, and their highest win rate currently. They are on a 4 map winstreak on Inferno.
* This TigeRES core was 15-3 on Inferno in 2025, averaged 54% winrate on CT side, and 66% on T side
* illwill are 33% winrate on 9 maps of Inferno in the L3 months overall. This is their only map with a &lt;50% winrate in the map pool at the moment, and by far their most uncomfortable.
* TigeRES have some extremely impressive Inferno wins against quality teams to start 2026, they are 5-2 this year so far, beating Nemesis 13-5, EYEBALLERS 13-6, and VP 13-10, they also had a very close lose to Gentle Mates 19-15, who might be the best Inferno team in all of tier two, very strong stuff
* illwill have very mixed results on Inferno, blown out by Tricked/FNC, close losses to BASEMENT BOYS/UNiTY, wins over Bet-M and Ursa, and in the last week have two relatively bad losses to 1WIN/FAVBET 13-7 each (both are very strong Inferno teams). They also had a win vs. ECSTATIC on Inferno 13-8 a week ago who are decently strong, but they also won both pistols</td></tr>

Tonight NIP plays possibly the worst team in the LPL. I don’t see this series being close, with NIP closing these games out rather easily. 

JDG I believe are a top 3 team and TES are no pushovers, but JDG has already beaten them once this year and I see them doing it again. I don’t trust them to take the series 2-0 but I don’t see them losing overall.

Fenerbahce need a win here as they sit on 3 points from 2 games in the cup so far. While Erzurumspor are doing great in their league, they got beat pretty hard (1-3) by Kocaelispor in this exact cup, showing they still struggle with the top tier sides. Although Fenerbahce can choose to rotate some here, they still have good depth that should be enough for some goals in this one.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Juventus DNB@1.88 (Coolbet) | **Stake: 3.5u**

**Write Up:** 

* Atalanta have won 1 of their last 21 home games against Juventus…
* Spalletti have only lost 2 of 20 games since taking over Juventus 

After a bad start to the season under Ivan Juric, Atalanta changed the coach and it got better for a long time, but now things have slowed down. Atalanta beat Parma 4-0 last home game, but also in the last five, they drew against Pisa who are in the relegation zone, lost both Champions League games that they were also favourites in and were massively lucky to get away with a 0-0 draw against Como on Sunday. 

Juventus has much the same story as Atalanta, as they also have gotten a whole lot better after sacking their manager. I will say that they are somewhat reliant on Kenan Yildiz to score and create chances, he is pretty clearly their best player at the moment and there is maybe some concern that he will not play this game. 

I don’t expect fireworks from this game, but for my money I believe Juventus has enough about them to see this game through in normal time with a 1-0 win.  </td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: ⛳️ Si Woo Kim top 20 finish including ties (+105)

Tournament starts at 9:20am EST, finishes Sunday evening. Bet 2u

Writeup: First thing to note here is the price of the bet has been moving like crazy since Monday. I got this originally at +125, and has since moved anywhere from +105 to -130. Do a little shopping around to try to get the best value.

I’ll also note that Kim has anywhere from the 3rd-5th best odds to win this entire event, and yet he is still listed as a plus money play in some books just to make top 20. Let’s capitalize on this.

The Waste Management Open is known for its fairly easier greens, making tee-to-green and strokes gained metrics very important if you want to come out on top in this tournament. Kim is currently 5th overall in tee-to-green metrics over the last 5 events this season, and is 4th in strokes gained. He is also leading in strokes gained specifically in his approach shots. Recently, Kim came tied for 2nd at the Farmers Insurance Open and tied for 6th at the American Express. In this tournament specially, he placed tied for 21st in 2025 and tied for 12th in 2024. I expect the winning score to be around -18, and with Kim having a Greens In Regulation of 75%, along with his fantastic ball striking with his iron play, I expect him to have a lot of birdie opportunities to keep climbing up the leaderboards. Kim has been a bit varied in his putting, but has recently earned 1.2 strokes gained from his putting over the last 5 events. 

I will be willing to say Kim will have some of the most birdie opportunities this entire tournament, the question will be if he can convert. Even if he is average in his conversion rate, his iron game and metrics in this area have been so good that he should be able to finish in the top 20 by the end of Sunday. A plus money play makes it even better.

​<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Tundra ML @ 1.76 (5u)

​Write Up:

We’re taking Tundra ML again.

Xtreme Gaming loves to play slow. They want to drag games out, farm up Ame, and stall until they hit their timings. The problem is that Tundra doesn&#x27;t let you do that. Tundra plays a suffocating, objective based style that chokes out the map early. They don&#x27;t just kill you, they take away your map so you can&#x27;t drag out the game.

Tundra also defeated XG back in the last BLAST slam using this exact same style. XG might be able to drag games out against other teams, but Tundra is too disciplined to let them get comfortable. XG is good, but Tundra is just a bad matchup for them play style wise.

**Confidence: 90%**

**Details: Al-Okhdood (Akhdoud) vs Al-Hilal - Saudi Pro League - 12:30 PM EST**

**---**

**The last 2 have just been stinky, let&#x27;s get back to normal. We&#x27;ve got 1st vs 15th in the SPL <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.**

**---**

**Al Hilal have played Al-Okhdood twice this season and have covered this line both times, achieving 7 and 11 corners in those games. Over 4 in both first quarters.**

**---**

The Saudi Pro League hasn&#x27;t failed us so far considering we&#x27;ve only touched the 2 best teams being Al Hilal and AL Nassr. The title race between these sides just brews heavy sided stats that fall in our favour.

Al Nassr have closed the gap over these past weeks, With Hilal now drawing 3 straight games anything less than 3 points tomorrow is confirmed capitulation. Al Hilal dominate the ball and give their opponents little to feed off out of possession. Considering Goal difference has been overlapped, 1 goal wont dwindle corner chances tmr.

**---**

* **Al Hilal** Average 6.7 Corners per game in the SPL
* In Al Hilal&#x27;s last 8 away games they&#x27;ve covered this line 7/8 with an average of 8.25 Corners Per Away game.
* In Al Hilal&#x27;s last 10 games they&#x27;ve covered this line 7/10.

**---**

* **Al Okhdood** are joint second for most corners conceded in the SPL at 6.2 Per game.
* Al Okhdood are coming off 3 straight games conceding over 7 corners ( 7, 12, 10 corners) 
* Al Okhdood have played 7 games against the top 6 this season and this line has covered in 5/7 with an average of 7.7 Corners conceded PG
* Again, they have conceded Over 6.5 corners in both matchups against Al Hilal this season

**Bet:** [Blanchet U.](https://www.flashscore.dk/spiller/blanchet-ugo/pSmNT7D2/) with handicap 4,5 games at odds 1.66

**Units:** 1 Units

**Explanation:**

Ugo Blanchet has really played well recently and won some big matches. He is playing against Fils who have not played a lot this year and have been out for some months. The match is being played on indoor hardcourt and should support a close match. In fact Fils has only played 1 match against Royer, which was a close 3 set match and the latest match before that was back in October.

I believe Ugo&#x27;s great shape and matches indoors support him and Fils is in my opinion favored too big in this match up. Fils is the better player overall but as his current form is questionable, we need to play Ugo with +4,5 games.

I see a good value in this bet and good luck!

### ⚽ <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: River Plate Reserve ML @ 1.62 (-161) - 3 Units


We are on a **4-win heater**. After comfortably hitting the Racing <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> yesterday, we’re staying in the Reserve League (Proyección) because the books still haven&#x27;t adjusted to the massive gap between these squads.

* **River Plate (Home):** &quot;La Maquinita&quot; is a powerhouse. Their academy is world-class, and at home, they play with a level of intensity and technical superiority that mid-table teams just can&#x27;t handle. They are coming in with great rhythm.

* **The Fade (Talleres):** Talleres’ reserve side is in a complete freefall. They’ve managed to win only 1 of their last 10 matches, losing 6 of them. But here is the kicker: **they haven’t won an away game in 7 months.** * **The Play:** I’m bumping this up to 3 units. River is superior in every single department, and Talleres’ psychological barrier when playing away from home is too big to ignore. 1.62 is a gift for a mismatch of this caliber.


BOL!!!

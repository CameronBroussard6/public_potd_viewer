**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s Event:** Champion&#x27;s League  | Bodø/Glimt vs Man City (18:45 GMT+2)

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Glimt Over 8.5 Shots@1.98  (7Red) | Stake: 4u unit to win 3.92 units

**Write Up:** 

This will be Manchester City&#x27;s seventh game since the start of the year, that&#x27;s a game every three days. Then we add the injuries they have in defense, with John Stones, Ruben Dias, Matheus Nunes and Gvardiol all out. Additionally Bernardo Silva is suspended and Rodri is coming back from injury so I doubt Pep will risk him with another 90 minutes after just doing so against Manchester United. His natural replacement is also injured (Nico Gonzales).

Bodø/Glimt is also playing on an artificial pitch which also gives them a small advantage, but Glimt is also just straight up very decent at home and can definitely create a lot of trouble for this City side that we just saw this weekend can be got at with counter attacks.

* **Glimt shots at home:** 18 (Juventus), 17(Monaco), 18(Spurs), 17 (Sturm Graz, playoffs)
* **City Shots Against Away:** 11, 10, 10, 7, 16, 16, 12, 9, 2, 9, 11 | Only Forest and Swansea in the League cup has failed to have 9+ shots on this run of games

There is definitely a big gap between the teams still, with the missing players. City just spent a casual £20M minimum on a centerback and gave him 300k in weekly wages, that is about the same amount of money Glimt paid for their seven most expensive signings... And his wages is about 27 times what Glimt&#x27;s best paid player is earning! Guehi is not available for this game, that also goes for Semenyo as they can&#x27;t registered before the knockout stage.

Bodø/Glimt is also out of season as their season ended in December. They have been spending their last two weeks getting matchfit and playing two friendlies in Spain.

When Glimt are home I believe they can create trouble for anybody, I&#x27;m not deluded enough to think they can win this one, but they should be able to throw some punches and make things much harder for City than what a lot of TV pundits might think.

City are in a decent spot in the top 8, while navigating multiple competitions, surely they would like to win here, however not as much as Bodo who are in a must win situation with nothing to lose. Bodo cleared this line in all home games in the season that just ended for them. In CL home games, Bodo had 18 shots vs Juve, 17 vs Monaco, 18 vs Spurs, 17 vs Sturm Graz. City do not allow that much, however they still allow a good amount in away games, most recently 10 vs Sunderland, 11 to United, 10 vs Newcastle, 16 vs Palace, 12 vs Fulham.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Tottenham Vs Dortmund - **Over 2.5 Total Goals @ 1.74 (Melbet)**

**Write Up:** Tottenham and Dortmund meet in the Champions League with very different momentum. Spurs come into this match under pressure after a poor run domestically, while Dortmund arrive full of confidence from strong league and European performances. Tottenham’s recent form highlights growing defensive issues. They haven’t won any of their last five matches in all competitions, conceding twice in losses to West Ham and Aston Villa. Even in the draw away at Bournemouth, they let control slip despite scoring twice.

At home in the Champions League, Spurs have looked much stronger. Comfortable wins over Slavia Prague (3-0) and FC Copenhagen (4-0) showed they can dominate when given space. However, their struggles under heavy pressure remain clear, especially away from home, as seen in the five goals conceded against PSG. Defensively, Spurs have kept just one clean sheet in their last five matches. While the 0-0 draw at Monaco showed good control, recent domestic games suggest their focus drops when matches become more open.

Dortmund come into this match in much steadier form. They’re unbeaten in their last five games across all competitions and have scored 13 goals in that run. Wins over Werder Bremen and Villarreal showed their ability to take control early and keep up attacking pressure. In the Champions League, Dortmund have scored four goals in three of their last four matches. Away wins at Copenhagen and strong performances at Manchester City highlight how well they adapt on the road without losing their attacking edge. While they do concede at times, they make up for it with goals, having scored 19 Champions League goals this season, the most of the two teams.

Tottenham have averaged 1.6 goals scored and 1.2 goals conceded across their last 10 home matches. Seven of those games went Over 2.5 Goals, with an overall average of 2.8 goals per game. Dortmund, meanwhile, have averaged 2.0 goals scored and 1.8 goals conceded in their last 10 away matches. Six of those games finished Over 2.5 Goals, with a higher overall average of 3.8 goals per game.

Given how both teams play, this looks like a match where both sides should be able to find the net. Their styles point towards a more open game with chances at both ends. Spurs have scored in four of their five Champions League matches, while Dortmund’s last four European games have all seen at least three goals. Tottenham will also be without Micky van de Ven and Ben Davies, which could give Dortmund opportunities to exploit defensively.

**Man, I missed the Champions League, and we’ve got a hell of a lineup of games tomorrow.**

Madrid are under a lot of pressure with Alonso leaving the club. Barcelona showed bright new life over the weekend, and a Champions League home game is where that pressure can really reach its limits.

Coming up against a Monaco side that’s in the middle of an identity crisis screams *low block*. I expect Monaco to frustrate them, leading to the final 15 minutes of each half being all about forcing corners from byline darts.

COPENHAGEN VS NAPOLI

Date: 20 JANUARY 2026 at 21:00

BET ON: Over / Under- Over +2.50

Odd: 1.98



\- In press conferences on both sides, Jacob Neestrup and Antonio Conte have revealed setups and injury impacts that point toward an open, attack-prone match with goals at both ends — a compelling backdrop for Over 2.50 goals. Neestrup has stressed that Copenhagen arrive with confidence and fresh intensity after a positive winter camp, and despite recent rest he wants his team to seek victory through proactive football, not defensive caution. Danish media report Copenhagen’s only absentees are long-term injuries to Rodrigo Huescas and Magnus Mattsson, meaning Neestrup can still field an offensive-minded XI and intends to press Napoli high and exploit transitions rather than sit deep. On the Napoli side, Conte’s presser made clear that injuries have forced tactical reshuffles — Politano and Rrahmani were lost in the last game and Neres still struggles with an ankle issue, leaving gaps on both flanks and in central defence which Napoli must cover with rotated personnel and untested solutions. Conte himself acknowledged these challenges repeatedly, saying his focus is on “finding solutions” with the players available and preparing the team to compete in attack and defence, not just shut up shop. Italian press highlights that Napoli’s absentees weaken defensive structure and force Conte into a more open tactical shape because he cannot rely on his best cover or wingers to sit deep and counter; instead he will likely push available attackers forward to chase a win that keeps Napoli in contention. Combined with Copenhagen’s motivation to score early and Napoli’s need to respond quickly when pressed — plus Conte’s acknowledgment of the difficulty in juggling an intense schedule and injury gaps — the tactical signals from both benches point toward an open game with goals on both sides, making Over 2.50 goals a strongly justified <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>.</td></tr>

**Last Pick Summary**: After a pretty good sweat with our Senegal bet on Sunday, Levadiakos delivered us a beautiful start to the week with 2 goals in the first 10 minutes, and a dominant 3-1 win! Congrats to anyone who tailed this one, that was cashed early and easily.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s Write Up:** 2 in a row, let’s stay locked in. Levadiakos gave us a no sweat bet, and we move on to Tuesday’s Champions League slate. I will be laying some action on most of these matches, but I think my favorite <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> comes from Dortmund vs. Tottenham. 

I love to watch Dortmund play because they are extremely offensively effective (3 goals in each of their last 3 games) which makes for exciting matches. They regularly have multi-goal games, and when they are away from home, they almost always concede at least 1 goal (especially against competent opponents). 

It’s true, Spurs have been a solid home team so far in 2026, but Tottenham is in trouble. They are only 2 days removed from a 2-1 loss at home against relegation threatened West Ham. They have a number of key players missing due to injury. Chants were booming through the stadium calling for the sacking on Thomas Frank. It is pure chaos in Tottenham at the moment.

They have proven to be able to handle sides like Slavia Prague and FC Copenhagen. They are a month of turmoil removed from that last Champions League win, and Slavia Prague is not even close to the same level as Dortmund. I think Tottenham will feel they have something to prove in this one after the West Ham nightmare. This will open the lanes up for Dortmund and I expect them to be able to put 2+ into the net before the final whistle blows.</td></tr>

Event: Australian Open R1 🎾

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Eva Lys 🇩🇪 ML vs Sorana Cirstea 🇷🇴 4 units to win 4U @2.00 (Bet365)

Lys will have some very good memories of the happy Ssam having reached the fourth round last year as a lucky loser to catapult her 35 spots into the top 100. Curently the No. 39 her game has seen some serious growth over the last few months. She had a solid end to her year, reaching the quarters of the Beijing WTA 1000 and picking up her first top 10 win over Rybakina in the process. She started her year at the United Cup defeating Lamens easily (2 and 2) followed by a close three set loss against No. 2 Swiatek, a player against whom she’d previously only won 7 games against in three matches. That match really exemplified the improvements she’s made and I really expect a big year from her. Lys has always been a good baseliner with great movement but it’s the depth she’s been hitting at on top of her redirection of pace by taking the ball extremely early and be aggressive from it that has impressed me. That should pay dividends in this match.

Cirstea announced that this was her last year on tour after almost 20 years on the big stage. Credit to the No. 41 who had a really solid season last year, going 28-18 and picking up a title in Cleveland. She’s also had a decent start to the season, defeating Pavlyuchenkova and Ostapenko before losing to Sabalenka and defeating Eikeri and Rakhimova in the Adelaide qualifying. So why am I predicting Lys to win? Well first of all she had to withdraw from the Adelaide main draw due to an ankle injury that seemed to bother here against Rakhimova where she was second best. That could suggest that, especially at her age, she isn’t 100% fit and against a player that will make her move as much as Lys could be a death sentence if it’s the case. The match-up is also tough for Cirstea, who is a flat aggressive baseliner who goes for winners as soon as she can, playing a low margin game and will have the serve advantage. However in rallies (which will multiply as the game goes on in our favour), Lys is going to return a hell of a lot more balls than against the average opponent plus with depth and consistency which is going to cause more a whole load more errors from the Romanian who often lacks a plan B. On top of the physical aspect that the German brings to the table it could be a recipe for disaster for the 35 year old as the match proceeds against her younger opponent and the unforced errors accumulate. There’s also the fact that Cirstea is 1-7 in grand slams since reaching the US Open quarters in 2023. Lys easily beat Cirstea on hard in ‘23 as well when she was ranked 100 spots below her (1-0 H2H). If I were to compare Eva to a player it would be Leylah Fernandez against whom Sorana went 0-2 against last year. On the opposite spectrum, the closest to the Romanian would be Boulter (Collins/Vekic would be better but Lys never played them) whom the German destroyed 2,1 in October.

This isn’t a lock of a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> (just like with any) as Cirstea could very well red-line with everything going in due to the nature of her game but I simply have to disagree with Lys being the short underdog so I see a lot of value here. BOL !</td></tr>

Last Pick: Laslo Djere ML vs Stan Wawrinka (-102, 1 unit): Loss

Tennis | Phan Thiet Challenger | 12:20 AM EST (estimated)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Yosuke Watanuki vs Omar Jasika | Watanuki to win 2-0 at -165 (DK). 1 unit. 

Write-up: I really wouldn&#x27;t have predicted that Wawrinka would not only win the match, but actually come back from a set down to do so. That brings me to two losses in a row for the first time since last September, and while I think the first one was still a decent read, that one definitely was not. In general, the opportunities for finding value at Grand Slams, and even tour level to an extent, are extremely thin, and I don&#x27;t trust myself to find it right now. I&#x27;m happy to be up a couple of units betting on main tour events to start the year, but I&#x27;ll likely be moving back to Challengers for a while.

Yosuke Watanuki enters the Phan Thiet Challenger as the No. 1 seed and clear title favorite. Watanuki has a solid Challenger resume with five career titles to his name (including one in November 2025 in Kobe), all on Asian hard courts. Watanuki has gone 4/4 in the first round of Challenger events where he is the top seed, and should be able to extend that here against Omar Jasika. Watanuki should come in here with a fair bit of confidence after pushing Norwegian prospect Budkov Kjaer, who ended up qualifying for the main draw, to three sets in their Australian Open match. 

Omar Jasika was once a solid performer on the Challenger Tour, though his strong results were largely limited to Australian events. However, Jasika really lost his way in 2025, going 15-19 overall (9-17 outside of Australia), including five consecutive losses to end the year. He hasn&#x27;t looked much better to start 2026, either. In the Noumea Challenger, he was blasted off the court by Michael Zheng; another thing to note about that match was that Zheng was a bigger favorite than Watanuki is here, yet I see them at a similar level. Then, he was ousted 6 &amp; 0 in the first round of qualifying for the AO by Kimmer Coppejans, who isn&#x27;t close to the same level as Budkov Kjaer. 

In terms of the matchup, Watanuki already has a 1-0 edge in the head-to-head, having defeated Jasika in straight sets on grass in July of last year. Like several other Australian players, Jasika actually has quite a bit of experience on grass, but wasn&#x27;t able to generate a single break point in the match, which took place in the midst of a similar slump. Watanuki also had a 6-2 balance against lefties last year, beating Gaston, Bellucci, Monday, and Monteiro. Watanuki is the much stronger server here, and while his results on return are mixed, he is extremely adept at attacking weaker serves (which won&#x27;t be good news for Jasika, who was clocked at just 167 kmh in Melbourne). Jasika gets plenty of returns in play and will be able to get himself into some rallies here, but I don&#x27;t see his combination of high-spin forehand/low-spin backhand troubling Watanuki here. Watanuki has previously seen success against this style against guys like Gaston and Bellucci; he even has a famous head-to-head advantage against Frances Tiafoe, who plays a more powerful version of the game as a right-handed player. Jasika also likes to play the finesse game, but one thing you&#x27;ll notice about Watanuki is that he loves to play cat-and-mouse points. Overall, this is one of my more confident plays of 2025, though it&#x27;s not quite in 2-unit territory.</td></tr>

Something new and it hits. I continue on the positive streak. Van Gerwen made it a bit of a sweat but luckily for me the opponent hit only 1 if his 9 double opportunities. Sometimes luck can still be on my side. 

**Write Up:** 

What I looked at first is that both Sporting CP and PSG are still playing for something. Which means they will be motivated to perform. 

Sporting CP their home games in the Champions League saw 11 goals in 3 games and PSG away saw 12 goals in 3 games. 

BTTS &amp; o2.5 hit in 2/3 games for both teams. PSG having a 0-0 draw and Sporting CP having a 3-0 win to not make it 3/3. 

Both also hit BTTS &amp; o2.5 goals in 4/6 CL matches total 

I expect both teams to go into the match with full confidence of a positive result. Which will mean chances on both ends of the pitch
Only a 2U play. I want to play it a bit safe as I am so close to hitting positive units since I started. Also the slate <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> isn&#x27;t as comforting to me as other days.

Given Golubic&#x27;s record at Grand Slams, I&#x27;m happy to take the risk on Gracheva here.

Tuesday’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> - Ben Shelton + Joao Fonseca +143 (1u to win 1.43u)

FYI, this match is Tuesday in Australia, but it’s Monday night in the U.S., so you’ll have to get in quick.

We’ve got an exciting first round matchup between Shelton and Humbert. Very tough draw for Shelton, going up against a guy who made the final in Adelaide and is one of the top unseeded players in the tournament. However, I think this is a good opportunity to buy in at a low price on Shelton. His odds for the matchup are around -165 for a guy who has only lost in the first round of a major once (his slam debut in 2022). I’m not as worried about Shelton not having as much of a tune up to the tournament and think he can still have the upper hand in this matchup.

In order to boost the odds, I added Fonseca as well, who feels destined for a thrilling 3rd round matchup against Sinner. He’s going up against an American Spizzirri, who has reached his ATP career high of 85, but doesn’t have much slam experience. This is his second slam (US Open last year). This should negate some concerns about Fonseca not having a ton of slam success despite having a great 2025. He should be able to build off of his year last year and make some deep runs this year, as well as win this matchup.

Good Luck!</td></tr>

Champion&#x27;s League is back and I&#x27;m hoping the change will get us back on track. Bodo (Norwegian side) host heavily favored Man City as they battle for their Champion&#x27;s League lives. A loss for Bodo here elimates them from playoff contention, whereas a win inches them closer to a spot. Bodo are 0-3-3 in the Champion&#x27;s League. They concede a lot but also score a lot. All of their matches other than 1 (5/6) have had 4 goals or more, their most recent home match against Juventus ended 2-3. Being in Norway, winter is their off season so the team has not played a match in over a month. This means they&#x27;ll have fresh legs, but may be a bit rusty. 

Man City are currently sitting 4th in the table and will desperately want a win here to progress towards locking up a top 8 spot and avoiding the playoffs. Man City very much need a palate cleanser after some rough EPL matches. Haaland especially has been cold and needs a goal, I&#x27;m expecting him to put in 1-2 goals here in his home country to help his team stay in the top 8.

**Event/Match:** Football | Champions League — Copenhagen vs Napoli (20:00 WET)

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Napoli ML @1.90 (4u) 

**Write-Up:**

Holy hell, Beer Sheva goalkeeper was just atrocious last game. After only 4 minutes, he made a mistake that not even my local league keeper would make, giving Tel Aviv the chance to sit back and play far more conservatively. As the game went on, Beer Sheva created lots of chances but only managed to convert one. Then, almost in the final minute, Tel Aviv had their only shot of the entire second half. The goalkeeper was perfectly positioned, yet somehow let it in with a poor touch. With any decent goalkeeper they would have won the game, but it is what it is. Hopefully <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> we get a fairer outcome. Now, onto the Champions League.

Both teams come into this level on points, sitting 23rd and 24th with 7 points.

Napoli are the stronger side overall, despite their inconsistent Champions League campaign so far. They sit 3rd in Serie A, competing week in and week out against a much higher level of opposition. FC Copenhagen are currently 5th in the Danish league, which already says a lot about the gap in quality between the two teams and their domestic environments.

Copenhagen have picked up some important European results recently, but context matters. They are coming off a long competitive break, with no official matches since mid-December, and have only played friendlies since. Against a well-structured Conte side, that lack of match sharpness can be costly, especially early on.

Napoli’s away form in the Champions League has clearly been an issue, but they’ve shown in Serie A that they can manage tough road games, recently taking points against Inter and winning away at Lazio. 

Even acknowledging Copenhagen’s strong home atmosphere, this is a matchup where Napoli’s superior squad quality, tactical discipline, and experience at a higher competitive level should prevail. I’m backing Napoli to get the job done and take a crucial three points in a tight but controlled away performance.

<tr><td class='post'>**Record:** 39-18-1 (+22.32u) | L5: 5-0 (5W)

**Last:** (CBB) Michigan State -3.5 (1.5u) - ✅

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** (CBB) Michigan State (-10.5) at Oregon

**Start Time:** 9:00 PM ET (FS1)

**Odds:** -110 (DraftKings)

**Units:** 1.5U

**Reasoning:** “Hey, babe, wake up. Michigan State plays tomorrow.”

After a 58-56 defeat at then-No. 13 Nebraska, the Spartans (16-2) have been on quite a roll. The team has reeled off four consecutive victories—all by double-digits—with an average margin of victory of 19.3 points. That includes our last POTD on Saturday when Michigan State delivered an emphatic 80-63 victory as just 3.5-point favorites. 

But if Saturday’s spread was disrespectful, Tuesday night’s line against Oregon is just downright blasphemous.

In what is quickly becoming a season to forget, the Ducks (8-10) enter this matchup as losers of four-straight. That includes losing three-in-a-row by double-digits with an average margin of defeat of 18.3 points. In fact, after a 4-0 start, Oregon has mustered just four wins over its last 14 outings. To make matters worse, the team will also be down its two leading scorers in big man Nate Bittle (16.3 PPG) and guard Jackson Shelstad (15.6 PPG). 

Here’s hoping the Spartans defense is bringing its appetite to Eugene, as a feast may be in order. 
Through 18 games, the unit ranks 8th in scoring defense (64.2 PPGA), 11th in defensive efficiency (0.920), 11th in opponent field-goal percentage (39.0%) and 30th in opponent three-point shooting (29.8%). Following an uncharacteristic performance against Cornell—97 points allowed on 46% shooting—Michigan State’s defense has been absolutely lights out, conceding just 59.6 points on 38.5% shooting (25.0% from beyond the arc) over its last five games. Furthermore, as we highlighted in Saturday’s post, the team has performed even better away from home, ranking 1st in defensive efficiency (0.951), 2nd in scoring defense (64.2 PPGA) and 5th in opponent field-goal percentage (38.8%). That all makes for absolute nightmare fuel for a shorthanded Ducks offense that ranks just  155th in offensive efficiency (1.066), 174th in scoring (75.2 PPG), 203rd in three-point shooting (33.5%) and 239th in field-goal percentage (43.2%) while averaging just 62.7 points on 38.7% shooting (26.8% from the perimeter) over its last three contests. 

On the other end of the floor, the offensive emergence of sophomore guard Jeremy Fears Jr. should help the Spartans stay hot.

Thus far, the team ranks 60th in offensive efficiency (1.133) 83rd in field-goal percentage (46.8%), 99th in three-point shooting (35.3%) and 100th in scoring (79.1 PPG). Although known mostly for his knack for distributing the ball—he ranks 2nd nationally in assists (8.6 per game)—Fears has scored almost at will as of late, averaging 17.8 points over his last six outings. That added firepower should help Michigan State expose a reeling Oregon defense that enters Tuesday night’s matchup ranked 120th in opponent field-goal percentage (43.4%), 158th in opponent three-point shooting (33.4%), 173rd in scoring defense (74.6 PPGA) and 191st in defensive efficiency (1.058). Those numbers have only free-fallen over the team’s last four games, dropping to 82.8 PPGA on 47.8% shooting (41.6% from deep). 

Look for the battle on the glass to once again play a crucial role.

If the Ducks have one strength, it’s their ability to grab offensive rebounds, ranking 27th in the category (11.5 per game). Unfortunately, limiting such opportunities happens to be an area where the Spartans excel. On the season, the team ranks 1st in opponent offensive rebounding (6.2), 1st in opponent offensive rebounding percentage (18.5%), 1st in defensive rebounding percentage (81.5%) and 10th in defensive rebounding (27.2). It’s actually Michigan State which should have the advantage in the category, as the team ranks 8th in offensive rebounding percentage (38.3%) and 15th in offensive rebounding (11.9) as opposed to Oregon’s rankings of 164th in opponent offensive rebounding (9.0) and 181st in defensive rebounding (22.4%). 

However, it will be the fast break that dooms the hosts.

It’s no secret that the Spartans love to play fast. So it comes as no surprise that the team is quite elite when it comes to fast break points, ranking 8th in the category (16.9 PPG; 98th percentile). On the other hand, this is yet another area of concern for the Ducks, as the team has ranked just 232nd in fast break points allowed (10.9 PPG; 37th percentile). 

And if you’re weary of the large spread, don’t be.

On the year, Michigan State has squared off with seven opponents outside of the Top 100 in NET rating—Oregon ranks 101st. Not only is the team 7-0 with an average margin of victory of 20.0 points in those contests, but each of those victories have come by nine or more points. That includes all but two coming by 17 or more points. 

In what should be yet another home road contest, trust Sparty to get the job done by 15+.

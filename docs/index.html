**Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Football - EPL - Leeds v West Ham - Under 2.5 Goals - $1.85 - 1.5 Units ❌

IMO, another completely unlucky result in the end. After a horrid start with a 3rd minute goal from a rebound it looked as if we were in for a tough bet from the get go. An early goal changes game plans and really was the worst possible scenario for our bet.

This was followed by a 15th minute goal from a corner before the game really had time to settle. This corner was 1 of 3 awarded roughly until the 60th minute mark. We stayed in the bet until the 90th minute as Leeds were stubborn for a long time and held out well to restore hope.

However, West Ham managed an amazing last minute goal from Bowen&#x27;s ball into Matheus Fernandes (an unlikely header of the ball) which killed our bet.

I feel my judgement was okay here contrary to what people may believe. West Ham were pretty toothless once again and that extremely early goal really was a dagger. With around 2.0xg for the game in total, tbh I&#x27;d say we were hard done by.

Still sitting at a 75% win rate and +units so hope I haven&#x27;t turned too many off with recent form.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Football - A-League - Melbourne City vs Perth Glory - Melbourne City (-1.5) - $2.30 - 1.5 Units

Well a 3rd harsh loss in a row will see me going for a bit of a riskier play here, but it&#x27;s great value for the match after analysis. Game will start in 8 hours roughly.

Perth Glory will travel to Melbourne for the second round of the A-League after a 2-2 draw with Wellington Pheonix (who had to travel 7 hours to get there). Perth only retained 29% possession in the game, opting for a counter attacking approach.

They are notoriously bad travellers, and only managed 4 wins from 26 games last year which was good enough for last place in the league. Comparatively, City finished 2nd on the table and were eventual Champions, defeating Victory in the Grand Final.

City managed a 1-1 draw away from home against Western Sydney in the opening round (who I think will be really strong this year). They also played midweek in the Asian Champions League managing a 2-1 come from behind victory against Thai side Buriram, showing good character in both games to be down and manage results.

City&#x27;s defence should be too good for Perth. I can&#x27;t see Perth getting more than a goal in this game, although I do worry a touch about veteran striker Adam Taggart who managed a goal last week but comparatively Max Caputo is in great form for City, scoring in the last 2 matches. The striker has just returned from the Under 20&#x27;s World Cup with 2 goals to his name in the competition as well.

I like the fact that City have a bit more game time in their legs having played more competitive games recently than Perth. Overall I think the class of City is too much for them, and they&#x27;ll be hungry to get their first win on the board in the league against a starting 11 of aging players that managed 29% possession at home against a jet lagged Wellington.

**12 wins in 16 bets**, well done to any followers. No pressure whatsoever, but if you are willing, any help will go a long way.

Last Pick: Norman Powell o21.5 points -105 (TBD)
<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Aleksandar Rakic ML -112 (FanDuel)
Event: UFC 321 Main Card 2:00 PM EST.
Explanation: I was between this and 3-4 other picks on UFC 321 but landed on Rakic for a number of reasons.

I’ll start with the negatives first. Rakic is on a 3 fight losing streak. He’s facing 15-0 undefeated Azamat Murzakanov. Rakic has been KO/TKO’d twice in those last 3 while Azamat has KO/TKO’d 4 of his 5 UFC opponents. Rakic is a bit chinny and Azamat has late round power that could steal the fight.

However, if you look into the numbers you’ll get a much fuller story. Rakic has lost 3 straight to 3 former titleholders in Jan Blachowicz, Jiri Prochazka and Magomed Ankalaev. Against Jan he was a win away from a title shot and had just dominated the 2nd round before his knee gave out early in the third, requiring him to take 2 years off. He came back last year to face Jiri in a fight in which he looked incredibly sharp in. Rakic dominated with leg kicks in round 1 and 2, hard enough to arguably fold any other fighter in the division but the insanely durable Jiri. He’d get caught late in the 2nd and TKO’d but looked great despite a 2 year layoff. He’d quickly turn around to face Ankalaev in another fight he’d look good in. He’d win a close round 1 before losing round 2 more decisively. If you remember his coaches were feeding him terrible information and he fought a solid but careful third round before losing 29-28 on all scorecards.

Rakic could’ve won all 3 of those fights which is a big what if but shows his position as being closer to the elite of the light heavyweight division than being another can. 

Rakic has a number of things in his favor. He’s massive compared to Azamat as he’ll be around 6’4 230 on fight day compared to Murzakanov being closer to 5’10 220. His leg kicks are elite and should be a massive advantage against a guy who he has a big reach advantage on and an athleticism advantage. He’s also fully capable of fighting a boring, controlling fight where he mixes in wrestling and controls the range with his kicks and jabs.

How can he lose? Murzakanov has big time power. He’s aggressive and can walk through shots to get in range and bomb overhands through Rakic’ guard. 

My prediction is a decision win for Rakic. I don’t think it’ll be sweat free and there will probably be a moment where Rakic gets hit but I think he’s just much more talented as mixed martial artist. Rakic is desperate for his first win in over 4 years and has switched camps to his home country as opposed to the knuckleheads who might’ve thrown his last fight. 

Rakic could get a TKO/KO set up by leg kicks but I think the undefeated Murzakanov will be overwhelmed by the pressure as opposed to jumping into the fire. Expect a slow fight of mostly stand up, if Murzakanov gets into a clinch then you could see Rakic drop for a single leg and take him down, another strength of his. He should know that if he keeps the fight on his terms he’s winning 99/100 times and has the skill to keep it there for at least 2/3 rounds.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Indiana -25.5 -115 3u to win 2.8**



***UCLA Bruins @ Indiana Hoosiers, Bloomington, Indiana, 12pm kickoff.***



Indiana loves beating the shit out of lesser teams, particularly at home. They beat the hell out of a highly ranked Illinois team, 63-10 a few weeks back. They beat the hell out of Michigan State 38-13 (Which should have been a cover but Michigan State has some sneaky sneaky stuff going on over there in regards to spreads and head scratching late game decisions), and handedly dispatched their 2 other OOC opponents for an average win margin of 60+. The only team that scratched and clawed was Old Dominon in Week 1, which is a bit of an outlier.



Last year at home they beat the hell out of UCLA at the Rose Bowl, and ran over every other team that was lesser than them all season long. Their insane point differential was one of the biggest reasons they made the playoffs last year in spite of their pretty sub-par SOS.



UCLA is not good. If you’d like a full breakdown on my thoughts of UCLA’s recent success you can look at my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> from last week’s UCLA vs Maryland game. A lot of it still holds true, and they weren’t able to cover against Maryland at home, looking extremely vulnerable in the second half of that game.



I’m keeping it simple. Curt Cignetti is fired up for this matchup against a Cinderella story UCLA team and is pretty excited to curb stomp them in front of 52,000 IU fans. UCLA doesn’t have the firepower to compete with Indiana, and they don’t have the ability to sneak up on them because they put themselves on alert with any teams that face them in the future by winning 3 straight. Indiana will take this game seriously and beat the piss out of UCLA. I like Indiana first half cover as well, removing the chance of a backdoor cover, which is always a possibility with a big spread like this. I think they come out strong early to set the tone.</td></tr>

Last bet: Liverpool vs Man United - Liverpool moneyline/to win. Odds : 1.6. UK time ❌

Todays <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> Brighton vs Man United - Brighton Double Chance - to draw or win . Odds : 1.8. UK time 15:00

Man we&#x27;ve had some bad luck this season, united score when the play should stop for a head injury and Liverpool then have countless really good chances which they miss, they definitely should have won that game. 

This leads me on to this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, united are still not a very good team. They&#x27;ve finally won two PL games in a row for the first time in forever and I can see them coming back down to earth here. They didn&#x27;t impress me against Liverpool despite winning and I made this same <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> for the same fixture last season, Brighton won with ease. I don&#x27;t expect it be that comfortable here but the odds are far too good. Until united prove they are a good team and can beat the likes of Brighton regularly then I will continue to bet against them which has won me a lot of money over the last couple of seasons. 

Brighton are a very decent side, they&#x27;ve beaten man city and Newcastle this season and have a great young coach who consistently gets Brighton performing well in big games. Following a good win last week I can see them getting a result here too, be that a draw or a win</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Ross “Smudger” Smith to win by -1.5 legs vs Daryl “only thing big is his chin and ego” Gurney at -150 for 3u to win 2u on FD

Writeup: I’ll try to keep this to the punch, because I firmly believe it’s going to be hard missing Gurney fucking chin tomorrow. Ross Smith looks primed to take down him by a couple of legs tomorrow…his recent form and stats just stack up stronger across the board. Smith’s averaging around 97 this season, a few points higher than Gurney’s 93, and he’s been throwing heavier scores with far more 180s (0.36 per leg vs 0.24). Over a long best-of-19, that kind of power scoring builds real momentum. Add in a slightly sharper checkout rate (42.5% to Gurney’s 40.8%) and better accuracy on his doubles, and it’s easy to see how Smith can edge out the crucial legs that turn a tight game into a 10-8 or 10-7 type win.

Momentum’s also firmly on Smith’s side…he’s fresh off a red-hot run in the Players Championships where he hit multiple nine-dart legs and looked full of confidence. Gurney’s got the experience, sure, but he’s not been as consistent lately, often dipping below his best under pressure. Across a long format where scoring power and rhythm matter most, Smith’s steady averages and knack for clutch finishing should let him break free late and close it out by a comfortable two-leg margin.

Side note the only reason, IMO, that Gurney even is in round 2 is because Gerwyn Price couldn’t hit a fucking double to save his life. Price went fucking 3/17 on check out and average a, in this level, pathetic 91 average. GURNEY averaged LESS at 90, the checkout of 6/11 is the ONLY reason he won. Price had an off day and I don’t expect Gurney to come out of the boonies and win tomorrow.

As always, BOL, PLEASE DON’T OVER BET THIS, I know I’m on a “heater” 🤞 we make it 8 in a row tomorrow, but there’s still plenty of darts in the season. Don’t think this sport isn’t subject to dumb shit because I lost big on Gurney beating Price yesterday….

Borussia Monchengladbach vs Bayern Munich

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> : Bayern Over 2.5 Goals @1.65 for 5u

Bayern are on a 12-match winning streak across all competitions and have been perfect in the Bundesliga with seven straight wins, scoring 27 goals in those seven games, which means they average nearly 4 goals per match. They just destroyed Club Brugge 4-0 in the Champions League on Wednesday night, and before that beat Dortmund 2-1 in their last league match. Harry Kane is the main reason for their incredible goal-scoring form with 12 goals in just 7 Bundesliga games this season, and he has 20 goals in all competitions already, showing he scores in almost every single match. The team also has Luis Díaz with 5 goals and Michael Olise with 4 goals supporting Kane, so goals can come from anywhere on the pitch.

Borussia Mönchengladbach are sitting at the bottom of the table with the worst record in the league, having scored only 6 goals all season while letting in 15 goals in just 7 games. They have zero wins, lost 3-1 to Union Berlin last weekend, and their defense is so weak that Bayern should score multiple goals easily. Bayern have already hit over 2.5 goals in six of their seven Bundesliga matches this season with scores like 6-0, 5-0, 4-1, and 4-0, proving they almost always score at least three goals per game. With Gladbach&#x27;s terrible defense and Bayern&#x27;s unstoppable attack led by Kane, this match should easily finish with three or more goals from Bayern.

Yesterday&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Melbourne Victory to win at Newcastle Jets 1u at $2.15 ❌

I did say yesterday was more of a vibe check, and that the A League only being in round 2 was a going to be a bit random. I wasn&#x27;t able to watch the match, so can&#x27;t comment too much, but from the extent highlights I&#x27;ve watched, Victory looked rubbish. In hindsight, if there&#x27;s no bet I like, I probably should just skip the day and save the record. 

We move on.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Lillestrom to win v Ranheim IL and o2.5 goals. 5u @ 1.61

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: I had a whole writeup for Coventry -0.75 but I&#x27;m basically going to milk this Lillestrom cow until it stops giving milk. 

They&#x27;re the best team in the Norwegian second division by a massive margin. They&#x27;ve got a 21-point lead on second place, and recently have just been demolishing teams. 

They host 7th place Ranheim in this game. 

Here&#x27;s the last 5 Lillestrom league games (most recent game first)
7-1 win away 
5-1 win at home
4-0 win at home
5-1 win away
4-1 win at home

Ranheim have been mid table in both home and away form this season. But honestly, I just think Lillestrom are a class above, and they show no signs of coasting through to the end of the season. I find it very unlikely that they don&#x27;t win this at home, and as you can see from previous games, the o2.5 looks a play too. 

In fact, you can even jump on them to score 5 or more for like $6.50, which considering their most recent form isn&#x27;t crazy. I also found them to score in the 3-4 range for $2.40. So you can play around with those too. 

But for me, <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> is the win and o2.5.</td></tr>

Last Pick: Wade win vs De Decker

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: Van Veen -2.5 win vs Searle 

Sport: Darts, European Championship

Reasoning: Van Veen’s scoring and checkout stats this season (97 avg, -45 % finishing) consistently outperform Searle’s, giving him more control over long-format legs. Searle can explode with power scoring and tidy finishing when he’s in rhythm, but his tendency to drift mid-match makes Van Veen’s consistency the safer side to trust. Over a race to 10, that superiority should naturally stretch into at least a 3-leg margin.

I think Noppert offers excellent value, especially with the +2.5 line. I also think Schindler will come through against Joyce.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Todays Pick</mark>: Premier League – Manchester United vs Brighton

Both Teams to Score &amp; Over 2.5 Goals @1.75

Manchester United may be at home, but stylistically this  matchup is in my opinion a nightmare for them. Against a team like Brighton, who drop players into the pockets between the lines and force you to break them down, United’s structure consistently falls apart. They won’t have the space to counter like they did vs Liverpool.

Brighton are in good form, confident in possession, and have the exact attacking patterns that expose United’s defensive fragility and poor pressing. But Brighton themselves concede chances and United still have enough up top to score at Old Trafford.

I am  expecting goals and both teams contributing.

Prediction:  I dont think United will win this one and can see Brighton winning this.

**Write up:**

**Trabzonspor v Eyupspor**  
Trabzonspor are 2nd in the league right now. They&#x27;ve only lost to Fenerbache so far this season. They have topscorer in the league Paul Onuachu in smoking hot form with 5 goals in his last 5 games. If he doesn&#x27;t perform <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, they can also rely on creative 21-year old right-winger Felipe Augusto, he scored in their last 3 games.

Eyupspor are sitting 14th right now and with their matches not being the toughest they are not performing well. With one win against 11th placed Kasimpasa in their last 5 games I don&#x27;t see them scraping even a point away from Trabzonspor.

**Mönchengladbach v Munich**  
Same recipe as earlier this week here because if it ain&#x27;t broke don&#x27;t fix it: Bayern have scored over 2,5 goals in 10/11 games this season, the one time they didn&#x27;t was against Dortmund last weekend. They are just a scoring powerhouse, even without Musiala. Kane, Diaz and Olise upfront are straight up deadly. They managed to get a 3-0 lead by halftime against Brugge wednesday and gave players rest.

Mönchengladbach has conceded over 3 goals or more 3 times already this season against Werder Bremen (4), Frankfurt (6), Union Berlin (3). And oh, they&#x27;re bottom of the league.

Best of luck if tailing! 🍀

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: PSG ML + Tom Aspinall ML (-139, Draftkings)

PSG have been winless in 3 of their last 4 league matches with two draws to Lille and Strasbourg and a loss to Marseille. They cant afford to continue dropping games which they would usually win while being 1 point behind Marseille on the table. With Dembele back, a convincing 7-2 thumping of Leverkusen in UCL, and leading the H2H with 9 wins and 1 draw in the last 10 matches vs Brest I can&#x27;t really see them losing.

Now onto our next leg we move to the UFC heavyweight division. Tom Aspinall is a great fighter but the heavyweight division lacks good prospects. Tom has basically been inactive for a year because the last fight to make at heavyweight was him vs Jon Jones but Jones ended up retiring and vacating the belt and is now left to fight Ciryl Gane because there&#x27;s not really anyone else. Aspinall is notorious for his quick finishes, across 18 fights his average fight time has been 2 minutes and 2 seconds which is the shortest in UFC history. Admittedly we haven&#x27;t seen Tom go past the second round and this will be a 5 round fight but regardless I do not see this going all 5 rounds. Ciryl Gane is a high level striker but this will be his third title fight and he lost the first two which were to Francis Ngannou and Jon Jones. Takedown defense was an issue in both of those fights as Ngannou was able to secure 4/5 takedowns on him that fight to a unanimous decision and Jones was able to secure a submission victory and Tom can definitely take advantage of this as well as match him on the feet with his freakish athleticism and power. Trusting in both PSG and Aspinall to come through for us tomorrow BOL and bet responsibly.</td></tr>

Another day, another Moist Conflict! One goal disallowed by VAR gave us the red for our combo paying 2.05, annoying but we keep going!




Brentford have scored in five of their last six home matches, and despite a few mixed results, they are averaging 1.4 goals per game over their last 10 league outings, with Igor Thiago leading the line and Jordan Henderson adding experience in midfield. Liverpool come in off a confidence-boosting 5-1 win over Frankfurt, and even with some injuries, their attack is clicking, scoring 1.7 goals a game, and Gakp and Ekitiké are all contributing regularly.

Defensively, both teams are conceding around 1.5–1.6 goals per match, which supports a high-scoring scenario. Liverpool&#x27;s last five head-to-heads against Brentford have seen BTTS land in three of them and over 2.5 land in four, with their last meeting at this ground ending 2-0 to Liverpool but generally open games between these two. Team news sees Liverpool missing key defenders but still possessing plenty of attacking firepower, while Brentford remain solid at home, losing just once in their last four at Gtech Community Stadium.

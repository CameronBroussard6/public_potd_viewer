Write up: THAT’S 10 IN A ROW! PATRIOTS KEEP US ALIVE!!! - Model has this as the highest confident Edge % and EV % for the day. Will add some personal information in this write-up as well.

• ⁠Model has Indiana 1H ML at 58%

• Model projects Indiana 1H -4.5 at 54%

• EV better betting 100$ = 12-13$ for this play

• College Football National Championship. I want to start off by saying, I was stuck between Indiana’s 1H line and Indiana -7.5 Full Game - Gut told me to role with the 1H so here we are - Indiana averages 20 points in the 1H this year which is top 10 in college football while only allowing around 6 points in the 1H - Miami averages about 14 points in the 1H, which isn’t the best, but is still pretty good - considering how good Indiana’s defense has been, this line drops - The stats of how good Indiana’s defense is in the 1H, compared with Miami’s mediocre 1H offensive side, gives a small edge towards Indiana in this one. Indiana’s run game is one of, if not the best in the nation - Miami is susceptible to big plays on defense, while Indiana in ranked 3rd in 20+ yard rushes - Indiana should be able to control the tempo with their run game, limiting Miami possessions throughout the 1H - Indiana has been pretty dominant in their 1H’s and they seem to catch opponents off guard early - Indiana will come out with an awesome game plan, and I see them being damn near perfect in the 1H - Hoosiers cover -4.5 for us in a low scoring 1H

It assigns ELO ratings to players and projects a win chance based on the combined ELO ratings of the players on each team. TeamReddit is projecting a 62% win chance here which creates value here on the ML.</td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **FUT Map 1 ML (+105)** vs. Aurora 5u

https://preview.redd.it/18009v6zncjg1.png?width=745&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3bd69b62913ae781a880e6214ace6145d6c1dc2

Game: Counterstrike 2 (CS2) | Tournament: PGL Cluj Napoca 2026 | Time: 3:00 AM EST.

**Writeup:**

* Aurora are the higher seeded team, the higher seeded team gets selection in veto which 90-95% of the time they will <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> 2nd with their choice. That means that FUT map <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> is up first in this series as the odds also indicate
* Both teams have a clear perma ban, Aurora ban Ancient, FUT ban Inferno, both teams also have EXTREMELY OBVIOUS map picks. FUT <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> Mirage, Aurora <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> Anubis, there is almost 0 chance we see either team swap their map <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> off of these unless one team just randomly drops their perma ban

**Mirage Stats:**

* FUT are 89% winrate on 18 maps of Mirage in the L3 months, they are on a rampage run, I would argue maybe the best Mirage team in the world strategically, they have been running Mirage as their home map forever. They first <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> this map in 70% of their games and for good reason. FUT dominance on Mirage as mentioned is not new, they went 51-20 on this map in 2025, an insane run of form
* Aurora are 29% winrate on 7 maps of Mirage in the L3 months, they have heavily struggled on this map, this is their only map in the pool currently they are &lt;50% winrate on.
* FUT are on a 10 map winstreak on Mirage, and while for a while they were mostly farming tier two teams, recently they have been dominating tier one teams on the map as well. They have beaten Astralis, G2, FURIA, as well as some strong tier two teams on the map like OG, EYEBALLERS and BetBoom.
* FUT are extremely well rounded on this map, they win 64% of pistol rounds, they average a 73.3% winrate on CT side/defense, and a 53.4% winrate on offense as well. In the last month despite a drop in pistol round win % down to 40%, they are 5-0 in this time including the win against FURIA where they won 13-11 despite losing both pistol rounds
* Aurora struggles really started for them in October and to close out the year but a lot of their Mirage maps back then were still close, but in 2026 these struggles have been much worse then previous, they are not just losing Mirage but getting dominated by teams, they lost to FURIA 13-4, Falcons 13-10, PARIVISION 13-5, GamerLegion 13-5 in 2026 so far which is when they picked up Soulfly.
* Aurora are 20% winrate in their last 5 mirage games, they have lost them by a total score of 59-37 winning just 39% of rounds overall. They have really struggled on CT side recently generating only 40.3% of rounds on this side in the new year, despite a 50% winrate on pistol rounds, their offense has always been shaky on Mirage going back 6 months, they average 42.1% winrate on T side over a 24 round sample, but in the past were able to win close maps due to their strong CT sides and often sneak win close maps, without good CT sides, they will never stand a chance against strong Mirage teams in my opinion</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>**Record:** 1-0-0

**Last Pick:** Galatasaray ML + o2.5 TG (vs Eyupspor) ✅

**Football | Turkish Super League | 20:00 UTC+3**

**Match:** Trabzonspor vs Fenerbahce

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Over 4.5 Yellow Cards

**Write Up:** There is a huge rivalry between Trabzonspor and Fenerbahce, and this rivalry reflects as tension on the pitch in every match played between the two teams. In all of their last 5 matches, over 4.5 cards have been shown.

That&#x27;s why for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>&#x27;s prediction, I&#x27;m not going to base it on the match result (side) or goals, but on yellow cards instead.

Btw that was good to start with a win to that series ❤️</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Olympic Hockey: Germany v Latvia, Leon Draisaitl 1+ Points + Germany -1.5 PL (2u to win 2.30u)

Write Up: Time to make it 3 in a row. <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> we’re going with Germany v Latvia. This game should be fairly competitive but I think Germany has the edge. Lead by Leon Draisaitl and Tim Stutzle who combined scored all 3 goals in Germanys game against Denmark. Draisaitl who is one of the best in the NHL has recorded 80 points in his 55 games played this NHL season. Latvia lost to the states 5-1 in their last game. This’ll probably be a sweaty <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> but it should hit!

BOL if Tailing!</td></tr>

​Event: Blast SLAM VI |  OG vs. Liquid

Time: 9:00 AM EST

​<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: OG ML @ 2.05 odds (5u)

​Write Up:

Team Liquid plays a very structured, high-tempo game. They want to win lanes, group up, and suffocate you with perfect efficiency. They are the best &quot;front-runners&quot; in Dota.

But, this new OG roster is pure SEA chaos. They don&#x27;t respect structure. They constantly force bad fights that turn into chaotic trades.

​Liquid historically struggles when they can&#x27;t play perfect Dota. When the game becomes a scramble, they hesitate. OG thrives in the scramble. We are betting on OG to turn the game into a bloodbath and force Liquid out of their comfort zone.

​BOL.

Slovakia over 1.5 total goals (-120)

A must win for both teams. Slovakia to secure their quarterfinal and top spot in the group and Sweden to try to at least qualify for the next round. Although Sweden has more firepower than Slovakia, they have not played to expectations and I don&#x27;t see them getting that much better on a back-to-back. They give up some great chances and they allowed 4 goals against Finland and 2 goals vs Italy with zero NHL players. Slovakia meanwhile has played really well in this tournament by beating that same Finland team that beat Sweden 4-1 and beating Italy 3-2. They should be able to at least score 2 goals against a fragile Sweden team.

BOL!</td></tr>

Stuttgart vs Cologne, Over 3.5 Goals @ 2.08

Over 3.5 goals is a strong play in this clash. Stuttgart are aggressive going forward and usually create plenty of clear chances at home. Köln’s defensive record on the road is often shaky, and when they concede, the game tends to open up. Both teams are capable of scoring, which increases the pace and intensity. A 3-2 or 4-0 result would not be surprising here.</td></tr>

Last pick - PSV V Feyenoord. PSV over 1.5 goals @ 1.55  ✅️

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the day</mark> - Werder Bremen V Bayern Munich. Bayern Munich ML &amp; over 2.5 goals @ 1.57

16th place Werder Bremen host league leaders Bayern. With Borussia Dortmund winning already this match week and closing the gap between 1st and 2nd to 3 points I&#x27;m hoping for a motivated Bayern outfit to come out and secure 3 points.

They are scoring plenty so I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they covered this goal lime by themselves although I expect Werder Bremen to score which could help also.

The only absentee from BM is Olise but I expect the difference in class to be on show here.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Over 2.5 Goals@1.99 (Lilibet) | **Stake: 4.5u** 

**Write Up**:

FC Tokyo was actually very good against last year&#x27;s league winners Kashima Antlers and should maybe have won the game in regular play instead of on penalties. Urawa Reds beat regional rivals JEF United 2-0 away, but how the fuck that game didn’t AT LEAST see a third humanity will never now, just how the fuck didn’t the ball go in one more time! The chances both teams had!  

Both meetings in the league last season ended with 3-2 wins for the host. The teams also faced each other in the Emperor Cup where FC Tokyo knocked Urawa out with a 2-1 win at home, but Urawa was the better team in that game and should at least taken the game to extra time. 

The bookies are not really feeling this game that strongly and while neither side saw three goals in their opening match, if they come into this game that they did in those opening games this should have no problem seeing 3-4 or even more goals.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: South Africa Vs New Zealand Total Extras Over 17.5 @1.83 . Units: 4U


Write Up: Hi Friends, I thought id share my knowledge in the hopes of all of you benefiting from it too. I am new here but find the insights very interesting (especially from jaysial) and sharing is caring.

Stating of with a high confidence wager in 
SA vs NZ for extras (b,lbs,wides,nb - for the non cricket players) to hit over 17.5. Multiple reasons for the conviction as below.

1. Match is played in Ahmedabad , the pitch is extremely flat meaning bowlers need to alter the lengths significantly and be more aggressive and hence prone to mistakes.

2. SA bowling attack is notoriously wayward in bowling , past 2 matches they have given away 11 &amp; 12 wides respectively. Not to mention 2 no balls in each innings as well. New Zealand are also susceptible bowling 7 &amp; 9 wides in their last 2 games.

3. This is a highly competitive game and a high scoring one resulting in the full over quotas being close to completion.

4. The conditions - The match is played at night in India where dew will come into play, the balls will slip out of the hands easier for the team bowling second increasing the number of errors. Also, weather is clear so the innings won’t be truncated.

Hope to be off to a good start and best of luck!</td></tr>

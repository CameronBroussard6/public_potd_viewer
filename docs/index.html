Good weather expected. The Buccaneers get Otton back and their scary O is finally as healthy as its been all season. They will have a lot of good opportunities to score a lot this game imo. Couple starters out for Carolina on Defense too.

Ikem Ekwonu is questionable but even without him i can see the Panthers getting multiple scoring opportunities and moving the ball against a Bucs defense that isn&#x27;t great and also has a couple of starters out.</td></tr>

Pärnu - 3,5 1st half handicap(1,62)

Reasoning - Fading Keila again, they are terrible and Pärnu has been playing good after a slow start, last two losses has come vs Top teams in the league. Main line has moved from - 7,5 to - 10,5 and ending with big leads can be sloppy, so taking the first half handicap, feeling comfortable until -5.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Lions -2.5 alt spread + Jahmyr Gibbs ATD (-134).

Game starts at 4:25pm EST. Bet 3u

Writeup: In this matchup, we have a team in the Pittsburgh Steelers who don’t really have much to play for until their week 18 match vs a Detroit Lions team that needs to fight for their playoff spot each week. 

The Lions currently have the highest-scoring offense in the NFL, averaging 30.6 points per game. This is particularly evident at home, where they&#x27;ve upped their scoring average to 33.7 points per game. The Lions are also facing a Steelers defense that are facing injuries to players like star linebacker T.J. Watt, giving another reason for the Detroit offense to have success.

Detroit is also a team who bounces back after losses, as they have a 14-1 record against the spread after a defeat since the middle of the 2022 season. This resilience is critical as the team fights to keep their playoff hopes alive.

The Lions also have several statistical advantages heading into this game. They rank ninth in third-down conversion over the last three games, compared to the Steelers, who are at 27th in third-down defense. The Lions also average 131.1 rushing yards per game, positioning them well against a Steelers defense that has struggled particularly against the run.

Given these factors, they should easily be able to cover a 2.5 alternate spread.

Speaking of the rushing advantage, let’s talk about Gibbs. Jahmyr Gibbs has been an essential player for the Lions, and his performance is crucial to the team&#x27;s success. The Lions have an undefeated 8-0 record when Gibbs scores a touchdown. He currently ranks seventh in the NFL with 1,100 rushing yards and 13 touchdowns. Gibbs has established himself as a dual-threat, contributing both in rushing and receiving, making him a focal point in the red zone.

The Steelers’ defense has been vulnerable lately, allowing a significant number of rushing touchdowns, which further enhances Gibbs’ chances of reaching the end zone. 

For my superstitious people out there, here’s how many touchdowns Gibbs has scored in the last 5 games: 0, 3, 0, 3, 0. What comes next…

With the Lions likely to lean on their star running back in critical game situations, betting on Gibbs to score feels sound both statistically and superstitiously.

Last Pick: CFP Oregon -20.5 (-113) 2u to win 1.77u❌

WOWWWW insane bad beat that came out of absolutely nowhere. Oregon looked like they were cruising to a mega blowout until their secondary decided to check out of the game in the second half. JMU ripped off several scores late in the game and eventually drove down the field 99 yards and scored on 4th&amp;Goal with a minute left in the game to cover. 

Event: NFL Week 16 Cincinnati Bengals @ Miami Dolphins (1:00pm ET)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Devon Achane o114.5 Rushing + receiving yards (-113) 

Write Up: The Dolphins have basically had two different seasons up until this week, going 1-6 in their first seven games and 5-2 in their last 7. This is in large part due to Devon Achane having a career year and racking up some insane numbers in the back half of this season. Achane has cleared his rush+rec yards prop in the last 4/5 games. The only exception came in week 14 against the Jets where he was well on his way to smashing the over with 105 rush+rec yards midway through the second quarter until he suffered a rib injury, forcing him out for the remainder of the game. Despite having one of his games cut short by injury, he’s still averaging a whopping 151.2 rush+rec yards over the last 5 games. With his average rush+rec yards prop line during the last 5 games being around 113, he’s massively outperformed this average prop line by a margin of roughly +38 yards. Achane has also been doing this with statistically one of the worst offensive line units in the league (25th in pass block win rate and 29th in run block win rate). 

Achane and Bengals D/ST: This week Achane gets possibly his best matchup of the year against the Bengals. The Bengals have had an extremely rough year on defense, and their rushing defense is THE worst in the league. They’ve allowed opposing running backs to stuff the stat sheet in just about every statistical category: Opponent RB YPG- 129.21 (32nd). Opponent RB Yards per Carry- 5.38 (31st). Opponent RB Receiving Yards per Game 45.57 (30th). 27th in run stop win rate and 29th in pass rush win rate. Achane ranks 3rd in total rush yards (1186), 1st in YPC (5.8), 4th in total receiving yards (450), and 1st in rushes of 20+ yards. The Bengals also allow the highest explosive play rate (rushes &gt; 10 yards and passes/receptions &gt; 20 yards). in the league at 8%. Achane ranks 1st in RB explosive play rate% at 14.15%. Achane has been an elite pass catching back a majority of his career but this season he’s taken another step up with an absurd 74.3% Route Participation% compared to 61.2% last season and 5.0 air yards per game this year (94th percentile among RBs). Regardless of the game script, Achane will have more than enough opportunities on the ground and through the air to to gash this Bengals defense

Dolphins QB Situation: On Wednesday the Dolphins made the decision to bench Tua Tagovailoa and give their rookie QB and former Texas Longhorns signal caller Quinn Ewers the start against the Bengals this weekend. While this might cap the production of the Dolphin’s pass catchers, Ewers&#x27; playstyle and tendencies as a QB should bolster Achane’s workload. At Texas, Ewers developed a reputation for rarely throwing the ball down field partially due to the offensive scheme and partially because of his tendency to not progress through reads. This resulted in lots of checkdowns, screens, and quick passes. Unless Ewers added a deadly deep ball and the ability to consistently go through his progressions at an NFL level this past year, the Dolphins plan is to get the ball out of Ewers hands as quickly as possible and into the hands of their playmakers like Achane. With a new QB and a terrible Bengals rushing defense in this game, all signs point towards Achane to get a huge workload and have himself a day.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:**  Stars to win in regulation &amp; Over 4.5 Total Goals

**Odds:** 2.3 | +130 | 3units to win 3.9

**Write up**: Historical data suggests that teams playing the second half of a road b2b against a rested opponent, especially one of stars caliber suffer a significant decline in win probability. This decline is manifested in 3rd period collapses, slower reaction times in the defensive zone, and an increase in penalty minutes due to fatigue  induced reaching and hooking. leafs road record stands at a mediocre 5-8-0 entering this contest , statistic that does not inspire confidence when paired with the zero rest variable. 

the stars enter this matchup with optimal rest and preparation. Their last contest was on Friday resulting in a commanding 8-3 victory over the young ducks. this schedule allowed for a full day of rest on Saturday, coupled with the luxury of remaining at home. stars have transformed the airlines center into a fortress this season, posting an impressive 11-5-1 home record. 

Stars with 53 points are secure in their playoff positioning but are engaged in a fierce battle for the central division title and the cestern conference top seed. They trail the avs (57 points) by four points. Maintaining pace with avs requires securing points in &quot;winnable&quot; home games against tired oppponents. The leafs motivation is born of desperation. Sitting with 35 points they are dangerously close to the bottom of the atlantic sivision, ahead of only the jackets. Even the sabres are in front of leafs (thats like so embarrassing btw). The loss to preds was a huge setback in their pursuit of the wild card. While desperation can be a powerful motivator, it rarely overcomes the physiological reality of fatigue when facing an elite opponent.

Stars possess arguably the most balanced and lethal offensive attack in the nhl for this season. Scoring 3.47 goals per game (ranked 4th) and having league best 13.8% shooting percentage. they do not need to dominate possession to dominate the scoreboard. Their offense is predicated on elite finishing talent and rapid transition play. Defensively stars are disciplined and structured. They have allowed only 94 goals this season, ranking 9th in the league. Their goal differential of +31 is second best in the west, indicative of a team that suppresses opponent chances while maximizing their own. Special team for stars are a massive competitive advantage, their pp is operating at a 32.1% (35-for-109), rank 2nd in the nhl. Then we look at whos in the crease. stars should be rolling out otter because desmith just played in b2b. toronto is forced to go with the rookie Hildby. The kid has some decent numbers on paper, but he just got lit up for 6 goals by Edmonton a week ago and gave up 4 goals to caps on the last start and asking a rookie backup to stand on his head against the 2nd offense in the league on the road with a tired defense in front of him is like asking for a christmas miracle.

We are looking at rested, elite home team facing a tired, inconsistent road team with a backup goalie. Hockey is unpredictable, and that showed in yesterdays pick too but this has stars W written all over it. About the yesterdays pick where hawks made the game a bit more interesting where they got lucky bounces and sens made the game more interesting too and got 6 penalties. Sens also decided not to go with ullmark too after his shutout (weird decision in my mind but i kinda understand that they wanted to give ullmark rest versus struggling chicago. also hawks were riding on their backup too). plus the refs wanted to make the game more closer than it should be with 2 returnd goals by ottawa (the last one should have counted definitely). Overall the sens domonated and pressured hawks most of the game and we can see that by shots. Penalties def killed some momentum for sens. ok now it just feels like im drifting on.

Dallas wins this, with a score of 4-2 or 5-3

This would normally be in odds range of 1,4 to 1,5 and we are getting great value according to me. Twente is good for sure, but away will be a task too difficult to prove. The team also wants to keep winning in hopes to secure a second place in the league and at the same time seeing PSV, who are the league leaders currently, to start dropping points. Second place leads straight for Champions League games and they have a good chance to achieve that. Meanwhile making the gap bigger for third placed Ajax, who in turn played draw yesterday.

I&#x27;m going to stick my neck out for this one. Celtic are all over the place since Nancy arrived. Square pegs to fit round holes in the new formation and system. First halves have been getting better and more promising but then falling off it massively in the second half. 

During that, Celtic are unbelievably open when the ball is turned over. Hearts, St Mirren and Dundee Utd all figured out how to beat the system pretty swift and I can&#x27;t see Nancy making any systematic changes. Celtic have conceded avg 4 corners per match since Nancy arrived. Aberdeen are 4-9-9-1 so an average in 5+ but brought down by their spanking in Europe. 

Yes Celtic are at home and the narrative should be that Aberdeen are kept at bay and Celtic control and dominate. But we&#x27;re in unchartered territory for Celtic at the moment. Gut feeling here.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Jameson Williams longest reception o26.5 -125 1u (Draftkings)

Previous play: ✅ Alabama TT o16.5 + Total game FGs o1.5 -120

This Sunday at Ford Field, the Detroit Lions square off against the Pittsburgh Steelers in a matchup with serious playoff implications. The Steelers sit atop the AFC North and are looking to maintain control to secure a first-round home playoff game. For the Lions, a loss would make their postseason path significantly tougher, putting even more pressure on Jared Goff and the Detroit offense.

Pittsburgh will be without two of their defensive playmakers, TJ Watt and Nick Herbig, a development that should provide a major boost for Detroit’s passing game. Goff has struggled under heavy pressure this season, often panicking and either taking sacks or forcing throws. With both Watt and Herbig sidelined, Goff should have more time to navigate the pocket, a key factor for a quarterback whose mobility is limited. When he has the time to let routes develop, Goff can be highly effective, especially in the deep passing game.

That brings us to Jameson Williams, one of the fastest receivers in the NFL. With extra time in the pocket, Williams should have ample opportunity to stretch the field and connect with Goff on vertical routes. While he’s had a few quiet games this season, there’s a trend worth noting: whenever Williams has avoided a goose egg in Detroit, he’s hit at least one reception of 26.5 yards or more. Given the stakes, the dome environment, and the weakened Steelers pass rush, it’s reasonable to expect Williams to come up big in this one. Look for at least one explosive play from Jamo to keep this trend alive.

**Write-Up:**
Phew! A close one but still a victory with Anaheim nonetheless. We have 4 wins in a row right now, lets go for 5th and catch our w/l ratio to even.

**Reasoning:**
Villa games at Villa Park are built for goals. They play aggressively, push defensive players high, and average approx ~2+ goals per home match, but still their defence is sometimes leaking. United, even with squad issues still create chances through transitions and individual quality, especially against high lines. United has scored in the majority of their away matches, but defensive absences and rotation have led to conceding consistently, particularly against top-half sides. Villa’s current form and confidence all but point to them scoring at least once. Head-to-head trends also support goals, and tactically this sets up as:
Villa controlling possession and chances
United dangerous on counters Neither side likely to sit back for 90 minutes
Some data to back up with reasoning:
Villa: high home xG, strong scoring streak
United: BTTS frequent in away fixtures
Match context: top-table pressure means proactive football
Match final result prediction screams 2–1 or 3–1, making BTTS + Over 2.5 a clean and a logical angle to bet on IMO.

**Write up:**

**The <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>:**  
This match sets up well for **1X &amp; Over 2.5** because it combines **home protection with a naturally open goal profile**.

The odds give Hajer a slight edge, but not enough to expect full control or a low-risk win. In similar profiles, the home side usually **avoids defeat**, while the game itself stays active and goal-driven rather than slow or tactical.

From a scoring perspective, this profile strongly favors **Over 1.5 as a base**, and once goals start coming, matches often push into **3+ goals**. Clean sheets are not a defining feature here, which is why combining goals with a safer double-chance makes more sense than backing a straight result.

Instead of forcing a home win, the **1X covers the natural volatility**, while **Over 2.5** aligns with the attacking structure shown by the model.

  
**My Model in general:**  
My model is built around the idea that matches follow **recurring patterns**, not randomness.  
Instead of predicting games in isolation, it groups matches by **odds profiles** and studies what *actually* happens when similar games are played.

By clustering historical matches with the same **home–draw–away odds**, I track how games usually unfold — goals, BTTS, scorelines, and game flow. From there, the model identifies **motives**: situations where teams are more likely to attack, trade goals, or avoid clean sheets.

When looking at player type, Russ records a majority 26% of his points from spot up where the Rockets allow the 8th least PPG against.

When looking at Scoring zones Russ records a majority 30% of his points from the RA, a zone the Rockets allow the 7th least PPG against. 

Russ shoots a combined 75% of his shots from the C&amp;S and &lt;10 FT, where the Rockets rank 7th and 11th best.

Russ went for just 16 PR in his previous matchup with the Rockets on 12 FGA and just 7 rebound chances in that game.

The Rockets come into this game as 12 point favorites so this game has blowout potential and can possibly take away from Russ’s 4th quarter minutes.</td></tr>

**Writeup:** This truly is a game that will be played. The stoppable 3-11 Jets go to Louisiana to face the movable 4-10 Saints. Shorter Writeup <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>

The Jets look terrible. Allowing this spread to be hit 4/5 last game, the only one not being allowed was when they beat the terrible Falcons. Jets boast the 20th best defense and 29th best offense. Saints host an equally terrible 26th ranked offense but make up for it with an 11th ranked defense. Saints have been on a role recently beating both divisional opponents, the Bucs and the Panthers.

Jets are starting Brady Cook who has thrown for 1 TD and 5 Interceptions his last two games, and an average of 169.5 yards where his line currently sits. Going against a defense putting up similar numbers to the Jaguars who Cook has done poorly against, i can&#x27;t expect Jets to put up any decent scoring here 

Saints take an easy home game while Jets tank in the hopes for a better <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> in the draft. This seems like a no brainer unless the Saints try their hardest to lose

**Last Pick**: Dallas Mavericks vs. Philadelphia 76ers (-2.5) (W)

**Event**: (NFL) Los Angeles Chargers vs. Dallas Cowboys | 1pm ET

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>**: Chargers ML +110 (FanDuel) | 2.5u to win 2.75u 

**Reason**: Los Angeles heads to Dallas for a 1pm kickoff which is a bit out of the ordinary for these teams to be playing at this time which I think will give us a fun matchup in the first batch of games. T**he Chargers come in winning their last two games as underdogs** and **Dallas comes in losing back to back games as favorites.** This Dallas team has began to crumble, and I definitely think that with their mathematical elimination from the playoffs after Philly&#x27;s win brings a lot of their energy down and I assume there will definitely be open seats at AT&amp;T Stadium. At this point, Dallas is really just playing for the incentives. 

**Los Angeles has been hot, winning 6 out of their last 7.** That one loss came against Jacksonville Herbert only threw 10 passes before Trey Lance stepped in. **Dallas looked like their defense might have some hope, over their last 3 games they have allowed an egregious 35.3ppg (30 on the season ranking 31st overall).** The Chargers&#x27; defense on the other hand has been stepping up massively and winning them huge games. **Over the Chargers last 3 games they&#x27;ve allowed only 15.3ppg (20.3 on the season). The Chargers secondary has been playing out of their minds this season as well averaging over 1 interception a game and ranking top-5 in almost every pass defense statistic.** 

**The Cowboy&#x27;s run defense ranks 29th in DVOA** and has given them major issues in giving them any type of advantage in time of possession and getting their defense off the field. **The Chargers rank 2nd in the NFL in average drive time** and should look to chip away at Dallas&#x27; poor defense. Both teams pass protection are at the bottom of the league. Lucky for the Chargers, the Dallas pass rush hasn&#x27;t been too much to worry about and have a pass rush win rate of only 39% and just haven&#x27;t been looking strong when trying to get to the quarterback. The Cowboys offensive line ranks just slightly above the Chargers, but the Chargers pass rush is just about as efficient as Dallas has been only winning 37% on pass rush, though the Chargers rank top 10 in total sacks this season. 

The secondary play and making sure they contain Lamb, Pickens, and Ferguson will be crucial to the Chargers winning this game. **The way the Chargers have been looking overall as a team, I don&#x27;t see too much reason as to why the Chargers won&#x27;t be able to do what they do best - chewing and managing the clock to their advantage - against a struggling and demotivated Dallas defense (and team as a whole for that matter).** 

I would also keep an eye on the game time decisions for the Chargers, the biggest one being WR Quentin Johnston. Though if he is ruled out, that wouldn&#x27;t have too much of an impact on the outcome especially as WR Keenan Allen practiced fully on Thursday and Friday. Dallas CB Daron Bland is out, Trevon Diggs is questionable though they have no need to rush his return now that they are eliminated so I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if he is ruled out once again. CB Josh Butler and Caelen Carson are also questionable for Dallas giving them even more limitations to their secondary.

**Event**: English Premier League: Aston Villa vs. Manchester United 8:30am PST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>**: Aston Villa Moneyline (+115) 2u

**Write up**:

Villa come into this game in super hot form, on a 9 game winstreak in all competitions with 5 of these games being at home. This season at home Villa have beaten Arsenal, Manchester City, and Bournemouth; proving they&#x27;re a force to be reckoned with in the Prem. In the Prem this season Villa are 6-1-1 at home, with the draw and loss being early in the season before they found their feet. They&#x27;re 3rd at home this season only behind Arsenal and Manchester City. Now I know Villa&#x27;s record against United at home is shocking, but with the form they&#x27;re in and the state Manchester United in (that I&#x27;ll speak on below) this is really hard to pass on at + money. 

Going over to the horrendous side of Manchester, they have actually found some decent form the last couple of months. Being 2-2-1 in their last 5, most notably beating Palace away and drawing Bournemouth in that hectic game just on Monday. With that being said, United are missing a lot of pieces tomorrow: Mbeumo, De Ligt, Casemiro, Mazraoui, and Amad being the main 5 out. United are 3-3-2 away from home in the Prem this season, losing to City and Brentford while drawing Spurs, Forest, and and Fulham. Basically meaning they only beat mid table/the worst clubs when they&#x27;re away (the 3 wins being against Wolves, Liverpool, and Palace). Had AFCON, injuries, and suspensions not taken 5 of their main guys I think United could have had a chance, but Villa have been dominating as of late. 

With Villa being in their superb for and United losing a lot of key players, I think this game will be in the 2-0/2-1/3-1 range for Villa at home, as they fight to keep their top 4 spot.

My lord that&#x27;s about as sweaty as it gets. I had all but given up when Curry went scoreless in 3Q, and looked lethargic in the 4th with only 14 points. He dials it up to bring his total to 24, but still seems too little too late with only a couple minutes left until Phoenix is forced to foul him to stop the clock once, and then again on the last play. And hilariously on the final play the refs wouldn&#x27;t even call the intentional foul so Curry lays it up to cash us out in the 48th minute, finishing with exactly 28 points.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Bulls +4.5 (-108 on DK); 3 units

This is more of a fade on the Hawks than a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> for the Bulls, but both perspectives are favorable. 

The Hawks, for whatever reason, are not playing well at home, and are one of the few teams that have a worse record at home (5-7) than on the road (10-7).

In terms of the spread, the Hawks are 4-8 ATS at home, 5-9 ATS as the favorite, and a whopping **0-5 ATS as the home favorite**.

The Bulls offer the reverse, though a little less extreme. As underdogs, the Bulls are one of the best teams ATS this season with a 10-3 record. Likewise, they are 5-2 ATS as road underdogs.  

In terms of matchup, Bulls won their only prior matchup against ATL by 5, despite being 2.5-point underdogs. Trae Young was playing in that game as he is expected to play in this one. 

The return of Trae actually creates a further advantage, as it disrupts whatever rhythm the Hawks have built for the majority of this season with NAW starting and JJ being the primary facilitator. 

Meanwhile, the Bulls have been playing well again lately, just recently beating the Cavs in back-to-back games, despite being the underdog in both of those as well. 

I&#x27;ll acknowledge that CHI is not a great team, but the conditions are pretty favorable to side with them in this underdog position against a bad ATL home team that has not covered the spread once this season as home favorites.</td></tr>

Is there a worse mismatch here in the entire league between the Raiders offense and the Texans defense? In Geno’s last 2 games, he went up against some pretty good defenses (Chargers and Broncos) and was under this line in both of those games. I think Houston’s defense is even better than those.

The Houston defense has been making it very difficult for starting QBs. Brissett did pretty well last week against them, but outside of that, not many QBs have done well. (Mahomes 14-33, Danny Dimes 14-27, Josh Allen 24-34 but was sacked 8 times).

NFL - New England @ Baltimore

TreVeyon Henderson 40+ Rush Yds/10+ Rec Yds (+107) 1u

We reach the end of week one with a bit of a tribute play, and a background story as to who I am.

Long story short: I was my grandfathers caregiver for 7 1/2 years when my nan died, one of the things we shared and did together often was gamble. Every Sunday he would give me a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> to play, and we would keep track of how he was doing. “$5, that’s it” - this has become my way of staying connected with him - all this to say, if the streak ends <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, it’s his fault 😂.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> we <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> his favourite player during this past season: Patriots rookie TreVeyon Henderson very quickly rose to fame in our household - for whatever reason early in his career, as he was the clear RB2 to Rhamondre Stevenson, my grandfather truly liked this kid: “He’s got something to him, he’s gonna be special” - every week I more or less waited for whatever he saw in him to flourish but it never did, until it did - more on this after, I’m sure at this point you want numbers:

Originally I had the all purpose yard play in the back pocket for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, but upon doing some line juggling I found + money on a play that should hit but maybe with a touch of sweat - something he would enjoy.

Henderson has hit 40 rushing yards in 7 consecutive games since becoming New Englands RB1ish, seeing double digit rush attempts over all 7 of those games.

The real gamble is on the receiving end: Henderson has hit 10 receiving yards in 4 straight games, showing he is a growing &amp; important part of the New Englands passing attack garnering 23 targets in the last 6 weeks - THIS ALL SAID, he’s still not a clear dual threat yet. A lot of his receptions come in the second phase, and usually isn’t the intention of the play call.

Part of this gamble is I anticipate New England to trail in this game in portions, if Baltimore find a way to get ahead, this may bring a few more check down passes his way than usual. This is a gut play on my end which is why I’m comfortable + money.

To finish the story: the week my grandfather fell ill was the week Hendo broke out: week 10, 150 all purpose yards, 2 TDs, following week, 3TD’s, 93 yards, all of a sudden as my grandfather was dying, his boy was starting to show up.

One of our last conversations went in order: CM Punk won the title, Jays are probably gonna keep Bieber, and Hendo scored 3.

“Three?!” He lit up and smiled, then he laid back down. He died 5 days later.

Fun fact: 2x Super Bowl Champion Tyrone Williams is my cousin!

Write-up: Loss again olé olé I mean just look at that form. It’s just pretty shit isn’t it, all analysis goes to the toilet despite the research put in. I don’t necessarily find the picks bad and that’s why I provide all the numbers involved in my write-ups which I hope you guys appreciate but in hindsight they are and it’s annoying. Never seen a team dominate possession and do nothing with the ball as Lokomotiva who other than one big chance they should’ve scored looked completely bereft of ideas. They deservedly lost 2-0, nothing more to say.

Swiss second division of ice hockey is where I’ve landed, get me out of here. Regardless at plus odds this baffles me. Thirty games into the season and Olten are 5th whilst the Lions are 7th (out of 11). They both should make the play-offs to attempt qualification to the top division as the lions are 10 points clear of 9th spot. At home, Olten’s matches have cleared the line in their last 11/12 in the league (92%). Meanwhile, the Lions have gone over in their last 8/9 away (89%). Should be a no-brainer that there are goals aplenty (at least 6) but you never know, don’t shoot the messenger. This very fixture two months ago saw 7 goals whilst their reverse encounter last month also had 7 goals scored. Maybe I’m out of my depth and we’ll see a borefest I don’t know but either way BOL !

**Game:** NFL - Jaguars @ Broncos, 3pm CDT

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Jakobi Meyers o56.5 receiving yards (-114 on FD)

**Rationale:**

In the six games that Jakobi Meyers has played with the Jaguars since he was traded from the Raiders, he has averaged 6.3 targets, 4.5 receptions, 59.2 yards, and .5 TDs per game. If you remove the first game he played in (after only having two days of practice), those numbers jump to 7 targets, 4.8 catches, 62.8 yards, and .6 TDs. Simply put, Jakobi was the missing link to Liam Coen&#x27;s offense and has immediately cemented himself as the WR1 on the team.

Meyers also kills the Broncos. In his four career games against Denver, Jakobi has performed very well each time, averaging 9.75 targets, 7 receptions, 83.75 yards, and .75 TDs per game. Several of those games also saw Pat Surtain II covering him, making those lines even more impressive.

Given BTJ&#x27;s new role as the primary field stretching receiver, I expect Surtain to be shadowing him, which should make Jakobi&#x27;s day a bit easier. Even if that is not the case, Jakobi has always played well against Surtain in the past.

I expect this to be a game where both defenses stymie the run, leading to more pass attempts from Trevor. I think Jakobi hits 60+ here.</td></tr>

Achane is 4^(th) in total scrimmage yards at **117/game**. He’s facing a defense that cant tackle, cant get penetration and allows large chunk plays on screens and broken plays. The reason I’m going for Rushing and Receiving rather than just rushing is Evans.

Event: Joe Cullen vs Mensur Suljovic

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Joe Cullen ML @ 1.62

Joe Cullen came into this tournament knowing he’s been a bit out of form. He was heavily underestimated in his first round against the young talent Brooks. He proved to the crowd what he was capable of and crushed Brooks 3-0 with a 99.33 average. This performance probably also came through due to his experience on the biggest stage in the world.

On the other hand, we have Mensur Suljovic, who also played a good first round and cruised past a weaker opponent with a 3-1 win. Both players are experienced but Cullen is simply the better player and is capable of holding a higher level of darts for a longer period of time.

To me, it still feels like Cullen is a little underestimated due to his bad form this year. I feel like he’s still winning this game and his odds of 1.62 don&#x27;t represent how he actually can be. Expecting a 3-1 win for Cullen here.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Villarreal Win or Draw -105, 2 units

**Write Up:** Villarreal and Barcelona are two of the most in-form teams in LaLiga, having **won 6 and 7 games on the bounce respectively,** meaning the match is going to be competitive. **Barcelona have been iffy in big challenges this season,** for example, their loss to PSG, Real Madrid, a spanking at the hands of Chelsea etc. all point towards a bigger issue, and <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>&#x27;s fixture definitely classifies as a big game. **Villarreal are extremely tough to crack at home**, the iconic Estadio de La Ceramica, and they&#x27;ll be looking to extend their incredible run of form in LaLiga, thus putting them in pole position to secure a top 4 finish come the end of the season. They **concede at a rate of less than a goal per game**, which is significantly better than that of their opponents. This means they should be able to **absorb any sort of pressure** Barcelona would try to put on them, while exploiting their **ridiculously high line** that nearly shipped 4 goals to Club Brugge in the CL. The **recent H2H is also promising** \- just one singular loss to Blaugrana since 2024. To make matters worse, **Barcelona have a long injury list**, and now we can add **Pedri** to it. *Villarreal also have a couple of absences,* but I think Barcelona is definitely worse off in this case, as they&#x27;ll be missing a couple of absolute star players, not to mention a lot of their players are **just coming back from various injuries**. With the injuries, form, H2H, and venue taken into consideration, I feel very confident in backing Villarreal. They can surely secure at least a draw, but I predict a narrow win for the yellow submarine. BOL and let’s end this unlucky madness once and for all ☘️</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:Aston Villa over 1.5 TEAM goals v Manchester United

Odds: 1.80x / -125 (Bet365)

Units: 2.5 units (Remember always follow our units) 
 

After a sweaty bet, lets just walk this one over shall we? Let me explain why this is a walkover. If there is one thing I love, it is Afcon. Players leaving, and targeting sides with important Afcon players.
 

First of all, let’s just get it straight. Manchester United are shit defensively. That’s the first argument, terrible side that will concede goals to anybody even Burnley or Wolves.  Manchester United are 3-3-2 away this season, conceding and scoring 14 goals in 8 games. Recent results include conceding to the worst offensive side in prem history Wolves once, and a very poor West Ham. They recently just played 4-4 against Bournemouth at home, another side who have been poor recently.
 

Let’s get into the juicy AFCON bit and lineups because that is the kicker. Man United are predicted to start Luke shaw, Martinez and Yoro. That is a terrible back line and there is two ways this game goes, either 4-4 again or Aston Villa absolutely terrorize them in my opinion. Mbeumo, Mazraoui and Amad Diallo are out for AFCON and Maguire, De Ligt and Casemiro are out with suspensions and injuries. While Aston Villa have an injury and that is Torres who is their starting CB, which isn’t really relevant to the bet. One AFCON player in Guessand which is honestly a benefit as he’s much worse than Ollie Watkins who should see 90 minutes here. 
 

Lets get even juicier, Aston Villa last 5 have gone over 1.5 team goals in 4/5 and one of them being against Arsenal where they won 2-1 against probably the best defensive side in the world. Now they facing a shit Man united side with AFCON, injuries and suspensions in their back line. Please do hand me this free money. Aston Villa right now have won 9 games in a row in all competition, facing sides where the games have been goals galore. 
 

You’re probably thinking, why not just take the ML and it’s a good <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> in itself but you just never know what United you will face, it could end 4-4 or it could be 4-0. Don’t take a risk you don’t have to take if you can find a loophole and this is what we did. Here is the loop hole, I highly doubt this game will end 1-0 to Villa and that’s where the edge of over 1.5 goals comes into play. 

Having also watched a lot of both of these teams this year I expect to see a high intensity end to end game with plenty of shots, both teams love to shoot and shots means goals. United are desperate right now having only taken 5/9 points from 3 bottom six sides and a win away at Villa would massive for them, hence I think they will go for it, leaving gaps at the back for the villains to exploit!
 

Let’s take advantage of this United defence and see Aston villa demolish this shit United side.

**Write Up:** Well, the first EPL match of the season Enzo doesn&#x27;t start. Genuinely confused. Glad a few of you got this voided, unfortunately I did not and am counting it as a loss. Always the risk with player props, sorry friends. 

Lets right the ship <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> with the only EPL match on the slate as we see 3rd place Aston Villa host 8th place Manchester United. Staying away from props as my main <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, with our streak of bad luck. Aston Villa are arguably the best home side in the league this season outside of Arsenal, touting an EPL record of 6-1-1 (9-1-1 in all comps) at home this season, and have won their last 6 in a row (including Arsenal and Man City) after a bumpy start. Putting this another way, they have won every home game in all comps since August. Villa Park has been a fortress and I don&#x27;t think Man U can crack it. 

Man United have been a pretty good away team this season with a record of 3-3-2. They also have tons of talent. But that talent just hasn&#x27;t seemed to click and they&#x27;ve been very inconsistent. They&#x27;ve also just lost two of their best attacking players, including their leading goal scorer, in Mbuemo and Amad to AFCON, which won&#x27;t help their disjointedness or scoring hopes. 

Overall, Villa is the better team and is playing at home. I like them to take this one, BOL.</td></tr>

**-----------------**

Lovely day of football <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, and it seems like we’re a bit shorter on picks, but there are still some great options.

United are a very on-and-off team, but one thing I’ve really noticed over their last few performances is how much individual brilliance somehow leads to so many shots on goal. Cunha is our man for this. Coupled with the team’s inability to defend, you end up with a chaotic shootout at both ends of the pitch.

If you’ve watched either of these teams this season, you’ll know how much of the football resembles ping-pong, with chances flying at both ends incredibly quickly.

United are coming into this game after a 4–4 draw that featured 18 total shots on target.

In Aston Villa’s last six Premier League games, there have been 7, 15, 17, 10, 8, and 11 shots on target, respectively.

BTTS looks right here, but I’m staying away as I’m expecting some big saves tomorrow.

__POTD Record:__ 67-32-1 (+77.23u) - 15-4 in last 19

__Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:__ [✅ Saquon Barkley o75.5 rushing yards (-110), 3.3u](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/s/Hmxxoo8o4S)

__Event:__ NFL: Jaguars @ Broncos 4:05pm EST

__POTD:__ Courtland Sutton o58.5 receiving yards (-115), 3.45u to win 3u

__Write Up:__ For my 100th write up, Saquon went off cashing us our 15th win in 19 picks. For write up #101, we’re taking it back to the beginnings. Those who have been here from day one will remember backing Courtland Sutton for our 16th win in a row back on our 17 win streak last year (see comment below post). Starting off the next century of picks, we’re going back to the well in another great matchup. The Jacksonville Jaguars (10-4) are traveling to Denver to take on the Broncos (12-2) at Mile High Stadium, with big implications for both division leaders on the line. The Jags have ridden an offense that’s been on fire to the top of the AFC South. They can clinch a playoff berth this weekend with a win &amp; a Colts/Texans loss. Sitting at 10 wins, the Jags are looking for their first 11+ win season since 2007 (shoutout to my former fantasy MVP Maurice Jones-Drew). They are on a 5 game win streak, averaging 34.2 points per game. But their 4 most recent wins were against the Titans (2-12), Jets (3-11), Cardinals (3-11), &amp; a Colts team after they lost their starting QB. They’ll face a real challenge this week vs the hottest team in the NFL. The Broncos not only are 1st in the AFC West, they are at the top of the entire AFC. Denver is coming into this one on a heater riding an 11 game win streak with an undefeated record at home, having not lost at Mile High since Week 6 of 2024. The Broncos have won 12 consecutive home games, their longest streak since the 2012-2013 season (13 games). Denver is the only team that has led in every game this season. With a win vs the Jags (&amp; a Chargers loss to the Cowboys), Denver can clinch the AFC West for the first time since 2015. If the Patriots lose to the Ravens Sunday night &amp; the Bills somehow lose to the Browns, Denver can clinch the AFC overall 1 seed. Coming off a big win over the Packers who had come into Denver as favorites despite having a worse record, the Broncos confidence is at an all time. That’s especially the case for QB Bo Nix who is playing like a mad man right now.

In Week 11 the Broncos lost starting RB JK Dobbins to a foot injury. Since then, __Head Coach &amp; Play-caller Sean Payton has shifted his offense pass heavy throwing the ball +8.6% over expectations in their last 4 games (2nd most in the league). Broncos QB Bo Nix has thrown for at least 295 yards in 3 of the 4 games with just 1 INT. That should continue this week vs a Jags defense that has faced opposing offenses that have thrown the ball 4.9% over expectations, 2nd most in NFL. This is due to the Jags having the heaviest pass funnel defense in the league. With the best run defense in the league, allowing just 86.3 yards per carry (only team below 90), opposing offenses are forced to pass on their defense, giving up 222.2 passing yards per game (20th). They’ve given up even more on the road allowing 248.3 passing yards, 5th highest in NFL.__ Now they’ll face Bo Nix who is coming off an incredible game last week vs the Packers, completing 23/34 passes (67.6%) for 302 yards for a season high 8.9 yards per pass &amp; 4 TD’s. Bo became the 1st &amp; only QB this season to throw 4 TD’s against zone coverage in a game. Now he faces a Jags defense that runs zone at the 4th highest rate in the league. Who was his favorite target last week? Courtland Sutton. __Sutton is coming off a 7 catch 113 yards, 1 TD game last week &amp; has been on fire lately. He has 49.5% of the Broncos air yards over the past 2 weeks &amp; 29.4% of the targets. In Weeks 6-13 he had a 15.6% Target Share, 17.8% 1st Read Target, 0.18 Targets Per Route, &amp; a 1.59 Yards Per Route. In the last 2 weeks he has a 27.8% Target Share, 37.5% 1st Read Target, 0.31 TPRR, &amp; a 2.69 - YPRR. He has now put up 59+ yards in 4 straight games, having 10+ targets in his last two. Sutton plays out wide at WR &amp; now faces a Jags defense that has allowed the 3rd most yards per game to outside WR’s this season.__ With his recent 37.5% 1st Read Rate in the Broncos last 2 games it’s been clear their strategy has been to get Sutton the ball. That was confirmed recently when Head Coach Sean Payton said in an interview “When we need a play in a critical situation, find 14. Because even when he’s covered, he’s not. He’s our best player &amp; we gotta keep feeding him the ball.” __Since 2024, Sutton is the best WR in the NFL on 3rd down: 1st in receiving yards (819, 1st in 1st downs (48), 1st in 20+ yard receptions (16), 2nd in catches (54). That’ll help this week vs a Jags defense that is poor on 3rd downs, allowing a conversion on 41.9% of plays (26th), 44.44% on road (27th). Sutton also is a speed demon &amp; a master at bringing in tightly contested catches, so naturally Nix loves to lob him the deep ball. Sutton ranks 7th in the NFL in 20+ yd catches (15) &amp; 6th in 30+ yard catches (7). Last week Sutton hit 23.3 mph on a long catch, the fastest speed of any ball carrier all season.__ Nix slings it. He has the most 20+ yard TD throws in the NFL since 2024. Nix will continue to let it fly this week vs the Jaguars defense that is elite against medium passes, but weak against the deep ball.

The Jaguars and Broncos defenses are both top 6 in rushing DVOA, setting up a pass heavy game. Nix has averaged 38.5 pass attempts over the past month. Jags QB Trevor Lawrence passed 9% over expectation last week as with TD passes vs the Jets. Jags RB Travis Etienne has averaged just 3.0 yards per carry the last 3 weeks, which won’t bode well vs the dominant Broncos run defense. I’ll gladly side with the Broncos leading pass catcher in a shootout. 

Nix lets it fly to his favorite guy. Sutton eats.

<tr><td class='post'>💎<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: 🏈 Bucs ML
Odds: -146 on FanDuel
Wager: 3 Units

Record: 6-7
Net Units: -2.5 Units

Explanation: The Buccaneers should beat the Panthers tomorrow because even though both teams are 7–7, Tampa Bay has been the more efficient offense on a per-play basis, and that’s usually what decides close divisional games. 

Tampa Bay is producing 0.372 points per play (average performance 
, but clearly functional), while Carolina is down at 0.308 points per play (bottom tier), which is a meaningful gap in determining how often drives turn into points. 

While I do think Carolina’s defense has been more respectable than Tampa’s in raw scoring efficiency allowed (0.385 opponent points per play, middle of the league), I determine the Bucs still have a clear path to winning by controlling the game. Their run defense has been a strength (top-10 in opponent rush yards per game), which can force Carolina into longer 3rd downs and more dropbacks, and that’s where an already low-efficiency Panthers offense can stall out. On top of that, Tampa Bay is coming in relatively clean health wise. Friday’s report had no game designations.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: CAR/TB BTTS 15+ points, DET -2.5 v PIT, +103 on DK at time of writeup, betting 4.5u

We’re starting this one with my favorite matchup of the day: TB v CAR for leg 1 of the NFC south title. I like this one because it is a good spot for CAR, arguably the weirdest team in the league. They win games they are supposed to lose and lose games they are supposed to win. They are an underdog of 3 and playing at home. This is a good setup for them. I’ll start with TB. This has hit in 5 of L6 for them, missing when they put up 7 vs LAR. Mike Evans is back and healthy and playing well. Their offense is pretty much entirely healthy. After choking last week against ATL, TB has a chance for a bounceback here, and they are on extra rest. CAR has the 6th worst EPA per pass allowed. With a healthy receiving corps and offensive line, I like Baker to do well here. He’s playing against his former team. Last year, TB won 26-23 and 48-14. This offense has been weak at times due to injury, but are still over 15 in all but 2 games. I don’t think they will have much trouble putting up at least 2 TDs and 1 FG in a tight game that they will really want to have since they have lost 5 of L6. CAR has an offense that is less consistent, but they are in a good spot. TB has the 3rd worst redzone defense in the league. When CAR gets there, they will likely be scoring TDs. TB is a defense that tries to take away the rushing game and force passing. This seems bad for CAR, although their offense is pretty balanced in terms of EPA (22nd in passing, 15th in rushing). This offense is pretty self-dependent: they’ve dropped 31 and 16 against good LAR and GB defenses, and 9 and 7 against below average SF and NO defenses. So, why back a team that appears inconsistent? It’s all about the spot. First, their past 8 games have been on a WL pattern. When they suck, they bounce back in the next game. They are playing at home, and they are fighting for their division lives. TB has allowed 24 and 29 points to NO and ATL in their past 2 games. CAR will come into this game and have to match TBs scoring output, which they are in a good spot to do. This is less of an advanced stats <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, but choosing something based on expected gameflow, game stakes, and recent form at good odds (-213). This feels like a 24-23 or a 21-17 or something of that like. I don’t know who will win, but I am very confident both teams will produce to their typical levels on offense.

For the 2nd leg, I like DET over PIT. We all know the trend: DET has won their last like 15 in a row coming off a loss. I’m not much of a believer in those types of things to predict what the next game will be, but I like DET in this game. They are fighting for their playoff lives, and every game is pretty much a must win for them. PIT is in a different spot. They are up 1 game on BAL, and they can lose the next 2 games, beat BAL in week 18, and win the division. PIT has CLE next week, a game that is much more winnable to add an extra game of cushion to their division lead. PIT will still try to win this one, it just won’t be with as much intensity as DET will be playing with. The way to beat DET is to outscore them, which LAR did last week. PIT is not a high scoring team. They are not a team that is built to put up a bunch of big plays against DET’s injured secondary. Their offense hasn’t actually been horrible this year, 13th in EPA and PPG. But they are very thin at WR, which is beneficial for DET’s defense, who is thin in the secondary. DET has the 7th best EPA per rush on defense. The DET defense does not need to shut down PIT entirely, they just need to hold them to a regular number. The PIT defense has been average this year, and are still missing TJ Watt. They are 25th in EPA per rush and 15th in EPA per pass on defense. DET has one of the best offenses in the league, 5th in EPA per pass and 10th in EPA per rush. Their offensive line is still banged up, but should be good to go. Critically, they are playing at home. DET is much better at home. Jared Goff is much more effective at home. DET will put up points, and I don’t think PIT will be able to keep up. DET should control this entire game. They have a lot more to play for. They always win following a loss, which I don’t really care about, but is still an applicable stat. PIT can lose this one and it won’t be that consequential for them. Give me the better team at home to win by 3 or more.

Taking both of these together at just barely + money is brilliant odds. I like this at 4.5u.

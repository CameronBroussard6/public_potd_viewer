Eng Champ: QPR - Leicester

Total o2.5 (-110) 1u

We head to England’s 2nd tier for a clash we hope will bring goals galore as Leicester City visits QPR. When I perused through the plays for this weekend, this one jumped out at me as a simple math play.

On the QPR end, their recent matches have cleared this total 5/6 times, but more curiously as the home team they’ve cleared this total 6 in a row. From the Leicester end, they’ve cleared this total 7 straight matches, and as an away side they’ve cleared this 6/7. 

In matches between these two sides, this total has cleared in the last 6, with the teams scoring 25 goals combined. I just can’t look past this one. A peak at the table shows two teams scrapping on the cusp of a playoff position halfway though the season - this is as close to a 6 pointer in December as they come.

Fun fact: Leicester City have conceded a goal in 15 straight matches, but have only lost 5 of them.

NCAAF - Alabama @ Oklahoma, John Mateer o16.5 Pass Comp (-125) 1u ✅

(16 completions by the break, and if you count that god awful, game changing interception, we clear the line by halftime… Mateer &amp; Oklahoma showed from the initial snap that they were going to stay traditional in the shotgun, and it worked perfectly for us - 5 in a row 🔥)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Dinamo Zagreb vs NK Lokomotiva BTTS 1 unit to win 1U @ 2.00 (Bet365)

Write-up: Not out of the woods yet with a pretty bad <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. The underdogs Astra won in four very competitive sets after dropping the first. Whilst the watch was pretty good that led to a lot more points being played than hoped for, ending on 186 total. Should’ve gone with my other <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> that was stronger statistically (and ended up winning), lesson learned. Don’t think the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> was necessarily bad though just one of those ones where I take it on the chin and say fair enough. 

Hooray, back to some actually normal sports with a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> I like a lot. I had 17 picks to choose from which is definitely my record but this one made the most sense overall. Zagreb are just barely top of the league, only a point ahead of rivals Hajduk Split. After shockingly losing the title to HNK Rijeka on H2H last year (which is absurd) they’ll surely be wanting to win the title this year. Anyways despite doing well in the league this season they’ve been conceding quite a bit. They have conceded a goal in their last 9/10 (90%) league matches this season including in six home games on the bounce (three of them being in the bottom part of the table). They should be scoring as well having scored in their last 16+ home matches. Lokomotiva are 8th (out of 10) but score a lot despite this. That’s now a goal in 19 of their last 20 league matches (95%) including 11/12 (92%) away from home. Obviously Lokomotiva doesn’t play against top of the league every week but combining both teams’ stats is very promising especially at plus odds. Looking at the H2H, Lokomotiva has scored in 13/15 matches (87%, BTTS landed 12 times) against their rivals. This includes the reverse fixture which they actually won 2-1. Away from home the travelling side have scored in 6/7 (86%) though that one game in their most recent encounter at Stadion Maksimir last season. BOL !</td></tr>

Recap: Crewe ML v Bristol Rovers – This is the sad part about betting, 3 <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> lined up. Rochdale ML, BTTS Bologna v Inter and then this. Thinking surely this is the best, oh wait striker wanted to get a red for violent conduct. Still was an even game despite them having a red 30 min in, but that’s the dark side of gambling. Start the investigation! 


<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:Leeds v Crystal Palace BTTS (YES) 
Odds: 1.80x / -125 (Bet365)
Units: 5U FUCKER ON THIS! (Remember always follow our units) 
 
Well well well, 5 unit plays aren’t for fun and if there is anything close to a lock (Nothing is never lock, we learned that the hard way) Then it is this!
 
Now, Leeds are shit. However, one thing they do have is an absolutely scary home pitch, they make close games against even the best opponents such as Chelsea and Liverpool recently. Lets delve into some filthy stats. 
 
Leeds scoring at home is just a certain thing, in the H2H with Crystal Palace, they have never not scored vs Crystal Palace at home, results ending 2-0,1-0, 1-5. This is very good for this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, because Crystal Palace wasn’t a great side in 2021, so them losing against them in the Bielsea era isn’t a shock. But this new crystal Palace side sits 5th right now in the premier league. 
 
Leeds last 5 has had BTTS in all 5 games including games like Manchester City, Liverpool, Aston Villa and Chelsea. Which is all insane, despite all three sides having solid defences, and all season it they have scored in all games at home except 1 and that was against a Newcastle side which ended 0-0. This makes the BTTS hit 8/9 times so far at Elland Road. 

Crystal Palace has conceded 15 goals this season in 16 games, they have been quite good so far defensively and this is why the odds are higher than expected. However, I do believe that if it a time to concede it is at Elland Road. They had a conference league game where they rested all players but some did get 20-30 minutes in a 2-2 draw v KUPS. They do have two starting injuries, Munoz who has been class this season in general and Doucoure a midfielder who has started all season. 

Looking at their last 5 games away, it has two clean sheets and that’s against the two worst premier league sides, Burnley and Wolves. Both are not even close to top championship sides, they’d both compete around playoffs in the championship right now. They conceded to Everton and fulham, two sides who have great home atmosphere and a 1-0 loss to an unfortunate fantastic defensive side Arsenal. 
 
Why on earth, would you bet against a great defensive side? Because there is always goals at Elland Road, 3-3 against Liverpool, 3-1against Chelsea and 1-2 loss to Aston Villa. I see this game go 2-1 or even 2-2 late. Don’t expect this to cash in the first 16 but I do see this done and over with within 60-70 minute. 

Let’s bounce back after that shit show before, and win again on the BTTS!</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>POTD Record 7-3

4 wins in a row! 

San Jose Sharks vs Seattle Kraken at 10:00pm EST (NHL/Hockey)
San Jose Sharks ML (-115)

Sharks are the up and coming team trying to stay into their wildcard spot and have won 3 out of their last 4 games(with their only loss being a close game vs the Dallas Stars who are 2nd in the NHL) while the Kraken are on the downfall with 4 losses in a row and are 1-9 in their last 10 games. Those two teams faced twice this season with the Sharks taking the first game 6-1 and then losing the other one 4-1 with both games being in Seattle. I expect the Sharks to be ready to avenge that last loss against them especially in their own arena which they are 10-6-3 while the Kraken&#x27;s away record is 5-7-3. In Celebrini we trust!

Easy cash as Puka goes full dog catching 12 balls for **225** yards – clearing this line by a handsome 50 all by himself. JSN adds 96 for good measure bringing their total to 321. Bets aside, one of the best games to watch all year.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** NFL - Eagles at Commanders 5pm EST: **AJ Brown Over 62.5 yards receiving (-110) 3U**

For <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> we head to DC for the first of 2 divisional games that the Eagles and Commanders will play over the next two weeks. Commanders are eliminated, Eagles can clinch NFC East with a win.

AJ Brown has had an up and down season but after sufficient whining, has stepped into form the past month. In the previous three games before last weeks 31-0 blowout win over the Raiders where he sat out the 4^(th) quarter, Brown brought in 24 catches on 35 targets for a total of 342 yards. That’s an avg of 8 catches for 114 yards/game.

My Commanders are sadly, if predictably, one of the worst passing defenses in the league, giving up the 4^(th) most passing yards (260), the most completions over 40 yards, and sit 28^(th) in pass defense DVOA. In short, we suck, have sucked, and will continue to suck at defending the pass. What’s worse for the Commies (but good for our bet) is that we play man coverage at an above avg rate which has only gone up since Quinn took over playcalling.

Brown feasts on man-heavy schemes, ranking as the 4^(th) highest receiver vs man coverage according to PFF. He tore up Bears – also heavy man defense – for 132 yards a few weeks back and in the three games against the Commies last year - torched us for 65, 95, and 97 yards. Despite the divisional matchup, recent Eagles/Commanders games have been shootouts (with the Eagles usually outshooting the Commies). The scores of the their last six games have been (55:23) (36:33) (26:18) (38:31) (34:31) (32:21) with 5/6 totaling over 50 points and 4/6 going over 60 points. Its gonna be sunny and 40 degrees in DC tomorrow afternoon – little to no wind – perfect December football. All signs point to **AJ Brown over 62.5 yards**. BOL if tailing!</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>💎<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Oregon-20.5
Odds: -125 on FanDuel
Wager: 2 Units

Record: 6-6
Net Units: -1.0 

Oregon can cover -20.5 against James Madison on Saturday because their profile matches what you typically need to win by 3+ scores: top-end scoring efficiency, explosive-play ability, and a home environment that creates mistakes and short fields. Statistically, Oregon’s offense has been strong all year (about 36.3 points per game, top-15 nationally, and 0.541 points per play, top-10), with elite overall efficiency and big-play gear that can turn a “normal” 10–14 point game into a runaway if JMU has even one bad quarter.  James Madison is legitimately good—especially defensively (allowing only 16.3 points per game, top-10, and just 4.0 yards per play, top-5), which is why the spread is “only” around the low-20s even with the talent gap.  But covering is still very realistic for Oregon because (1) Autzen can cause communication issues for an option-heavy / run-centric offense and lead to false starts, burned timeouts, and punts that flip field position,  (2) Oregon’s roster talent is simply higher across the two-deep, so if the Ducks get up two scores they can keep the pedal down with fresh bodies, and (3) the injury situation may actually improve for Oregon—national previews note multiple Oregon skill players who’ve been banged up as possible returns, which raises the ceiling for explosive scoring.  The market also reflects this “blowout path” pretty clearly: the AP’s betting coverage pegged JMU as about a 20.5-point underdog, implying oddsmakers see Oregon’s median outcome as a comfortable win even while respecting JMU’s defense.  Put it together and the cover script is simple: Oregon’s efficiency generates points early, crowd noise and speed force JMU into a couple empty drives, and once the Ducks create separation, their tempo/athleticism and depth turn a 17–7 type game into something like 38–14—exactly the kind of scoreline that gets you past a -20.5.</td></tr>

Early kickoff at St James Park just means a tough time for this Chelsea side. Regardless of the injuries Newcastle have, I&#x27;ve watched this matchup over and over over the years to see how it goes. Chelsea haven&#x27;t beaten Newcastle at St James Park since 2021, just a stadium that adds an extra player on the pitch.



Lots of adversity coming from Chelsea&#x27;s end, and I do see them having better spells than expected, but Newcastle will play the crowds and apply the pressure. Expecting Sanchez to have a busy day on goal tomorrow.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Miami +3.5 -118 2.36u to win 2u**



***Miami Hurricanes @ Texas A&amp;M Aggies, Noon EST. Kyle Field, College Station, Texas.***



Battle of the two teams who beat Notre Dame. Both of these teams were ranked as high as #2 in the country at various points in the season, and showed the ability to bleed a little bit. I think this is an excellent matchup and should be one of the best games of the season. Pretty excited for this one.



Texas A&amp;M doesn’t impress me much. They had one of the softer schedules in the SEC, and nearly lost to South Carolina. Required a 2nd half heroic performance from Marcel Reed, and an absolute collapse from Shane Beamer and his squad. They then lost to Texas by 10 points, in what seemed like their first actual test of the year. Miami has also shown some weakness, losing to a middling Louisville team, and being a litttlee bit too competitive with teams that they shouldn’t have had an issue with. Both teams have QB’s who can get into pretty severe cold stretches. 



I think Miami’s front 4 can get to Marcel Reed without requiring additional blitzers. They’re a top 5 d-line in the country with a sure fire top 5 <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> playing on the edge in Reubin Bane. Guy is an absolute game wrecker. Marcel Reed’s stats actually IMPROVE when he gets pressured, and I think the reason why is he can’t read a defense well. He relies on playing recess ball, and when teams bring extra guys to rush him, he’s able to find 1on1’s due to lack of numbers in the secondary. If Miami can keep 7 guys in coverage and STILL get to Marcel Reed, they will make him have a longggg day. I believe they’ll have the ability to do so with this really high level front 4.



Carson Beck gets a lot of hate. He’s a pretty ugly guy. He can get really turnover prone and play like a high schooler occasionally. He got his Lambo stolen when he moved to Miami and I think his girlfriend broke up with him in the off season and I’m pretty sure she had an Only Fans. Got his job taken by Stetson Bennett at Georgia after getting hurt in the SEC championship last year and bounced to take a few million in NIL at Miami. He’s also 30 years old or something



Guy is 34-5 in his college career. Built like an NFL QB. Played in the SEC and won against juggernauts. Threw for 11,000 yards in his career. Extremely high completion %. He’s in a good flow, winning his last 4 games by 20+ points each game, throwing for an average completion % of 80%, 300+ yards per game, and has only thrown 1 <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> in that stretch. When he’s playing well, he looks like a serious NFL prospect. He’s got plenty of big games under his belt and can BALL out against anybody. FRESHMAN SENSATION Malachi Toney will be a big component to this game, gadget guy who is an extension of the run game. Screens, deep balls, YAC, jet sweeps. Doesn’t matter how this dude gets the ball, every time he touches it he’s liable to score. He’ll be the difference maker in this matchup and I don’t think A&amp;M’s defense can stop him.



Texas A&amp;M has a really poor turnover ratio, sitting at 120th in the country. They won’t be able to capitalize on Carson Beck’s turnover problem, and Marcel Reed might give Miami a couple. This will be a game of field position that comes down to one or two plays that will decide the outcome. I think Miami will be able to get the job done, and ultimately beat A&amp;M, and worse case scenario we’re getting a couple of points our way in case this game ends in a field goal. I like Miami to cover the +3.5. Good luck, have fun

**Last:** (CBB) Arizona ML (1u) - ✅

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** (CBB) No. 12 North Carolina (-3.5) vs Ohio State

**Start Time:** 3:00 PM ET (CBS)

**Odds:** -115 (DraftKings)

**Units:** 1.5U

**Reasoning:** Typically, when a team races out to a hot start, there’s always fear of a letdown on the horizon. 

However, don’t expect that to be the case for North Carolina. Although his team sits at an impressive 10-1--with victories over two Top 25 opponents—head coach Hubert Davis actually wants more from his players. 

“We’ve gotten off to fast starts and then we’ve had a four- or six-minute lull on both ends of the floor,” said the fifth-year head coach. “The consistency, that’s one of the biggest things with this team, just playing at that high level. We’ve shown that we can be there, but it’s the consistency to be able to do that for a full 40 minutes.”

A Tar Heels squad keeping it in high gear throughout an entire game? That’s a scary thought, for a team that has still managed to go 7-4 ATS on the season, including covering in each three of its last four. Not to mention, North Carolina has managed to accomplish this all without its veteran leader and top perimeter defender Seth Trimble (14.5 PPG, 5.0 RPG), who is set to return to the lineup for the first time since Nov. 7. 

His presence will only bolster an already formidable defensive unit.

Through 11 games, the Tar Heels rank 6th in opponent field-goal percentage (37.0%), 14th in defensive efficiency (0.901), 14th in scoring defense (64.1 PPGA) and 63rd in opponent three-point percentage (30.3%). Those numbers have been even better as of late, dropping to 60.3 PPGA on 36.3-percent shooting (28.8% from three-point range) over the team’s last three games. The unit will once again be tested against an Ohio State offense that packs a punch, ranking 15th in field-goal percentage (51.2%), 29th in offensive efficiency (1.185), 30th in scoring (87.6 PPG) and 125th in three-point shooting (34.8%). The return of Trimble comes at just the right time for North Carolina, as the Buckeyes (8-2) are led by senior guard Bruce Thornton (21.8 PPG) who shoots 60.2-percent from the field, including a blistering 50.0% from beyond the arc.

On the other end of the floor, look for the Tar Heels to take advantage of a slumping Ohio State defense. 

Thus far, the Buckeyes have fared respectively on defense across the board, ranking 61st in opponent three-point percentage (30.2%), 83rd in opponent field-goal percentage (41.8%), 85th in defensive efficiency (0.987) and 135th in scoring defense (72.9 PPGA). However, over their last three contests, those numbers have ballooned to 86.0 points per game on 43.8% shooting (40.3% from three-point range). That should be music to the ears of a North Carolina offense that comes in ranking 68th in offensive efficiency (1.134), 80th in field-goal percentage (47.2%), 85th in scoring (80.7 PPG) and 205th in three-point shooting (32.7%). 

Finally, look for rebounding to play an X factor on Saturday afternoon. 

Per KenPom, the Tar Heels rank 1st in average height (79.5) and 8th in effective height (+2.3). That advantage has become evident on the glass, as the team ranks 4th in defensive rebounding (29.0 per game), 12th in total rebounding (42.1) and 116th in offensive rebounding (10.0) while ranking 58th in opponent defensive rebounding (20.2), 77th in opponent total rebounding (32.6) and 80th in opponent offensive rebounding (8.2). Conversely, Ohio State ranks 33rd in defensive rebounding (26.3), 111th in total rebounding (37.0) and 290th in offensive rebounding (7.7) while ranking 21st in opponent defensive rebounding (19.1), 34th in opponent total rebounding (31.3) and 115th in opponent offensive rebounding (8.5). However, unfortunately for the Buckeyes, those opponent rebounding numbers have only gotten worse over their last three outings, jumping to 22.7, 37.7 and 10.0 respectively. 

Look for Trimble’s return to spark North Carolina to a complete-game effort and get the job done.

Units +56.4

Back with a premier League <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. After missing the last few game weeks just been too busy to really have time to research the games properly.


Last pick:

Manchester United Vs West Ham 

Manchester United win &amp; Bryan Mbuemo to have a shot on target.

(1.80) 2.5 units ✖️

Some time ago now but a really unfortunate loss, Mbuemo getting his shot on target in the first half and United much the better team and was winning the match until the last 10 minutes when west ham scored from nowhere, United created more than enough chances to go 2-0 but poor finishing cost them the win here.

Premier League 

Brighton Vs Sunderland 

Brighton win and under 4.5 goals 

(1.95) 3 units.

Brighton host Sunderland, the long away day for the side from the north of England traveling to the South coast.

Sunderland have done exceptionally well this season, nobody could have predicted they would have as many points this season, this is down to a very strong home support and they&#x27;ve picked up a lot of points in their home games, but they have struggled on the road, managing the odd draw here and there, but they have been outperformed in almost every away match this season.


Sunderland are also the team which faces the biggest loss of players in the league to AFCON, **Sunderland have 6 first team players and 4 regular starters gone on international duty** ,with another 2 players out with injuries and suspensions also.

Sunderland are expected to line up very defensively with a 5-4-1 formation and will look to frustrate Brighton for as long as possible. Brighton will have a lot of the ball and chances here as they do against most teams at home, they will miss just 1 player to AFCON in balleba in midfield but still have all their attacking players available.

I think there are too many first team players for Sunderland to survive, when they have already really struggled on the road, and I think eventually Brighton will break them down and get the win in a game that shouldn&#x27;t have too many goals.

**Todays Event** 🏈 NFL Saturday Night Football Packers @ Bears 7:20 PM CST 🏈

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Todays pick</mark>:** Kyle Monangai 50+Rushing Yards (+102 on DK) 1u to win 1.02u

**Writeup:** Battle for the NFC North, a heavily injured Packers unit face the Bears in Chicago. Both teams need a win and a little help from Rodgers out in Detroit Sunday night to beat the Lions to clinch. It is sure to be a heated game

D&#x27;Andre swift is looking questionable with a groin injury. While I would take his under for my bet, he&#x27;s played prior weeks after injury, even gong for 90 yards against the Vikings week 11. Rome Odunze and Luther Burden are also out, while Cole Kmet is questionable, giving Caleb Williams less to work with.

Monangai has been an up and coming star especially in the 2nd half of this season, averaging 48.6 yards per game over 10.4 rush attempts, averaging 4.7 Yards Per Carry. He&#x27;s proven he&#x27;s a good backup behind Swift. He&#x27;s cleared this number the last time they played Green Bay in week 14.

Packers defense is top 10, only allowing just over 100 rushing yards per game with 3.9 yards per carry, but they&#x27;ve been declining through the year. They&#x27;ve lost star rusher Mica Parsons last week, listed Collin Oliver as out this week, Listen Safety Evan Williams as questionable, and have been missing Devonte Wyatt since Thanksgiving. This defense will have lots of gaps for Monangai to exploit.

Finally, Bears are favored this game. The spread is rather low at -1.5, No doubt since its an important Rivalry game at this point deciding who&#x27;s the 2nd seed and who&#x27;s the 7th seed (And possibly who gets home field advantage between them if they matchup in the wild card round). This suggests ample opportunity for rushing, highlighted by the lack of receivers like Odunze and Burden. If early rushes build up tempo and if Swift is limited, I can see Monangai getting plenty of touches and torching this line.

**Write Up:** It is time to return to our roots. With Palmer back in the lineup I took a bit of a break playing Enzo while he settled in. Now that we&#x27;ve seen 3 Palmer games and Enzo is back to his box crashing self, we&#x27;re returning to our favorite play at some really nice plus money odds. Enzo 1+ Shot on Target has hit in 9 of his last 10 matches, the only miss being a 3 shot game vs Leeds with Caicedo serving his first of 3 game suspension. I like this play even more now that Caicedo should be back and next to him in the midfield, that will empower Enzo to play further forward and attack the net. 

You all already know why I love me some Enzo, we&#x27;re backing our guy again for an SOT to start the weekend. We&#x27;ve cashed this play 4 times so far, let&#x27;s make it 5. BOL and have a great Saturday!</td></tr>

__Event:__ NFL: Eagles @ Commanders 5pm EST

__POTD:__ Saquon Barkley o75.5 rushing yards (-110), 3.3u to win 3u

__Write Up:__ Despite 3 College Football Playoff games going down tomorrow, it pains me that I’ll be having to take this Saquon prop instead but it’s money. __First let me breakdown the implications this game has on Saquon’s contract incentives.__ The Eagles signed the former Giants RB last March to a 3 year, $38 mil contract following his historic 2024 season where he rushed for 2,504 yards, breaking the single season record &amp; leading his new team to the Super Bowl. The extension made him the highest paid RB in NFL history &amp; included $36 mil guaranteed. Barkley is the first RB making $20+ mil/year &amp; can make an additional $15 mil in incentives &amp; escalators. Barkley gets $250k for 1,500 yards &amp; it becomes $500k at 2k yards. If he rushes for 1k yards &amp; Philly wins the NFC ship he gets $250k, that turns to $500k if they win it all. That’s up to $1.5 mil per year in incentives. Also, any incentives earned escalate each remaining year’s salary by the same amount. So say he earns the full incentive package in 2025, his base salaries in 2026-2028 increase by $1.5 mil each year. That leads to a max payout of $15 mil. So what does that mean for this week? __There are 3 games left in the regular season &amp; Barkley sits at 1,213 yards. To earn his $250k incentive he needs 287 yards. He needs to avg 96 total yards per game to hit that mark, with another $250k waiting at 2k yards, plus escalators that bump future salaries by the same amount. As for rushing yards, he sits at 940, so he’s just 60 yards away from another 1k season setting up another potential 250k/500k bonus.__ It it all starts this week in a crucial game for playoff implications against a Commanders defense that continues to be one of the most attackable run defenses in football.

The Eagles (9-5) are traveling to Maryland to take on the Commanders (4-10) this Saturday. These teams have not met this season &amp; their last meeting was on Jan 26 in the NFC ship with Philly crushing them 55-23. This NFC East rematch was supposed to have huge playoff implications for both teams when the NFL schedule makers set this game for a Saturday Week 16. But Washington limps into the game already eliminated from playoffs &amp; without their Star QB Jayden Daniels who’s out for the season with dislocated elbow. Washington came into the season with high hopes riding the high of an NFC Championship &amp; started the season off 3-2. They then went on to lose 8 in a row, but did earn a 29-21 win last week over the Giants. The Eagles upheld their expectations with a chance to lock in the division title this week &amp; jump up in the NFC standings. The Eagles have had a roller coaster of a season. Starting off 4-0 with huge wins over the Chiefs, Rams, Cowboys, &amp; Bucs. Then lost their next 2, won their next 4, lost their next 3, before destroying the Raiders 31-0 last week. They’ve dealt with injuries with starting LT Lane Johnson &amp; DT Jalen Carter both having been out. But they have a chance to lock in the division this week against a Washington team that just so happens to be one of the most generous defenses in the league when it comes to feeding RB’s.

Washington head coach Dan Quinn is in his 2nd season with the team. Philly has been a thorn in Quinn’s side for years, dating back to when he was the coach of my ATL Falcons. Quinn has been to the playoffs 3 times as a head coach. 2016 in ATL: 28-3 Super Bowl vs Pats 😔. 2017 in ATL: Eliminated by Philly. Last year in WSH: Eliminated by Philly. To make matters worse, Quinn is a defensive head coach, having spent 23 of his 31 year coaching career coaching defenses only. This defensive coach cannot stop Saquon. __In Barkley’s 3 games vs Washington last year:__

Week 11: 26 carries, 146 yards, 2 TDs

Week 17: 29 carries, 150 yards, 2 TDs

NFC Ship: 15 carries, 118 yards, 3 TDs

__That’s 414 rushing yards &amp; 7 TD’s in just 3 games. 39% of his TD’s came against Washington last season.__ Saquon is the sole reason Quinn made stopping the run an offseason priority for Washington, it just hasn’t worked. In 2024 the Commanders allowed the 2nd most rushing yards per game (143.4), giving up 5.0 yards per carry (2nd most). They ranked 27th in EPA run defense (-0.019). __This year Washington ranks 27th in EPA run defense once again (-0.006). They allow 136.3 rushing yards per game (5th most), on 4.7 yards per carry (5th most).__ The biggest issue with this Commanders defense is they just can’t bring ball carriers to the ground. __Washington has the 5th most missed tackles this season with 103. That’s a huge issue when they are also giving up the 9th most yards before contact at the line of scrimmage (2.37). This has allowed opposing RB’s to run at the 4th highest success rate in the NFL (47.3%), breaking free at the 7th highest explosive run rate (5.3%).__

That’s going to be a huge issue vs Barkley who is the 5th fastest in the league this season clocked at 21.87 mph &amp; has an explosive run rate at 7.08%. Scheme wise this is a great matchup for Saquon too. __Philly pounds the Gaps on 40.5% of their runs. Washington has been the worst gap run defense in the league, allowing a league high 60.7% success rate &amp; 5.61 yards per carry (4th most) when defending gap runs. Even worse, Philly specifically targets the C gap (outside the Offensive Tackle) &amp; D gap (outside the Tight End) on 53.7% of their runs (7th most), averaging the 6th most yards per carry (5.68). Washington allows the 3rd highest success rate (57.9%) &amp; the 5th most YPC (5.71) on runs to those gaps. Philly doesn’t run inside much, just 43.6% of runs toward the A/B gaps (7th fewest), but when they do, Washington still allows the 4th highest success rate (60.3%) $ 4.64 YPC (5th most).__ Washington’s defense simply has nowhere to hide. Another strategy Quinn has used in the past has been to stack the box with 7+ defenders. __Washington stacks the box on 40% of runs, yet still allows the 10th most YPC when doing so (3.77). Philly has been successful vs stacked boxes this season averaging 3.83 YPC. Philly ranks top 10 in yards before contact (2.12), Washington allows 2.37, &amp; that gap is exactly where Barkley does his damage.__ Saquon is the clear workhorse for this Eagles backfield too, with an 80% snap share (3rd most in NFL) &amp; they are feeding him. He had 25 opportunities last week, his most since Week 11. He’s had 20+ touches in back to back weeks with zero competition &amp; when Philly plays from ahead he consistently gets 20 carries. Philly already runs the ball on 48.13% of plays (4th most) &amp; Washington faces a run rate of 46.73% (8th most). This is a perfect volume environment vs an extremely weak run defense that Saquon feasts on. 

Saquon gets his bag Saturday night.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Algeria vs Sudan AFCON (soccer): Algeria ML and Mohamed Amoura 1+ SOT, -115 on DK at time of writeup, betting 1u

Not really sure why I&#x27;m making a post <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> with no NFL or NBA, but I want to try this out.

AFCON round 1 is <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. This game starts at 10 AM ET. Now, I know nothing personally about either of these national teams. Sudan is pretty bad. They have not scored a single goal in their last 5 matches. Algeria have won their past 4 matches. Algeria has Mahrez, who is old but still good. Zidane&#x27;s kid is their goalie, he plays in the Spanish second tier. Algeria is a strong side, they also have a player called Baghdad Bounedjah, who has contributed almost the same amount of goals to the team as Mahrez. Sudan has conceded at least one goal in 6 of their last 7 matches. Algeria has players who are experienced and generally much higher quality than what Sudan has to offer. They should score once or twice here. Would be very surprised looking at the match history and just generally considering how these matches go between quality sides and lower quality sides in these international tournaments if Algeria can&#x27;t outscore this Sudan side. 

Who is Mohamed Amoura? I had no idea before going into this writeup, but apparently he&#x27;s good. He plays for Wolfsburg, a respectable side in the German league. He scored 10 times for Algeria in World Cup qualifying. His attacking partners Mahrez and Bounedjah are older, Amoura is 25. He is clearly the top attacker of a team that should dominate the game. He will absolutely be going for goals here against a weak Sudan team.

Only 1u because I don&#x27;t know any of this stuff personally, but this seems like a good <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> by the numbers. BOL to all tailing</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s Event:** AFCON (Soccer) | Cameroon vs Gabon (12:00PM PST)

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Bryan Mbuemo Over 1 SOT (+131) 1 unit to win 1.31 units

**Write Up:** Man these cup matches, lots of chanced for Arsenal and they barely squeak by with one goal and advance on penalties. Really tough to predict these lineups and which teams will show up. Sorry friends, bad game to play. 

Not a ton of soccer on for Xmas Eve. I recommend taking it easy with your units and enjoying watching the games and spending time with family with your beverage of choice.

That said, while I do not watch a ton of Africa football, one of my favorite players is playing <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> in Mbuemo and I&#x27;m seeing good value in him <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Both of these teams are mixed bags. Cameroon does not have a ton of big names outside of our guy, but with their main striker out Mbuemo will be the most dangerous attacking threat, likely penalty taker, and the conduit for most of Cameron&#x27;s offense. Gabon tends to either concede 4 goals or concede 0 goals, there is not much in between. 

To clarify my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, this is a push if he only gets 1 SOT, and a cash at 2+ SOT. I like him for 2 SOTs and my original <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> was ATGS (+255), but those fall outside of the allowable <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> limits. If your book does not offer over 1, you are essentially splitting into two bets. Say your units are 100 for easy math, right now on DK that means 64 goes on 1+ SOT and 36 goes on 2+ SOT. The goal is to place your 1+ SOT bet to break even. 

BOL and hope everyone has a Merry Christmas!</td></tr>

Prior Play: Nigeria ML (W)

Event: Algeria vs Sudan @ 10:00am (EST)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Algeria ML + Over 1.5 Goals (SGP) = 1.18u at -118

Write Up: My second AFCON play of the tournament. Algeria should cruise to a victory here. The better and more well balanced team in this matchup, plus the team in good form. Sudan is just not as developed as Algeria when it comes to any aspect of soccer. I knew I was going to play Algeria in some way, but the money line was a bit chalky so I decided to just group in the over 1.5, which I believe should be an easy mark for Algeria to hit. This is a pretty simple bet.

Overall: Again, every bet I place will be to win 1u. This is for transparency reasons. Remember, bankroll management is key. Betting to win 5u usually means that someone has a small unit size in comparison to their bankroll, or that they should just increase their unit size in general. Everything should be played with the ability to lose. If you need a bet to win or else you lose a large chunk of your money, you probably have a unit size that oversized. Be smart with it.

Bet responsibly.</td></tr>

**Event:** AFCON, Burkina Faso v Equatorial Guinea, 7:30 am EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Equatorial Guinea Win or Draw -111, 4.5 units

**Write Up:** Here&#x27;s a crazy stat - **Burkina Faso have only won one out of the 13 AFCON openers.** I&#x27;m tempted to conclude my write up here, but honestly it only gets better if we bring the **H2H** into the equation as **Burkina Faso haven&#x27;t beaten Equatorial Guinea yet,** with their last two games ending in a disappointing 0-0 (oh, how we&#x27;d take that <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>). But make no mistake, Equatorial Guinea aren’t just stubborn defensively - they’ve consistently made **AFCON group stages difficult for favourites**, going unbeaten in a number of crucial group games historically and even **scoring in five consecutive AFCON group matches** in past tournaments, thus proving they can absolutely be menacing in the final third. **Emilio Nsue** remains a **danger going forward**, he&#x27;s very capable of producing decisive moments out of thin air, while midfielder **Omar Mascarell’s** presence adds **experience and composure in transition.** Initially, I was tempted to go with the 2.5 goals Under, but seeing how Burkina Faso managed to be involved in a few high-scoring games leading up to this meeting, I&#x27;ve decided to just back Equatorial Guinea. I don&#x27;t mind taking the 2.5 Under line, and you could definitely use it to spice up the odds even further (or perhaps take 3.5 for extra padding), I just haven&#x27;t picked it as my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>. I&#x27;m very confident with this one so I&#x27;m going in with 4.5 units. We don&#x27;t need dominance here, just discipline, and I believe Equatorial Guinea has enough quality to hold Burkina Faso to a draw, or even take all three points in what is going to be a tightly contested affair.

**Reasoning:** Santi Aldama just casually dropping almost 40 smfh - anyways, I love Cal in a battle against honestly pretty evenly matched teams, and while this is the Hawaii Bowl in Hawaii theres also something to say story-wise about Cal QB Jaron-Keawe Sagapolutele being from Hawaii and this being techincally a &quot;home&quot; game for him as well. I think it could potentially be a wild up/down game, but Cals defense has been underrated this season and to me, JKS is the difference maker. Cal by 3+ for the + money</td></tr>

Yes i still like smiej because i already put a bet on him yesterday the same unit i am putting with everything (5units). Also, he is the last leg of my parlay (got a promo) which will pay me about 60usd, and someone will tip me about 50usd if smiej win, someone will give me 20 if smiej win so theres a lot at stake on that match.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Shanghai (W) vs Liaoning (W) O123.5 total points 1.2 units to win 1U @1.83 (Bet365)

Write-up: I said that last play was statistically the best I’d ever posted and boy did it deliver… me a heart attack. 130 total points in a 25-15, 27-25, 25-13 win for Scandicci. Doesn’t get any more sweaty than that but those wins always feel the best and hopefully we’ll start gaining more momentum heading into the new year as the recent form has been slightly better (it’s still not great).

It’s Christmas Eve and you know what Santa promised me this year? A win on the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> reddit thread. Really let loose with my demand this year. Could the Christmas spirit get me two wins a row, let’s find out. Yes, we will be frantically watching some Chinese second division women’s volleyball on this day much to the family’s worry and I’ll just pretend like I actually support these teams (spoiler: it won’t work). Anyways this line is simply too low for this match in my opinion. We’re only 3 games into the season and Shanghai have the chance to go top of the division with a win here. Meanwhile, Liaoning are bottom with three losses to start the season off. Not off to the best start but 123.5 is very low for volleyball and the stats back it up. Lianoning didn’t have a great season last year either with a 7th place finish (out of 8), Shanghai were 2nd so the stats do reflect last year’s dynamic. Shanghai have cleared the line in 8 of their last 9 home matches (89%) and with an expectation of them winning, 17 of their last 18 home wins (94%). Liaoning meanwhile have covered the over in their last 10/10 away league matches and their last 27/27 total matches. With regards to H2H Shanghai have surprisingly really struggled against Liaoning losing their last three against the side and their matches have gone over in 13/14 of these fixtures in Shanghai’s back yard and 26/27 total fixtures which is great for the play. I would kind of take it with a pinch of salt considering these stats go back to 2014 plus I focus less on head to head due to numerous factors but it does show a trend. I am slightly more bullish on this one compared to yesterday’s pick simply because this is a case of top playing bottom but regardless no matter what way I see it the line is just too low here and I look to find an edge. Despite Liaoning’s bad form they hit the over against current leaders Shandong this season. BOL !

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Burkina Faso to Win @ 1.75 

Units to bet: 5u

Write-Up:
Burkina Faso look well placed to secure a win in this matchup, particularly with the advantage of playing at home and the level of control they have shown in recent performances. They tend to approach games with confidence and structure, managing tempo effectively and limiting opponents’ opportunities, while Equatorial Guinea have struggled to assert themselves, especially on the road. Burkina Faso’s ability to stay compact defensively and capitalise on key moments gives them the edge in what should be a disciplined and controlled performance. With momentum on their side and a clear difference in overall sharpness and composure, Burkina Faso are well positioned to take all three points.

Explanation: I think Cal can beat Hawaii tomorrow because Cal has been throwing the ball efficiently and creating a decent amount of negative plays on defense. 

 Hawaii’s offense seems one dimensional to me.  Cal is a pass first team and their QB Sagapolutele has been having a great season with 3000+ passing yards. I don’t see Hawaii’s defense being able to consistently put pressure on Cal’s passing game.</td></tr>

**LAST PICK:** Hapoel Tel Aviv -5.5 vs. FC Bayern Munich ✅

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>TODAY</mark>&#x27;S <mark style='background:#fff59d'>PICK</mark>:** Houston Rockets -7,5 vs. LA Clippers (NBA)

**ODDS:** 1.86 / -116 (varía según book)

# Reasoning:

This is a strong spot for Houston when looking at current form, rotations and matchup context.

The Rockets are playing solid basketball at home and come in with a clear physical and depth advantage. Even without VanVleet, Houston still have enough ball-handling and pace through **Amen Thompson**, while **Sengun** remains the offensive hub and a major mismatch inside.

The Clippers, on the other hand, are extremely short-handed. **Chris Paul and Zubac are out**, which leaves them thin in playmaking and interior defense. That puts a lot of responsibility on **Harden and Kawhi**, both of whom are being asked to carry heavy minutes on a struggling team with little margin for error.

Without Zubac, the Clippers have no reliable answer for Sengun in the paint, and Houston’s ability to score inside should force help defense and open up secondary scoring. Defensively, the Rockets are physical and disciplined enough to limit easy looks and force the Clippers into tough half-court possessions.

Given the gap in depth, interior matchup and current team trajectories, this sets up as a game where Houston can control the pace and gradually pull away. **-7,5 is a fair number and still offers value** in this spot.

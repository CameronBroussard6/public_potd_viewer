**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** West Ham vs **Chelsea ML** | **Lorient ML** vs Nantes **(2.5u)**

**Odds:** \+198

**Write Up:** Pretty sweat free, Knicks early payout and full time blowout means we secure this pretty easily. Nice little win, onto the next.

Quick and simple <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> as I realised I placed my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> and had everything ready just not posted the write-up here! Firstly WH vs CFC - head to head Chelsea are on a 4 game win streak. This game has seen plenty of goal and btts often so the fact West Ham are 1-0 up as of right now is not putting me off. Both team are coming into this fixture on win streaks, CFC on 4 and WH on 3 (all fixtures), I expect this to see its fair share of goals but as its at Chelsea&#x27;s home stadium I reckon they see it through given their decent form and quality over a team who are sitting 18th, compared to 5th.

Nantes vs Lorient is an odd choice you may think as coming into this Nantes have not lost in the last 3 H2H fixtures- BUT Lorient are currently on a 3 game win streak with no losses in 10 and Nantes on a 3 game losing streak. This game also sees a shared amount of goals with BTTS happening 5/last 7 meetings. Lorient&#x27;s home form is middle of the pack going 6-7-6 (W-D-L) compared to Nantes&#x27; away form of 2-3-4. Nantes have only seen 3 wins and 5 draws with 11! losses this season. Despite Lorient only being mid-table at 9th I do reckon they see this game out as the home advantage and current form will give them the edge they would need to win this fixture.

BOL and always bet what you can afford to lose!</td></tr>

**Last POTD:** (NCAAB) St. Bonaventure - Saint Louis (-8.5) 📈

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** (NCAAB) IPFW - Robert Morris (Over 144.5)

**Start Time:** 06:00 PM (GMT)

**Odds:** \-115

**Units:** 1U

**Reasoning:** A little bit late, the match starts in 1 hour but its just <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> there&#x27;s is sooooo many games and Saturday. I go through all games one by one, I couldn&#x27;t even finish them all but this one is good for the oven.

The Over 144.5 in Purdue Fort Wayne Mastodons vs Robert Morris Colonials makes sense because this game sets up to move. Fort Wayne likes to play fast and routinely lives in the high 70s or low 80s, especially at home.

Robert Morris isn’t far behind offensively and they’re not exactly a lockdown defense either, so their games tend to climb into the mid 140s without much effort. When these two match up, nobody slows the pace or sits on the ball. Possessions are quick, shots go up early, and the scoreboard keeps ticking. With a total this low for two teams that can both score and give it up, you don’t need anything crazy to happen, just a normal game flow and that’s why 145+ is the most likely outcome.</td></tr>

Last pick: Detroit -3.5 against PHX, they got smoked. 

Event: Spurs @ Hornets 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Keldon Johnson under 5.5 rebounds 

Write Up:  horrible streak, don&#x27;t tail. Game starts in 10 minutes. Johnson has only cleared this line in 3/ last 10. He&#x27;s averaging 4.5 rebounds during that time. Charlotte allows the fewest rebounds of anyone in the NBA. His isn&#x27;t a game where I think he&#x27;ll go over his recent average. Wemby is playing and Diabate for Charlotte, they&#x27;ll keep a lot of the rebounds.

Safer Parlay: Cincinnati +18.5 alt spread + Kansas +3.5 alt spread (+101)

Riskier parlay: Cincinnati +14.5 + Kansas -3.5 (+270)


Write Up: Personally I think both of these hit. The second parlay is a combination of the spreads as they are currently set by the books. Cincinnati has covered spreads easily and even won games against good and/or ranked teams (see: Baylor: won by 10; Iowa St: won by 9; HOUSTON: lost by 9). Kansas is a good team at home against a high-scoring but not as good BYU team.</td></tr>

**Recap + overview(?):**

Had a late night last night so I am posting this way later than expected. The beers were pretty good if anyone is interested in that haha

Unfortunately the Radomiak vs Arka Gdynia match was postponed due to a power outage in the stadium. It is not yet officially voided so I will wait with adjusting my record for now.

Let&#x27;s keep riding the momentum.

**Write Up:**

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> I’ll keep it simple. Maybe an extended write up will force a delay in the match again.

Chelsea are good in the 1st half at home. 11 games, 6-5-0 record with 10 goals scored and 3 against. They aim to get ahead early and will do so again <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.

Chelsea kept a clean sheet in 82% of the games and ended up scoring themselves in 73% of the games.

West Ham are 2-4-5 away from home in the 1st half with only 3 goals scored whilst conceding 9. They have kept a clean sheet in 55% of the matches and only scored in 18% of the matches.

If a team scores it most likely will be chelsea and they will pull off the halftime result.

Not as confident as the big 4U/5U plays but I like the play so putting 2U on it.

**Previous:** Kings vs Celtics | Both Teams to Score in the First Minute of the Game - No \[1U\]✅

**Event:** NBA | [San Antonio Spurs](https://www.poundingtherock.com/) vs Charlotte Hornets | 12:00pm EST  
**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Both Teams to Score in the First Minute of the Game - No \[1U\]

The Spurs are around the top-10 in the league when it comes to defensive points allowed and above average in field goal defensive. The big man Wemby plays a big part  in rim protection in that along with guys like Castle and Harper around the perimeter. Hornets favor the 3 ball and the Spurs have a defensive core that can force them inside the paint which is where things get dicey shooting 46% from the field this season. Charlotte is known to cough the ball up, averaging close to 16 turnovers a game. 

I expect the Spurs to score first, and holding the Hornets offensive in their first possession to ultimately tick off 60 seconds on the clock before Charlotte can put the ball through the rim. 

BOL✌️</td></tr>

**Last:** Cade Cunningham o31.5 pts + ast (-114) FanDuel 4u ✅

**Event:** NBA: Mavericks @ Rockets 8:30 pm EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Kevin Durant o30.5 pts + ast (-122) FanDuel 3u

**Write-up:** Going back to KD since his line has basically stayed the same. As we know, Steven Adams is injured, which has led KD to log a ton of minutes. On this line, he is 25 out of 44 on the season... which isn&#x27;t great, but without Adams in the lineup, this jumps to 9 out of 13. In one of those games, he played the Grizzlies and shot an awful 5/18 - 28% with no free throws. In another, he played the Spurs and finished with 25 pts+ast, where he only shot 12 times, a season low. He played the Spurs again and ended just shy at 30 pts+ast.

Without Adams, KD is looking at 19.5 FGA per game. In the majority of those games, he is shooting 46% or better. He is also looking at 11 potential assists per game, while averaging 4.7. The Mavericks rank 6th in points allowed to the small forward position; for reference, the Spurs rank 3rd. However, in their last 7, they rank 26th in points allowed + 25th in threes allowed to small forwards. Mavericks are ranking middle of the pack in terms of assists allowed. Mavericks are ranked 4th in pace this season, and KD has covered in every game except one since Dec. 1, covering against teams ranked 10th or better. That one game was against the Mavericks, and he ended at 30 pts+ast and was sat a little early due to a blowout.

KD is the iso god. The Mavericks do okay in iso matchups, ranking 18th. KD is getting 50% of his points from isolation buckets, free throws, and spot-up shooting. The Mavericks rank 6th in defending spot-up shooting this season. This is where KD thrives. Versus teams that rank 10th or better in defending spot-up shooters, KD has covered in 11 out of 14 games.  Two of those losses were against the Mavericks. One game was with both Sengun and Adams (26pts+ast), and the last was without both (30pts+ast / the blowout). Should set us up perfectly with the Sengun-in/Adams-out combo <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. With KD doing so well against good spot-up defenses, it shows that KD wants you to guard him. KD wants to pull up and shoot it in your face. The slim reaper is extremely tall - taller than the entire Mavericks starting lineup. I think KD has even more incentive to score now, since he is inching closer to MJ’s scoring record every day.

Mavericks do tote a rank 10 transition defense and sit middle of the pack in free throws allowed. This leads me to bet a little less this time around, since it does take a chunk out of our win percentage. Still, though, this season KD is 1 out of 3 H2H against the Mavericks. He just took them for 41 pts+ast back on Jan 3.

At Home without Adams, KD is 2 out of 4 on the line, with the two losses coming from the Spurs. He did torch the Wolves for 46 and the Grizzlies for 35. KD should be looking at 20 shots tonight, paired with 11 potential assists / 5 assists. Spread sits at -10.5, favoring the Rockets. The Mavericks have beaten the Rockets in their last two. Should see a bit of a revenge game here from KD and the Rockets. I expect KD to play another 35 minutes here and get us another dub.

Good Luck, fellas!</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: 🏀 Seton Hall -2.5 alt + Santa Clara -2.5 alt (-122).

Game 1 starts at 12pm EST. Bet 2.25u

Writeup: This took way too long for me to decide on games. Wanted to take Vanderbilt but couldn’t get a good price on them, but I still like this bet as well. We’ve done well with alt parlays, so why stop now?

Seton Hall is simply the better team vs Marquette thanks to their defense. Seton Hall boasts a top 15 defense, whereas Marquette’s offense is outside the top 130. This is also one of our first bets where a slower paced team like Seton Hall is also incredibly consistent, with a consistency rating in the top 30. This is finally the combination we’ve been looking for to bet on this type of team. We’ve also seen this matchup earlier this year, where Seton Hall won by 6 as the away team. Marquette is coming off a huge win against Creighton last game, so I’ll give them the momentum advantage, but this Seton Hall defense should be too much for them. I’ll take Seton Hall by 3 or more.

Similar to the first game, I expect Santa Clara’s defense to be too much for Loyola Marymount to handle. Their defense is top 40, while Loyola Marymount has an offense below 250th. Santa Clara’s offense is also at an advantage, boasting a top 40 offense against LMU’s defense outside the top 100. Santa Clara also has a solid offensive rebounding advantage with one of the best field goal rates in the country. This is a deadly combo given that Santa Clara is a faster-paced team. In their first matchup, Santa Clara won by 31, and now Santa Clara is also playing some of their best ball as of late. They don’t play nearly as well away whereas LMU plays well at home, but I think the talent difference is too much in this one. Santa Clara should also win by 3 or more.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: **N.C. State -5.5 (-115 DraftKings) 1U**

Event: CBB | N.C. State @ Wake Forest (Noon EST) | 🏀 

*Recap: Grand Canyon led by two at the half, then pulled away on the strength of Henley&#x27;s guard play and some solid shooting.*

It&#x27;s 9 am EST and I&#x27;m writing from the snowy mountains of Western North Carolina. This game was scheduled for 345 and is now listed for noon. I fully expect a postponement, but I&#x27;m going to write this up anyway. I&#x27;m not going to write a novella <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Short and sweet.

Wake Forest (11-10) has lost three in a row, and hasn&#x27;t covered in 9 of its last 10 games. NC State (15-6) is red-hot at the moment (hot enough to melt the snow?). The Wolf Pack have won three in a row, and 8 of their last 10. Better yet, the Wolfpack have covered 7 of their last 10 games against Wake Forest. NC State has won all four of its ACC road games this season - at Pittsburgh (covered), Clemson (covered), Florida State (covered), and Boston College (did not cover -11.5). NC State laid 10.5 points on Dec. 31 when they beat Wake, 70-57. NCSU&#x27;s leading scorer, forward Darrion Williams (14.4 ppg), didn&#x27;t need to do much. He scored eight points on 3-of-12 shooting. Since that outing, Williams has three 20-point games,  including 23 in Tuesday&#x27;s 88-68 win over Syracuse. I like him to impose his will in the Wake rematch. Both these teams can score a&#x27;plenty, but KenPom has NCSU&#x27;s offense rated 28 while Wake is 88. Wake can play surprisingly stingy defense at times, but they&#x27;re sitting 15th in ACC standings and have allowed 82.7 points per game since their loss to NCSU. That&#x27;s six points over their season average. What are they playing for? Better yet, *who* are they playing for? The gym might be awfully empty if and when these teams tip off with 2-3 inches of snow on the ground. 

My thesis: N.C. State is playing well - they&#x27;ve covered three straight - and Wake is going down, down, down. The Wolfpack are 14th in the nation in shooting 3s (39 percent), and Wake struggles in stopping opposing shooters, allowing 56 percent from the floor. NC State is too balanced and too good on offense. I see them clearing a six-point win at Wake. Full disclosure: both KenPom and Bart Torvik think the final score comes in under 5.5 points, but I&#x27;m betting against the grain here. I don&#x27;t think Wake has a homecourt advantage <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> (in the snowstorm), and I think the recent trends are too much for the Demon Deacons to cover. I **DO** **NOT** like 6.5 here just because I think conference rematches are usually much tighter affairs, and early games tend to promote weaker shooting (which is State&#x27;s advantage). I&#x27;ll probably sweat this one, but I like the Pack to prevail in the snowy tundra of Winston-Salem.  

Good luck and Godspeed!

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Georgetown -5.5 vs Loyola/ Army -6 vs UMass +250 (1U) 

Write Up: Never really have the confidence to throw my picks out there for basketball. They’re all shots in the dark. But college lacrosse is what I know and love. These two picks you don’t really have to read too much into. But here’s my testament,  Loyola and UMass were two of the bottom tier programs last year and through what I’ve seen transfer portal/signee wise, they aren’t looking to take the massive leap this season either. Whereas I’m truly excited is to see this Georgetown and Army squads get to set off their 2026 campaign. Army was undefeated and in the top 5 for most of the season last year. Until they dropped their conference championship by a couple of goals, ultimately stealing their bid for the NCAA tournament that they had held in their hand all year. This undoubtedly left a bad taste in the Troop’s mouths. Army is going to beat the piss out of UMass and I feel sorry they have to play them first. The troops graduated All-American Jackson Echier , but seem to have a way of replenishing their forces yearly. Probably due to players staying in the program and not transferring away. Easy to run the system if you’re in the system for 3 years and then you get your shot.  In our other leg of the parlay, we have a Georgetown team that’s hard to get a read on some years. But I was boots on the ground for 2 of their games this past season and these guys only added talent through freshman signees and Colgate transfers Liam and Rory Connor. The brothers hope to fill an Aidan Carrol size hole left in the offense. If there was one knock you could have on the Hoyas offense, it was the lack of production when Carrol wasn’t on the field. These brothers are the real deal and will be day one impact performers. And day one is <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> baby. Not to mention they have the best defender in the country in Ty Banks. It’s scary watching him play defense. He will lock up whatever primary initiator they need him to anywhere on the field.

&gt;**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Team Einarson +1.5 @ 1.77

&gt;Team Einarson and Team Lawes meet tonight in the page 1v2 game at the Scotties. Team Einarson have been heating up over the last few days and it feels like they&#x27;ve got some great momentum right now. Sweeting&#x27;s line calls on Einarson&#x27;s shots have been phenomenal and the team has really shown their experience this week. They put a lot of pressure on their opposition with rocks in the house. Team Lawes just squeaked past Team Black to get into this game. Einarson and Lawes have met in the page 1v2 game at the Scotties before and it was Einarson who came away with the win, en route to her first of four Scotties championships. The two key positions where Team Einarson has the advantage are lead and fourth. Burgess is capable of every shot in the book which allows them to take advantage of any mistakes from the opposing lead. Einarson is more precise and consistent than Lawes and Einarson&#x27;s draw weight has been money all week. I was surprised to see Team Lawes favoured here, I think their event record is getting too much attention. Team Einarson are a top 5 team in the world and the highest ranking team at the Scotties this year. Team Lawes are top 15 in the world and came into this event 2-7 against top 10 teams this year. On the other side, Team Einarson are 14-5 this year against intermediate teams like Team Lawes. Einarson owns the career head to head 11-4 over Lawes. The wrong team is favoured here but we&#x27;ll take the +1.5 to account for the strong play we&#x27;ve seen all week from both teams.</td></tr>

They’ve lost all seven of their away trips against top-half opposition, and their goalscoring numbers show an equally bleak picture. The Swans sit 21st in the league for net xG from open play and carry the second‑worst open‑play attack in the championship this season.

Watford, by contrast, are solid at the back, ranking inside the league’s top five for xG conceded. With the home side consistently creating and protecting chances and the visitors struggling badly whenever they face a step up in class, the matchup leans strongly towards the hosts <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: BTTS - 1.70 (Bet365)

Write Up:  
*Wanted Ludogorets to get that 2 goal cushion for a sweat-free game which they didn&#x27;t but a win is a win. We&#x27;ll take it.*

  
For <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>&#x27;s game, we have two teams who are more than capable of scoring and it helps that none of the major goalscorers from either team are injured so it should be a very competitive and balanced game. Apart from that, Villarreal currently has a nice buffer 7 points from the 5th place team whilst having a game in hand. I know they&#x27;ll want to keep that buffer as high as possible while trying to climb up to 3rd place. On the flip side, though Osasuna is mid table and has a *&quot;decent&quot;* GD, they are only 5 points away from 18th place Mallorca who are in the relegation zone. Every point counts for them so I expect them to play for all 3 points to stay mid table at least.

**January Record: 20 Wins ✅ 5 Loses ❌ 20-5 L25**

Write up: What a GREAT month we’ve had - 20 Wins, and only 5 Losses!! 20-5 L25 - Let’s finish this month on a high note with a + odds parlay - Model has this as the highest confident Edge % and EV % for the day. Will add some personal information in this write-up as well.

• ⁠Model has Kansas ML at 56% 

• Model leans Houston -14.5 at 53% 

• EV better betting 100$ = 9-11$ for this play

• Bought down on the Houston line because they have been subpar in bigger spreads at home after looking into it - the way this year’s college basketball season has gone, big spreads just don’t feel safe, and normally become a sweat in the last 3-4 minutes of games - Houston has the better offense in this one, compared to Cincinnati’s offense on the road - Houston is ranked top 10 in many offensive categories and one particular stat that stands out to me is their high free throw percentage - Looking at Cincinnati, they have a very high turnover rate, ranking almost 200th in the turnover margin in the NCAA, while they also have a low 3pt % - Cincinnati averages just 65 PPG on the road, and with how good Houston’s defense is, this number will likely stay here or even drop this afternoon - An interesting stat that I found was that in conference play, Cincinnati averages under 40% in FG% - Last time these two met, Houston won on the road, 67-60, and Cincinnati had 15 turnovers - if Houston can force those turnovers, stay consistent on offense, they should be able to cover -8.5 here - Cincinnati ATS % is under 50% this year while Houston’s is above 50% - Can see Houston winning this one by 10-15 points 

•The only thing that scares me about Kansas ML is that BYU is coming off a loss at home - BYU is better in a lot of offensive categories this year, but when you look at home games for this year for Kansas, they offense averages almost 10+ more PPG - the big catch in this one is I believe Kansas defense, who holds opponents to 37.7% FG% - in conference games played at Kansas, opponents average less than 68 PPG - showing that Kansas becomes a different dog when they play home games - Looking at the ATS % Kansas is 57%+ and BYU is below 45% - the key in this matchup is AJ vs Peterson, which player will go for more - Both teams have weapons, and I expect both AJ &amp; Peterson to do their part - and I like other pieces Kansas has over BYU - I think Kansas will be able to slow BYU down just a touch in this one and walk away in a lower scoring game here - I think Kansas has more guys that can score the ball, while BYU has the better scorers (aside from Peterson) - if Kansas can slow down AJ and or Saunders/Wright - they have a good chance of winning this game - look for G Melvin Council of Kansas to slow Saunders or Wright - it is hard to fade Kansas at home, regardless of the matchup, as they are absolute dogs at home this year - BYU will have a good game plan, and I expect to come out guns blazing, especially looking to bounce back after their L against Arizona at home - give me the Jayhawks at home in this one

I&#x27;m more more confident on them to end the game in the first half. Basically seeking 2-0 or higher numbers here in 45+ minutes. It&#x27;s really good value here, because of their difference in quality and their league positions. I will keep going 5 units as always and try to nail this one. There were alot of other games to bet on, but the odds were too low to post it. So I went for this value bet instead. This is also the aim, even if our record will remain negative. Most important are the units won. But anything can happen in football and good luck everyone.

Went under that line for 5 games in a row now. I&#x27;m going with the same argument that I used for Werenski yesterday. Nathan MacKinnon is going to the Olympics next week and doesn&#x27;t want to get injured before the event starts so he plays more passively than he would usually do. It also helps that Colorado is first in the league with a comfortable lead.

Colorado doesn&#x27;t play Detroit often but the last 2 games between them, MacKinnon only had 1 and 2 shots. Detroit will be playing their last game at home before the Olympics break and will look to finish strong as they lost 2 in a row especially with the Atlantic division this season being pretty tight. In their last 10 home games, they allowed on average only 25 shots.

Hoping for a 6th game in a row where MacKinnon goes under!

Last pick: Cade Cunningham (DET) OVER 8.5 Assists✅

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the day</mark>: Rudy Gobert (MIN) OVER 11.5 Rebounds(-115) HR

Reasoning • :The &quot;Hospital&quot; Memphis Factor Memphis is missing their entire frontcourt rotation. Zach Edey (Ankle), Brandon Clarke (Calf), and Santi Aldama (Knee) are all OUT. They are forced to play small-ball with Jaren Jackson Jr. at the 5, who historically prefers to float on the perimeter rather than bang in the paint for boards. The Matchup Math: • Season Average: Rudy is averaging 11.2 RPG this season. • The Ceiling: In his only game against Memphis this season (Dec 17), Rudy feasted for 16 rebounds. • Memphis Vulnerability: The Grizzlies allow 45.2 opponent rebounds per game. Without their 7&#x27;4&quot; rookie Zach Edey to box out, Rudy will have a massive reach advantage on every single miss.

Scenario Analysis: The &quot;Gobert Vacuum&quot; • Scenario A: The &quot;Brick City&quot; Shootout Memphis is currently starting &quot;G-League&quot; level guards due to injuries to Ja Morant and Scotty Pippen Jr. They are projected to struggle with efficiency against the #1 Timberwolves defense. More misses from Memphis = more defensive rebound opportunities for Rudy. If Memphis shoots under 42%, Rudy hits this line by the 3rd quarter.

• Scenario B: The Foul Trouble Trap The only real threat to this &quot;Over&quot; is if Rudy gets two quick fouls in the 1st quarter. However, Memphis doesn&#x27;t have a traditional &quot;bruiser&quot; center right now to bait him into foul trouble. JJJ plays mostly &quot;face-up,&quot; which keeps Rudy&#x27;s hands away from the whistle.

• Scenario C: The Blowout (The White Flag 🏳️) If Minnesota goes up by 25 points, Rudy might sit the entire 4th quarter. However, even in a recent 20-point blowout win over OKC, Rudy still managed to stay on the floor for 34 minutes and grab 11 boards. Against a smaller Memphis team, he can easily hit 14 boards in just 28 minutes.

Referee Influence 🏁 Keep an eye on the officiating crew. If we get a &quot;let &#x27;em play&quot; crew like James Williams or Mitchell Ervin (who both rank high in PPG allowed), the game will have a faster flow with fewer stoppages. A faster pace means more shot attempts, which directly translates to a higher rebound ceiling for Rudy.</td></tr>

Last pick UFC 324 Song Yadong +3.5 -140 3u ✅
  
Ufc 325 <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>: Billy Elekana -3.5 + Salkilld KO = +190 3u

Explanation:
Leg 1: Quillan Salkilld vs. Jamie Mullarkey
To put it bluntly, Jamie Mullarkey has hit a hard ceiling in the UFC. He doesn&#x27;t possess a single elite attribute, and his most famous moment remains getting folded by Alexander Volkanovski on the regional circuit nearly a decade ago. I’m a huge believer in Salkilld; he’s a highly technical, heavy-handed prospect who is catching Mullarkey at the perfect time. While Mullarkey might try to survive the initial onslaught by stalling and clinching, I don&#x27;t see him lasting the full 15 minutes. Expect Salkilld to find his rhythm and land a clean straight right down the pipe to floor Mullarkey, likely in the second round.
Leg 2: Billy Elekana vs. Junior Tafa
The other side of this parlay is a pure &quot;fade&quot; of Junior Tafa. Tafa simply isn&#x27;t a UFC-level mixed martial artist. We saw Valter Walker, Mohammed Usman and Tuko Tukkos make him look like a beginner by taking him down and controlling him with ease. Junior’s only path to victory is a &quot;puncher’s chance,&quot; but as Billy Elekana proved in that ugly fight against Ibo Aslan, he is a master of the &quot;shit show.&quot; Billy is excellent at neutralizing power, forcing a grind, and avoiding high-risk exchanges at all costs. Against a grappler with Billy&#x27;s discipline, Junior Tafa is essentially a fish out of water. It is almost impossible to envision a scenario where Billy doesn&#x27;t grind out a dominant, albeit perhaps ugly, victory here.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: Diego Lopes Vs Alexander Volkanovski | Volkanovski To Win By Decision (+150) 3u To Profit 4.5u

Write-Up: Another week of PPV UFC and I’m ready for it! Volkanovski is fighting Diego Lopes in a rematch to try and keep his title as featherweight champion. In their last bout, we saw Volkanovski win a decision pretty handily, winning the fight 4 rounds to 1. Volkanovski is getting pretty old and his chin might not be 100% anymore but he showed in his last defence against Diego that he is still a cardio machine and has great technique. I think he will be as safe as possible and try to land takedowns if possible and be able to manage the distance and stay out of Diego’s power like he does to all of his opponents. Diego Lopes is good but he doesn’t have great cardio and that showed in his previous fight with Volkanovski, once it gets to the later rounds, he will be breathing heavy and that’s where Volkanovski will dominate. I expect Volkanovski to take 1 or 2 of the first 3 rounds by landing more volume punches, while Diego is going for a knockout. After those first 3 rounds, Volkanovski should take over and be able to take Diego Lopes down, or just keep on landing many strikes to win the 4th and 5th rounds. I’m not worried about Volkanovski finishing Diego lopes, because Diego is good defensively on the ground and can avoid getting submitted, but Volkanovski should be able to hold him down and win the rounds that way. As for the striking, Volkanovski doesn’t have much power and Diego Lopes has a great chin, so even if Volkanovski lands a big amount of punches, Diego Lopes should be able to take them without getting knocked out. I expect Volkanovski to most likely win 4 rounds to 1, unless Diego does somehow take 2 whole rounds which I don’t expect due to his cardio, Volkanovski could still win 3 rounds to 2.

Take Alexander Volkanovski By Decision!</td></tr>

Last pick: Parivision ML vs Falcons, 1u @ +165 **✅**

**UFC: Alexander Volkanovski ML 3u @ -130**

Volk won the first fight against Diego Lopes 9 months ago in Miami, Floria (that was also one of my POTDs). Tomorrow he finds himself on Australian soil defending his belt against a very game opponent. Over the Xmas period I was actually leaning towards Diego Lopes but in researching this fight I re-watched the first bout at length and some notable features stood out to me:

\- Volk out-struck Diego on the feet at an almost 3-to-1 ratio, he was largely winning all of stand-up exchanges bar two very impactful moment for Lopes. The judges scored the fight 48-47, 49-46, 49-46 however the crowd were partisan for Diego that night and I believe they may have influenced the judging slightly. Scoring it myself I actually give all of the rounds to Volk, that&#x27;s right, the fight was 50-45 for me personally (that&#x27;s just my opinion on re-watching)

\- The aforementioned moments for Lopes were a knockdown in round 2, which whilst troubling, didn&#x27;t seem to slow Volk down he popped right back up and got back to fighting and the second incident really needs some exposition - Volk did get clipped with a good right upper cut from Lopes but right before that shot landed Lopes threw a jab that cut Volk&#x27;s eyelid - the two things combined made Volk seem more hurt than he probably was because during this flurry by Lopes he actually didn&#x27;t land many shot and Volk was actually out-landing him despite backpedalling - in this round and in all round Volk landed more shots on Diego and in my opinion did more total damage

\- In a nutshell I am of the opinion that Diego Lopes needs to finish Alexander Volkanovski here to win this fight and I&#x27;d cap that possibility conservatively  at 40% or lower which means Volk should be winning this match up at a 60% clip or greater. In essence anything above -150 is offering some value according to my capping. My fair estimate for Volk winning here is 65% likelihood (60 being low and 70 being high) which would put him closer to -200 favorite.

**Side note:** I believe an early finish for Volk is unlikely so there are options to play the late win props such as Volk to win by decision or Volk to win and Round 4 to start. These would both be plus money.

**Summary:** Diego Lopes is a dangerous fighter and I fully acknowledge he has the finishing upside here however based on the evidence we have (the first fight) Volk is a level above Diego in striking, ring craft and winning the minutes. Also I want to give some credit to Volk&#x27;s fight IQ and game planning, I have seen people saying there is no way for him to improve on the first fight and I think that is untrue. I believe Volk can have more success than in the first fight by mixing in takedowns earlier and getting some top control on Diego to nullify any threat on the feet and land some ground and pound.</td></tr>

Meanwhile West Ham have turned things around after enduring a miserable 10-game winless run in all competitions.  They have won their last 3 matches against Queens Park Rangers, Tottenham and Sunderland.  However, West Ham remain 18th in the EPL table and only 5 points from the relegation battle at the bottom.  Woth mentioning is defensively, West Ham have the most goals scored against them in the EPL, with 45.

Chelsea should win this match at home.  If they only win by 1 it’s a push and we get a refund.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s pick</mark>: Dylan Harper over 13.5 points, rebounds, and assists (-120 Bet365) vs Hornets at noon. Playing two units

This line is 15.5 for Fanatics and FanDuel for +105 so -120 for 13.5 is a steal. He has hit this in 6 out of 7. Averaging 17.2 for the season. The four guards likely to guard him (Ball, Green, Sexton, and Knueppel) all grade out as average or below average defenders on StatMuse. I expect the Spurs to get out to an early lead (like the line for them too), and if they do, I expect more minutes for Harper. He could score over 14 points, but he is averaging 6.5 rebounds/assists for the season. Sometimes it’ll be 5-1 or 2-4 so I don’t like his individual props. I think this line is low based on his match up and season average, and I expect a few extra minutes against the Hornets.</td></tr>

Hull City rank 3rd away, are unbeaten in 10 of 14 away games, and 12 of 14 away fixtures have cleared Over 1.5, which fits a game where Hull avoid defeat and the match naturally produces goals.

Yes I am aware that Napoli has only 1 win in the last 7 games, so this is the perfect match to bounce back against a Fiorentina that is still in relegation zone, and has shown a lot of weaknesses against attacking teams, Conte will now focus in Serie A only and eve though this is a risky one, the 1.90 odds are too good to pass on it.

**Event**: English Premier League: Leeds United  vs. Arsenal 7:00am PST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>**: BTTS-YES (-106) 4u 

**Write up:**

Back with a premier league <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. Starting off with Leeds, they may not have a great record but boy do they score some goals. Leeds have scored in 9 of their last 10 games and have only gone scoreless at home once this season (which was GW3 against a strong Newcastle team). At home this season in the Prem Leeds average 1.72 goals scored per match and 1.18 goals conceded. Across the entire competition this season Leeds average 1.35 goals per match and concede 1.65. Although in their previous matchup this season Arsenal won 5-0, this was before Leeds found consistent goal scoring form and it was at the Emirates. 

Feel like I don&#x27;t really need to touch on Arsenal. They&#x27;re the best team in the league (although it pains me to say) and they score practically every game. Although they are the best defensive side in the league, they conceded 2 at home to an awful UCL team last match, conceded 3 to United at home, and overall have conceded in 5 of their last 6 games.

I dont see Leeds winning this game or scoring more than 1 goal, but I&#x27;ll be shocked if they don&#x27;t bag at home considering their recent form along with Arsenal&#x27;s poor form as of late.

Confidence level: 82% Part of the reason this scares me is because Nikola Jokic is coming back. He has been a huge problem in the past to the Clippers.

Overall Thoughts: The Clippers are the hottest team in the NBA. They are so good when Kawhi and Harden are on the same page. I really think this team can make a run to end the season as a top 6 seed. Clippers must box out and keep Jokic off the boards to win tonight.

**Event:** LaLiga, Elche v FC Barcelona, 3:00 pm EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Elche +1.5 Asian Handicap, +103, 3 units

**Write Up:** Elche have been the surprise package of this LaLiga season, sitting in 12th place after coming up from the second division just a season ago. They do play above all expectations, but their team genuinely looks very solid with the likes of Inaki Pena, Chust, Rafa Mir and many others. *Their form might&#x27;ve taken a bit of a nosedive at the beginning of the year,* but they&#x27;re still capable of frustrating the visitors. Emphasis on visitors, because here&#x27;s a fun stat for you: **Elche have a record of five wins, five draws and just one loss in 11 home matches.** Yes, they&#x27;re extremely resilient at home and are no doubt going to make life tough for the Catalans. They&#x27;re also going to treat this as a bounce back and a revenge game because as I said, their recent form has been patchy, and Barcelona did win the last time they met.

Barcelona, with their usual defensive instabilities, which were on full display once again against Copenhagen, are going to struggle for sure. **They&#x27;re also going to be tired after the midweek Champions League match,** in which they had to give it their all to secure the top 8 spot in what proved to be a surprisingly demanding game against Copenhagen.

The stats point in Elche&#x27;s favor and even if they lose by a goal, the bet still wins because of the +1.5 handicap. All in all, Barcelona are definitely vulnerable, so I&#x27;m dropping 3 units on this. BOL and may this be the day Barcelona are finally stopped ☘️🫡

Blues were passing, communicating, and playing well in 5v5, and getting rushes. Think it&#x27;s the first time I saw it all year, now it might&#x27;ve been all the penalties to cause that. I&#x27;m going for o6 Goals. Columbus has been on a scoring tear since they fired their coach, and the Blues have good energy.

Sabalenka continues to dominate on hard courts. She’s made her 4th straight Australian Open Final and she’s made the last 3 U.S. Open finals as well. That being said, she’s got a tough finals this go around with Rybakina. The H2H matchup favors Sabalenka 8-6, so these players are familiar with each other and have a bit of a back and forth when they play each other. Sabalenka won the first 4 matchups, but in their last 10 Rybakina is 6-4 H2H

There is a bit of a trend however. This +2.5 game spread for Sabalenka is 6-1 in their last 7 matchups. In their 14 matchups against each other in the WTA, Sabalenka has only won in straight sets once.

* Chelsea SoT Against: *5, 7, 2, 5, 6, 3, 5, 3, 6, 8, 5, 4* | Only Pafos, Charlton and City have failed to have 4+ shots on target against Chelsea in their last 12 games
* West Ham Recent SoT against Chelsea: *4, 5, 7, 2, 6, 4*

Are things getting better for West Ham? I mean they have back to back wins now in the league, having beaten Tottenham and Sunderland in the last two rounds. At least the atmosphere around the club has livened up a bit and it’s no longer all doom and gloom. 

Chelsea has started well under Liam Rosenior, but I do still have some caveats about the results/performances until now. Sure, winning 3-2 in Italy over Napoli is nice… But Conte has a horrible record with his teams in the Champions League, just god awful, which can easily be proven by the fact that Napoli couldn’t even make the top 24. A 3-1 away over any team in the Premier League is great, but Palace is in a terrible place at the moment. 1-0 over Pafos was a bit disappointing. They beat Brentford 2-0, but the guests were just as good if not better. Then they were a bit lucky not to concede more in their 3-2 defeat at home in the first leg of the League Cup against Arsenal.

Regardless if you agree or disagree with my assessment of Chelsea’s performances in these games, we can all agree that the situation with their defense isn’t great and Robert Sanchez in goal isn’t exactly mister reliable. 

The sale of Lucas Paqueta doesn’t change much for this game, as he hasn’t really been good for West Ham for a while now. Castellanos has only scored against QPR in the league so far, but he is at least getting shots off which is what we want for this bet. Also, Summerville has really popped off for the Hammers recently with a goal in his last three games and just generally great play.</td></tr>

I believe Lopes, being younger and hungrier, will make the necessary adjustments in the rematch and utilize his significant power and elite jiu-jitsu to catch volk, either on the feet or the ground. I don’t see Volk being able to finish Lopes here, I think if he wins it&#x27;s gonna be via the scorecard. Give me Lopes win inside the distance decision no action (this means the bet is voided if it goes to a decision).



Saint-Denis is known for his relentless forward pressure and strong grappling, averaging over four takedowns per 15 minutes. This relentless style is a bad matchup for Hooker, who has previously been finished by submission multiple times and struggles when forced to fight on his back foot. Going with BSD ML, I think he wins via finish.</td></tr>

**Write Up:** No more Bundesliga for a while...tough match. 

Back to one of our tried and true plays, arguably my favorite player to back in Enzo Fernandez. This time we&#x27;re taking on some extra juice by adding 2+ total shots to the mix, because I like the value that bring going from 1 SOT at -135. Feel free to stick to just the SOT if you prefer. 

I like this play primarily because West Ham concede the 2nd most SOTs and shots in the EPL. Chelsea is at home and I expect they will have most of the ball. Palmer has been dealing with another injury, and while coach says he is fit to play, there&#x27;s a decent chance he&#x27;s rested with Arsenal next on the schedule, which puts Enzo back starting in the #10 role again and playing further forward.

While Enzo has slowed down a bit with his SOTs, he is coming off a 2 shot, 1 SOT and a goal game at Palace, and a midweek champion&#x27;s League goal on 3 shots at Napoli. He has played a lot of minutes lately, but so has the rest of the squad it is that time of year.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** (CBB) No. 14 Kansas (-4) vs No. 13 BYU 

**Start Time:** 4:30 PM ET (ESPN)

**Odds:** -110 (Caesars)

**Units (to win):** 1.5U

**Reasoning:** In what will be billed the A.J. Dybantsa versus Darryn Peterson game, expect home court to be the difference. 

Under head coach Bill Self, Kansas is an impressive 336-21 at Allen Fieldhouse since 2003. While the Jayhawks (15-5) already rank among the nation’s best defensively all-around, their numbers get even better at home, where the team concedes just 61.1 points per game on a porous 35.4% shooting. In fact, Kansas has beaten five of its last six opponents at home by 18 or more points, including a 84-63 thrashing of then-No. 2 Iowa State on Jan. 13. 

On the other end of the floor, this is a BYU defense that seems to be unravelling.

While the unit enters ranked 23rd in defensive efficiency (0.955), things have slipped in recent weeks. Over their last five games, the Cougars (17-3) have conceded an average of 80.3 points on 46.2% shooting (37.8% from beyond the arc). That includes losses to the potent offenses of No. 1 Arizona and No. 15 Texas Tech over the last three games. 

But what will be the X factor is guard play. 

In those two losses, BYU was exposed by dynamic guards. Against the Wildcats, Brayden Burries constantly got whatever he wanted on his way to picking up 29 points and four assists. For the Red Raiders, sophomore Christian Anderson took advantage as well, pouring in 22 points and seven assists. Expect senior Melvin Council Jr. (13.7 PPG, 5.2 APG) to have a big game on Saturday for the Jayhawks. 

Trust Kansas to take care of business at home.

 Jan 31, 2026 – 16:00 CET

Spirit vs Aurora 
<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Map 1 Duration and win – Over 35.5 Minutes + Spirit win (@ 2.51 / +151)

Net Units: 1U

Analysis:

• Aurora has been playing a very disciplined, slow-paced game during their current win streak and mostly comebacks during mid to late game because of their cores who have preferred to farm more and delay the game. their recent matches yesterday and two days ago against the favorites  like BetBoom and Yandex have consistently pushed past the 40-minute mark. I think lot of people are still underestimating Auroras new lineup and the way they play and they think Spirit is able to “ Stomp” them in a short duration game. Nightfall their carry has been playing outstanding this tournament and they have been beaten the two favourites to reach upper bracket final. Spirit on the other hand are still the favourites to win this tournament with Yatoro finding his form again on Sven and Windranger. 

• Head-to-Head History: In their last three Bo3 encounters, over 70% of Map 1s have gone over the 38-minute threshold. Both teams currently favor high-durability cores (like Abaddon for Nightfall) that naturally extend team fights and objective sieges.

• Tournament Stakes: As this is the Upper Bracket Final, both teams are expected to play conservatively in Map 1. Neither side wants to concede an early series lead to a &quot;cheese&quot; strategy, leading to a more methodical, late-game oriented draft. I choose spirit because I still do think they are the better team, more experienced and there is good value.

Prediction:

I think it will hit over 35.5 map duration regardless of which team wins, however I am edging more towards Spirit taking the map but Aurora won’t back down easily, longer slower game but Spirit will eventually come out at the end.

For safer bet—&gt; Over 36.5min 1.75 odds

**Write Up:** Picking back up a little with 3 wins on the trot now, and for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today’s pick</mark> we’re heading west to Ascot for DARYTE. Now this horse trialled well into its debut last  start however the performance it put up there far exceeded what I expected. Sat leaders back and had to wait for a gap, only to rocket through it and put 3 lengths on the second horse in about 50 meters. The acceleration off a sit sprint was insane and the mark of a good, young horse.      
      
We draw barrier 1 <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> and I expect the exact same scenario to play out again here; we sit leaders back and wait for the gap before exploding past. The same leader/2nd place getter is the 2nd favourite in the race, alongside the 3rd place getter, and I can’t see at all how they get any closer to us, especially factoring in the extra 100m.     
      
Got the goat WA jockey in W Pike aboard again, and all he needs to do is get us some space in the straight and we’ll go whooshka.

&gt; **Write Up:** This <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> is from my soccer model that I&#x27;ve been using for the past two years. It assigns ELO ratings to players and projects a win chance based on the combined ELO ratings of the players on each team. TeamReddit is projecting a 62% win chance here which creates value here on the ML.</td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>

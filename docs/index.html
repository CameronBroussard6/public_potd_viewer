<tr><td class='post'>💎<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: 🏈 Bucs ML
Odds: -146 on FanDuel
Wager: 3 Units

Record: 6-7
Net Units: -2.5 Units

Explanation: The Buccaneers should beat the Panthers tomorrow because even though both teams are 7–7, Tampa Bay has been the more efficient offense on a per-play basis, and that’s usually what decides close divisional games. 

Tampa Bay is producing 0.372 points per play (average performance 
, but clearly functional), while Carolina is down at 0.308 points per play (bottom tier), which is a meaningful gap in determining how often drives turn into points. 

While I do think Carolina’s defense has been more respectable than Tampa’s in raw scoring efficiency allowed (0.385 opponent points per play, middle of the league), I determine the Bucs still have a clear path to winning by controlling the game. Their run defense has been a strength (top-10 in opponent rush yards per game), which can force Carolina into longer 3rd downs and more dropbacks, and that’s where an already low-efficiency Panthers offense can stall out. On top of that, Tampa Bay is coming in relatively clean health wise. Friday’s report had no game designations.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: CAR/TB BTTS 15+ points, DET -2.5 v PIT, +103 on DK at time of writeup, betting 4.5u

We’re starting this one with my favorite matchup of the day: TB v CAR for leg 1 of the NFC south title. I like this one because it is a good spot for CAR, arguably the weirdest team in the league. They win games they are supposed to lose and lose games they are supposed to win. They are an underdog of 3 and playing at home. This is a good setup for them. I’ll start with TB. This has hit in 5 of L6 for them, missing when they put up 7 vs LAR. Mike Evans is back and healthy and playing well. Their offense is pretty much entirely healthy. After choking last week against ATL, TB has a chance for a bounceback here, and they are on extra rest. CAR has the 6th worst EPA per pass allowed. With a healthy receiving corps and offensive line, I like Baker to do well here. He’s playing against his former team. Last year, TB won 26-23 and 48-14. This offense has been weak at times due to injury, but are still over 15 in all but 2 games. I don’t think they will have much trouble putting up at least 2 TDs and 1 FG in a tight game that they will really want to have since they have lost 5 of L6. CAR has an offense that is less consistent, but they are in a good spot. TB has the 3rd worst redzone defense in the league. When CAR gets there, they will likely be scoring TDs. TB is a defense that tries to take away the rushing game and force passing. This seems bad for CAR, although their offense is pretty balanced in terms of EPA (22nd in passing, 15th in rushing). This offense is pretty self-dependent: they’ve dropped 31 and 16 against good LAR and GB defenses, and 9 and 7 against below average SF and NO defenses. So, why back a team that appears inconsistent? It’s all about the spot. First, their past 8 games have been on a WL pattern. When they suck, they bounce back in the next game. They are playing at home, and they are fighting for their division lives. TB has allowed 24 and 29 points to NO and ATL in their past 2 games. CAR will come into this game and have to match TBs scoring output, which they are in a good spot to do. This is less of an advanced stats <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, but choosing something based on expected gameflow, game stakes, and recent form at good odds (-213). This feels like a 24-23 or a 21-17 or something of that like. I don’t know who will win, but I am very confident both teams will produce to their typical levels on offense.

For the 2nd leg, I like DET over PIT. We all know the trend: DET has won their last like 15 in a row coming off a loss. I’m not much of a believer in those types of things to predict what the next game will be, but I like DET in this game. They are fighting for their playoff lives, and every game is pretty much a must win for them. PIT is in a different spot. They are up 1 game on BAL, and they can lose the next 2 games, beat BAL in week 18, and win the division. PIT has CLE next week, a game that is much more winnable to add an extra game of cushion to their division lead. PIT will still try to win this one, it just won’t be with as much intensity as DET will be playing with. The way to beat DET is to outscore them, which LAR did last week. PIT is not a high scoring team. They are not a team that is built to put up a bunch of big plays against DET’s injured secondary. Their offense hasn’t actually been horrible this year, 13th in EPA and PPG. But they are very thin at WR, which is beneficial for DET’s defense, who is thin in the secondary. DET has the 7th best EPA per rush on defense. The DET defense does not need to shut down PIT entirely, they just need to hold them to a regular number. The PIT defense has been average this year, and are still missing TJ Watt. They are 25th in EPA per rush and 15th in EPA per pass on defense. DET has one of the best offenses in the league, 5th in EPA per pass and 10th in EPA per rush. Their offensive line is still banged up, but should be good to go. Critically, they are playing at home. DET is much better at home. Jared Goff is much more effective at home. DET will put up points, and I don’t think PIT will be able to keep up. DET should control this entire game. They have a lot more to play for. They always win following a loss, which I don’t really care about, but is still an applicable stat. PIT can lose this one and it won’t be that consequential for them. Give me the better team at home to win by 3 or more.

Taking both of these together at just barely + money is brilliant odds. I like this at 4.5u.

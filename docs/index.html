**Events:** NCAAM Utah State @ USF (7pm EST) -- NBA Utah Jazz @ Brooklyn Nets (7:30pm EST)

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Utah State ML (-130 on DK) + Utah Jazz ML (-180 on DK) for **+175 parlay** \-- 2 units to win 5.5 units

**Write Up:** Long-time tailer for a lot of these guys, first-time poster. Thought it would be fun to share a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> for once and see how it goes, and I&#x27;m going with a parlay featuring the great state of Utah. There are slim pickings on the sports docket <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, and I wanted to stay away from TNF because everyone seems convinced it will be a high-scoring affair with tons of overs, and I don&#x27;t want to risk the Vegas rug-pull.

Starting with Utah State, they are 7-0 to start the young NCAA season and are heading on the road to take on USF, who stand at 4-4. I really just like the price of this game, as I think Utah State is taking a hit from barely squeaking by Montana State in OT their last time out. Even with that close one though, they have a solid body of work thus far, taking out good mid-major teams in Davidson and Tulane. Meanwhile, USF has dropped games to Oklahoma State, Colorado State, and GW. These two actually share a common opponent in VCU, and Utah State took their matchup 80-77 while USF lost by 12. Utah State is simply a better team right now with solid play from MJ Collins (21.3 PPG) and Mason Falslev (13.7 PPG), and has been shutting down teams defensively in a way that I don&#x27;t think USF will be able to overcome.

Now going to the professional side of Utah basketball, I&#x27;m picking the Utah Jazz to beat the Nets in Brooklyn. The Nets are on a back-to-back, which is my favorite bet in sports. They also just flat-out stink, and to make matters worse they&#x27;ll be without Cam Thomas for a good while. Even though Utah will be missing Walker Kessler, I think that Lauri Markkanen (28.0 PPG, 6.3 RPG) will be enough to power the Jazz to victory over the shorthanded and fatigued young Nets.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s Event: Boston Celtics @ Washington Wizards

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Josh Minot o7.5 points (-122)

Reasoning: Looking to get back into the winning column tonight, and I’m going with my hometown team. Been a die hard Celtics fan since ‘98, and watch every game so feel confident about this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. Jaylen Brown is likely out tonight(GTD) but even if he played(which I don’t think will happen, perfect game to rest him) I like this line for Why Not Minot. Josh brings energy off the bench and sometimes starts depending on the matchup. He’s been knocking down the Trey ball all season, and also is a threat on the offensive glass to get second chance points. Tonight we will see a lot of Minot, Baylor Scheierman, and Jordan Walsh. Even with Jb in the lineup he’s cleared this in 3/5 games, and coming off an excellent all around performance against the Knicks. Lot of value in this game, let’s get back to business here and hoping for another Celtics Win!!!

At the same time, both teams have more than enough quality to score, and BTTS has hit for each club in 4 of their last 5. All signs point to it landing again tonight. Let’s cash, lads. ⚽🔥

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: **New Orleans Pelicans +12.5 -120**  


**Intro**

First <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> I am posting here. I built an NBA projection model that looks for gaps between standardized team performance and the market. I will only post when the model shows real value, so it will not be an everyday thing.

**Model Details**  
The model converts team statistics into z scores. A z score shows how far a team sits from the league average once the league wide standard deviation is applied. This places different metrics on the same scale. From there the model applies weights to each metric to account for how strongly they relate to expected scoring. The weighted values combine into a single team rating. The difference in team ratings is then converted into a projected spread using a K value, which is a scaling factor that maps rating differences onto expected point differentials. Home court is then added and a small rest adjustment is applied when a team is playing without a day off.

When New Orleans and Minnesota are compared in standardized terms, the gap between them comes out smaller than the posted number.

**1. Possession creation supports New Orleans**

New Orleans has a positive z score in offensive rebound rate. This indicates a steady ability to create second chance possessions. Minnesota sits slightly below average here. New Orleans also posts a slightly positive opponent turnover rate, which reflects a consistent level of defensive activity. These areas help prevent Minnesota from creating a large possession advantage and narrow the projected scoring difference.

**2. Turnover control is neutral**

Both teams sit near league average in their own turnover rate. This keeps the possession balance stable and avoids widening the projection.

**3. Efficiency gaps are real but do not reach the market number**

Minnesota grades higher in standardized offensive and defensive efficiency. The model does register that Minnesota is the stronger team, but the difference in these categories does not translate to a twelve point expectation once the weighted values and scaling are applied.

**4. Pace does not separate the teams**

The pace related z scores for both teams are very similar. Since neither team is likely to materially change the possession count, pace does not widen the expected margin.

**5. Margin based metrics do not drive the projection**

New Orleans has negative margin related z scores, but these reflect outcomes rather than underlying predictive factors. Once the standardized performance metrics are applied, the projected difference is much smaller than their season long margins would suggest.

After the model applies the weighted z scores, the K value, home court, and rest adjustments, the projected spread falls well below 12. The standardized matchup shows New Orleans as competitive enough in key areas to justify taking the points at this number. Good down to +10.5.

Their last 10 have also been against some great teams, like the Avalanche, Oilers, etc. Meanwhile the Flames are currently tied for last place in the league. Gustavsson is in net for the Wild and while he hasn&#x27;t been as good as the Wild&#x27;s other goaltender, he has been playing better the Flames&#x27; goaltender Wolf.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Manchester United vs West Ham UNDER 3.5 @ 1.62 (1 unit)

**Write up**: This one feels solid. The Poisson model keeps spitting out 64% Under 3.5, and when you adjust for West Ham&#x27;s creative central player missing (Paqueta red card in the last match), the expected total drops even further - well under our target.  
What&#x27;s really compelling is the H2H: Last five PL matchups have all been under 3.5 and averaging barely 2.2 goals per game. Man Utd might create chances at home (1.90 xG), but West Ham&#x27;s offense is gutted right now. The broader Premier League trend backs us too: 72% of matches this season went Under. Even with the tight 1.62 odds, the model shows +8.58% value here. Low-risk play with historical precedent. I&#x27;m confident on this one.

The <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Merrimack Warriors (-8.5 to -9.5) vs. Rider Broncs

Time: 7:00 PM ET

Location: Hammel Court, North Andover, MA

The Rationale:

This matchup presents a severe &quot;strength vs. weakness&quot; disparity that heavily favors the home team. Merrimack utilizes a unique, high-pressure 2-3 zone defense designed to force turnovers, a category where they consistently rank in the top tier nationally.1 Conversely, Rider possesses one of the least efficient offenses in Division I, ranking 364th out of 365 teams in offensive efficiency.2

Key Tactical Advantages:

Turnover Margin: Rider struggles significantly with ball security (ranking 310th in turnover percentage). Against Merrimack&#x27;s havoc-inducing zone, which forces turnovers on nearly a quarter of opponent possessions, Rider is likely to lose shot volume, giving Merrimack easy transition points.2

Shooting Void: To beat Merrimack&#x27;s zone, a team must hit perimeter shots. Rider averages only 4.2 made three-pointers per game, one of the lowest marks in the country.3 Without shooters to stretch the floor, Merrimack can pack the paint and suffocate Rider&#x27;s offense.

System Value: This game fits the &quot;Opening Home Favorite&quot; betting system. Historically, mid-major home favorites playing their first conference game of the season tend to outperform the spread, as the market undervalues their home-court advantage relative to their early-season record.1

Forecast: Expect a suffocating defensive performance from Merrimack that holds Rider under 60 points, allowing the Warriors to cover the spread comfortably with a double-digit victory.4</td></tr>

Colorado Avalanche -1.5 | DraftKings (1 unit)

The Colorado Avalanche come into tonight’s matchup against the Islanders looking every bit like a team in top form, riding the momentum of recent strong performances including a 7–2 blowout over Montreal and a solid 3–1 win over Vancouver. With Nathan MacKinnon driving the offense and the top line clicking, Colorado’s scoring upside gives them a real chance to control this game early and often. The Islanders can be pesky defensively, but Colorado’s depth, pace, and current confidence make the puck line appealing. I’m projecting a 4–1 Avalanche win, and while covering -1.5 always carries the risk of a tight, low-event game, Colorado’s firepower makes them well-positioned to win by multiple goals tonight.</td></tr>

**Units:** 2U

**Reasoning:** Gibbs is straight-up cooking right now. He’s averaging 86+ rush yards per game this season and has cleared 76.5 in 7 of his last 10 when he’s the clear lead back. With David Montgomery still banged up (knee issue) - Detroit has no choice but to feed Gibbs heavy touches — we saw 27 touches for 154 yards vs the Bears and 23+ in recent games. Lions are top-3 in total rush yards and love pounding the rock, especially against a Dallas run defense that’s 27th in YPC allowed (4.7) and gets absolutely gashed up the middle.

**Risk:** Only real worries are if Monty somehow suits up and steals 10-12 touches (doubt it), or if the game script goes full air-raid because Dallas can’t stop anyone through the air.

TAKE MANCHESTER UNITED ML @ 1.6

Manchester United at Old Trafford, eh? I’ve seen this matchup since before remote controls existed, and United usually come out on top. Historically they’ve beaten West Ham far more times and hold a strong Premier League head-to-head advantage. United are averaging around two goals lately, while West Ham hover closer to one, and that difference shows when things get tense. West Ham always fight, but they love gifting one silly mistake, and United at home usually punish it. So take the Manchester United ML, kid.

Both teams are capable of scoring a lot of points, especially Utah, who are attacking strongly and have a couple of mistakes on their defense that teams are used to using. Brooklyn might be starting to improve, but they need to lead a little stronger attack. They have already scored this many points in games against each other and a possible extension could be to our advantage.

Dodin showed good signs during her first round match and I believe she can keep this one close against Parks. I love this +4 line since something a 6-4/6-4 scoreline is still a push but hopefully Dodin keeps it close or even wins this match, playing in front of her home crowd.</td></tr>

Walsh&#x27;s playing time has increased dramatically as of late both as a defensive force and as a putback rebounder. He&#x27;s averaged 26 min over his L5 against 19.8 on the season.

With Alex Sarr out, I expect Walsh to be able to bully his way into the paint against a notoriously weak Wizards defense. Wizards rank 29th in the NBA in Rebounds allowed to SFs and 29th overall in rebounding even with Sarr.

Walsh has cashed in L4/6 and his last game against the Wizards in November he got 7 rebounds in 24 min.

Jaylen Brown is doubtful for the game as well so expect more playing time / responsibility to go around for the rest of the Celtics.

Coach Obradovic left and gave his irrevocable letter of resignation, and he stayed in Athens after a loss to Pao. Then, later, he decided to come back to Belgrade and meet with the board; he was met at the airport by thousands of fans. Then the club president gave some statements and interviews, then finally Obradovic gave an interview. What became clear, the atmosphere between them was not good, and Obradovic didn&#x27;t want all the players in the roster, and that he wanted some players the club didn&#x27;t go for.

Anyway, during this whole soap opera, it became clear that fans are 100% on the coach&#x27;s side, and they are going to use tonight&#x27;s game to cheer against the players - they blame them also, but mainly against the president Mijailovic, they already asked for his resignation.

It is still not clear what they are going to do, whether they leave the arena after the first quarter or something else, but I don&#x27;t see that anyone is going to have an easy time playing in that atmosphere. Partizan can win or lose; they are a slight favorite, but for both teams to be that inspired despite the conditions that await them to reach the 165-point limit, it would take a miracle. I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing if my thinking was sound.

To add one rumor, there was a talk yesterday that Tyrique Jones refused to play against Asvel, in a one-point loss, since he found out shortly before, that Bruno Fernando* has a bigger salary than he does. That shows enough about the state of the club.

**History:** Been off for a while, but we back. Gonna be trying my luck at a $400-$10000 challenge (my unit size is $400), aiming for five straight wins to get to that magic $10k mark. Switching it up a bit this time - I&#x27;m a massive Pels fan (tough life trust me), and I know this team inside out, so for this run I’m only betting on Pelicans games. Hopefully we nail the five wins straight off the bat, but either way I’m grinding until we hit that $10k.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** New Orleans Pelicans v Minnesota Timberwolves | Trey Murphy III O 29.5 PRA + Saddiq Bey 10+ Points @ 2.10

Writeup coming, on the train will writeup once home

In his last five games he’s averaged 32.4 PRA, but the more relevant split is his 36 PRA across his last five without Zion, and Zion is out for at least a month. Still, this play is mainly about the matchup after watching last game with the Twolves.

Even tho Saddiq Bey usually takes most of our boards, he ended up stuck on the perimeter with Randle, which left Trey to completely clean up inside. Last game he had 33 points, 15 rebounds, and 4 assists, and I&#x27;d expect a similar matchup here. Fears will likely take Ant, Bey will take Randle, and Trey will again be in the corners to crash the boards.

On the scoring side, he and DQ have started running a lot more <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> n roll together. DQ sets the screen, Trey drives and has been working on a little throw line floater, which I saw him try at least five times last game. Expect more of those looks, plus increased three point volume as he settles into the primary option role without Zion.

Overall, massive upside in this matchup and a clear path to another big stat line. Little bonus would be sprinkling a little on the double-double because why not.  

FYI for Saddiq, he&#x27;s averaging 20.2 ppg in his last 6 games and taking nearly 14 shots per game and 6 threes. Definitely taking 10+ points to boost the odds.

Cowboys defense has been performing much better as of late.

Lions offense has too many injuries to deal with, but not to Gibbs. 

If either of these teams gets up they are going to run run run. And the defenses aren&#x27;t going to be able to stop them milking this clock. 

And honestly its just the number. Way too high and too much respect and every stupid bettor is gonna want a piece of that over in a standalone game.

Jalen Johnson got downgraded to questionable outta nowhere and later got ruled out. This bet voided

Jalen Brown is doubtful to play tomorrow, I’m expecting him to sit this one out against a bad Wizards side who they’ll manage without in this matchup. Pritchard feels like the move immediately as the main scorer imo, I don’t trust White enough and what I know with Pritchard is that he’ll get his shots up. 

Small sample size but without Tatum and JB he’s avg 25.6 PPG and is over in 3/4 games as a starter dating back to last season.

31, 38 (against the Wizards), 15 &amp; 34 points.

Had 18 points earlier this season against the Wizards WITH Jaylen Brown playing.

Wizards are ranked 22nd in spot ups, 24th against the PR ball handler &amp; 30th in transition points all of which are Pritchards top 3 main play types. Wizards have allowed 2nd most points to PG’s this season aswell.

Fine with playing this up to 22.5, think Pritchard gets a great matchup and without JB he’ll need to step up.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Todays pick</mark>: Cowboys @ Lions o54.5 total points scored (-114 on DK) 1u to win 0.88u

Writeup: Cowboys head off this Thursday to face the Lions in Detroit. Lions are favored with a -3 spread, no surprises as it&#x27;s a home game. What&#x27;s interesting is that this game is likely a fight for the wild card. Whichever team loses could very well be out of contention, which means both teams will be giving it their all. Not to mention it being a primetime game.

Cowboys have hit this line in 7/12 games while Lions have hit this line 6/12 games this season. Cowboys hold the number 1 rated offense and the 30th rated defense while lions are the 3rd rated offense and 14th rated defense. This is looking to be an offensive battle type game, While Lions may be without Amon-Ra, they also lost key cornerback Terrion Arnold which should allow the cowboys to light them up. Both teams average just over 29 points a game, and as mentioned with their rankings, these teams are top 5 in offensive yardage. In terms of defense, Cowboys give up 28.5 and lions give up 21.6. However lions defense has been inconsistent in their pass rush and coverage. Javonte Williams has been putting up good numbers.

Overall this game is bound to see some high action from both sides barring any crazy offense related injuries. Both teams have something to fight for more than every. I could see this game going up into the 60s

Last Pick: Milwaukee Bucks Moneyline (+135) 5 units vs Detroit Pistons

Last Pick Reflections: Great resolve after they got out to a slow start with 5 turnovers and trailed 19-4 7.5 minutes into the game. However, once they shook off the Giannis calf strain injury, they shifted to a zone defense that completely neutralized the Pistons offense. The only thing working for Detroit seemed to be Javonte Green 3&#x27;s and aside from scoring 7 points on one possession, the Pistons offense felt like it was challenged each trip up the court. Really pleased and impressed with their resolve to come back from 18 down to win this game. Glad to have gotten the win on this underdog!

Event: Dallas Cowboys vs Detroit Lions NFL

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Detroit Lions -3 (-105) 5 units

I don&#x27;t entirely trust the Cowboys recent surge after winning 3 straight against relatively struggling teams (Raiders, Eagles, Chiefs). Part of what I attribute their recent victories may in part be the recent passing of Kneeland (RIP) and fighting to play for him. However, I feel like their surge ends here as the Lions pose a different challenge in terms of their coaching expertise and offensive scheme. With Amon Ra injured last week, the lions quickly pivoted to an offense that prioritized crossers, namely by bringing Jameson Williams on a lot of cross-field routes. I anticipate a similar gameplan will be in store tomorrow and expect Gibbs to also have a monster game on the ground. The Cowboys IIRC under Eberflus play a very low % of man, almost &lt;10% if I had to guess, and they get absolutely gashed in zone coverage. Yes, the lions are unlikely to have Amon Ra St. Brown tomorrow and yes the Lions have lost 2 out of their last 3, but I think this is a great bounce-back spot for them and to be honest when I watch them play, they rarely make mistakes in that they don&#x27;t give you a lot of turnovers and capitalize on their red zone opportunities. The cowboys on the other hand strike me as a high risk high reward offense. Yes, lamb and pickens are very likely to get their fair share, but if 1 of them can be neutralized, which I trust Campbell to do, then the Cowboys quickly become a very lackluster offense in my opinion. 

Just to reiterate, in conjunction with my model, I use the eye test as well as my gut feeling to play what I believe is the most-valuable <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> on the slate. Cheers to a great game, and please remember to gamble responsibly and to only wager what you can afford to lose.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: 🏈 George Pickens longest reception over 25.5 yards (-115).

Game starts at 8:15pm EST. Bet 2.25U

Writeup: For Thursday Night Football, we have the Detroit Lions hosting the Dallas Cowboys. Both of these offenses are incredibly explosive, with the Cowboys offense being on fire recently thanks to being one of really only 3 teams in the NFL who have 2 star WRs on the same team. While CeeDee Lamb was the main beneficiary of this offensive success last week, George Pickens has actually been the one who I’ve found to be more impressive over the last month. Pickens has hit this number in his past 3 games, and Lamb has hit this number in 4 of his past 5 games. While it may feel like a coin flip as to who to select, the selection comes down to defensive matchup. The Lions have been playing a lot of man defense this year, and George Pickens is averaging twice as many yards per play as Lamb against man coverage. Additionally, the Lions have been one of the worst defenses in the league against explosive plays, and have given up a reception of this yardage every single game this season. While I do think the Cowboys can keep this game close, I think there is a good chance that the Lions have gotten a wake-up call and realize they need to play at an even higher level to make it into the playoffs. They could have a decent lead in this game, thus causing the Cowboys to throw even more and giving us more opportunities for Pickens to catch a reception of 26 or more yards.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Dallas Cowboys ML (+140) 3u

Write up: Take this with a grain of salt as I am a Lions fan so could potentially be over dramatic, but I feel pretty good about this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. 

Yes, the Lions are at home, and yes, Dan Campbell hasn’t lost two in a row in years. However, I feel pretty confident that this Lions defense won’t have many answers for this red hot Dallas offense and I don’t think the Lions currently have an offense that is at a level where it can bail them out against good teams. 

No stats here, but I know from watching that the Lions play A LOT of man coverage and currently aren’t getting home at all with their pass rush. Couple those two features with the fact that they have to find a way to shut down Pickens AND Lamb AND all the other Cowboy weapons makes it hard to believe the Cowboys dont put up 30+ points. Also, the Lions number one cover corner just got placed on IR and their all pro safety has been out for a handful of weeks and won’t be returning tomorrow. 

On offense, the Lions have an O line that is currently serviceable in run blocking, but not so much in pass blocking. They have a QB in Goff who has little to no ability to make anything happen without a clean pocket, are missing their top 3 tight ends, and might be missing a couple of O linemen AND Amonra. 

Again, maybe I see more of a dumpster fire than a non-lions fan would, but really the only way I see the Lions pulling this one out would be behind another 250+ yard performance from Gibbs which I am not going to be putting money on.

Event: Cowboys @ Lions 6:15MST

Write Up: The playoff race is getting tight and these two teams are still searching for their spot into the NFC. One team is trending upwards and the other heading the other direction. I know a lot of people will be looking to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> up all of the wide receiver props this game which I believe will turn out to be good picks in what has the makings to be a high scoring offensive affair. But Javonte Williams has certainly found his stride in the Dallas backfield this season and I believe he has a big game upcoming this week. 

Javonte Williams is a true workhorse, he currently ranks 1st in the league in snap share with 52.2 snaps per game. He currently averages 16.5 carries per game with the highest YPC average in his career (4.8).

Although the Lions have been a top ranked run defender throughout this season, they have been leaky in their last 3. Over that span they have been allowing 131 yards average per game and over 52% of their opponents offensive snaps were runs. 

Williams has hit the over in rushing yards in 9/12 games this year and I predict with his usage alone he will clear this line.

De Graafschap’s last four away games have been absolute chaos, producing 19 goals in total. That’s an average of 4.75 goals per match, with over 3.5 goals cashing in three of those four and both teams scoring in all four. Their away matches are wide open, full of chances, and usually turn into end-to-end football.

Vitesse at home follow the same pattern. Three of their last four home games have also gone over 3.5 goals, and BTTS landed in three of them. They’ve been leaky defensively but dangerous going forward, exactly the type of matchup that fits perfectly with De Graafschap’s high-tempo away style.

With both teams consistently producing high-scoring games and both conceding regularly, this has all the ingredients for another goal-heavy affair.

Units: 3
Write up: Saw this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> a while ago, and i feel it is a very good one, here&#x27;s why.
Partizan is currently facing a very tough time in it&#x27;s history, Zeljko Obradovic resigned a few days ago (those who don&#x27;t know a Partizan and Europe Basketball coach legend) after a disappointing set of results. Partizan have not yet found a new coach, and if i remember correctly the new interim coach will be Mirko Ocokoljic, one of the staff of Zeljko&#x27;s time in Partizan.

Now, Partizan is playing at home and shock therapy proved to be very effective in european basketball, i don&#x27;t feel it is going to be as effective as always. Firstly, Partizan didn&#x27;t get any new players, Carlik Jones is still injured, and the only one who can be a replacement for him is a 36yo Nick Calathes... 

Second, Partizan fans are currently very hostile to both its club president, and their own players, one for getting rid of their best coaches in their history, and the players because of their non-commitment in their way of playing. Frankly i expect a very hostile arena, which will probably not be fully sold out, which will lessen the impact of home advantage.

Now, i think this sits on the shoulders of Bayern to not be completely shit, and that&#x27;s why i gave Bayern a sizeable 6 point lead because even if somehow Partizan starts playing better immediatly, which i don&#x27;t feel like it will happen, i think Bayern can keep it close or to say Partizan will beat itself to death( note 25:0 series against Panathinaikos, 16:2 against ASVEL, and 20:0 against Monaco).

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Jared Goff O249.5 Pass Yds @1.8 1u to win 0.8u

Write Up:  
 

Listen, I’m not saying Jared Goff is suddenly turning into peak Marino, but the man’s been dealing this season like he’s trying to get a Christmas bonus early. He’s averaging around 252 yards per game, which means this 249.5 line is basically the sportsbook saying, “Yeah, let’s hope he has an off day.” Cute.

And let’s talk matchup,  the Dallas Cowboys pass defense has been more generous than a grandma on thanksgiving , they’re giving up about 251.5 passing yards per game, which is literally above the line we need. So unless the Lions decide to turn into the 1985 Bears and run it 45 times, Goff is gonna have opportunities. Volume is there, matchup is there, and the man loves a clean pocket like he loves a good play action rollout.

Plus Goff already cleared this number in 7 of 12 games this year. That’s 58% and now he gets a defense that lets opposing QBs move the ball like a morning traffic jam. One or two chunk plays to whoever’s healthy, and suddenly you’re staring at 260+ yards before you can say “Cash me out.”

So yeah, Goff over 249.5 isn’t just a bet. It’s a polite handshake between him and the over column. If he doesn’t hit it, I’m checking the Wi-Fi, because something glitchy had to happen.

Drop the ticket. Let the yards fly. ✈️📈</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>__POTD Record:__ 58-28-1 (+66.95u) *4-Win Streak*

__Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:__ [✅TreVeyon Henderson o63.5 rushing yards (-115), 3.45u](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/s/mlyldOGxu6)

__Event:__ NFL: Cowboys @ Lions 8:15pm EST

__POTD:__ *Same Game Parlay:* George Pickens 60+ receiving yards &amp; Jameson Williams 60+ receiving yards (-120), __5u to win 4.17u__

__Write Up:__ Couldn’t let 2025 end without a __5u MAX bet.__ The Dallas Cowboys (6-5-1) are traveling to Detroit to take on the Lions (7-5). The Lions are coming off a 24-31 loss to the Packers at home on Thanksgiving, their 3rd loss in their last 5. Dallas is coming off a 31-28 win over the Chiefs also on Thanksgiving, extending their 3 game win streak, with 2 straight wins vs last year&#x27;s Super Bowl finalists. The Cowboys defense has been atrocious, but their offense has been one of the best in the NFL. __Dallas is averaging 29.3 points per game, 2nd best in the league.__ Against another high powered offense in Detroit, the Cowboys should put up more big numbers.

This Dallas offense is coming in hot, scoring 24+ in 3 straight games, including two 30+ point games. Their high scoring has come from the elite trio of QB Dak Prescott &amp; WR’s George Pickens &amp; CeeDee Lamb. __Dak has been slinging it, averaging 8.7 yards per pass (2nd in NFL). That’ll continue vs a Detroit defense that’s allowed the 3rd most yards per pass in their last 3 (7.9 yards) &amp; have given up the 3rd most yards per pass (11.9) this year.__ But not only has Dallas been throwing the deep ball a ton, they’ve also been doing so efficiently. __The Cowboys lead the league in EPA as a passing offense (117.8). Detroit is last in the league in EPA as a pass d over the last 4 weeks (-37.1).__ Dak has thrown for 300+ yards in back to back weeks vs stout defenses in the Chiefs &amp; Eagles. He has thrown multiple passing TD’s in 7 of his last 9 games. He’s avg the most passing yards per game in the NFL (271.8), while also being the only QB with over 300+ completions. His 75.3 QBRating leads the NFL. Their offense has ran the ball at low rates this season. The Cowboys rank 26th in run play % (40.5%). They’ve averaged just 1.62 yards before contact (7th worst), while Detroit has been decent allowing around the league avg at 1.76 ybc. When the Cowboys have had success on the ground it has come from Zone concepts with a 51.8% success rate (7th), compared to Gap runs that have a 44.3% success rate (28th). The bad news for Dallas is Detroit is the 3rd in the NFL at defending Zone runs, allowing just 3.47 YPC (3rd) &amp; a 41.1% success rate (3rd). Dallas is going to air it out a ton this game, as the Lions have been getting burned by the deep ball lately. __Detroit gives up the 2nd most explosive passes (20+ yard passes) in the NFL (5.7%). They’ve allowed 41 catches of 20+ yards, &amp; 6 of 40+ yards. Since Week 10, when defending passes of 20+ Air Yards, Detroit has allowed: 17.6 yards/attempt (31st), 137.1 passer rating (32nd), 52.0% completion % (31st), 3 pass TDs (32nd), &amp; a -1.12 EPA/dropback (32nd).__ An even crazier stat I found myself going through every single Detroit Box Score in their last 20 games dating back to last season: __The Lions have allowed a 30+ yard reception to a receiver in TWENTY straight games dating back to Nov 2024 when the Jags failed to do so. Detroit has allowed 24 plays of 30+ yards, 2nd most. Dallas has 25 plays of 30+ yards, tied with Lions for most in NFL. The Lions gave up huge gains the last 2 weeks, allowing a league high 17.1 yards per completion to Winston &amp; Love.__ They specifically got torched on passes down the sidelines. Love went 12/19, 165 yards (8.7 YPA), 4 TDs, 130.5 passer rating. Winston was 16/24, 364 yards (15.2 YPA), 2 TDs, 137.5 passer rating. Love’s 4 TDs are the most in a single game on sideline passes over the last 4 seasons. Winston’s 364 yards are the most in a single game on sideline passes over the same span. Cowboys WR George Pickens owns the sidelines. Pickens has had 78+ yards in 7 consecutive games. Since Week 4 he is averaging 108 receiving yards/game. He has the 2nd most receiving yards in the NFL with 1,142 yards. The Steelers traded Pickens this past offseason, their entire WR core has just 1,082 yards. Since Lamb came back from injury, he has tied Pickens in target share (27.8%) with 39.2% of the air yards (10th most) in that span. But where Pickens has excelled the most has been against man coverage. __The Lions are playing man coverage on a league high 40.8% of passing plays. Pickens has 14 receptions of 20+ yards vs man this season, most in NFL (next highest 9). He has 504 rec yds vs man, (next highest 321). Pickens has been targeted on 35.3% of his routes for 4.96 yards per route vs man. CeeDee Lamb averages just 2.44 YPR, as he’s more of the zone threat. When Detroit is out of man, they run single high safety 61.4% of plays, 3rd highest. Pickens has 27.7% of targets &amp; 47.9% of the air yards vs single high coverage.__ Dak excels against man too, ranking 9th in completion rate (59.8%) &amp; 6th in yards per pass (8.0 Y/A). Dak &amp; Pickens are going to connect a ton, &amp; Pickens could clear 100 yards for 3rd time in 4 games.

I’m running out of room but Jameson Williams is now the #1 receiver in Detroit as the Lions will be without star WR Amon-Ra St Brown &amp; TE Sam LaPorta. St. Brown left the game last week vs Green Bay after one drive with a sprained ankle. __Williams stepped up &amp; had a career high 37% target share (4th in NFL), had a 1st Read % of 28.6%, &amp; caught 7/10 targets for 144 yards &amp; a TD.__ That is the highest target share in a single week of his career &amp; something St. Brown has only had 4 times in his 5 year career. He led the NFL in receiving yards last week &amp; had the 2nd highest PFF grade among WR’s (91.2), &amp; that was against the 4th best pass defense in the league (GB allows 284 pass yds 4th). Now he gets one of the worst pass defenses in the NFL this week. __The Cowboys have given up the most passing yards in the NFL (3,234). They’ve allowed 168 receiving yards per game to receivers (4th most).__ Dallas has had a great run defense since acquiring Quinnen Williams on the DL. __Over the past 3 weeks they’ve allowed 3.3 YPC to RB’s (3rd) &amp; allowing 0.33 yards before contact (4th). Detroit ranks 27th in rushing success rate (38.1%).__ Detroit is tied with Dallas in plays gaining 30+ yards on offense (25) &amp; I expect them to air it out.

These offenses rank 2nd &amp; 3rd in scoring, while each pass d is weak. Detroit had its best games following losses this year, scoring 52, 44, &amp; 34 points. Dallas has scored 57.25 more points than their projected totals, 2nd in NFL. These defenses rank 27th &amp; 30th in red zone TD conversion %. This will be a shootout. 

Pickens has 68+ in 10/11 games. Williams has 66+ in 5/7 games &amp; all 5 were with Amon-Ra on the field.

__George Pickens 60+ receiving yards &amp; Jameson Williams 60+ receiving yards__

Premier League 

Newcastle United Vs Tottenham Hotspur 

Newcastle win and over 1.5 goals 

(1.90) 3 units ✖️

A disgusting bad beat. Newcastle the much better team creating plenty of chances and bossing possession. They took the lead twice , and in the 95th minute Tottenham CB Romero scored his 2nd with a bicycle kick, completely ridiculous, 2 shots on target both going in for Tottenham, what can you do.



<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>:
 
Premier League 

Manchester United Vs West Ham 

Manchester United win &amp; Bryan Mbuemo to have a shot on target.

(1.80) 2.5 units

Manchester United host West Ham, United much improved this season, particularly at home , winning 4 from 6 home games, dropping points to Arsenal on the opening weekend, and very unlucky not to get something against Everton.

Cunha is expected to return to the attack, he&#x27;s been a great addition, great at carrying the ball forward and creating chances, taking some of the creative pressure off Fernandes.

Mbuemo has also had a great impact, **he&#x27;s had a shot on target in his last 7 league games in a row** for United, and against a team like west ham he should get alot of shooting opportunities.

West ham are without their best midfielder in Paquetta, after his ridiculous red card against Liverpool, a big loss for them as they don&#x27;t have alot of debth on the bench for that position.

I expect United to bounce back at home here, Fernandes Chuna and Mbuemo should all start and they have too much attacking quality for West Ham imo.

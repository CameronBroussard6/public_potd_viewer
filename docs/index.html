**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Midjylland v Genk o2.5 goals +Braga o0.5 goals vs Nice 2U at 1.84X

**Write Up:**   
Vitinha cleared no sweat, but Foden had a terrible game. Reijnders came in and had a great opp but was blocked unfortunately.

For <mark style='background:#fff59d'>todays pick</mark> we are leaving the players, going for goals. Midtjylland-Genk should be a great match-up. Midtjylland ranked 2nd on the Europa League. Over 2.5 last 5/5 games. Facing Nordsjaelland twice going 5-1 and 6-0. Also 1-2 vs Roma while beating Celtic with 3-1, Tel-Aviv 3-0 and Nottingham Forest with 3-2.  
Genk on the other hand are coming from 4 straight games over 2.5 goals. In Europa Leagues last 2 games they have played Basel 2-1 win, Braga 4-3 win.  
Now, looking at Braga. Placed 7th currently in Europa League. Scored in 13 straight games. They have scored in every single game in Europa League. VS Nice who has conceded a goal last 7 games. They have not won a single game in Europla League, conceding 13 straight games.</td></tr>

**Freiburg vs Salzburg – BTTS 1.90**  
**2 Unit**



Reasoning:  
  
Europa League is always unpredictable: low motivation, heavy rotation, weird game states. But <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> I see clear value on BTTS.

Salzburg(RB-school) always press high and force chaotic transitions in every match. Freiburg are expected to rotate, which usually opens the game up even more. Both sides should get chances in these transition phases, and 1.90 looks playable for both to score.</td></tr>

&gt;China face Japan <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> in a men&#x27;s playoff game to decide which team will be going to the Olympics. China have been the best team at this event and finished above Japan in the round robin. They have the advantage at every position but Li is significantly stronger than Yamamoto at second. That should allow China to play the open style match that they prefer. China are 19-5 against teams outside the top 25 (such as Japan) this season while Japan are 4-3 against intermediate level teams like China this season. The combination of talent and experience should make this an easy win for China.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Jordan Walsh over 7.5 points -132  
Event: NBA - Boston Celtics @ Milwaukee Bucks 8pm EST

Jordan Walsh has cleared this line in his last 5 games straight. He&#x27;s a defensive monster who guards the other team&#x27;s best ball handler and is projected to see 26+ minutes on the court. Honestly he is the 4th/5th option on offense and will stand in the left corner to create space for White/Pritchard/Brown. He is a low volume but efficient 3 point shooter and will get a lot of his points on offensive rebound putbacks. As soon as White/Pritchard jack up a shot he&#x27;s going to dive. I could get into how the Bucks are middle of the pack at limiting PF points and top 10 against Centers but I think that&#x27;s misleading with Giannis out and Myles Turner potentially playing the 4. Either way Turner is allergic to rebounds and Walsh should get plenty of opportunities. 7.5 is just too low. I will personally be laddering this at 7.5 10 12 15 and 18. BOL!</td></tr>

**Event:** Braga vs Nice (Europa League) 12:45 PM EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Braga ML (+105 FD) 1u

**Write Up:** Braga at **+100 moneyline** is <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>&#x27;s **Lockdown Play Of The Day.** The data points clearly tilt the edge toward the Portuguese side, Braga enter this match with **10 points in the group from a 3-1-1 record**, while Nice sit on **0 points from 0-0-5**, meaning Braga have already shown they can get results on this stage and Nice have yet to earn anything. Braga’s group performance includes **9 goals scored and only 5 conceded**, giving them a positive goal differential and a consistent threat going forward, whereas Nice have conceded **12 goals in their five games**, a ­massive defensive liability. Nice’s recent form is atrocious, **five straight losses in all competitions**, and their last five matches involving them have tended toward high goals conceded, with my model having Nice to concede multiple goals again. Braga are scoring at a steady clip and have creators like Rodrigo Zalazar and others contributing regularly, evidenced by their multiple goal involvement in European matches, while Nice’s attack hasn’t consistently delivered two goals in a game this season. Additionally, in the only recent head-to-head meeting Braga beat Nice, showing confidence in this matchup. When you combine Nice’s **0–5–0** Europa League record and defensive frailties with Braga’s positive expected performance and actual goals differential, the plus-money on Braga is value, you’re basically getting a team with momentum and scoring ability against a club in crisis, and the data suggests Braga deserve at least parity if not favoritism here.</td></tr>

Last Pick: SGA o24.5 pt v PHX, Luka o44.5 PRA v SAS, -151 on FD at time of writeup, betting 4u ✅

Our smash spot cashes, SGA records 28 points in a 49 (!) point blowout win, Luka goes 35/5/8 for 48 PRA. This <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> shows why following this alt line system is important. I saw a lot of picks in a lot of places for these guys to go over their set lines of 30.5 pt and 50.5 PRA. Both players&#x27; inputs were limited by gamescript. Taking lines that are &quot;immune&quot; to these possible ways of losing are so important. 7th win in a row, can we get 8?

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Kevin Durant o19.5 pt v LAC, Toumani Camara o1.5 3 pointers made v NOP, -154 on DK at time of writeup, betting 2.5u

4 games on the NBA slate <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, and these are my model&#x27;s top 2 plays of the day. KD has been strong this year, over this line in 84% of games and 5 of L6. HOU is healthy again, and so is LAC. KD has scored 20+ points against Kawhi Leonard in 17/17 games in his career. We run into some blowout risk, but KD almost always gets 20+ in HOU blowout wins this year, so I&#x27;m not concerned. He&#x27;s getting standard minutes and shot volume, and I like him to keep it up <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Toumani Camara is a player I am personally not very familiar with, but he has been a strong contributor to a POR team that is currently injured, missing Jrue and UCONN legend and 2 time collegiate national champion Donovan Clingan. He&#x27;s over this line in 75% of games and 5 of L6. He has taken 10+ 3s in 4 of L6. The books like NOP to keep this one close (4.5 spread), and we have a high total of 239.5. Camara has been getting steady minutes, steady perimeter volume, has a favorable matchup, and has a favorable gamescript. I like him to hit at least 2 threes tonight.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Penguins ML (-120)

Write Up: The penguins have the best PP unit in the league right now and will be playing a canadiens team with a weak PK unit. The Canadiens get a lot of penalties and have been letting in a ton of goals. None of the Canadiens goalies have looked great this season and with the penguins playing at home I’m looking for the Penguins to capitalize off their PP and win at home.</td></tr>

Event: UT Arlington at UT Rio Grande Valley (NCAAB) (4:30pm)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: UT Rio Grande Valley -2.5 (-110) 1.1 Units for 1 Unit

Write Up:

Hell of a second half from Purdue after leading by three at halftime as they drill Minnesota by 28. Credit to the Golden Gophers for fighting early on.

Pivoting to Thursday, once again not a lot on the slate, but this in-state battle with UT Arlington and UT Rio Grande Valley is an interesting one.

UT Arlington is 4-3 against D1 competition with road wins at Weber State by one point and Evansville by eight. While UT Rio Grande Valley is 2-5 against D1 teams with all five losses coming on the road featuring some great programs in Baylor, Illinois and Boise State. The Vaqueros are 2-0 at home and despite their overall record are favored in this matchup which I believe is telling.

Similar to our New Orleans <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> on Monday, I believe we’re catching some value with a more battle tested group with the Vaqueros at home. UT Arlington has a solid defense, but playing at a bottom 20 pace in the country, turning the ball over on 20% of their possessions while shooting less than 20% from three I don’t think will go too well. 

Keep an eye on Vaqueros guard, Marvin McGhee to help settle this group down the stretch as this game will more than likely be close. I see a 5+ point win for Rio Grande Valley in their own building and remain undefeated at home.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s Event: UEFA Conference League | Rapid Wien (Rapid Vienna in some books) vs Omonia Nicosia (4PM EST)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>:  Omonia Nicosia Moneyline (+200) 1.0 units to win 2.0 units.

Write up: I am shocked on the odds that Omonia Moneyline has. Rapid Wien is on a 4 game losing sreak for both league and 1 conference league (losing 4-1 to Rakow Czwestochowa). They are ranked LAST on the table, losing every game. Conceding 12 goals and only scoring 2 in 4 games. Omonia on the other hand is on a 3 game win streak (3 wins in last 4 games) with 1 being a 2-0 win over Dynamo Kyiv in the Conference League. Omonia has scored 4 goals and conceded 3 in 4 games which makes me feel confident that Rapid Wein won&#x27;t score. The &quot;problem&quot; arises where they&#x27;ve averaged 1 goal per game which isn&#x27;t great, but seeing rapid concede 3 goals or more in 3 of their 4 games makes me confident that omonia will pull through!

Odds: 2/1</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Jagiellonia Bialystok/Rayo Vallecano Under 2.5 goals

**Start Time:** 12:45 PM EST

**Odds:** \-110 (BetMGM)

**Units:** 1.1 units to win 1 unit

**Reasoning:** Rayo was a side at the beginning of Europa Conference League that I eyed as the possible champion of the whole thing.  Having said that, their play of late has been lacking.  The main reason has been their inability to score goals.  In La Liga they are averaging less than 1 goal per game.  They have remained competitive primarily because they have not conceded many goals either.  In their last 4 La Liga games they lost 1-0, drew 1-1 and drew 0-0 twice, one of those 0-0 draws being against Real Madrid.  They travel to Poland in this one and face a Jagiellonia side who are only conceding 0.6 goals per game at home in Conference League.  And while the Polish side is averaging 1.6 goals per match, that is against lesser competition.  They step up in class in this game where I predict both teams will struggle to find the back of the net.  Good Luck</td></tr>

Nice has allowed 14 goals in their last 5 games and has only scored 3 goals in those matches. Braga has allowed 5 goals in their last 5 while scoring 13.</td></tr>

**2-leg SGP James Harden 1+ STL / Kris Dunn 1+ STL (-128 Caesar’s)** 1 Unit

8:00PM EST / GMT -5 (12 hours from time of comment)

￼Write Up: The Rockets (and more specifically Amen  Thompson) are having a big problem. They are turning the ball over a ton lately. Mostly through allowing steals to their opponents. They’ve allowed, in their last three games:

12/6 @ Dallas - 13 steals 

12/5 vs Phoenix - 12 steals 

12/3 vs Sacramento - 10 steals 

That’s an average of 11.7 steals allowed, 3rd worst in the NBA over that span

Over their last 3 games played, Harden and Dunn have each averaged 2.3 steals (Harden with 4 and Dunn with 3 in their last game vs Minnesota on 12/6)

I believe this game will include around a dozen Houston turnovers, and we just need one steal each from 2 guys who have had busy hands lately and will see plenty of time on the court.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Donyell Malen 2+ SOTs (+160) 1.0 unit to win 1.6 units

**Write Up:** Love it when a plan comes together! Haaland (and the rest of City) executed pretty much as expected,  cashing our play in the first half and ending with 3 SOTs and a goal. Good to be back with more plays!

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> we head to Switzerland to revisit one of our favorite picks, Donyell Malen in the Europa League. After winning Aston Villa&#x27;s November player of the month, primarily due to his Europa performances, our guy should be starting here either up front with Watkins resting or next to him. In his last two Europa matches, the only two he has started, Malen has cleared this line with 3 shots (3 SOT, 2 goals), and 6 shots (4 SOT, 1 goal). This line doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense, given his ATGS line is lower than 2+ SOTs, and Watkins is the inverse of that (ATGS better odds than 2+ SOT). Again, I think Malen should start here, but I was expecting his 2+ SOT line to be around the +110 mark which is where Watkins is at. 

FC Basel play tough at home, winning both of their Europa matches at home thisnfar. However, they have not really played EPL level competition and have given up an average of 6.5 SOTs per Europa match. 

While this play has actually hit with Malen coming off the bench a week ago, I obviously am banking on him starting the match here. As always, **please feel free to wait for lineups if youre worried about players not starting**. I prefer to take the risk of the players not starting, as we tend to get better odds that way. But coaches do weird things and my reads aren&#x27;t perfect, so please be wary that there&#x27;s always a chance Malen does not start.

Write Up: Basel is hosting Aston Villa in the Europa League <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Basel sit in 3rd place in the Swiss Super League (8W3D5L, goals 25:18) and they are pretty strong at home.

Aston Villa are in pretty good form, sitting in 3rd place in the Premier League with 9W3D3L, beating Arsenal(!!) this weekend and having also recently beat Brighton, Wolves, Leeds and Bournemouth. In the Europa League they are in 3rd place with 4W0D1L, recently beating Young Boys and Maccabi Tel Aviv.

Unreal amount of bad beats lately, 20 points in the 3rd quarter and doesn’t make a single shot in the 4th.. 0-6 from 3 surely didn’t help either, inconsistent numbers from my part so far gotta do better 

Sabonis and LaVine are both out for this game against the Nuggets and they need the point production to come from someone else, DeMar is the obvious way to go and should see a lot of usage here.

Only one game played this season without them but he did drop 25 points against the GSW in that one where he also had 20 FGA with 29.5% usage. With 15+ FGA he’s over in 7/10 games this season avg 24.4 PPG, with him ending on 18 &amp; 19 points in the two misses, over in 14/L20 with 15+ FGA counting from last season aswell.

Denver is ranked 24th against spot ups which is his main play type where he gets 21.1% of his buckets from. Everyone knows DeMar as the mid range killer where he gets 37% of his shots from, Denver are ranked 29th against mid ranges this season.

Top tier matchup for DeMar where he could have a great night, would play this up to 21.5.

**🏀** **Amen Thompson 6+ Rebounds + Kevin Durant 4+ Rebounds +115**

The Rockets are the best rebounding team in the league. In total rebounding % and offensive rebounds, they&#x27;re #1. The Clippers meanwhile, rank much lower at 19th overall in total rebounding.

At these lines, both players have remarkably good hit rates. Amen has cashed 6+ in L9/10 and L3/5 vs Clippers. KD has cashed in L7/10 and L6/7 vs Clippers. Both players averages across L5, L10, and the Season map well ahead of their lines

Now, this game already has low lines because it figures to be incredibly slow pace. Both teams rank in the bottom 5 in Pace and the over/under is one of the lowest at 219.5.

That being said, that gives us low lines and with alternate lines from the SGP, we&#x27;re looking at great hit rates for the plus money play.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Over 238.5 (-115) (1U) 

(Bet to win unit size) 

Write up:

I believe we have a recipe for an over in tomorrows matchup between the blazers and pelicans. The blazers will be without Clingan and Holiday while Rob Williams remains questionable. This will throw a wrench into an already shaky defense that has allowed an average of 119 ppg to opponents over their last 5 games. The pelicans have been atrocious defensively, ranking 29th in defensive efficiency over their last 5 games and allowing an average of 132 ppg over that same span. However, offensively both of these teams have shown life and have some players that can still put the ball in the hoop. What I think is interesting is the pelicans have been 12th in offensive efficiency over their last 5 and 14th over their last 10. And although the blazers haven’t been great offensively over their last 5-10 games, it will be a lot easier going up against this pelicans defense and guys like Shaedon sharpe and avdija who love to push the pace will thrive in a matchup like this. The blazers and pelicans are both 1st and 3rd respectively in pace over their last 5 games and 6th and 7th respectively in their last 10. Without the presence of clingan down low tomorrow I expect queen to have another big game after dropping 33 in his last game and I expect the guards from Portland to be able to score at will in a fast paced game down in New Orleans. I expect both teams to flirt with 120+ and cash this over. As always, cheers 🍻</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>**POTD Record (2025-26 Season): 2-2**

**History:** Been off for a while, but we back. Gonna be trying my luck at a $400-$10000 challenge (my unit size is $400), aiming for five straight wins to get to that magic $10k mark. Switching it up a bit this time - I&#x27;m a massive Pels fan (tough life trust me), and I know this team inside out, so for this run I’m only betting on Pelicans games. Hopefully we nail the five wins straight off the bat, but either way I’m grinding until we hit that $10k.

**Win Streak**: ❌ ✅ ✅ ❌

The worst loss I&#x27;ve ever seen. Fears ends with 19 PRA (1 short), shot 4/16 from the field and missed a free throw to put us over the line. Absolutely shocking. Back in the lab tho.

**Wager:** $400 (Day 1)

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** New Orleans Pelicans v Portland Trailblazers | Derik Queen O 25.5 PRA @ 1.86

Keeping it extremely simple. After Queen&#x27;s historic triple double last game, and that absolutely ridiculous third quarter when he shot 10/10 from the field, I am absolutely convinced the Pels will finally run the offence through him again. They did for a few games (in which Queen averaged about 35 PRA), then switched it over to Bey and Fears. That little experiment didn&#x27;t work too well, and after that performance they will almost certainly switch back to a DQ-based offence.

Expecting extremely high usage, and overall should be a comfortable cover. Not much else to add tbh. Let&#x27;s get back on track (still so mad about that last beat, but it&#x27;s all good).

5 Units

Buccaneers have Wirfs, Evans, and McMillan back for this one. It’s a home game. Good weather expected. 

Buccaneers have been SEVERELY battling injuries on offense all season long and still had a lethal offense at times despite missing multiple starters numerous times. All of their receivers, backs and QB will be suited up together for the first time in idk how long. 

The tight End Otton who is a nice target is doutful however, but they all already have 6 respectable WR’s and that’s not including running backs who can catch and make plays as well.

Falcons offense being beat up can also lead to better field position for offense or even the defense making a play to aid this.

Main worry here is the Falcons having slow sustainable deliberate time wasting drives wasting as much time as they can. Hopefully the Bucs coaching staff is smart enough to force them to throw the ball downfield as they should and this would eliminate that threat. I’m not banking on it though as common sense seems to be gone in most NFL and college coaching 😂.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: 🏈 Chris Godwin 25+ alt receiving yards + Tyler Allgeier 15+ alt rushing yards (-156).

Game starts at 8:15pm EST. Bet 3U

Writeup: For Thursday Night Football, we have a divisional matchup in primetime with the Atlanta Falcons and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Falcons season has been over for weeks, while the Bucs are fighting to stay alive at the top of their division standings. This bet is absolutely gross, but I have this priced around -180, so I like the value even if it’s only -156.

In these divisional matchups in primetime this season, we have learned time and time again that the obvious plays don’t hit, and we need to dig a little deeper to find the better plays. The Bucs are getting back both Mike Evans and Jalen McMillan from injury for this game, meaning they now have Mike Evans, Chris Godwin, Emeka Egbuka, Jalen McMillan, and Bucky Irving all on the field. If this team stayed healthy I would make an argument that they are a top 3 team in the NFC behind the Rams and Seahawks. The Falcons have two defensive threats in cornerback AJ Terrell as well as safety Jessie Bates, and Mike Evans will be getting a lot of attention from them in this one. Even if Terrell doesn’t shadow Evans, the Bucs simply have too many offensive weapons for the two of them to handle for 60 minutes. Earlier in the season I would take Egbuka in this spot, but his efficiency has absolutely fallen off a cliff over the like 5 or so weeks. Chris Godwin has re-cemented himself as the WR2 in this unit, so I’m liking him to get 25 receiving yards or more in this one.

Now for the other side of things. The Bucs rush defense has been solid this season, but are averaging over 100 yards given up per game and got slashed by Saints backup running back Devin Neal and QB Tyler Shough last week. The Falcons have Bijan Robinson, a top 5 RB in the league. He will be getting a lot of attention in this game as the Falcons do not have their starting QB nor their top WR in this game, and there really isn’t much talent left on that offense besides Kyle Pitts (shoutout Mr Ingles) and Bijan. However, the Bucs passing defense has been one of the worst in the league this season. Bijan is also a passing catching running back, meaning both he and Pitts are going to to have the respect of the Bucs defense, and they’ll have to cover for the pass even without the Falcons starting QB and WR. Given this info, I like having their backup RB, Tyler Allgeier, to have opportunities to run as the Bucs still need to respect the passing game. There will be running lanes opening for the Falcons, even against this Bucs rushing defense. Allgeier has hit this number in 3 straight games, is averaging over 3 yards a carry, and received double digit carries last week. Interestingly enough, the last 2 teams that the Falcons played who had higher caliber defenses, Allgeier got double digit carries in both games and went for 45 yards on average. He should get 15 or more rushing yards in this one.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** (CBB) No. 4 Iowa State (-11.5) vs No. 23 Iowa

**Start Time:** 8:00 PM ET (FS1)

**Odds:** -110 (DraftKings)

**Units:** 1U

**Reasoning:** “Anything you can do, I can do better” is mostly associated with that old Michael Jordan-Mia Hamm Gatorade commercial. However, it also just so happens to be the mantra for this season’s Iowa State men’s basketball team.

Okay, I lied. I have no idea if it is, but if it isn’t, it most certainly should be. 

That’s because these undefeated Cyclones (9-0) can inflict damage in every area of the court.

You want offense? Through nine contests, Iowa State ranks 1st in offensive efficiency (1.279), 1st in field-goal percentage (54.9%), 3rd in three-point shooting (43.8%) and 4th in scoring (94.6 PPG). Surprisingly, the team has been even better as of late, averaging 102.7 points on 61.5% shooting from the field (57.5% from beyond the arc) over its last three games. Furthermore, the Cyclones have topped 78 points in each of their games, including topping the 90-point mark in six of those. 

And if you want defense…well, just ask Purdue.

The former top-ranked team in the country found life miserable against this Iowa State defense. The unit was suffocating, holding the Boilermakers to just 24-of-59 (40.7%) from the field and 4-of-18 (22.2%) from the perimeter in an 81-58 victory on the road. It snapped a 36-game win streak in home non-conference matchups for Purdue. Not surprisingly, Iowa State finds themselves among the best in the country across the board, ranking 9th in defensive efficiency (0.873), 13th in scoring defense (64.6 PPGA), 89th in opponent field-goal percentage (41.9%) and 180th in opponent three-point shooting (33.0%). 

That doesn’t bode well for an over-achieving Iowa offense on Thursday night.

Thus far, the Hawkeyes (8-1) rank 14th in field-goal percentage (51.7%), 16th in offensive efficiency (1.212), 41st in three-point shooting (37.7%) and 100th in scoring (79.9 PPG). However, the unit has struggled as of late, averaging just 64.7 points on 45.2% shooting from the field over its last three. That includes a 71-52 defeat at then-No. 7 Michigan State last Tuesday, a game in which Iowa was held to just 17-of-45 (37.7%) from the field. In fact, in the only matchup against a defense that ranks Top 100 in defensive efficiency—74th-ranked Ole Miss—the Hawkeyes shot just 24-of-56 (42.8%) from the field in squeaking out a 74-69 victory. 

Conversely, the defense has yet to be truly tested either.

Through nine games, Iowa ranks 10th in scoring defense (62.6 PPGA), 43rd in defensive efficiency (0.949), 121st in opponent three-point shooting (31.7%) and 146th in opponent field-goal percentage (43.6%). However, the team has faced just one offense ranked in the Top 20 in offensive efficiency—77th ranked Michigan State—and the unit allowed the Spartans to shoot 23-of-46 (50%) from the field in a 19-point loss. 

Meanwhile, the Cyclones have beaten five power conference opponents, including four of them by double-digit. 

Trust the experience and athleticism on both ends of the court to allow Iowa State to cruise in this one.

Write-up: Finally managed to snap that losing streak, hallelujah. It was a sweat-free <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> as well that cashed around the 30th minute with Dobson ending the match on 4 tackles (2 won) before being hooked at the 68th minute. Wrexham were pegged back for large portions of the game eventually losing 2-0 and to make matters worse Moore missed an equalising pen but Hull thoroughly deserved it.

Generally don’t love to bet on European matches due to the small sample size of stats but I like the value here so I’ve gone for it. Peretz started off as a more defensive player playing deep in midfield but has moved up the pitch in the past few years, now playing as the attacking mid of the team. He’s their top scorer this year with 7 goals and even scored a brace against Italy with his country. I’m not going to use domestic league stats for Peretz because of how weak the Israeli league is.

In European matches, Peretz has averaged 2.4 shots per match over the last 15, clearing the line in 12 of those (80%), 9/11 in Europa league since last year (82%). In away games he’s had 2+ shots in 7/7. This campaign has seen him average 2.5 shots and cleared the line in all four matches. He’s recorded 2+ shots over some very good teams in that run including the current top three of Europa this year Lyon, Midtjylland and Villa away (insane that they had to play them back-to-back). Last year saw him cover against Ajax, Besiktas, Braga so he does pull off shots even against tough teams despite how awful Maccabi look, sitting in 35th out of 36. I watched their matches against Aston Villa and Lyon and he looked like the only player who could cause any sort of danger so if they want any chance coming into this it’ll be coming through him. Stuttgart have been conceding 3 shots per game against attacking mids and 2.4 at home this season. Yes the German team will control possession which is a concern but I still back Dor Peretz to get the job done as he’s done so often in these tough matches. BOL !

__Event:__ NFL: Falcons @ Bucs 8:15pm EST

__POTD:__ Kyle Pitts o58.5 receiving yards (-110), 3.3u to win 3u

__Write Up:__ I’m unfortunately a Falcons fan &amp; have had to watch every single game of this atrocious season. I normally avoid betting on their games but it’s Thursday Night Football &amp; this play looked nice. The (4-9) Atlanta Falcons travel to Tampa Bay to take on the (7-6) Buccaneers in an important inner divisional NFC South showdown. After starting the season off on a tear with a 5-1 record at the top of the NFC South, the Bucs went on to lose 5 of their last 7 games &amp; are now tied for 1st with the Panthers in the division. They’re coming off a 24-20 loss last week at home to New Orleans, in a game where they led 10-7 at halftime &amp; 17-14 in the 3rd quarter, but only scored 3 points the rest of the game for the loss. The Falcons on the other hand have been absolutely miserable after starting the season 3-2. They come into this game having lost 7 of their last 8 games, &amp; they don’t have much to play for at this point in the year. Not even a draft <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. They don’t have their 1st round <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> in the 2026 NFL Draft after trading it in the 2025 draft to the Rams to move up to get DE James Pierce. They’re going to be trying their best to win, especially with head coach Raheem Morris in the hot seat. A little over a month ago Atlanta lost their young starting QB Michael Penis Jr to a season ending ACL injury that required surgery, with good ol 87 year old Kirk Cousins filling in as his replacement. They’ve also been without Drake London who has been out with a PCL injury, he will miss this game as well. They’re player who has benefited the most from this injury is the Falcons 25 year old Tight End.

Last week the Falcons did what every Atlanta team has done to me being an Atlanta sports fan my entire life, build your hopes up &amp; just when you have a glimpse of hope they castrate you, leaving you hopeless &amp; nutless. They played the Seahawks well all 1st half, it was tied 6-6 at Half. Then the Seahawks outscored them 31-3 in the 2nd half &amp; it was back to the old days, better than 28-3 I guess. But there was a little slither of hope. Kyle Pitts might have finally arrived after all these years. In 2021 the Falcons selected him with the 4th overall <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> in the draft making him the highest drafted Tight End ever. He has not lived up to expectations to say the least. But with the recent injury to QB Penis Jr, Kirk Cousins may have brought Pitts back to life. Pitts had 7 catches for 82 yards against the Jets 2 weeks ago, then followed it up with 6 catches for 90 yards vs the Seahawks last week. __In Cousins 4 starts this season, Pitts has 32 targets. The next closest player is Darnell Mooney with 16.__ It has helped Pitts even more that Drake London has been injured. __In Pitts last 4 games with London, he has went (starting with most recent):__

6 rec, 90 yards

7 rec, 82 yards

2 rec, 25 yards

9 rec, 59 yards

Kirk has been targeting the hell out of him &amp; he has become Cousins favorite weapon. __Cousins has targeted him 18 times the past 2 games. In the 4 games that London has missed, Pitts has received 30%, 25%, 25.8%, &amp; 35.7% of the team’s targets. On those 137 routes, Pitts was targeted on 25.5% of his routes for 2.0 yards per route. That target rate/route would rank 1st among Tight Ends over the entire season &amp; the yards/route would rank 3rd. Pitts also has a 34% first read target share over the past 3 games, higher than even Trey McBride the best TE in the league. He leads all Tight End’s in air yards with a 37% share.__ Now he faces a Bucs defense that runs a ton of zone. Bucs head coach Todd Bowles is a defensive minded coach that loves his zone. __The Bucs run Zone coverage on 76.2% of their plays, 8th most in the league. Last week Pitts shredded the Seahawks defense (6/90 yds) that run zone 79.4% of their plays, highest in the league.__ Zone defenses, specifically the Bucs’ defense, naturally funnels passes to tight ends &amp; running backs. It’s the only place to throw the ball. They will give you the underneath &amp; sidelines gaps between the zones all day. __The Bucs allow 112.4 yards per game on short sideline passes 3rd most in the league, &amp; 53.5 yards per game to intermediate sideline passes 4th most in the league. The Falcons average 108.2 yards per game on short sideline passes (7th most) &amp; 57.7 on intermediate sideline passes (3rd most).__ This is where Kyle Pitts does his damage &amp; he should eat the Bucs alive like he has done in the past. __Pitts has hit over this line in all 3 of his games vs the Bucs dating back to last season:__

9/7/25: 7 rec, 59 yards

10/27/24: 4 rec, 91 yards

10/3/24: 7 rec, 88 yards 

Another reason Kirk Cousins has targeted Pitts is he is just 31 of 64 (48.4%) for 320 yards (5.0 Y/A) with a 72.4 rating when targeting wide receivers this season. Pitts is his lord &amp; savior. __Also the Bucs D allows the 4th most yards per pass attempt &amp; has been lit up by opposing TE’s lately: Saints TE’s: 5/54, McBride: 8/82 1 TD, &amp; Rams: 7/70 1 TD.__ Kirk should connect a ton with Pitts here.

5 of Atlanta’s last 6 games have gone over the total &amp; the Bucs have been vulnerable to downfield passing attacks. With Bowles as the head coach of Tampa Bay, the Bucs are 1-8 against the spread when hosting division opponents. They’re also just 1-10 ATS when playing at home after playing a home game the previous week. On top of that, the Falcons are 5-0 ATS when playing away from home after a game in which they allowed 30 or more points under Raheem Morris. Sunday’s contest was played in heavy rain, leaving Tampa’s turf in poor condition heading into this week’s matchup. If the field conditions are less than ideal, that typically helps offenses over defenses, with DL losing footing &amp; DB’s having issues mirroring WR’s routes. Tampa Bay’s defense in particular has had trouble this year in these situations.

I think it’s a shootout &amp; Pitts is the biggest beneficiary for the Falcons.

Thursday’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> - Kirk Cousins longest completion u31.5 yards -112 (1.12u to win 1u)

We’re going back to the well here. Pretty similar situation to last weekend. No London, pretty good defense with Tampa who will be looking to improve on their performance last week. Pitts is also a little banged up according to the practice reports and he is questionable for the game.

Tampa hasn’t allowed a 32 yard completion since they went up against Stafford and the Rams a couple weeks ago. Kirk hasn’t had a game with a 32 yard completion since week 12z

Good luck!</td></tr>

Game: League of Legends | Tournament: Kespa Cup 2025 | Teams: DKia vs. NS/T1 vs. HLE | Time: 1:00 AM EST

**Writeup:**

* Writeup tonight was too long to fit into reddit so have to condense it but a few points up front
* Kespa Cup is an off season tournament with teams varying how seriously they are taking it, the kill totals are way higher and the games aren&#x27;t being taken as seriously, however the average game time is way down which is kind of balancing it out in a way
* No Support is averaging more then 6+ deaths in the entire Kespa Cup right now, not even teams with 0%wr
* Damwon take on Nongshim in first round playoffs, Damwon went 4-0 in dominant fashion in group stage, Nongshim had a tougher road to qualify going 6-2 in maps and having to qualify in the last chance gauntlet. Damwon are -200+ favorites on most books and have side selection for map 1
* T1 take on HLE in the match everybody wanted, Guma left T1 to join former teammate Zeus, now he faces off against his teammates he just won worlds with, he also gets to vs. his replacement adc
* **Want to make it clear that LCK CL and LCK are not the same as Kespa Cup, the kill total is higher a regular LCK game is normally in the mid 26-26.5 range for a map, while this tournament kill lines are in the low 30&#x27;s per map, this doesn&#x27;t mean the stats are worthless, but their will be more deaths. I am factoring this in but still think both lines are disrespectfully too high given the circumstances**

**Career U 5.5 Deaths Map 1**:

* So far at Kespa Damwon are 4-0 at the tournament, Career is averaging 3.3 DPG with 0/4 hit rate on over
* Overall 89/101 hitrate (88.1%), and 49/53 of his teams wins (92.4%) in 2025
* While this is the riskier of the two since Career was previously an academy player and lacks LCK experience, I really think he is a very talented support, led the LCK CL in lowest deaths per game on support both in 2025 and in Summer Season, he plays very smart and disciplined and I really like DKia bot lane in this one. DKia are -200 favorites and will get side choice to start blue side in this series

**Keria U 5.5 Deaths Map 1:**

* Keria is averaging 2.7 deaths per game at Kespa Cup so far with a 3/3 under hitrate so far
* At worlds, Keria had a 20/20 hitrate on U 5.5 deaths averaging exactly 3 deaths per game, 14/14 in wins
* Overall Keria has a 92% hitrate last year in Spring/Summer/MSI/Worlds, with a 97.6% hitrate on the under in his teams wins,

Keria line is just way too high to me, he covers so often even in losses on this line, T1 are a slow paced team that play macro and don&#x27;t scrap a lot for no reason, this match means something to the players as well and this line is  just way too high (Delight is set to 3.5 deaths).

Career slightly scarier because less data against LCK, however line is still way too high in my opinion again massive hit rate most of times significantly under, and Career is a -200 favorite, where he has covered in 92.4% of games and most misses being on troll picks that we won&#x27;t see. Model heavily favors in both unders even when accounting for the projected kill lines per map as opposed to their normal data</td></tr>

**My last pick of the day PSG to win 1,75 on bet365, 5 units. X**

PSG played ass couldn&#x27;t score their chances, bad read from me.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>: Feyenoord and Aston Villa to win. 2,75 4 units.

Feyenoord just played Stuttgart, Villa and Celtic in the Europa League. Those are all top sides in this competition, and the level is way higher than what they face now. FCSB are sitting tenth in the Romanian league and they’ve only won one Europa League game, the same as Feyenoord, but the difference in quality is huge. Feyenoord competes for the Dutch title, they play a much faster and attacking, and they absolutely need this win to stay in Europe. This should be a game where the difference in tempo and intensity shows immediately. For me, Feyenoord should handle this.

Then you have Aston Villa. They’re second in the Premier League, playing top football every week, and even though they’re not as dominant in the Europa League, they’re still winning and sitting third in the group. Villa create chances and they move the ball well. When Malen plays, he’s been in great form too. The numbers are there. Villa attack at a high pace: almost fourteen shots per game, six on target, creating close to four big chances every match. With that amount of pressure, they eventually break teams down.

Basel, on the other hand, look shaky. They only kept one clean sheet. They allow one point four goals per game, they make a lot of fouls that lead to shots, and they lose the ball over 130 times per match. Their defensive numbers tell the whole story. They clear the ball a lot because they get pinned back, and their duel success isn’t high enough to stop teams that attack constantly.

Villa usually dominate possession, with over sixty percent on average and almost nine out of ten passes completed. That kind of control is exactly what Basel struggles against. Most of the game will be played in Basel’s half, and the shot volume from Villa should be too much for them to hold out.

So for me, both picks line up. Feyenoord have more quality, more urgency and a way higher level of competition behind them. Villa are simply the better team and the stats back it up. But I do like them single as well.

BOL!</td></tr>

• ⁠Model has this set as 54.5% but what stood out to me was that the model has 20+ yards at the percentage of 52.9% - very close so I am sprinkling on the 20+ too

• ⁠Model shows he has hit this line over 50% of his games this year

• Model says his line should be at o/u 22.5 rushing yards

• Model believes his o/u rushing attempts should be 5.5 

• Model shows me he has a 70% probability chance if he rushes 6+ times tomorrow night

🏒 NHL, Golden Knights at Flyers, 12/11/25 Thur, 7 pm Eastern Time

Explanation: Vegas has been one of the more efficient two-way teams in the league so far, and they have a solid 36 points this far in the season. I like how Vegas’ shot share and expected-goals share are both slightly above 50% on the season, especially since they have deeper forward depth. 
 
I don’t like that the Flyers heavily on Konecny to create offense. I don’t think that’s going to be enough to out-score the Golden Knights, given my reasoning in the first paragraph.

Let’s get back to winning after 2 tough losses with psg not able to score a goal with all the chances and byu fighting all the way back to win on heroic 3 buzzer beater</td></tr>

2026 PDC 🎯 World Championships: 0-0

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Madars Razma (-161) v Jamai van den Herik

Pumped to return for what I consider to be the greatest three weeks in all of sports - The PDC Darts World Championships! Over the course of three weeks, 128 of the best darts players on the planet will compete on the Ally Pally stage for a piece of the $5 million prize fund. 

For the first day of action, I very much like backing the darts vereran &amp; Latvian #1 player - Madars “Latvian Razmatazz” Razma to defeat Jamai van den Herik. 

Razma, current world #46, has been on the PDC Tour since 2017, steadily climbing the rankings to achieve a current career-best within the top 50. Razma has won matches at the World Championships in each of the last two world championships, and he also reached a QF of the 2022 World Grand Prix, a major tournament on the darts tour. 

The opponent &amp; current world #115 van den Herik, is a much lesser-known and inexperienced commodity than Razma. The 22-year-old van den Herik has amassed $42k in his brief career, with most of that $$ being earned on the Modus Super Series, a lesser, secondary professional tour in the sport of darts 🎯. 

Van den Herik has not won a PDC rated match since October 1, 2025, and he’s lost his last 6 matches in the final PDC Players Championships to close out his 2025 PDC Tour. In contrast, Razma won 7 PDC ranked matches in each of those same PDC Players Championship events where van den Herik went winless. 

While there are never easy victories when it comes to the World Championships, I think experience, form, and overall ability all favor the 37-year old 🇱🇻 Madars Razma — so I am Locking him in to win on day 1, while also eyeing a potential upset coming up on day 2.</td></tr>

Siskova is a decent player, with good serve percentages due to her experience in doubles, where she has won much more compared to her singles career, where she never got out of the top 200. 

Leonard has been on a huge winning streak, having won 11 matches in a row, with two ITF tournament wins. She also has a good serve but offers many more technical aspects to the game, such as slices, dropshots and a good net approach, which are qualities that can throw off a lot of players at this level and can really make the difference. 

I&#x27;ve backed Leonard against Bassols in the previous round as I didn&#x27;t agree with the French being the underdog and I&#x27;ll do the same here.

Good luck!</td></tr>

Todays Event 🏈 NFL Thursday Night Football Falcons @ Bucs 7:15 PM CST 🏈

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Todays pick</mark>: Rachaad White o15.5 Rushing Yards (-117 on DK) 1u to win 0.86u

Writeup: This line could very well be a trap set by Vegas who knows something we don&#x27;t. Sure Irving is back, Same with Evans and McMillan, therefore White&#x27;s volume is going down. But, he&#x27;s still seeing plenty usage. While he did only have two carries against the Cardinals, he saw 11 against the Saints. I believe this line at 15.5 is too low even with so many weapons being back. In fact, getting those weapons may cause a wide enough lead to incentivize 2nd half rushing.

Atlanta&#x27;s rush defense has been bad these past few weeks. They&#x27;ve been allowing the 12th most fantasy points to rbs in that stretch. Not to mention they&#x27;re ranked 24th in rushing defense in the league giving up 131.0 average rushing a game. This is juxtaposed to their 9th ranked passing defense. Buccaneers are going to utilize their rb room

Looking at White&#x27;s rushing average those 6 games (w1-4 and w13/14) when Bucky is playing, he&#x27;s averaging 6 carries a game for 28 yards, still plenty of volume, White&#x27;s been averaging 3.8 YPC, and the Falcons have been allowing around 4.5 YPC this season. I can see him getting at least 4 touches which would hit if he follows these averages.

Tampa bay holds a solid o-line currently, a useful tool needed for rushing. As it stands right now, the Bucs are favorites playing at home, with a -4.5 spread and -238 ML. Falcons offense has been rather inconsistent, most of the time looking bad and then showing up where they have no business to. Unless Kirko Chains unleashes another 500 yard game, I can see the Bucs getting a nice lead, further utilizing the run and diversity in who gets the ball (ie less Irving concentrated carries).

Last Pick: ✅ Cade Cunningham O4.5 Rebounds

NBA | Lakers vs Celtics | 6:30 pm est

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: LeBron James Over 5.5 Assists (-146)

Write Up: This play comes from my simulation-based NBA prop tool that weights season production, recent form, projected minutes, pace, opponent adjustments, and blowout probability before running Monte Carlo simulations to estimate true probability versus the posted line.

LeBron is projected at 7.9 assists with a modeled 75.7% probability of clearing 5.5. Projected minutes sit at \~34.2 in a core role during a close game according to the spread. His season average is 7.2, and recent form is elevated (10.6 L5), suggesting increased facilitation responsibility.

Variance is relatively tight (std dev ±1.9), and the distribution centers above 6.5 even with a slight negative opponent adjustment (-2.2%). At -145 range, the model indicates value relative to implied probability.

Rockets @ Knicks OVER 214.5 (-105) ❌

Tough one.
Tracked perfectly most of the night — pace was there, shot volume was there, just needed a normal close. Then Houston went completely cold late and it died out.

Absolute pain… Shamet misses the free throw with 1 second left that would’ve pushed us over. Brutal hook. 


**Record** : 4–7

**Net Units** : -2.46u



🎯 **<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>**: 

Gui Santos OVER 11.5 Points (+105) *Fanatics*

**Units** : 2u

This is strictly a minutes + role play.

Santos isn’t stuck in that early-season 12–15 minute role anymore. Over this recent stretch he’s consistently seeing high-20s to low-30s minutes, and when he’s getting that kind of run he’s producing like a legit rotation scorer — hovering around 14 PPG and clearing this line regularly.

When he hits 26+ minutes, the path is simple. He’s getting enough shot attempts, transition looks, and second-unit usage where 12 points is just a normal night. Warriors have been comfortable keeping him out there in competitive rotations and he’s been aggressive offensively.

This line still feels priced off his old usage, not what his role looks like right now.
If the minutes hold, this projects in that 12–16 range again.

Plus money on a guy trending over with steady run is value I’m taking.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Monchengladbach v **SC Freiburg ML + Roma ML** v Cremonese (3.5u)

**Odds:** **+160**

**Write Up:** What a shit show from FC Nordsjaelland, luckily for those who also placed it on Bet365 the early pay-out saved the lay. For those that took just BTTS good choice also, appreciate everyone who tailed - not much we can do about the red card and losing a 3-0 lead. Like I&#x27;ve mentioned its not often I go 0-2 (lets hope I didn&#x27;t jinx it) so I usually place both in singles to hedge against a total loss! For those who are asking how to get me a coffee or a section where I post my picks, I don&#x27;t have either as of yet but if there is more traction for either then I will look into making one. Lets keep the ball rolling here for you all - have a wonderful day everyone!

First up is German top flight football, with SC Freiburg (8th) hosting Monchengladbach (14th) - this league is made from 18 teams for those who aren&#x27;t aware. Their head-to-head results are as follows: 4(SC Frei)-5(Draws)-1(Mon), with SC Freiburg unbeaten in the last 9! faceoffs, this however changes when we look at home fixtures for SC Freiburg going 5-5(W/D) with their last 5 fixtures resulting in 4 draws and the LATEST resulting in a win, in 2024 albeit. The reverse fixture away at Monchengladbach was a 0-0 draw. Now whilst those stats don&#x27;t sound too convincing here lies my main reasoning for this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>: recent forms are that SC Frei are 2-1-2 (W/D/L) in their last 5 and Mon are 0-3-2 (W/D/L) both home and away, Mon are now winless in 6. Moving onto their respective home and away forms it looks like this: SC Frei at home in this league are 4-1-0 in their last 5 and Mon are 0-2-3 in their last 5 away. Even with the two draws for Mon they have come against Bremen (16th) and HSV (11th), with their latest loss coming from 7th place Frankfurt 3-0. Whilst SC Frei beat Bremen a man down 1-0 last home game, as well as their only draw coming against second place Dortmund (albeit with a red card in the 53rd minute). Based off better current form, home advantage that has proved Freiburg are a much different team home and away, as well as Monchengladbach&#x27;s poor current form, I see Frei taking the needed 3 points to build a lead on the teams below them, especially as their away form is so poor. I&#x27;ve chosen them to win outright purely for the value but for a securer line and something for more of a bankroll builder SC Freiburg or Draw could be the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> for you.

Second leg is in the Italian top flight where Roma, 4th, are hosting 15th place Cremonese. In their last 5 head-to-heads in all competitions it is 3(Roma)-0 draws-2 Cremonese. Current form is as follows: Roma are 5-2-3 (W/D/L), 2-2-1 in their last 5 - Cremonese are 0-4-6 in their last 10, 0-2-3 in their last 5. Onto current home/away forms: Roma are 4-1-0 at home in their last 5, Cremonese are 0-1-4 in their last 5 away fixtures. Roma themselves are in great current form, Malen in particularly is on fire scoring 5 in his last 5 appearances, scoring 1.15 per 90 minutes he is getting. For a team that is hot form, taking over 2 points per game from their home games against a poor travelling, bottom half team I see Roma seeing this out and continuing their fine home form. Not overthinking this too much - home advantage, players in good form, weak travelling team on a 11 game winless streak should prove too much for Cremonese and Roma seeing this through.

I appreciate the those who tail - those asking how to get me a coffee or if I post other picks elsewhere if more ask for these I&#x27;ll look into them both. Have an awesome day folks lets keep this streak going!

Crystal Palace ML + O1.5 Team Goals @ +105

Reason:

This has covered in 6 straight H2H matches between these two teams. Wolves have had two impressive draws in a row, but they allow teams a lot of good scoring opportunities and don&#x27;t have much offensive firepower themselves. Both teams are banged up, but Palace still has strong weapons in spite of that. I feel confident in Palace to win relatively comfortably.</td></tr>

Odds: (1.85)

Write Up: Shamyl hussain is the captain of the pakistan team and he is also the opening batman which means he gets to play the power play. In the last game he scored a comfortable 50 and scored our required target of 20 runs in the first three overs . Being the only batsman who played well from the Pakistani side in the previous game i think he will take it slow and be extra cautious in not losing his wicket which will help our bet to be completed.</td></tr>

Feyenoord vs Telstar, Over 3.5 goals @ 2.05 (1u) 

I’m taking over 3.5 goals in Feyenoord vs Telstar. This just feels like a mismatch on paper. Feyenoord at home are relentless, they keep attacking even when they’re two goals up. Telstar defending for 90 minutes against that pressure sounds tough. If Feyenoord click early, this could get out of hand quickly. And honestly, I wouldn’t be surprised if Telstar sneak one too. I’m expecting a proper goal fest here.

Time: 11:30 AM EST &amp; 2:30 PM EST

​<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Liquid ML &amp; Aurora +1.5 Maps @ 2.02 odds (5u)

​Write Up:

Team Liquid has consistently shown they have the upper hand in this matchup. After their recent success at BLAST Slam, their coordination in the mid-to-late game remains superior to BetBoom’s often chaotic playstyle. While they drew 1-1 with BetBoom just a few days ago in Group Stage 1, Liquid historically tightens their gameplay as tournaments progress into the second stage. BetBoom is talented but prone to mid-game collapses, expect Liquid&#x27;s disciplined drafting, superior macro and objective control to secure the series win here.

Falcons looked untouchable in their 2-0 win yesterday, but Aurora is a notorious bracket spoiler. Aurora has a unique, aggressive playstyle that often catches top-tier teams off guard in the opening map. Even if Falcons win the series, Aurora taking just one map is a very high-probability outcome given their recent form and the draft variety they bring to Bo3s.

​BOL.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> we&#x27;re running back a play from a few weeks back as we&#x27;re backing JSL to land two shots on target against his former team. This has hit in both of his first two matches for Crystal Palace, including 2 goals in his last outing vs Burnley. 

I like this play here because he&#x27;s facing his former team and this is the perfect opportunity for a revenge spot. Wolves, despite a major improvement in form, are still bottom 3 defensively in the EPL. They conceded 10 SOTs in their last away game to Forest, who are bottom 5 offensively.

**Write Up:** This line is straight up disrespectful to Levante. *They might be a relegation threatened team* at the minute, but they have enough quality about them, especially in attack, to trouble Barcelona and, most importantly, cover the spread. The first league game between the two ended in a **narrow 3-2 win** for the Catalan giants and we’d take a repeat of that in a heartbeat <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.

*Levante do struggle defensively,* but thankfully the **Barcelona attackers have been misfiring lately**, having performed **well below their xG,** and they should squander a ton of chances <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> again. On the other end, Levante have a **good enough attacking outlet** to punish Barcelona’s weak defensive line and keep the scoreline tight. Not only that, but Barcelona have shown a surprising inability to establish dominance in the midfield in the past two/three games, and I can see another iffy match from them <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.

Moreover, Barcelona are still **plagued by injuries and fitness issues** from the usual suspects, now add **embarrassing back to back defeats** to Atletico and Girona into the mixer, and I just can’t see an out of sorts Barcelona doing anything more than narrowly defeating Levante. I wouldn’t even be very surprised if they dropped points again in all honesty. I expect a big performance from Etta Eyong, **if he starts** <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. 5 units as per usual since it’s a Barcelona special.

SION VS YOUNG BOYS

Date: 22 FEBRUARY 2026 at 14:00

BET ON: Match odds- YOUNG BOYS

Odd: 2.75



\- For this clash, motivation and tactical context clearly tilt the balance toward BSC Young Boys. Throughout Swiss press this month, coach Gerardo Seoane has publicly expressed frustration with his side’s inconsistent performances and defensive issues, describing the team’s recent displays as uncompetitive and acknowledging clear faults that need fixing – especially discipline and defensive focus – which signals a strong tactical emphasis this week to tighten up and control phases better than in previous matches. That’s important: Seoane isn’t complacent, he is demanding basics be right and pushing his squad to “stop looking upwards and do fundamentals correctly,” a phrase Swiss media reported from players commenting on his messaging. In contrast, FC Sion coach Didier Tholot has stressed steady progress and collective ambition to climb the table into the Top-6, highlighting confidence gained from recent positive results and collective improvement. But Sion’s mindset is one of consolidation and resilience, not outright dominance, and they remain burdened by injuries and suspensions in key defensive areas that restrict how proactive they can be early in games. With Young Boys’ coach publicly pushing for stronger defensive discipline and greater intensity after recent lapses, and Sion still reshuffling due to absences, Young Boys should have the edge in tactical motivation and urgency — a convincing argument for backing them more confidently.

The big one. A rematch of the 4 nations final and a rematch of the 2010 Olympic final. I think we’re getting a bit of a discount on Canada because they haven’t been dominant in their QF or SF game and because they are without Crosby. If I can get McDavid and MacKinnon together on a discount, I’m going to take it.

Then there is the story of the 2 goalies. Big game Binnington had some excellent saves in the QF game against Czechia (big one in OT) and a couple saves against Finland to keep Canada in the game. I trust the former Stanley Cup winner over Hellebuyck, who has yet to prove he can win the big one. Of course, he certainly has the skills and potential to get it done. I’m going to pay to see it

Nantes are topping the french division 1 table ahead of PSG with goals different, Nantes hasn&#x27;t lost a match in the french league this whole season, and going off against 7 place Tremblay who have lost their 8 meeting against Nantes and Nantes have covered this line in all.

remember the Valladolid game is Spanish handball league while the Nantes game is french handball league. Valladolid -2.5 and Nantes -3.5.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Kyoto Sanga Win@2.05 (Coolbet) | **Stake: 5u**  

**Write Up:**

Kyoto Sanga with two 1-1 draws so far against Vissel Kobe and Shimizu, which I guess we can call okay so far. Sanga had a sensational season last year and nobody really expects them to follow up that 3rd place.

Avispa Fukuoka drew 1-1 against Okayama in the opener, before Cerezo beat them 2-0 at home. I have Avsipa to finish last in this West group, there is just very little about this team that inspires anything. They averaged less than a goal a game last year and over the winter they have lost some key players without replacing them with anybody noteworthy. The manager has also left after last season after being accused of power harassing yet again and the replacement hasn’t done anything special before this to inspire confidence. 

It would be really fuckings frustrating if Kyoto Sanga can’t win this game by just scoring a single goal. The guests here really do look clueless and poorly coached. My guess is another 2-0 defeat for Avispa.

Tottenham Hotspur v Arsenal, 17:30 CET
<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Winner: Arsenal, 1.60, 1 unit

Write up: North London derby - a story in itself.
Probably one of the biggest point-difference between these two teams if front of this derby in the 21st century. Arsenal are chasing the Premier League title after 22 years, while Tottenham after a great start of the season now  can&#x27;t find a way to escape the relegation zone.
Arsenal are in front of the first serious test in the title race after drawing against Wolves. If they don&#x27;t manage to win at Tottenham, after whole 22 matchweeks there is a big chance for them to lose the first place in the near future because of the tougher schedule rather than Man. City.
Although in this kind of derbies statistics don&#x27;t matter a lot and the mentality in front of the games is the key, Arsenal dominated in their last Premier League meeting and won in the last 3 Premier League games at Tottenham away.
In addition, in Sunday Igor Tudor will make a debut as the new manager of Tottenham.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: Iowa vs Wisconsin/ Wisconsin ML (-148) 4u

Write up: Part of what makes Vegas so profitable is how reactive the average Gambler is. A lot of gamblers would see Iowa fresh off a win against Nebraska and Wisconsin fresh off of a loss and scratch their head here. Let’s present the facts. Iowa is 3-5 on the road. Iowa is 1-5 against teams ranked in the AP Poll. Iowa’s offense has looked horrible to say the least recently. And what made Iowa win last game was how they schemed against the Huskers offense. It’s easy to prey on a team when you’re on your home court. But I just can’t see the Hawkeyes being able to scheme quite as well on the road. Especially with how potent this Badger offense can be. The only way, and I emphasize only, the Hawkeyes can control this game is if Wisconsin is lousy with the basketball. Otherwise I don’t see a sputtering offense marching in on the road and dismantling a Badgers team in need of a win. Wisconsin is currently a tournament team but nothing is guaranteed. A loss here hurts BAD, and we all know winning on the road is extremely hard to do, ESPECIALLY with a struggling offense. Stirtz is phenomenal, but he’s gonna need a lot of help tomorrow. Thanks to those tailing. Only gamble what you can afford to lose, let’s have a good weekend everyone!

T1 had a poor showing vs Bnk Fearx and I don’t see them absolutely dominating DPlus KIA here. I think they will go a full 5 games to decide this one.

Puck drop is 5:10AM PST. This is match 2 of a system I have for Macklin Celebrini to score a goal. Since this is a very important game it would not be surprising if the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> does not hit. As we know he has been a prolific goal scorer during his time at the Olympics. 

Should this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> not hit I will continue to make the same <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> going forward until it does. I double my units after each loss. Celebrini plays again with the Sharks on the 26th.

🦊 <mark style='background:#fff59d'>TODAY</mark> <mark style='background:#fff59d'>PICK</mark>: Y.Wu v J.P.Ficovich, C.Wong v A.Hernandez: **Wu ML + Wong to win in straight sets (1.60)** 🦊

🎾 ATP 500 Acapulco, 1:30 and 3:00 CET

🚨First match starts in 2 hours🚨

About first match: Wu is simply a machine on hard court and he’s facing an unchallenging opponent like Ficovich, who gives his best on clay and just doesn’t seem to have enough weapons to put pressure on Wu.  
  
About second match: Coleman Wong is a strong player, and he’s not used to have mental blackouts, which are what could cause him to lose a set against Hernandez, who could join the tournament through a Wild Card and seems to just be a lower stages player, normally competing on minor ITF tournaments. 

I was tempted to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> just Wu in straight sets, but he’s not as mentally strong as Wong, so i preferred to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> just the ML and add Wong’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>.

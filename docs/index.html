**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** William Nylander 3+ Shots on Goal for 2u

**Odds:** \+116 (was +165 last night)

**Game:** NHL | Maple Leafs @ Edmonton Oilers | 8:30pm EST

**Reasoning:** William Nylander has been out with a groin injury for a number of games since 2026 started, however he returned during the Canucks game where he posted an impressive 5 SOGs on his return from injury. That momentum kept up last night against the Flames where he had 1 Goal, 2 Assists and 3 SOGs.

Vegas realized their betting line mishap last night after his incredible performance and quickly tightened the line down from +165 to +116. Now he faces an impressive squad in Edmonton tonight where historically these games are high scoring affairs, concurrently the Leafs have been posting roughly 30 SOGs per game for the month of January.

Nylander is also an extreme endurance athlete, I think he some stretch where he played 236 consecutive games, so I don&#x27;t think playing the back-to-back will impact his performance much and I fully expect Coach Berube to recognize Nylanders contributions in just his 2 games being back and to get him some more time on ice tonight.

Nylander is also a key component of the PP squad for the Leafs and they are facing Edmonton who average roughly 3 penalties per game or 11th most penalized team in the League. We expect to see a north-to-south game tonight where the Oilers force some penalties on themselves while the Leafs will be expecting more &amp; more from their primary star player.

\-----------------------------------

Let&#x27;s go Nylander! Shout-out to u/Far-You5676 for a stellar SOG <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> last night. Lets see if I can return the favor.</td></tr>

Domi has been on a pretty good run with 13 points in 17 games in 2026. He has good opportunity, expected to play on the top line tonight with the always dangerous Auston Matthews. Among forwards with 500+ minutes, his xGF/60 is decent, ranked 93rd (out of 334). His actual GF/60 is a bit low, but that&#x27;s because Domi doesn&#x27;t always play on the top line with Matthews.

Oilers is average to below average in most defensive metrics. Domi has had reasonable success against them, with 3 points in 5 games since the 23-24 season. That&#x27;s good enough for me to take the plus odds.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Potd</mark>:    FC Dordrecht v Helmond Sport 
Btts yes @ 1.66

Dordrecht score consistently at home and rarely finish matches without scoring in front of their fans.
Both Dordrecht and Helmond concede goals regularly, with very few clean sheets this season.

Helmond Sport manage to score even in away matches, including against stronger opponents.

Neither team typically controls matches defensively, reducing the chance of a clean sheet scenario.

Both teams have reliable scoring trends and unstable defenses, making my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> the most logical and statistically supported outcome.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: **Isaiah Collier O12.5 P (-125 FanDuel) 1U**

Event: NBA | Utah Jazz @ Indiana Pacers (7:10 p.m. EST) | 🏀

*Recap: Snow at the beach. Charleston Southern vs. Gardner-Webb is now postponed to Feb. 17.*

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s reasoning:** Isaiah Collier is *not* a 3-point shooter, and that&#x27;s a good thing. The Utah Jazz point guard ranks 13th on the team in 3-point attempts per 36 minutes. I think that&#x27;s a remarkable stat for a primary ball handler. Instead Collier&#x27;s game is anchored on drives into the paint and drawing contact. He ranks fifth on the team in free-throw attempts per 36 minutes. He&#x27;s also averaging 14.3 points per 36 minutes. I keep looking at the &quot;per 36 minutes&quot; metric because Keyonte George injured his ankle Friday and is out for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>&#x27;s game in Indiana. In the meantime, Collier - who had been averaging 25.9 minutes per game - logged 30 during Sunday&#x27;s loss at Toronto and is sure to play plenty <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. I think he clears 13 points with ease. Here&#x27;s why.

Indiana runs shooters off the 3-point line. They allow the fewest 3-point attempts and the third-lowest percentage in the league. The Pacers want to neutralize long shots and dare players to drive. But... they&#x27;re allowing 62.3 points in the paint - the worst mark in the Association. Slashing guards, like Collier, can find success going inside and playing to contact. For that matter, I like his assists too (7.5), and I did consider a PA combo (21.5). But I&#x27;m going with points.

Over his last 10 games playing without George, Collier is averaging 14 points. Against the Raptors on Sunday, he netted 19, including 8-of-10 from the free-throw line. Speaking of freebies, Indiana is bottom five in the league in giving up 5.4 free throws to opposing point guards. If Collier gets even five points from the charity stripe, he only needs four field goals to go over. Granted, he&#x27;s only hitting 68 percent of his free throws, but he&#x27;s still getting there (as seen in the per 36 minutes stat). Plus, Collier has been consistent through three career games against the Pacers - averaging 13.3 points (11, 15, and 14 in his last meeting in November). Both his career average against Indiana AND his recent &quot;without George&quot; average are higher than the current line.

Utah already plays one of the fastest tempos in the league. Their high volume hides inefficient possessions. They rank sixth in tempo, while Indiana is 15th. Utah is also sixth in scoring (118), while both teams have been leaking points like they&#x27;re going out of style - Utah allows 127 (30th) and Indiana gives up 118 (25th). When they played on Nov. 12, Utah won 152-128. If scoring is the only way the Jazz win <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, I&#x27;ll take my chances with a point guard who isn&#x27;t bothered by what Indiana tries to take away, and who will be called on to step up in George&#x27;s absence.

Collier is averaging 12.3 points over his last 10 games, regardless of George&#x27;s health, nearly three points higher than his season average. Over the previous five games, that number jumps to 13.8, and he&#x27;s been shooting over 51 percent during this stretch. He&#x27;s clearly on an uptrend. Full disclaimer: Collier has cleared 10 points in just five of his last 10 road games. However, in 16 road games where George doesn&#x27;t play, Collier has cleared 12.5 points seven times. In the other nine games (most of them early in his rookie season), he&#x27;s scored: 11, 11, 8, 7, 5, 2, 0, 0, and 7. But here is where I see the value. In his last seven road starts without George (dating to March 2025), he&#x27;s not only cleared 12.5 points every time, he&#x27;s averaged 17.8 points. Plus, Indiana is 28th in the NBA in allowing opposing point guards to score.

Here&#x27;s my thesis: In a short career sample size, Collier&#x27;s done the job against the Pacers. But with Keyonte George out, I see 30+ minutes for Collier to drive inside, draw free throws, and finish in the paint. I think Utah wants a track meet, which will help mitigate a poor shooting night. However, Collier is fifth on the Jazz roster in effective field goal percentage - highest amongst Utah guards - and I think he will look to score against an Indiana unit that doesn&#x27;t particularly stop opposing point guards.

Good luck and Godspeed!

Unit: 4 units

* In Spirit&#x27;s recent 2-1 loss to Liquid (Jan 30), he cleared this line in every game they won and even hovered near it in their losses.
* In &quot;sprint&quot; matches like this, Spirit typically funnels every ounce of resource into Yatoro. Whether he’s on a signature Morphling  he is the designated finisher for 80% of their teamfights.
* Team Liquid has been bleeding kills in the mid-game recently. In their last 5 matches, they’ve conceded an average of **24.5 kills per game**. Against a carry of Yatoro&#x27;s caliber, 7 kills is a very modest bar to clear, even if Spirit ends up losing the match.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Sri Lanka vs **England ML** T20 **+** **Hearts ML** vs St Mirren (2.5u)

**Odds:** \+185

**Write Up:** Nice 87th min penalty gets us over the line, the amount of shots for both teams and the tempo the whole game it easily could have been another fixture with 4+ goals, just some good defending and saves from both keepers. 

Firstly is the international T20 fixture between Sri Lanka and England, England are in good form and are currently 2-0 up in the series and are looking to sweep. They have won their last 5 T20 games and have won the last 5 head-to-heads against Sri Lanka, with SL only winning 1/5 T20 matches. Going off player form and recent results I don&#x27;t see why England can&#x27;t sweep Sri Lanka here and given the odds I don&#x27;t mind confidently putting them into my two lay <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. 

Secondly we go to the Scottish Premiership, Hearts sit at the top of the league with St Mirren in 10th, winning none of their last 5 fixtures. I almost went with under 2.5 goals as the home team of St Mirren have only scored 7 and conceded 10 from their 14 home games, the game earlier in the season did go over but that is an exception being one of two to do so. Carrying on with the analysis, Hearts are currently 16-6-2 (W-D-L) with Mirren going 4-8-11; Mirren have an alright record against Hearts but in current form I do not see them being able to keep their opponents out of their net. However it must be said that Hearts have only won 1 out of their last 5 away at St Mirren, despite this the reverse fixture finished 2-0 to Hearts; Mirrens home form is 3-5-4 with Hearts away form being 8-2-2. With Hearts having harder fixtures to come and not wanting to drop any points here I think they secure the win over Mirren to take all 3 points.

These two Dutch sides are no strangers to goals. They score and concede regularly with 74% of their h2h games having over 2.5 goals.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>, I&#x27;ll back AZ to score because they have a great record of scoring at home with almost a 100% hit rate. Also, though Twente has won every KNVB Cup game so far, they&#x27;ve also conceded in every game including games against both a 2nd and 4th division team. I expect AZ to put in at least 1 goal <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.

  
For the corners, it&#x27;s a similar story. AZ has an almost 100% hit rate for over 3.5 corners at home. I expect an end-to-end game with plenty of shots, saves and tackles so hopefully this hits very easily. There is a good chance it hits in the first half.

**Event:** NBA: Lakers @ Nets 7:30 pm EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Michael Porter Jr. o24.5 pts (-105) BetMGM MAXBET 5u

**Write-up:** Porter just keeps getting disrespected on his lines. I’m happy to keep taking them, though. This season, Porter is 24/38 on this line, and at home, this is 12/19. He is going to be rested for this game since he didn’t play Sunday and will have three days of rest. He has covered this line back to Dec 1 when he’s had three. Plus, we have everybody playing tonight, which should relieve some of the pressure off of Porter and allow him to not get doubled as soon as he touches the ball.

The Lakers rank 30th in points allowed to small forwards this season and 28th in threes made to small forwards. In the last two weeks, they rank 28th in points and 25th in threes allowed. In the last week, 29th in points and 29th in threes allowed. 

Porter has been carrying this offense all season and is averaging 20 FGA and 10 3PA…so 50% of his shots. Porter is getting the rest of his buckets inside the restricted area, where the Lakers rank 21st on the season and 27th in the last week. Against teams that defend the restricted area weakly, Porter is covering at an insane 80%. The Lakers are playing at a mediocre pace. Versus middle-of-the-pack teams in terms of pace, Porter is also covering well. Porter’s main shot is a catch-and-shoot, where he is coming off a set of screens into a three. The Lakers are struggling to contain C&amp;S players, ranking 20ish in their last 5/10/15 games. Versus teams that rank 15-25, Porter is covering around 79%. In January he didn’t cover just five times. Two by blowout, and three versus LAC, Phoenix, and New Orleans, who were ranking top 10 against small forwards last month. Lakers ranked 26th.

The last three picks have been rough, man. Good reads, but then KD, Brooks, and Zion all shoot 30% and STILL ALMOST cover. Realistically, we should be 14-6, since I feel like the reads were correct. As I said, you cannot predict a bad shooting night. Just gotta take some licks and keep moving. Hopefully, Porter comes into this game lights out, I don’t know if I can take another 30% shooting night from the field 😭.

Going max bet here as well. Probably a little too risky, but I’ve been high on Porter all year, and he’s been a consistent hit for the most part. Nets also stick around the spread better at home and shouldn’t get blown out.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Denver +3.5 v Detroit

Write-up: 
On the last 5 games, Denver ranks 7th in adjusted net efficiency, while Detroit ranks 9th. Stay with me. 

The difference here is on the road games with Denver. They are ranked 1st in adjusted net efficiency and have the proven consistency in their play. As for Detroit, they are ranked 5th in adjusted net efficiency and are less consistent in comparison to Denver.

Denver lost to OKC yesterday, which was literally a Shai and Cason Wallace out of this world night. 
Also, Jokic was abysmal during that game, which would be more surprising to see him not bounce back against Detroit. 

Detroit is not as dominant against west conference teams (13-6), unlike with east conference teams (23-6). 

No significant injury report for both teams (besides Denver’s players that were already injured from the beginning of the season)

Reasoning: Under Mike Brown, the Knicks’ pace has exploded. Washington is 30th in rebounding \[6.2\] and 29th in defensive efficiency. Hart has cleared this in 4 of his last 5 against DC, averaging 10.8 RPG.

The 5-Scenario Analysis Scenario A (The Track Meet): The game stays close and fast. Washington misses their usual 55% of shots. Hart plays 38+ minutes. Result: 11-13 Rebounds.

Scenario B (The KAT Dominance): Karl-Anthony Towns stays in the paint and snags the first 10 boards. Hart stays active on the perimeter. Result: 8-9 Rebounds (The Sweat Zone).

Scenario C (The Mike Brown Blowout): Knicks are up by 25 in the 3rd. Bench clears early. Result: 7 Rebounds aka (The Heartbreaker).

Scenario D (The White Flag 🏳️): Washington shoots an unsustainable 60% from the field (highly unlikely). No rebounds available for anyone. Resulting with 4-5 Rebounds.

Scenario E (Cold Night): Hart gets into early foul trouble or the referee crew (Pat Fraher&#x27;s crew) calls a tight game, slowing the pace to a crawl. Result: 6 Rebounds.

Scenario Proof: Washington allows 47.5 rebounds per game (29th in NBA). With Bilal Coulibaly out, their wing rebounding is non-existent. Hart is the &quot;vulture&quot; king; he doesn&#x27;t need plays called for him to produce.</td></tr>

Darren Raddysh over 2.5 shots (-120)

Darren Raddysh has been a monster for the Lightning this season and I expect him to have another great game tonight. He went over the 2.5 line for 5 games in a row now and he&#x27;s crushing that line easily with a 7 shot performance last game and 2 of those games where he got 5 shots. He also hit that line in 8 of his last 10 games! He&#x27;s feeling confident in his shot lately and it pays off with now a goal in 4 games in a row! Expect him to continue that trend against a Buffalo team that played yesterday vs the Panthers. It also helps that the Sabres are top 5 in the league in shots allowed this season!

Now he is playing in France on home court against a Choinski who has only played 1 match this year and lost 2-0 against Riedi.

Droguet has a strong serve, are in good form and I see good value in this bet!

Good luck!

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Hull/Draw + Bayer Leverkusen to win @ 2.03

Write Up: 

Hull/Draw: Hull is hosting Watford. Hull is 3rd place in the league, 16W5D8L with a 48:40 goals ratio and has won 4 matches in a row. Watford is in 10th place with 11W10D8L and 39:35 goal ratio. At home, Hull has 8W2D4L while Watford is pretty poor away with 3W5D5L. Watford did win the last two H2H but both times Watford was at home, Watford is much worse while away so I think Hull will at least get a draw here.

Bayer Leverkusen to win: Bayer Leverkusen is hosting St Pauli. This is the DFB Pokal, but in the Bundesliga, Leverkusen is in 6th place with 11W2D6L (38:26) while St Pauli are 17th with 3W5D12L (18:34). At home, Leverkusen has 6W1D3L while St Pauli has 1W1D8L. Their last H2H was in September where Leverkusen won 2-1 away. What I&#x27;m trying to say is, Leverkusen should win.

NBA | Knicks v Wizards | 🏀  

Interesting spot for Kolek here as the Knicks are facing the tanking Wizards tomorrow before facing the Nuggets the day after, feels like a game where the bench guys could get some run here with potentially a couple of starters getting ruled out imo.

Has gone over in his L3 games where he dished 10 dimes against the Raptors in 15 minutes, so definitely a good spot even if everyone’s playing, gets good usage when he’s on the court and with the big spread here, a blowout is definitely possible where he would gain even more minutes.

Wizards defense is ranked 2nd worst in the league allowing 3rd most assists and 2nd most points in the league so definitely a good matchup for Kolek here. 

Think there’s upside and potential here with the circumstances, has done work with the minute he’s been getting.

Individual split would be assists.</td></tr>

⚽️ Concacaf Champions Cup

Match: Forge vs Tigres 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Tigres ML + Tigres Over 1.5 ( -114)

Write-up:
In this tournament, Mexican teams start with a slight advantage due to the league schedules in Canada and the USA.

Forge played their last official match in November of last year, meaning they have gone more than two months without competitive action. That lack of match fitness should have an impact when facing a team that already has much better game rhythm.

Tigres are the current runners-up in their domestic league and have only one loss in the tournament, in a match they should have clearly won. They have strong attacking players, fast transitions, and create a lot of danger down the wings. This will definitely be a huge challenge for Forge’s defense, especially after more than two months without competitive matches, to contain Tigres’ attackers.

I expect a clear win for Tigres, even if they decide to rotate and use some backup players in attack for this match.</td></tr>

**Write Up:** 

**Bologna vs AC Milan | 20:45 GMT +2**

* AC Milan haven’t lost a game since the opening round in Serie A

Bologna’s form has really fallen off a cliff over the last two months! In Serie A they have only seen 1 win from their last 10… And they didn’t even have the best Xg in that match. At home they have four defeats and a draw from their last five. AC Milan have been much better than last year&#x27;s disaster class and currently find themselves in 2nd place with an opportunity to put themselves seven points deep into the top 4 after Roma and Como dropped points this round.  

The reason we are getting such good odds on Milan is the guests&#x27; injury situation. No Pulisic Saelemakers or Leao… That will obviously impact their ability to score goals. Fullkrug is also not 100% (Shocker). But I don’t see them losing here against such a poor Bologna side. 

\+++

\+++

**Sheffield United vs Oxford United | 20:45 GMT +2**

* Sheffield United have won 6 of 7 meetings

It’s hard not to call Sheffield United’s season a small disaster so with their current 17th place, but it’s still not entirely impossible to make the top 6, a win here would put them just 8 points off. Oxford United unsurprisingly  sits in the relegation zone with their 23rd place. THey recently made a manager change that saw three games unbeaten, before losing 2-0 at home last round. They also only scored in one of those four games.

Sheffield United have won 5 of their last 6 at home in the Championship, scoring a massive 17 goals in these games. Oxford United doesn’t really have the money or have the willingness to spend to compete in this division and when you also have the injury problems they have now, it obviously isn’t going to be easy to stay up. 

The Blades haven’t been very reliable this season, but they have had some very strong home performances. I mean the only draw on the mentioned run of six home games, came against Norwich whose goal was an own-goal and Sheffield had an xG of over 3(!).</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: Under 6.5 Goals (-115) 2.3u To Profit 2u

Write-Up: That Stars Vs Jets one was brutal, it was looking so good after the first period, anyways onto the next one. We have the Seattle Kraken coming to Anaheim to face the Ducks. In net for the Ducks is Lukas Dostal who has been solid this season. On the year, Dostal has a save percentage of .897 alongside a 2.81 goals against average. On the other side for the Kraken is Philipp Grubauer who has been lights. This season, Grubauer has a very impressive .919 save percentage, and just a 2.19 goals against average. Both teams are pretty unimpressive on offense, with the Kraken ranking 22nd in goals this season. They are also nearing the bottom of the league in shots on goal, being ranked at 30th. Ducks aren’t anything outstanding either, ranking 14th in goals this season. With both teams being pretty unimpressive offensively and having a decent goalie in Dostal and an amazing goalie in Grubauer, this one will be a relatively low scoring game maybe ending 3-2 or 4-2.

Given that Arsenal are missing Saka and Merino who both played last game I think that Chelsea have a real chance not just to Win/Draw but also win this game. Also the fact that Arsenal are up 3-2 in the first leg, they will settle for a draw so I am pretty confident with this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, I think the odds are great, the momentum is with Chelsea and I think they shock arsenal here and could even go to the finals.

Event: NCAABB Duke vs BC

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Duke o82.5 (-120) 2.4U to win 2U

Write up: Duke host BC at Cameron indoor for an ACC mid-week game.  Duke is on an absolute tear winning its last 9 games in convincing fashion.  Duke is loaded with stars and NBA prospects as usual, Boozer is dominant in the college ranks and leads his team in points, rebounds, and assists.  While Duke&#x27;s pace of play is not especially quick but their offensive efficiency is tremendous scoring 127 points per 100 possessions.  Duke&#x27;s scoring at 85.0 ppg.  Boston College is struggling 9-12 overall and 2-6 in ACC.  BC has a similar pace of play as Duke, BC is lead in scoring by Fred Payne at 15.2 ppg, he&#x27;s an great shooter boasting a 41% FG% but only stands &#x27;6&quot;1.  Duke&#x27;s defense is excellent ranking 4th overall per KenPom, the team&#x27;s leading players getting minutes are all at least &#x27;6&quot;5 posing a challenge for BCs strongest scorer.  Payne in mediocre from the FT line at 76% but BC overall shoots only 65% from FT line.  BC has the deck stacked against them, Duke should continue their domination in ACC play and have their way with BC.  BC will struggle to score and Cameron indoor will only make those difficulties worse.  Duke should have opportunities to get backups in the game late.  26.5 is a large spread, so I prefer Duke total team score o82.5.</td></tr>

Last Pick:
Nicholls State @ Northwestern State — Northwestern State Team Total Under 73.5 ✅

Result:  Win

Review:  NW State stayed under 73.5 because their scoring efficiency collapsed, not because of pace or game script. They shot just 37% overall and 20% from three (4–20), eliminating any realistic ceiling despite normal shot volume and free-throw attempts. Transition scoring was limited, forcing them into contested half-court possessions all night. Without an efficiency spike or foul-driven boost, the team total was never meaningfully threatened.

Wyoming Cowboys @ San Diego State Aztecs
Tuesday, February 3, 2026 | 11:00 PM ET

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Wyoming Team Total Under 65.5

Odds: -125 (DraftKings)

Write-Up: 

This is an elite asymmetric team-total under driven by opponent-specific suppression rather than overall game pace.

San Diego State is not a global pace suppressor — they are an opponent suppressor. Their defensive structure specifically removes transition opportunities, forces extended half-court possessions, and limits clean early offense. 

That profile directly attacks Wyoming’s scoring model, which is efficiency-fragile rather than volume-driven. Wyoming cannot unlock pace here, and their easiest scoring paths are structurally unavailable regardless of how San Diego State scores.

From comparable SDSU matchups and Wyoming’s offensive profile, the most likely outcome band sits in the 58–62 range. For Wyoming to exceed 65.5, they would need above-baseline shooting plus either foul inflation or transition leakage. Neither condition is supported in this matchup. As a result, 65.5 functions as a buffered ceiling rather than a tight median — exactly what you want when playing a team-total under.

The market quietly confirms this read by shading the under, reflecting that the median outcome already sits below the posted number. This play does not rely on game script, late-game behavior, or San Diego State playing slow — it only requires SDSU to defend the way they always do.

The primary failure mode is a genuine hot shooting night. Not pace. Not volume. Not fouling. That’s the lowest-variance risk profile available.

⸻

NOTE: If you cannot access team totals, the full-game under (141.5 at the time of posting) remains playable BUT introduces unnecessary dependence on San Diego State’s offensive efficiency. The Wyoming team total under is the cleaner, more insulated expression of the edge.

Best of luck.</td></tr>

Write Up: Finally a game with no pending injuries. Kind of a short write up here and I might be wrong but I just believe that the Nuggets really lack inside defensive presence without Aaron Gordon. They usually can make up for this by just out scoring the other team but against the Pistons this will be very difficult. The Pistons have above average defenders at every position and will be able to slow down the Nuggets offense. When Jokic was injured the Nuggets were starting to slow it down more but  can’t really do that when Jokic is in the line up. I think this is just stylistically an advantage for Detroit.

**Football | Scottish Premiership | 04:00 AM (GMT+8)**

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** St Mirren Vs Hearts - **Hearts to Win @ 1.83 (Melbet)**

**Write Up:** St Mirren return home still trying to find their rhythm after a run of results that has slowed their momentum. Their performances have lacked attacking sharpness, and recent matches have often drifted without much sustained pressure, which leaves them vulnerable against stronger sides. Hearts arrive with more confidence, built on control and efficiency. Their recent league form shows a team comfortable managing games patiently before taking charge, especially as matches progress.

St Mirren’s recent league form shows clear struggles going forward. A goalless draw with Dundee FC and a 1-1 draw at Livingston offered some stability, but those results came after defeats including a 2-0 loss away to Hearts and 2-0 defeats against Falkirk and Motherwell. Goals have been hard to find, with just one scored across their last four league matches. Defensively, they tend to stay competitive early, but once they fall behind, matches often drift away rather than opening up. Their approach has been cautious, and attacking moves frequently lack support, leaving them dependent on isolated moments instead of sustained pressure.

Hearts head into this fixture as clear favourites. Manager Derek McInnes, appointed in the summer, went unbeaten in his first 12 Scottish Premiership matches in charge, an impressive run that included nine wins and three draws. While there was a small dip in form during November and early December, with three draws and one defeat in four matches, Hearts responded strongly. They bounced back with three consecutive wins, highlighted by crucial victories over Celtic and Rangers.

Hearts will be keen to carry this momentum into the final months of the season and will be looking to repeat their 2-0 win over St Mirren from mid-January. That said, despite their strong campaign overall, Hearts have found trips to St Mirren difficult in recent years, winning just one of their last seven away league meetings with the Saints. While Hearts should still be well placed to win this fixture, it’s an important trend to keep in mind.

Overall, Hearts arrive in better form, with greater control and far more attacking reliability than a St Mirren side still struggling for goals. While past trips to this ground have been tricky, Hearts’ current momentum and quality should give them the edge.

The talent and potential is there. He has hit this in his last 9 of 15. Averaging 11.4 points per game over that time. Heat are tops in the league for pace of play, and the Hawks aren’t too far behind so lots of shooting and potential points. Powell and Jacquez rank as average defenders. Risacher can score cutting in transition, line drives, and catch and shoot. He gets late game minutes so if the game is close, he should still be playing (game is expected to be close with a spread of five). He also has a size advantage over the Heat players that will be guarding him.</td></tr>

Not sure, but they lost their opener to Aurora 2-1, then as MASSIVE favorites, nearly got eliminated by NRG <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> after winning Map 1 13-5, they were down 9-0 at one point map 2 and 7-2 map 3

* 3DMAX won on March 9th 2-1, lost on October 10th 2-1,
* 3DMAX won their map <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> in both h2h matches on Inferno 13-11/13-9

**Projected Veto:**

* 3DMAX perma ban Mirage, Falcons perma ban Overpass
* 3DMAX <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> **Anubis (**or Inferno)

**Anubis Stats:**

* 3DMAX are 100% win rate on 2 maps of Anubis, they beat FUT 16-13, and BC Game 13-4
* Falcons are 0% Win rate on 2 maps of Anubis, they lost to Vitality 13-4, and Aurora 13-7
* 3DMAX on paper would <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> Inferno, and I still think this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> is solid value if they do, however Falcons Inferno has been rapidly improving and imo is one of their better maps now, they are coming off a 11-1 CT side domination against NRG on Inferno and 3DMAX are coming off a loss to Vitality
* Falcons worst map by far is Anubis, most important thing about Anubis, it is the most T sided map in the map pool, you need to be able to win rounds on offense especially on this map, and so far Falcons have been awful at it, with a 29.3% win rate on T side Anubis
* As said in previous writeup, Falcons used to perma ban this map, lack reps on it and both IGL/coach struggle with ideas on it, this map more then any really requires reps/good fundamentals/T sides for executes/taking space on the map which Falcons have really struggled with
* Their were some decently significant map changes, but the map is still Anubis at the end of the day. 3DMAX in 2024 were a very strong/dominant Anubis team, with a 45-28 record in 2024 with 4/5 of the same roster. Bodyy/Lucky have been insanely good on this map, Maka historically loves Anubis and Graviti is having a great tournament,</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>⭐️:🏀SIU Edwardsville +13/Nevada +12 (-148) \[Bet365\]

Start Time &amp; TV 8:30 &amp; 9:00pm EST (ESPN+ &amp; MWN)

Units: 4.5 Units

Reasoning: In this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick of the day</mark> weve got two teams going against familiar foes, opponents they have both faced off against earlier this year and have beaten. SIU Edwardsville defeated Lindenwood in a 66-62 game where they showed the strength of their defense and Nevada manhandled Boise State in a 81-66 victory killing the Broncos in transition. Nevada ranks higher than Boise State in RPI rating, NET rank, and KenPom rating. Nevada has an edge over the Broncos in points allowed per game, three point percentage, three point defense, offensive rebounding, steals, blocks and turnovers allowed per game. I think its also worth noting that Boise State lost to a division two squad that is Hawaii-Pacific earlier this year. SIU Edwardsville has the 13th best ranked defense in terms of points allowed per game and they are coming off another great defensive performance allowing only 46 points in their last contest. They face Lindenwood who has a terrible turnover problem ranking in the bottom 10% of teams in turnovers allowed. Lindenwood hasnt lost a conference game by more than 6 points all year and their only 2 losses by more than 13 came against a Big Ten and Mountain West squad so I think covering 13 points is an easy number for them. I think both of these squads have close games against teams they have already defeated before this year.

Prediction: 68-65 Lindenwood, 77-76 Nevada

Last pick:🏀Lipscomb ML/SEMO ML💩Lipscomb decided to lock in a little too late in that one.

Best of luck to everyone tailing and remember to bet responsibly! I am personally doing a slight ML sprinkle on Nevada as well.🍀💜🐉

__Event:__ NBA: Hawks @ Heat 7:30 EST

__POTD:__ Dyson Daniels over o13.5 rebounds/assists (-110), 3.3u to win 3u

__Write Up:__ Dyson Daniels has averaged 6.6 rebounds per game over his last we games. He has 6+ boards in ALL of his last 10 games at home vs the Eastern Conference. He’s over in 8/10 games without Kristaps Porzingis averaging 7.7 per game. He’s had double digit chances in every single one of those games &amp; when he plays 30+ mins in them he’s over in 8/9 games. He had 9 rebounds earlier this year vs them even with KP playing &amp; having 8 rebounds. The Heat allow the MOST Rebounds to guards this year. Allowing 7.23 to PG’s (Most) &amp; 7.33 to SG’s. Their recent numbers have been just as bad, allowing 15.31 rebounds to PG/SG’s in their last 15 games. Last year when he faced the Heat he averaged 8.5 rebounds, in 4 games he put up 10, 8, 5, &amp; 11. Miami has averaged 116+ points in 4 straight games scoring. They are 2nd in points per game this season (120.0). They average the most points per game in the league at home this year (122.2). They rank #1 in Pace, with an average of 108 possessions per game. In their last 3 they’ve average 111.9, most in the league. Vs an Atlanta team that ranks 4th at 105.8. There should be plenty of rebound chances for Daniels, especially since the Hawks best rebounder Onyeka Okongwu has been ruled out which is huge for Daniels’ rebound total. Okongwu lost a few teeth during Wednesday’s win over the Celtics, as he took a Jaylen Brown elbow to the mouth. After undergoing dental surgery the following day, the Hawks’ center is looking at an extended absence as he recovers. Christian Koloko moved into the starting lineup. Without Okongwu in the lineup, Daniels has gone 4/4 over his rebound total &amp; has had had 13+ rebound chances in all 4 games without Okongwu. Which is HUGE as Daniels is over this line in 15/20 with 13+ chances. The Hawks traded guard Vit Krejci  to the Blaxers for an injured Duop Reath &amp; 2 second rounders. Krejci averaged 2.2 3-pointers made per game on 42.3% shooting, which ranks top 20 in the NBA. This results in more playing time for Daniels. Offensively he’s been off this season but he’s one of the best defenders in the leagues. He averaged a league leading 3 steals per game last year. He pressures opposing ball handlers &amp; has a phenomenal natural instincts jumping passing lanes. He creates chaos in the perimeter. This will be key in an intradivisional matchup vs a Miami team that ranks in the bottom 10 in rebounding rate at home (49.2%). 

The Heat also give up the 5th most assists to PG’s in the NBA this season allowing 9.41 per game.

**Write Up:** Hopefully a few of you guys took Brobbey on 365, as the play hit with sub on play on. Unfortunately officially it is a loss, and we are still in major fade zone guys.

But we&#x27;re back with a play that has done us well many times before. I love this play for all of the same reasons I normally do. Arsenal host Chelsea in the 2nd leg of the Carabao Cup semifinals. Arsenal are up 3-2 on aggregate, meaning they essentially start this game with a 1-0 lead, which is huge for Arsenal and their stingy defense. This will change the dynamic slightly, as Chelsea will need to play more aggressively and try to make up that one goal difference. While I do not believe Arsenal will park the bus with only a 1 goal lead, they will be content giving Chelsea some possession and playing more defensively than normal. 

Enzo has had 1 SOT in both matches he has played vs Arsenal this year - the first leg of this match at home a few weeks ago and in the EPL at home back in November. I can see Palmer getting a rest here after playing the full 90 over the weekend, which may pull Enzo forward into the #10 role. Even if not, I still see him playing far forward and box crashing as usual.

**Write Up:** You know the drill, we&#x27;re fading Barcelona because I simply don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re beating Albacete by 3 or more goals <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. **Albacete stunned Real Madrid** in the previous round and have since seen a big uptick in form, notching up **4 wins in a row.** Yes, they&#x27;re a second division side, but clearly they play some good football and are capable of an upset (or at least not getting blown out).

Barcelona are clearly **deprioritizing the cup** and they looked unconvincing in the previous round, **needing a sweaty 96th minute goal to barely overcome the second tier Racing Santander by 2-0** (after almost conceding from a previous attack). The Guadalajara game in an even earlier round followed much of the same script, with Barca needing two late goals for a measly 2-0 win. Besides that, they also have some **key absences** and are going to be slightly **fatigued** following their packed schedule.

Based on the fact the Barca team is run into the ground, has some key absences, and will likely be rotated for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>&#x27;s match, I expect Albacete to cover the AH. BTTS Yes is also another angle if you&#x27;d want to take that. Make no mistake, Barca are the heavy favorites here and are most likely going to progress, I just can&#x27;t see them dismantling their opponent.

Last POTD: 🏀 UNC -5.5 alt spread + Charleston Southern -9.5 alt spread (-135) 💰

Writeup: Charleston Southern game postponed and UNC wins by their normal spread.  My odds dropped to -274 after the voided leg but hey a win is still a win.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: 🏀 Xavier +23.5 alt spread + SDSU -4.5 alt spread (-130). 

Game 1 starts at 7pm EST. Bet 2.5u

Writeup: Going against the public as I believe Xavier can cover their normal spread. Love rooting for UConn but they have not been themselves as of late. UConn’s 25th ranked offense should feel pretty comfortable against Xavier’s 85th ranked defense. The defense may be able to generate some turnovers, but Xavier is not the best at scoring on 2nd chance opportunities. Still, I think Xavier’s ability to cover will come from their offense without transition against UConn’s defense. UConn will have the rebounding advantage, but beyond this, I see it as being a pretty equal battle. Xavier does a great job limiting turnovers on offense, and they should find some success shooting from mid range. Our biggest driver here is a similar process as our Providence bet against UConn - these teams have opposing playing styles with Xavier being the more up tempo team, the more consistent team, the team with more momentum, and the team far better as an away team vs UConn as a home team. I still don’t feel comfortable taking UConn as a massive home favorite yet, so give me Xavier to keep it within 24.

SDSU should be able to handle Wyoming well. They are the better team on every part of the court beyond defensive rebounding. SDSU is borderline top 10 in defensive efficiency, whereas Wyoming is well outside the top 100 on offense. I also expect turnovers to be generated for SDSU, who are also a top 50 team in transition offense. Wyoming likes to shoot from the inside, but SDSU is softer on the outside. There are a lot of little things here that simply add up to SDSU being too much for Wyoming to handle. The 2 key things for me here are that SDSU should find good success on defense, and that SDSU is playing some of the best ball in the country relative to any other team’s average play. These teams do have opposite play styles, but neither side is on the extreme. SDSU should take care of business and win by 5.

ARSENAL VS CHELSEA

Date: 03 FEBRUARY 2026 at 21:00

BET ON: Over / Under Team corners- CHELSEA Over +3.50

Odd: 1.83



\- Chelsea’s pursuit of Over 3.50 corners is supported by both tactical setup and contextual game incentives in this crucial cup tie. Trailing 3–2 on aggregate forces Liam Rosenior to adopt proactive attacking intent from kickoff — he’s openly acknowledged the difficulty of overturning Arsenal’s lead, but insists his side will go “as deep as we can” and bring intensity and urgency to the Emirates. With one goal needed just to level the tie and two to lead outright, Chelsea are highly likely to press high, push full-backs up and attack in waves down the wings, naturally generating corners as they attempt to stretch Arsenal’s defense. Many of Rosenior’s recent games under this framework have seen multiple corners, and his side’s willingness to play on the front foot even when behind bodes well for over corner output.

\- On the injury front, Chelsea’s offensive unit — including dynamic wide players like Garnacho and Neto — remain available and motivated to exploit transitions, while Arsenal’s slight defensive rotation due to knocks and squad demands may blunt their ability to defend wide pressure as robustly as usual. Opposed to that, Arteta’s Arsenal are expected to cautiously manage the game, controlling possession and avoiding excessive risk as they protect their aggregate advantage — a setup that often concedes territory to opponents and results in defensive blocks and repeated attacks from wide areas. In sum, Chelsea’s need to attack from the start, Rosenior’s encouraging attacking intent and tactical emphasis on width and high positions, plus the likelihood of Arsenal sitting deeper with less aggressive pressing, create conditions highly conducive to Chelsea winning four or more corners.</td></tr>

Soccer | Argentina Liga Profesional | 21:15 (GMT-3) - Tuesday, Feb 3rd

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Independiente Rivadavia ML @ 1.90 - 2U

Write Up: We are on a 2-win streak. After that clean 3-1 from Gimnasia, we’re finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.

Note on Timing: For those in the US/Europe, this match kicks off late Tuesday night in Argentina (21:15 local time), but it shows up as Wednesday GMT. Don’t get confused.

We’re heading to Mendoza. Independiente Rivadavia has been doing things right lately. They’ve built a solid identity at home, playing with a high-pressure style that usually suffocates visitors. They’re not world-beaters, but they are disciplined and tough to crack in front of their fans.

On the other hand, Sarmiento is a frequent inhabitant of the bottom of the table. Their away record is consistently poor, often traveling just to park the bus and hope for a 0-0. Given Independiente&#x27;s current form and home advantage, 1.90 is a very solid price. I don&#x27;t expect a blowout, but the home side should have more than enough to take the 3 points. 2 units to get us back into positive territory.

Tuesday’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> - Pistons -4.5 -115 (1.15u to win 1u)

A lot of people seem to be going towards the Nuggets here on the road with Jokic back in play. However, I’m still skeptical that we will get a full dose of Jokic, especially with this being the first game of a back to back (they play the Knicks on Wednesday). 

A week ago, these teams played each other and Detroit won on the road by 2 points despite shooting 6-31 from three. Their best 3 point shooter Duncan Robinson shot 0-8 from 3 in that game and he historically shoots much better at home. 

The combo of the Pistons being at home, not having to deal with a back to back, and having just beat this (albeit minus Joker) gives me confidence they can cover that number.

**Write Up:** I was heavily invested in CLEVOR TREVER last start and on face value I thought he was quite disappointing, getting rolled at $1.85 after seemingly having every chance. That “disappointing” run has been turned on its head with the winner, ASAKURA, looking like one out of the box with an almost 3 length romp in its next start over some quality city gallopers. To frank the form even further, the 3rd place getter LOUD CHARLIE has come out a won a metro maiden by a lengthy, so the run was definitely not disappointing.     
      
We get a great set up here drawing barrier 4, and there’s a bit of natural pace engaged, so we should be one or two pairs back on the outside. A mid prep trial over 900m has kept us ticking along and it was a nice piece of work under no pressure. The step up to 1300m also is a plus, as I think this horse is a more gradual type than a sit sprinter.     
      
The second favourite BEAST FIGHTER has drawn barrier 1 however I think that’s absolutely awful for this horse. In both its trials it’s completely bombed the start, and from barrier 1 that just spells disaster. Being barrier 1, it’ll be loaded first and I’m prepared to completely pen his chances. ZEPHYR ZONG was a good run in town, but I reckon we could have the perch on it, and I trust our form a lot more.

I do feel like this value is good, since Bristol Rovers are not in the same quality level here. It&#x27;s basically a team battling from relegation vs a team fighting for promotion to League One. Walsall have been out of form, and therefore the higher odds. On the side note, they should be capable of winning this game or even having a two goal lead here. I do like the half time odds though. That means the second half won&#x27;t have any matter for us. Our aim is always long term here and I will continue to look for high odds. But anything can happen in football and good luck everyone.

‎**Units** : 1U to win 1.02U

‎**Writeup** :

‎let&#x27;s talk Constantine vs Mostaganem real quick , this one&#x27;s screaming under 2.5 goals to me, and here&#x27;s why I&#x27;m pretty confident putting some units on it. First off, look at their head-to-head lately. These two don&#x27;t exactly light up the scoreboard when they meet. Recent games have been super low-scoring:


‎One ended 2-0 . Then straight 0-0 draws in both directions like 0-0 at Constantine and another 0-0. **Average goals in their direct matches? Around 0.67 to maybe 1-1.5 per game across the last few**. Basically, they&#x27;ve played out a bunch of cagey, low-event football. Draws and clean sheets are the norm, not fireworks.


‎On top of that, check the recent form for both sides. Constantine&#x27;s been solid at home but not banging in goals their last bunch of games have a ton of unders, like **5 out of 6 or more staying under 2.5**. They keep things tight defensively, especially against teams that aren&#x27;t flying.


‎Mostaganem? They&#x27;re struggling big time bottom half of the table, poor away record ***(0 wins in their last 8 road games or close to it)***, and they&#x27;ve been involved in low-goal slogs too. Their attack is blunt on the road, they don&#x27;t create much, and they concede without conceding a ton either. **Lots of 0-0s, 1-0s, 1-1s in their recent meetings**.

‎For Al Khalidiya Head-to-head is straight up domination for them. **They&#x27;ve played 13 times recently, and Al Khalidiya has won 9 of them, with Al Hala scraping just 1 win and a few draws**. More importantly, in those matches, **Khalidiya averages 2.3-2.6 goals per game against them** that&#x27;s not fluke stuff. They&#x27;ve dropped bags like 6-2 in one recent one, and even in tighter games, they usually find 2+. Check the scores: ***plenty of 2-0s, 3-0s, 4-0s from Khalidiya in past meetings***. Al Hala just can&#x27;t handle them their defense leaks when facing this side. Khalidiya racks up the shots and finishes, while Al Hala parks it but still gets picked apart.





‎Lets Get back to winning ways !!

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Jay Dylan Hara Friend vs Raphael Perot | **Friend ML at -140 (FD). 1 unit.** 

Write-up: Ended up being a solid <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, though I wish I had just gone with Mannarino 2-0. 

Here, we have a matchup where I don’t think the opening line makes a lot of sense. Jay Friend is one of the top college players in the country, but he also established himself on the pro tour last year with a title run from qualifying at the Fairfield Challenger. He had a solid outing at the ITF Winston-Salem a couple weeks, eventually losing to Mitsui in the third round, but he’s also been playing well in college duals, defeating World. No 488 Edward Winter in straight sets. 

In comparison, Perot was also a college player who graduated from Texas A&amp;M a couple years ago and has plenty of experience in American hard courts. However, I don’t see him in the same tier of ability as Friend, and he has started the season with three losses in winnable matches against Smith, Rottgering, and Dostanic. Looking at how these players have been priced, Friend was a -175 favorite against Mitsui, but Keegan Smith was actually around the same price against Perot, and a very slight dog against Mitsui. These odds don’t quite match up, and I think Friend should be a bigger favorite in this one. Perot is a solid grinder, but Friend has the serve and attacking game to take over this matchup on indoor courts.</td></tr>

Last Pick: Team Spirit 2-0 + Team Yandex ML ❌

Sport: eSports | Dota 2

Event: BLAST Slam | OG vs. Team Liquid

Time: 6:00 AM EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: OG ML @ 2.21 odds (5u)

Write Up:

Man, that last parlay was brutal. Spirit did their job but Yandex fell apart completely. Time to bounce back with new Dota tournament.

We’re fading Team Liquid here. I know Liquid is the better team on paper, but have you seen them lately? They looked absolutely lost in the Fissure and ESL Birmingham qualifiers a couple of weeks ago. They seem shaky rn and definitely not in top form.

On the other side, we’ve got this new look OG squad. With the SEA boys like Yopaj and Natsumi, they play that hyper-aggressive, chaotic style that is perfect for a Best of 1. In a BO1 group stage match, I’ll take the unpredictable, aggressive underdog over a slumping favorite every time. Liquid tends to start tournaments slow, and if OG runs at them early, this could be over fast.


BOL.

**Details: Albacete VS Barcelona - Spain Copa del Rey -3:00 PM EST**

**---**

**Lower than I&#x27;d like but Honestly just surprised there is any value at all on this line considering the difference in quality between these sides + previous rounds.**

**---**

Albacete are a league lower than Barcelona (Laliga 2) and will look to replicate the same gameplan that saw them knock out Real Madrid in the Round of 16. Fortunately for us that gameplan saw Real Madrid get 11 corners total and I expect Barca to cover us.

* **Barcelona** are ranked **#1/20 in La Liga for corners awarded with an average of 7.1 per game,** now facing lower opposition I expect average at the least
* Last Cup round Barcelona faced the best team in the La Liga 2 and still managed to put up **10 corners in the game. The round before they managed 9 corners against Guadalajara**
* **Albacete** in La Liga 2 are **ranked 4th highest for corners conceded per game at 5.2 corners per game.**
* Albacete miraculously managed to knock out Real Madrid in the previous round and **Madrid still manage to put up 11 corners against them**

**---**

**Expecting Barcelona to avoid falling under the same hand as Real Madrid and go for the kill early, Albacete will have the confidence in their structure and won&#x27;t mind conceding corners considering 11 did nothing to save Madrid.**

**Special thank you for the coffee and beers, cant express how much they help keep these coming!**

<tr><td class='post'>AC Milan @ 2.43 - €500.00 (Unibet) // Serie A Football

Last 5 &gt; LWWLW // Profit: €4,198.04

Staying in Serie A, mybad for the loss… should’ve never trusted Roma at all. I want to blacklist Serie A from all my future bets if this loses, but I am confident in <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>’s.

In <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>’s matchup we have a Bologna side who are in bad form, in their last 10 games they have been 1-3-6. At home they are 0-1-4 in their last 5. Milan is on the other end, they are 2nd in the Serie A as away team and currently still unbeaten (6-5-0). In their last 5 their form was WWDWD. 

Milan have a decent H2H (5-3-2) against Bologna, but it pops up more at the stadium of their opponents. At Bologna, Milan are 13-5-1 as a traveling team, with the only loss the most recent one. In the managerial H2H Allegri is 7-1-1 against Vincenzo.

Also to note, Bologna are missing their main GK due to red card. For Milan Pulisic and Saelemaekers are out, I reckon some good long shots from Rabiot should do it.</td></tr>

**Last:** (CBB) Kansas +4.5 (1.5u) - ✅

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** (CBB) Indiana ML at USC

**Start Time:** 10:00 PM ET (Peacock)

**Odds:** +105 (Caesars)

**Units:** 1.5U

**Reasoning:** Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in.

It’s a Godfather quote that jumps top of mind when it comes to betting on Indiana basketball. That’s because after appearing all but dead in the water following a four-game skid, the team has responded by winning each of its next three contests. That includes an impressive 72-67 victory over then-No. 12 Purdue last Tuesday night. 

Still, I can understand the hesitancy to trust a Hoosiers (14-7) squad that is just 2-6 against Quad 1 opponents. 

While the shortcomings against quality opponents is most definitely concerning, a closer look at the matchup against USC provides quite a bit of optimism. Through 22 games, the Trojans (16-6) rank just 130th in offensive efficiency (1.078) and 97th in defensive efficiency (1.017). Now consider this: in 12 games against opponents ranked outside of the Top 100 in offensive efficiency, the Indiana defense concedes an average of 62.8 points on a  porous 37.4% shooting (26.6% from beyond the arc). Furthermore, the unit held 11 of those opponents to 42% shooting or less while limiting all but three to 33% or less from the perimeter. Not to mention, the Hoosiers were 11-1 in those contests, with each win coming by eight or more points and all but one by 17+. 

The same improvement can be seen on the other end of the floor.

While the Indiana offense has been pretty good overall—37th in offensive efficiency (1.156), 57th in scoring (81.5 PPG), 68th in field-goal percentage (47.0%) and 85th in three-point shooting (35.7%)—the unit takes it to another level against poor competition. In 12 games against opponents who rank outside of the Top 75 in defensive efficiency, the Hoosiers have averaged 88.8 points on a blistering 51.1% shooting from the field (39.2% from beyond the arc). While Lamar Wilkerson (19.4 PPG) and Tucker DeVries (14.3 PPG) should once again pace the team, its been the recent play of junior Nick Dorn (9.7 PPG) that has been played a major role in Indiana’s recent run of success—20.2 points per game over his last four games. They should have no issue penetrating a USC defense that hasn’t held an opponent under 69 points since Dec. 14. 

Turnovers should prove to be the difference in this one.

On the year, neither team has made a habit of forcing opponents into mistakes, with the Trojans ranking 135th in turnovers forced (12.3 per game), 180th in turnovers forced per possession (16.5%) and 240th in steals (6.0) while the Hoosiers enter ranked 239th in turnovers forced (11.0), 243rd in turnovers forced per possession (15.7%) and 312th in steals (5.4). However, while Indiana has done a great job playing clean basketball on the offensive end—56th in turnovers per possession (14.7%), 57th in opponent steals (5.7) and 58th in turnovers (10.4)—the same can’t be said about USC, which ranks 200th in turnovers per possession (17.0%), 265th in opponent steals (7.2), 268th in turnovers (12.7). If the Hoosiers can take advantage here, that could very well be the X factor.

Keep the points, trust Indiana to win this one outright.

Trabzonspor vs Fethiyespor, over 3.5 goals @ 2

Trabzonspor are Turkey’s top-flight side with attacking quality capable of producing multiple goals, especially at home, and they’ve shown they can score freely in cup competition. Fethiyespor have also been involved in matches with multiple goals recently, particularly away from home. Historical goal averages in the cup and recent attacking performances from both teams suggest this fixture has the potential to be open and high-scoring, making Over 3.5 goals a possibility worth considering.</td></tr>

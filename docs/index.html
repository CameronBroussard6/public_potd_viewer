<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>⭐️:🏈🏀Louisville -2.5/UCF ML (-146) \[Fanatics\]

Start Time &amp; TV: 2:00pm EST (ESPN)

Units: 4 Units

Reasoning: Going with a cross sport two legger with the Louisville Cardinals (8-4) taking on the Toledo Rockets (8-4) in the Boca Raton bowl and the UCF Knights (10-1) taking on the Florida Atlantic Owls (8-4) in a neutral site basketball game. I really like riding with the Louisville Cardinals as they have looked really solid this year with some impressive wins as they have beaten two college football playoff teams as they have beaten James Madison 28-14 and pulled off a very impressive road win against Miami 24-21. They have one common opponent with the Toledo Rockets as both of these teams have faced off against the Kentucky Wildcats and the outcome of those two games were vastly different. When the Rockets played Kentucky they lost to the Wildcats 16-24 but when the Cardinals played them they defeated Kentucky 41-0. This Cardinals team is much different than this Rockets team as this squad out of the ACC is faster, stronger and more talented than this squad out of the MAC. A huge key factor as well in this one is that Toledo will be playing without head coach Jason Candle who took the UConn job and without starting quarterback Tucker Gleason who is out with a back injury. I also really like going with the UCF Knights as I think they should easily handle the FAU Owls in this one. UCF has put together some very impressive wins as they have a quad 1 win against Texas A&amp;M in a 86-74 win, a solid win against Pittsburgh and they are undefeated against quad 3 and 4 teams this year. Their only loss comes to nationally ranked Vanderbilt and I actually thought they played very well in that games putting up 93 points and outscoring the Commanders in the second half. The Knights have one common opponent as the Owls as both of these teams played FGCU as the Knights defeated the Eagles 102-80 and the Owls defeated the Eagles 81-76. The Knights lead the Eagles in points per game, field goal percentage, free throw percentage, offensive rebounds and defensive rebounds so I like rolling with the Knights in this one.

Prediction: 27-17 Louisville, 82-72 UCF

Last pick: 🏈Texas A&amp;M -2.5💩Defense played great but Marcel Reed played his worst and most inaccurate game of his career.

Best of luck to everyone tailing and remember to bet responsibly! Lets keep our 4u+ play streak up havent lost a play at this confidence level in a couple months! But remember this means 4u not 40! Lets have ourselves a Tuesday!!

ELC: Arsenal - Crystal Palace

WDW Arsenal &amp; o1.5 (-120) 1u

I certainly didn’t expect to twice be betting on the old “Carling Cup” as it was called when I was a kid, but times have changed and pretty much every trophy means something these days. As a result, we delve into the quarter final of the competition as Premier League leaders Arsenal host fellow Londoners Crystal Palace.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s selection leans heavy on the goal scoring trends between &amp; aside these teams share. As usual I like to get the *roadblock* out of the way: last time Arsenal played Palace, it was a grinding, evenly matched 1-0 Arsenal result. Neither team found much attacking flow.

Makes no sense to bet on this, right? Well, there’s good trends: Goals galore. Palace have **cleared 2.5 goals 5/5**, meanwhile Arsenal **clear the requisite 1.5 in 11/12** - they alone have **scored 2 goals in 8/9** home matches. 

Recent history is kind to this line as well, with Arsenal winning **7/10** matches between these two, and the **1.5 total clearing in 8 of their last 9**. Basically, I’m not saying we are gonna see a wild 4-3 match by any means, but a 2-0 or 2-1 Arsenal match is in my vision.

Fun fact: I forgot yesterdays fun fact, so here is 3: My brother is a huge Arsenal supporter, and only 13 km separates these two clubs, closer than the Yankees &amp; Mets, 

Last play review:

NBA - Utah @ Denver, Svi Mykhailiuk o1.5 3PM (-108) 1u ✅

(All I can say is sweat free, FULL of perspiration. Worst basketball I’ve ever seen, and I once coached U14 girls basketball guys - this was that, maybe worse. For Svi, maybe the worst 5 minutes of basketball he played all season to start the game. Then he sat on the bench for almost the entire half. 43-15 Denver at the end of the first quarter, Svi 5 min, 0-3, pine. Flashbacks of Hendo last night. I can hear my grandfather laughing at my pain.

Then he re enters, and snipes the 2 before halftime… gambling)

Event: Nigeria vs Tanzania @ 12:30pm (EST)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Nigeria ML = 1.95u at -195

Write Up: AFCON is here. Some of the best times to find great lines is during international soccer tournaments. AFCON, being the soccer tournament for African nations provides great spots to make money. Although <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> was not the first day of the tournament, it is the first day where I have found a line I like. Nigeria come into the match not playing up to their full potential. World Cup qualifying presented its struggles, but I feel that a full strength Nigerian team will still be able to handle Tanzania. I cap this line around -250 range so when I saw the line had not yet reached -200 I knew I had to play. Normally, I would look to play a spread here , but do to Nigeria struggling I could see a 1-0 win as the score line, which would still cash with the ML. The line is a bit chalky, but there is still value as Nigeria should cruise to an easy victory early in AFCON.

  
Overall: Again like I said almost everything will be played to win 1u. I will never be laying 5 units hammers and anyone who is consistently laying 5 units should really increase their unit size. Bankroll management is a key part of being profitable in sports betting, and if you are laying 5 units every play, you are not betting responsibly (or you just need to increase your unit size). Also the laying 5 units a play thing is misleading to people who tail and to people who are new to the space. 

If you would like to chat more about my play or my analysis comment below or just send me a dm. I enjoy talking with people about other potential plays as well, even if they may go against one of my plays. More opinions and breakdowns lead to sharper bets. 

Bet responsibly.</td></tr>

Event: Miami Heat vs Toronto Raptors, 7:30 PM EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Heat -4.5 at 1.91 odds (-110), 2 units to win 1.82 units

Write up:  
The Heat are generally inconsistent mostly due to Spo getting more than most from a roster without as much talent, this generally makes pockets in the season where they are undervalued. I believe this is one of them. 

Toronto has scored just 177 points in their last two games (88.5 PPG), including a humiliating 81-point output against the 7-19 Nets, and ranks 29th in three-point shooting at 31.1% while missing RJ Barrett. Miami is 10-4 at home and leads the NBA in pace (104.25), which they&#x27;ll use to expose Toronto&#x27;s sluggish offense that plays at 99.58 pace. Even without Herro and Jovic, Miami still has Norman Powell, Bam Adebayo (18.3 PPG, 9.4 REB), and Jaime Jaquez Jr. providing efficient scoring. Miami commits the 3rd-fewest turnovers in the league and sends opponents to the free throw line less than anyone, while Toronto&#x27;s only real advantage is offensive rebounding against Miami&#x27;s 25th-ranked defensive rebounding. The Heat will push tempo at home, force Toronto into a track meet they can&#x27;t win, and cover the 4.5 points comfortably.</td></tr>

**NBA Chicago Bulls vs Atlanta Hawks**

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Jalen Johnson over 25.5 points @ 1.90 odds (1 unit)

**Write Up:** Quite simple really. Two teams with woeful defense and leaking points like it&#x27;s already Christmas. Tomorrow&#x27;s line is set at a high 253.5 with -4.5 to the Hawks and the last game between two of them a yesterday hit a sky high 302 without OT.

Since Nov 14, Johnson has seen 30+ minutes every single game and has averaged 35.5 minutes for the season. He averages 27.7 points over the last 10 games, and 36 points against Bulls yesterday.

Minutes are secured and is expected to rain points. Johnson over 25.5 points.</td></tr>

Odds: -140 on FanDuel
Wager: 2 units

NHL. Penguins at Maple Leafs, 4 pm ET 12/23/25

Record: 7-9
Net Units: -5.4 Units

Explanation: Toronto can beat Pittsburgh tomorrow because their most repeatable edge in this matchup is usually offensive ceiling + special-teams leverage, and those are exactly the things that tend to decide NHL games that aren’t perfect 60-minute efforts. 

The Leafs’ roster construction is typically built around high end finishing and power-play conversion, which matters a ton against a Penguins team that has been more vulnerable when games turn into track meets or when they’re forced to defend multiple areas for long stretches. 

If Toronto can get more shot attempts, more inner-slot chances, fewer odd-man rushes against—they put Pittsburgh in a spot where the Pens have to keep up offensively, and that’s where Toronto’s depth scoring and top-line star power can separate. 
Toronto needs to start fast, get Pittsburgh chasing the game (which increases defensive risk), stay disciplined enough to avoid giving the Pens repeated power plays, and then let Toronto’s own power play be the difference if whistles happen. Add in that goaltending volatility often swings this specific matchup—Toronto doesn’t need 40 saves if they control the slot and limit second chances—so if the Leafs get even league-average goaltending while generating the higher-quality looks, they’re in a strong position to win.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Bulls +4.5 (-115 on DK); 4 units

The books are giving us the same line at nearly the same odds as they did for this matchup two days ago. Perhaps it&#x27;s stubbornness, inertia, or arrogance, but they seem to be daring me to go double or nothing. I will oblige.

I made this same <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> two days ago for this same matchup, so I am repeating much of my reasoning below for comprehensiveness, but now with updated stats.

Here we have an almost perfect storm of ATS records.

The Hawks are now 4-9 ATS at home, 5-10 ATS as the favorite, and **0-6 ATS as the home favorite**.

The Bulls are now 11-3 ATS as underdogs, and 6-2 ATS as road underdogs.

The Bulls have now won both of their prior matchups outright against the Hawks, despite being 2.5-point (in Chicago) and 4.5-point (in Atlanta) underdogs. Both matchups included Trae Young and he is expected to play in <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>&#x27;s game as well.

Trae is a great player and had a strong game against the Bulls last time but it wasn&#x27;t enough. He is a liability on defense and can&#x27;t do anything against 6&#x27;8&quot; Giddey who can get to the rim ~~out~~ at will, drawing doubles and initiating endless drive-and-kick plays. Trae is also useless in transition defense and the Bulls are doing really well on fastbreaks, especially with the return of Ayo Dosunmu.

If you are concerned about the Bulls&#x27; ability to beat the same team twice in a row in a &quot;baseball series,&quot; rest assured that (1) they don&#x27;t have to win, only cover a +4.5-point spread, and (2) they accomplished that very feat against the Cavs just last week.

There is no better ATS fade than the Hawks as home favorites, and the Bulls make it even more appealing. Obviously anything can happen but the evidence points overwhelmingly at this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>.

Last Pick: Los Angeles Lakers -8.5 vs Utah Jazz @ 1.93. 3U. ❌

Busy last few weeks, I wasn’t able to make much time for researching picks. Back now, let&#x27;s get some wins.

 

Next <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **Toronto Raptors vs Miami Heat -4.0 @ 1.91**. 3U play.

Both these teams have looked mediocre recently, but the Raptors missing both RJ and Poeltl is much more significant for the Raptors. The Heat will be at home here, and Kel’el and Norm continue to look really good, so with the supporting cast of Wiggins, Bam and Davion, I am confident they can stifle the Raptors’ middling offense. In terms of recent form, the Raptors just got destroyed by the Brooklyn Nets, and had lost to the Cs by double digits prior to that. They&#x27;ve won only 3 of their last 10 (and only 2/L10 ATS). The Heat haven&#x27;t been much better but put up much better fights in their last couple games against the Knicks and Cs.

<tr><td class='post'>**POTD Record:** 5-11-3 *We come out empty-handed once again. In an unlucky turn of events, Levadiakos did what was expected of them and comfortably saw off a convincing 2-0 win against the lowly Panserraikos; sadly, though, Bologna let us down and played like they&#x27;d never seen a ball before. Despite all that, I&#x27;m determined to make it out of this slump, and I&#x27;ve (perhaps rather ambitiously) eyed up just the perfect event to help me achieve this goal - the AFCON*

**Event:** AFCON, DR Congo v Benin, 7:30 am EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Benin Win or Draw +110, 2 units

**Write Up:** The beloved AFCON is an unpredictable tournament with historically tight matches, and that is exactly why I&#x27;m backing Benin to cause a minor upset in <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>&#x27;s outing. DR Congo enter this matchup as slight favorites, boasting stronger recent results, a deeper squad, and a greater tournament pedigree. However, football matches are never played on paper, and that is especially true when it comes to the AFCON, where things constantly refuse to follow the script. Let me emphasize that Benin are far from a pushover. They finished **level on points with Nigeria** in their World Cup qualifying group and **just a point off the eventual group winners, South Africa**, proving **they can sustain a competitive streak against highly ranked African nations** (not to mention their group was slightly tougher than that of the DR Congo). What&#x27;s worth noting is that Zimbabwe finished bottom of Benin&#x27;s group on measly 5 points and a goal difference of -7 (compared to Benin&#x27;s 3rd place finish on 17 pts and a GD of +1), yet held their own against Egypt, so why couldn&#x27;t Benin go a step further and snatch a point off their opponents? *I certainly don&#x27;t see a reason not to take this value bet at the juicy + odds that cover not one, but two outcomes.* As for their key players, amid some absences, **Jodel Dossu is likely to lead the attack with creativity,** while **Rodrigue Kossi and Sessi D&#x27;Almeida fulfill the central midfielder roles,** serving as an **outlet for build-up and transition** (key **Benin strength**). The DR Congo players are expected to control the match flow and tempo, but I can absolutely see Benin sustain any and all pressure being thrown their way, while **killing them off with quick transitions.** Their **form looks good** too (they even **pushed Morocco** all the way in a recent friendly), so I can&#x27;t see why they wouldn&#x27;t give the DR Congo a serious run for their money. Trying to save one&#x27;s record in AFCON of all places is always a challenging task, but one I&#x27;m certainly up for, and I expect a cheeky point (or more) to finally break out of this massive, unexpected downtrend.

Something has to give here. Detroit’s goalie John Gibson has won 7 straight starts and has a .920 save percentage in the last month. 

So why am I picking Dallas? Well they’ve won 4 in a row, 8 of their last 10, and Oettinger, who I think is going to go tomorrow, has a .923 save percentage in the last month. 

As far as comparing the two teams, Dallas impresses me a little more than Detroit. Dallas has a ton of firepower and Detroit can give up goals, whereas Dallas is a little more sound defensively. Dallas is 13-2-4 in road games this season while Detroit is 11-7-1 at home.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Scandicci (W) vs Cuneo (W) 1.1 units to win 1U @1.90 (Bet365)

Write-up: Well that was awful and I’m not touching this sport again. Ended in a five set win for Osadchyi featuring 92 points. Not saying whatsoever this was the case here but it does seem a bit too easy to throw a game here and there considering how short the matches are and how many they play so I’d rather not take the risk again. Quality was pretty average as well, I’m not a fan of you Setka Cup.

This is a play that is very strong statistically across all fronts that will somehow find a way to lose and I’ll be questioning my life choices. Regardless when I see the stats I simply cannot ignore it whatsoever, no matter the outcome that I don’t control. I would stake a lot more units on this but keeping it disciplined until the new year where in 2026 we’ll be hoping for big things. 15 games into the season and Scandicci are in second spot whilst Cuneo are 10th (out of 14). So this isn’t even a case of a fully dominant team top of the league playing against some dead-beat rock bottom side like this line would suggest. This corresponds roughly to their standings last year where the home team finished third and the away side 11th. Scandicci have gone over the line in 13 of their last 14 home league matches (93%). Meanwhile, Cuneo have cleared in their last 22/23 away league matches (96%). Statistically + logically, this is arguably the best play I’ve put out and I struggle to find why the line is set so low. To be fair the reverse fixture in October lost by 0.5 but not for the reason you might think of - Cuneo actually won 3-0 which is simply anomalous (odds are @41.00 for it). Looking past this, the line has been covered in 12/14 (86%) H2H league matches, including the last 9/10 (90%). BOL !

**League - Carabao Cup**

**Game: Arsenal vs Crystal Palace**

**Time: 3:00 PM EST**

**---**

Looking to bounce back and were looking at the last Carabao cup semi final <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.

Arsenal have been under some scrutiny in front of goal recently, and I see them setting things right tomorrow. Don&#x27;t see too much rotation tomorrow either, as Arteta has set the precedent of taking all competitions seriously this season.

Palace are coming off a 4-1 loss to Leeds and will set up a lot better structurally <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, but i see Arsenal closing this out in 90 minutes. Palace are now 3 games without a win and have conceded Over 1.5 goals in all 3 games. Watching them concede 4 goals and 20 shots to this Leeds side really sets a good stand for this game.

Arsenal has played 12 home games this season and covered this line in 10 out of 12 of those games. Keep in mind this includes a 1-0 win against Palace but I expect a better performance in front of goal tomorrow.

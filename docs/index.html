Coventry City @ 2.34 - €100.00

One of Frank Lampard’s biggest hurdles this season. 1^(st) placed Coventry will take on Ipswich who are 3^(rd) themselves. There is a huge contrast between home and away form for both sides.

At home Coventry are yet to be beaten and are #1 ranked with a 9-2-0 record. They also tally for the best goal diff with a 27:7. Of their last 5 home games they have won all of them. Ipswich though are 12^(th) as away side with a 3-4-4 record, they have a 16:13 goal diff. Ipswich have only won 1 game from their last 5 road trips where they lost 2 and drawn 2.

Now for H2H it does not look convincing for tonights’. Kieran is 2-0-0 against Lampard and in the last 10 games Ipswich are 6-2-2. Even with these stats, Coventry are heavily overperforming this season which makes me lean towards them for tonight.

2-1 Coventry</td></tr>

It assigns ELO ratings to players and projects a win chance based on the combined ELO ratings of the players on each team. TeamReddit is projecting a 62% win chance here which creates value here on the ML.</td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>

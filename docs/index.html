We are 5-0 on blocks props this season. Let&#x27;s see if we can get to 6-0.

This line being at 0.5 is pretty wild. Zubac has cashed in L9/9 vs Warriors including a 5 block game last season.

Zubac has cashed in L5/6 as well, only not covering in an 11 minute game. He&#x27;s averaging in that span 1.2 blocks per game.

Warriors are ranked 16th in allowing blocks to Centers. In the past week, they&#x27;ve given up 4 blocks to Chet, 3 blocks to Claxton, and 2 blocks to Filipowski.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Stephen F. Austin +10.5 (-114) 1u

Write Up: Cashed an easy W yesterday halfway through the first quarter, only regret was not betting more! However, profit is profit, and now we move on to try to keep this streak going.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> going with Stephen F. Austin at +10.5 against McNeese. Line hasn&#x27;t moved between last night and tonight, however SFA is 4-1 ATS in their last 5 games on the road. Public Bet right now is leaning 51% SFA to cover and public money sitting at 41%. Both teams are in the top 50 when it comes to their defense, holding opponents to roughly 40% FG %. SFA has the edge when it comes to rebounding (+3.6 RPG) and 3PT % (+3.6%) which gives me comfort that while they may not win, the should be able to hang in on a relatively low scoring game.

The only concern I have is McNeese&#x27;s ability to capitalize at the free throw line, but if we get into a late game fouling party, it should be because the game is close and hopeful it won&#x27;t push us beyond the 10.5 point spread.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: (NBA) Atlanta Hawks +6.5 vs Toronto Raptors (-180) (7:30 PM EST)**

Reasoning: Liking the Trae Youngless, Atlanta Hawks tonight on the road. Here’s why: First off, I think it’s no secret that the Hawks are a much better team without Trae Young in the lineup (15-12 w/o young, 2-8 w young). Secondly, the Hawks are strong ATS especially on the road. Atlanta are 12-8 ATS on the road and 11-5 ATS when undergirds of 3.5 points or more. The Raptors, on the other hand have a 11-8 record at home this season but are just 5-9 ATS when favored at home. Yes, these two teams just played each other with the Raptors winning by 17 however Hawks are in a revenge spot and it’s not easy to sweep a team during the season. Expecting this to be a much tighter game. Line movement has also favored Atlanta so with all that in mind, let’s expect Atlanta to cover the 6.5 points as underdogs tonight.

Last POTD: Andrew Nembhard O25.5 PA -112 1U ✅

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: **Charleston -1.5 -120 (FanDuel) 1U**

Event: CBB | William &amp; Mary (7 pm EST) | 🏀

*Recap: Nembhard had a terrible shooting start, but dished five assists in the first quarter alone. He had 25 PA by the end of the third and finished with 31 PA for the game - 20 points, 11 assists. It&#x27;s crazy how much easier it is for opposing point guards when Suggs and his neck band aren&#x27;t out there.*

I&#x27;ll play Devil&#x27;s Advocate right away. William &amp; Mary is the top team in the country against the spread, where they are 11-1. They are beating Vegas&#x27; lines by an average of more than 8 points per game. Cool. Here&#x27;s why Charleston is covering tonight. The Cougars are finally healthy. Half of Charleston&#x27;s six losses came in their first five games, and they were 2-3 without Bradley transfer Connor Hickman in the lineup. He&#x27;s been back and averaging 33.1 minutes and 12.5 points per game since his return. He&#x27;s no longer ramping up, and his presence in the backcourt has stabilized the thing that hurt Charleston the most early on: turnovers. The Cougars also have Colby Duggan back. The Campbell transfer was an expected starter at the beginning of the season, and he&#x27;ll be playing his third game of the year tonight. In his other two, he&#x27;s averaged 8.5 points in 26 minutes. In getting healthy, Charleston has won five in a row entering tonight&#x27;s battle for a share of the lead in the Coastal Athletic Conference.

William and Mary will want to run and pass and pass and run and ...you get the idea. They are number one in the nation for shortest possessions, getting a shot off in 13.7 seconds. You can see it in their pace (14th) and scoring ranks (52nd). But I actually like the under for this game for a few reasons. Hickman helping the turnover battle means the Tribe won&#x27;t get their fastbreak going as much as they&#x27;d like. Charleston also features a pair of 7-footers inside - including Duke transfer Christian Reeves - which should dampen William and Mary&#x27;s ability to drive. If Charleston can set its halfcourt defense, I don&#x27;t expect the Tribe to shoot over it. William and Mary are very ordinary from beyond the arc, where they make just 34.2 percent (169th). To be fair, Charleston is *much* worse from 3, shooting 27.8 percent. But that just means they won&#x27;t be able to play catch up *should* William and Mary dictate tempo. I know that goes against my Charleston -1.5 thesis, but it&#x27;s a decent reason to sprinkle some on the under (which I will likely do).

Charleston graduate student transfer Jlynn Counter has been balling out - piling up points, rebounds, and assists, all while shooting a high percentage from everywhere on the court. As the main usage guy for Charleston, he&#x27;ll be asked to facilitate or finish often. In fact, the Cougars have won the last three games in which he took at least 12 field goals. He can get to the free-throw line, where he converts, and he&#x27;s averaging 6.75 assists over the last four games - 2.25 more than his season average. Why? Because Charleston is finally getting its full complement of weapons back!! And the timing couldn&#x27;t be better. Look for Charleston to get it done, and move to 6-2 at home this season. Speaking of home cooking... In their five wins at TD Arena this season, Charleston has held opponents to 65.4 points - another nod to the under. Moreover, William and Mary is 1-9 straight up in its last 10 games in Charleston. You&#x27;d have to go back to 2016 to find the last time the Tribe won on the road.

Good luck and godspeed!</td></tr>

Payout: +100 (2.0x)

Play Size: 1 unit

**Special Notes**: This specific slip was put together on *PrizePicks* since the other platforms I have looked at did not have these lines or combos.  
  
**Write Up**

Hello! I thought I would give the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> a try since I had seen so many other good plays on here before. Fingers crossed that my first one works out.

Dyson Daniels has been going crazy with his Rebounds and Assists recently. Due to some poor showings at the start of the season his average RA sits at just over 12 per game. As the season has progressed, has has become more consistent and - most recently, with Trae Young&#x27;s absence - pulled his RA to over 15 per game.   
The 9.5 line is above some of his last ten games but when he&#x27;s up against the Raptors he absolutely crushes this line (aside from the first game of the season which was his second worst of the year).   
With T. Young out and the Raptors as his opponents, Daniels is very likely to cross the rather conservative 9.5 line we are using.

\+

The line for Thompson and Brooks is being based, respectively, on the season average of 18.1 and the road average of 19 for these players (or the last five games average for both. Pretty much the same value anyway).

Both of these players have been a bit inconsistent recently but their averages are still doing well across their last ten games. Despite their recent numbers, both of these players have excelled against the other&#x27;s team. Across their individual last five games against these teams, both players averaged 19 PPG. Yet for this season, Brooks have averaged 26 points against the Rockets and Thompson has averaged 29 against the suns. That puts their average combined total score against these teams 17 points above their average and the line. So long as one player does well and the other has one of their average games, this line should clear.</td></tr>

**Write Up:** Tonight the Bulls travel to Boston to take on the Celtics. In a game that the Celtics should dominate,  the only way the Bulls can keep this game somewhat close is if we get a solid outing from Vuc. He has had an up and down season thus far but the style of play from the Celtics, I can see Vuc getting around 12 rebounds in this game. Vuc is typically flirting with double doubles so at plus money I like this play. No Giddey, Smith or Collins for the bulls tonight so expect Vuc to play a big part in this game.

* He has hit this line in 3 of his last 5 games
* He had 8 rebounds in his last game 3 days ago
* He got the back-to-back off so he should be playing pretty refreshed (in comparison to his teammates) with an increase to his minutes (probably 20 min)
* These two teams just played (while Porzingis rested) and the game entered the 4th with a 50% for each team winning, meaning they are playing close games and might play him even more if it means securing the win
* The raptors give up 14th most rebounds so a team he should be able to tally up quite a few

Mega - Vienna 🏀 ABA Liga ⏳in 1.30 Hour

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Mega -5.5 Handicap @ 1.60

* Vienna away record: 0-6
* Mega home record: 3-2

Vienna arrives in Belgrade physically exhausted and demoralized, having been eliminated from a grueling cup semi-final in their domestic league just 48 hours earlier. This will create a significant handicap, particularly in the second half, affecting their shooting and defensive runs. The home side, Mega, has spent the entire week resting and focusing on this game, and they are also motivated to avenge their loss to Vienna in the first half of the season, where they recorded an unusually high statistic of 23 turnovers. Mega&#x27;s young and high-tempo lineup will force the tempo against their tired opponents, making it difficult for Vienna&#x27;s limited rotation to respond for 40 minutes. Even if Mega only manages to reduce their turnovers to an average level, the difference in skill between the two teams will be reflected on the scoreboard, potentially creating a double-digit difference. Vienna&#x27;s low outside shooting percentage will also make it difficult for them to match Mega&#x27;s scoring potential, while the home side&#x27;s desire to &quot;stop the losing streak&quot; in front of their own fans is the final critical element supporting the handicap. Taking all these factors into account, a Mega victory by six points or more is the most mathematically and tactically logical outcome.</td></tr>

Going back to McBride, as still without Hart, he is shooting pretty well + playing time. Going to move the line down to just 10 points as he has hit this 9/10 times without Hart, and one of those was against the Pistons. We know McBride loves the three as he has averaged 8 3PA in his last four games back, and the Pistons have given up a ton of 3PA in their L3. He&#x27;s also shooting at about a 50% clip...bro cannot miss.

We then go to Sexton, who has notched 10 points 25/27 times this season. H2H vs the Thunder, he is 3/3. The Thunder are also giving up a ton of looks from the three. They also rank 20th in defending the SG position. If Edgecombe can reach 10 points off of 16 FGA, then I&#x27;m sure Sexton can reach 10 points off of his normal 10.5 FGA, since he is shooting 46% in his last six. Sexton creates a lot of contact and gets to the line very, very often, while hitting them at 84.7%

We head back to the Championship as our friends Leicester City host West Brom in a match of two teams trying to get their season going in the second half - reminiscent of me trying to get the wheels back on the track. 

I’m not going to dig too much into the details, because it’s just about form and math here: Leicester have **cleared this total in 11 straight matches, conceded in 19 straight, both teams scored in 8 straight**. Head to head West Brom have **conceded in 13 straight matches against Leicester, and these teams have gone over 5/6 with both teams scoring 6/8.**

The two teams *played to a 1-1 draw earlier in the season, &amp; West Brom have only cleared this 6/10 in recent weeks* - however when the two teams met, they combined for 24 shots and an xG of 3+. 

And from a personal perspective I’ve hit 6 straight Leicester City games, including 1 here on <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> last month. For a + money play, I like this.

(Pain - in reality the quick start by Baltimore is what pushed this game, because it forced everyone to up the pace, and thus exceed the total. It’s always gutting when the plan and idea all fall into place, but you end up a half point off. We’ve lost 3 in a row)

Sport | League | Event Time / Time Zone | <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:
1)Tennis | ATP Brisbane | Denis Shapovalov vs Raphaël Collignon | 20:00 EST
2)Tennis | ATP Brisbane | Brandon Nakashima vs Alejandro Davidovich Fokina | 20:00 EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: Alejandro Davidovich Fokina +2.5 Games &amp; Denis Shapovalov +2.5 Games - Parlay @ -111 (DraftKings) | 1.11 units to win 1 unit

After analyzing recent performances, stats, and attacking trends, Fokina and Shapovalov to cover +2.5 games is the strongest <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> for this fixture.

Write-Up:

This parlay focuses on total game spreads, offering a buffer for closely contested matches rather than relying on outright winners.

Alejandro Davidovich Fokina has been consistent on hard courts over the last 12 months. He wins 51% of total points and averages 2.65 breaks per match, showing he can challenge opponents in tight sets. His net points won per match sits at 80, and he converts 47% of break point opportunities, indicating that even against top-tier players, he can grab games and push sets to the limit. The +2.5 game spread means he only needs to avoid a loss by 3 or more games, making this a high-probability play even against favorites.

Denis Shapovalov, while favored in his match, is not invulnerable on hard courts. His service stats reveal 79% of service games won, but his return stats—32% 1st serve return points won and 52% 2nd serve return points won—indicate that opponents can take games off him in each set. With a +2.5 spread, Shapovalov can afford a few close games or even drop a set and still cover, giving excellent protection for this parlay.

Combined Parlay Logic:

1) Both legs use a spread, which reduces risk versus straight match bets.
2) Fokina’s ability to break serve and stay competitive in each set complements Shapovalov’s potential for tight games.
3) Statistically, both players have shown tendencies to produce long, competitive sets, aligning perfectly with the +2.5 games spread.

Probability Insight:

This parlay is projected to have around 70–75% likelihood of covering, providing a disciplined approach without chasing risky match outcomes. It’s a calculated play aimed at consistency and value, rather than high-odds volatility.

Optional Risk Play:

For bettors willing to take a bit more risk for higher odds, backing Fokina to win and Shapovalov to cover 1 set at +112 is also a solid option, leveraging Fokina’s competitive form and Shapovalov’s tendency to drop a few games in each set.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: NBA Portland Trail Blazers vs Utah Jazz Under 244.5 (-110) 1u
Writeup:
This line is inflated by about 5-6 points and I&#x27;m fading the &quot;Jazz defense&quot; narrative here.
Yes, the Utah Jazz give up points like crazy (gave up 123 to GSW on Saturday), but 244.5 is a massive number that requires both teams to shoot 50%+ from the field and push pace for 48 minutes.
Jerami Grant (Achilles) is officially out. That removes 20+ PPG and their best iso scorer from the floor. The Portland Trail Blazers&#x27; offense is now running entirely through Deni Avdija and rookies.
Portland has gone Under in 7 of their last 10 games. Their last three games finished at totals of 225, 231, and 219. The market is pricing this like a 2024 Pacers game just because it&#x27;s the Jazz, but Portland doesn&#x27;t have the firepower right now to drop 125+ without Grant.
Even if the Jazz put up 120, we just need Portland to stay under 124. In a game with role players forced to carry the load (Kris Murray, etc.), expect some sloppy offense and bricked threes in the 4th quarter.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Jaylen Brown Over 29.5 Points $1.82**

Could be a blowout game, however Bulls are a team that gives up the most points in the restricted area and I expect Jaylen Brown and Queta to be the ones mainly attacking the paint/restricted area. Id also be concerned if Brown passes it, but to be honest hes hit this line 7 straight games at home, and recently dropped 50 against Leonard and I think its due to him not getting player of the Month which he expressed on his livestream. Furthermore he has played similar teams that have weak paint defence such as the Pacers and hit 30 in both, Personally I think Issac Okoro is not good enough to guard JB and I dont think they will double him due to the playstyle of the bulls</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Egypt ML + u3.5 goals, $1.85, 2.00U to win 1.70U

Got stung yesterday by touching the A-League, so I’ll target a competition that’s not much better. Egypt come in clear favourites, but I like them even more because they were able to rest key players such as Salah and Marmoush, as they were guaranteed qualification before their last match. Was tossing up between o1.5 and u3.5 total goals but chose the under due to the African style of football where teams defend with their lives, and a team like Benin will most likely adopt this strategy, making scoring tough for Egypt. Egypt + Benin were also under 3.5 goals in all their group matches (6/6).

What’s up boys, this is my first ever <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> post. The last 3 games Toronto has played Atlanta, they have won every game by at least 10 points. ATL is 2-8 L10 with wins against the Knicks and the Wolves. They beat the Knicks because KAT and Josh Hart were injured, and they beat the Wolves because they had a horrible night shooting 37/87. Toronto however, is 6-10 L10 with some questionable losses to the Wizards and Nets due to poor shooting, but have gotten some good wins against the Warriors in OT and the Heat by at least 10 points. With Trae Young also being out again, their record against the hawks, and beating them on Saturday by 17 points I believe this is a strong play.

Recap: Covered in the first half, love it. Reed played 30min, even more than I expected. We’ll keep our eyes on this line going forward if Duren remains out, but Isaiah Stewart’s rebound line is something to watch too as they went with him down the stretch in a close game.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: Matas Buzelis 15+ Points (-152) 1 Unit

1/5/2026 4:30pm PST / NBA / Chicago Bulls @ Boston Celtics

Narrative: With the Bull’s starting backcourt, Giddey and White out the last 3 games, Buzelis of course has seen increased usage with 19 points on 15.7 shots in 30.3 minutes. Buzelis is shooting 47.9% from the field this season, and with the required usage of him offensively there’s great value here. The reason this line likely is where it is, is because Coby White was designated as Questionable <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. The Bulls originally announced Coby to be re-evaluated on Wednesday 1/7/2026… another odd early return from injury which I highly doubt a full workload for him here. Along with that, Jalen Smith also came down with an injury yesterday, which essentially locks Buzelis into min 30min played regardless of White’s minutes. The only worry here is how good defensively BOS is, but I think the volume for Buzelis will lock this in. GG!</td></tr>

NBA | GSW v Clippers | 🏀  

B2b wins we take those after the ugly stretch, we move cheers Joel.

Going with an alt line here in what has been somewhat of a system play when Steph has played the Clippers, you can go with the 3.5 line being offered but it’s very juiced hence why im going with an alt for higher odds.

Curry has had 5+ assists in 5/L5 games against the Clippers including 8 assists &amp; 10 potentials in their only meeting against them this season. 

What Clippers did this season and what they have done previously is letting Zubac push higher up on Curry, almost blitzing and leaving his player open in order to neutralise his pull up 3’s. Saw plenty of times where Post was open from three of the P&amp;R and the doubles they sent at Steph. Doubt they’ll change it this time around, something Ty Lue has done plenty of times facing Curry.

Has gone over in 6/L10 games with a few misses on 4 so not just a matchup thing either, Steph isn’t just a shooter. 

Clippers has been a good matchup for guards to get their assists aswell, allowing 9th most assists to PG’s this season.

Clippers has looked really good as of late and im sure they’ll want to keep the momentum going, closing down Steph will be huge in this game and I like the assist angle here.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the day</mark> : Jalen Brunson Higher 28.5 Points (-120) 


Reason • :
The Knicks are coming off an &quot;embarrassing&quot; loss to the Hawks where they lost their dominant home record. Now, they face a Detroit team that is first in the East (26-9) but currently wounded. on the road stats is the clincher: Brunson has an 80% hit rate in Detroit, including a 40-point explosion in the playoffs.

Scenario A. The Captain’s Revenge
Brunson scores 15 in the first half to erase the memory of the Atlanta loss. He continues to exploit the Duren-less paint and finishes with 32 points to secure the road win.

Scenario B The Efficiency Boost
Detroit plays better defense than expected, but because they are on a back-to-back, Brunson draws fouls on their tired guards. He goes 10-for-12 from the free-throw line (similar to his Philly game) and clears 29 points through sheer volume.

Scenario C The Blowout (Low Risk)
The Knicks are so focused that they blow Detroit out by the 3rd quarter. Even in this case, Brunson is the engine of the lead—likely having 26+ points by the time the starters are pulled.

Scenario Proof:
 * The Injury Gap: Detroit is missing Jalen Duren (starting center) and Tobias Harris. Without Duren’s rim protection, there is no one to stop Brunson’s floater or drive.

Scenario proof:
 * The Close Game: With a -3 spread, the game is projected to be tight. Brunson is averaging 34.4 PPG over his last five games. In a close game, the ball stays in his hands for all 36+ minutes.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Leicester Vs West Brom - **BTTS @ 1.8 (Melbet)**

**Write Up:** Leicester welcome West Brom in a Championship match where both teams have been unpredictable. Leicester are currently 13th in the table, with West Brom close behind in 18th, just three points adrift. The Foxes have shown they can be dangerous going forward, but they’ve struggled to stay solid defensively. 

They’ve found the net in four of their last five games, including an impressive 3–1 win over Ipswich and a 2–1 victory against Derby. When Leicester play at a higher tempo, their attack looks sharp and confident. Defensively, Leicester are still struggling. Heavy losses to QPR and Sheffield United highlighted issues with spacing and organisation, and conceding in each of their last five games shows the lack of stability at the back.

At home, Leicester often push players forward, which helps them create chances but also leaves them exposed to pressure. They’ve scored 34 goals and conceded 34, showing how hard it has been to find balance. In fact, only four Championship teams have conceded more goals this season, and Leicester haven’t kept a clean sheet since their 0–0 draw with Coventry City.

West Brom’s recent form has been mixed rather than disastrous. Wins against QPR and Sheffield United showed they can stick to a disciplined game plan, but losses to Swansea and Hull City highlighted their ongoing struggles in attack. Three of their last five matches finished 1–0 or 2–1, showing how tight their games usually are.

Away from home, West Brom usually stay compact and keep things tight early on. They don’t often start games aggressively, but when they fall behind, their shape can open up. Having conceded 33 goals this season, they aren’t solid defensively, but their lack of goals often forces them to push forward late which is  a situation that plays into Leicester’s attacking approach at home.

BTTS has hit in Leicester’s last 8 matches, and it has landed in 9 of their last 10 and 16 of their last 20 games overall. Leicester matches regularly open up, especially with their attacking style and defensive issues. West Brom show a similar, though slightly less consistent, pattern. BTTS has landed in 7 of their last 10 games and 12 of their last 20. Even in past meetings between these two sides, both teams have scored in 3 recent encounters.

With Leicester’s attacking intent and ongoing defensive issues, I anticipate an open game here. West Brom’s tendency to stay compact before taking risks later on only adds to that pattern. All signs point toward a game where both sides are likely to find the net.

Earlier this year they got smashed at home by Houston on the 2nd night of a back to back, and they got smashed again by Houston on the road even on 4 days rest. So I&#x27;m betting Houston would handle PHX even in normal circumstances, but on the 2nd night of a road back to back, PHX will struggle and not cover the 7.5.</td></tr>

The Kings have been struggling a bit in their last 10 games. They’ve been rolling with Forsberg in goal until recently with Kuemper being back from injury. Kuemper gave up 5 and 4 goals respectively in his last 2 games. They might go back to Forsberg, who hasn’t been great when tasked with being the full time goalie. 

 The Kings are 6-9-4 at home this year while the Wild are 13-4-5 on the road. The goal differential on the season is +23 for the Wild and -4 for the Kings. The Wild should be favored here, but the odds are a pickem with a slight lean towards the Kings.

**Event:** AFCON, Egypt v Benin, 11:00 am EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Benin +1.0 Asian Handicap +105, 1 unit

**Write Up:** *We&#x27;re back at the tournament that arguably took my notorious run to another gear: the AFCON. The grass is always greener on the other side and I thought diving into other competitions would&#x27;ve been the play, but it turns out AFCON is still the source of my last win from over 10 picks ago.* <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> we&#x27;re back just in time to target the Benin game. On paper, Egypt look like heavy favourites but I&#x27;m more than positive that&#x27;s not how the game is going to actually play out <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> and I see immense value in giving Benin just a bit of a helping hand with a +1.0 Asian Handicap. While mainstream media frames Egypt as vastly superior, a deeper look at the numbers suggests Benin can keep this tight and stay within that +1 goal cushion.

Egypt’s recent defensive performances haven’t been nearly as convincing as their clean sheets would suggest. They conceded **16-18 shots** in their two group stage matches and only shut out opponents due to defensive circumstances. They were forced into defending for their lives after being a man down against South Africa and the other clean sheet came against a rotated Angola side. This suggests that Egypt&#x27;s defence can be breached, and isn&#x27;t as bulletproof as the reputation suggests.

Benin, meanwhile, have shown resilience and the ability to compete against technically superior teams through their sheer physicality and a structured defensive shape. While they failed to score against DR Congo and Senegal, they did beat Botswana in their **first-ever 90-minute win at AFCON finals** and were **competitive in matches where they were underdogs.** That resilience, coupled with smart defensive shape, means Benin aren’t a team that&#x27;s easily blown away. Not much to go off when it comes to H2H as these sides barely played each other, with the most recent result being a *2-0 win for Egypt in 2020, but the teams&#x27; levels were completely different back then and yet Egypt didn&#x27;t dominate that game too much.*

**Egypt were also knocked out in the round of 16 in the last tournament,** showing they&#x27;re more than capable of stumbling early, and there&#x27;s going to be serious pressure on them to deliver. Usually slightly dysfunctional teams crumble under such pressure and I believe Egypt could struggle <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Meanwhile Benin stunned Morocco on penalties at this stage in the AFCON 2019 and they&#x27;ll be looking to cause another upset facing another strong Northern African side. Another thing that works in Benin&#x27;s favor is **Trezeguet&#x27;s poor form as he&#x27;s yet to register a G/A** in this year&#x27;s tournament, while Mohamed Salah doesn&#x27;t seem to be back to his scary old self and the partnership with Omar Marmoush has been slightly less fruitful than most fans had anticipated. All in all, I definitely feel that **Benin +1.0 Asian Handicap** gives us some amazing odds for covering most results, barring a blowout, which feels highly unlikely in what should be a cautious, tight AFCON knockout affair. I feel a big game coming from Benin&#x27;s **Olaitan and Mounie who were involved in five goals during the AFCON qualifying,** with the wide attacker contributing two assists, highlighting his creative threat. I do like the BTTS Yes angle too, as well as the Under 3.5 goals angle, if you want to sprinkle some extra spice on this madness, but personally, I&#x27;m just sticking to the outlined <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. I&#x27;m very confident in this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, but I&#x27;m going into this with just a standard unit, as you can imagine I want to preserve the bankroll in these tough times, ahead of the fun upcoming games (particularly targeting the Spanish Supercup in a few days&#x27; time).

Kiryat Yam vs Nof Hagalil, over 2.5 goals  @ 2

Kiryat Yam vs Nof Hagalil looks set up for goals, and over 2.5 is the right call. Both sides prefer open play and push numbers forward, often leaving spaces at the back. Recent performances show defensive lapses and good attacking intent on both ends. With chances likely at both goals and a fast tempo expected, three goals or more feels very achievable in this matchup.</td></tr>

Cobolli vs Rinderknech , United Cup 🎾🏆 9 pm ET 1/5/25

Record: 15-12
Net Units: +3.53 Units ✅

Explanation: I think Rinderknech is at a significant disadvantage in this matchup because Rinderknech historically has struggled more on hard courts. while Cobolli is historically better on hard courts with his clay court nature of being able to grind points out. It may sound silly the first time hearing it, but the type of court you’re playing on is a significant factor for tennis.

 Cobolli is one of the better returners , he’s at around 30% first-serve return points won and creates a nice amount of break looks (0.62 break chances per return game), so he’s solid at not letting big serves get past him.  

He’s been playing great and been on the come up, as of most recently . He’s arguably a top 25 player now, and that’s the right momentum to have coming into this matchup.</td></tr>

**Event**: English Premier League - Leicester City vs West Brom - 20:00 GMT+0

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>**: Leicester City DC and Over 1.5 @1.85 - 1u

**Write Up**: Leicester&#x27;s season has been shaped by how inconsistent they&#x27;ve been. After being relegated in horrible fashion last season, they still haven&#x27;t found their footing under Marti Cifuentes and you just can&#x27;t know what Leicester will show up. But the same could be said about West Brom under Ryan Mason. West Brom find themselves 18th in the league with scattergun performances. But what you can say for the Baggies is that their xP tells us they should have more points than they do, which isn&#x27;t the case for Leicester. But the negative for West Brom is their shocking away record. They&#x27;ve got 10/13 losses playing away this season making them the fourth worst in the league for this metric. And while Leicester&#x27;s home form isn&#x27;t particularly great, they have covered DC in 9/12 of their games. And this is why I&#x27;m ultimately landing on taking Leicester DC here as they have slightly higher value due to being the underdog. The other thing expected from Leicester other than them being shit is for goals to go in. They are very leaky and have covered the 1.5 line in 22/25 games. West Brom haven&#x27;t been so open but they do have good xG generating metrics so with Leicester being poor defensively, they could contribute to the score. 

**Additional Thoughts**: The City game was hard to take as they looked in control from the beginning and to throw it away like that was a bit maddening with just 2 minutes to play. I&#x27;m less sure about this one overall but I&#x27;m not to enthused by tomorrow&#x27;s games so I can only do my best.</td></tr>

Last 5 &gt; LWWWL // Profit: €1,439.00

We are looking at a Leicester whom are not too bad at home this season having a 5-4-3 record and a 17:14 goal diff. The outlier in this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> though is that we are counting on the consistency of West Brom, which is that they are bad on the road. Away from home West Brom rank 21th and are 3-0-10 but the bigger thing is that they have now lost 9 games in a row when traveling.

On the H2H side things are looking positively for Leicester as they dominate this fixture by 7-2-1 in the last 10 games against West Brom.

The stake <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> is just purely to keep track of my own progress, since I bet this number. I would consider this a 3U <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>.</td></tr>

Tennis | ATP Hong Kong | 5:00 AM EST (estimated)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Fabian Marozsan vs Yibing Wu | **Wu to win first set at +110. 1 unit.**

Write-up: Yibing Wu is a player who displays an extremely high level when healthy, but simply can&#x27;t stay on the court for more than a few months at a time. This is his first time competing in Hong Kong, but there&#x27;s no doubt that Asian hard courts are where he plays some of his best tennis. The good thing for Wu is that he doesn&#x27;t come into this match completely cold, as he looked pretty fit in an exhibition match a couple of weeks ago. Nevertheless, it&#x27;s hard to predict how Wu will fare as the match drags on, which is why I decided to go with his first set ML here.

Meanwhile, Marozsan&#x27;s hard court results last year were punctuated by some really nice wins and some really rough losses. The Hungarian tends to strike the ball extremely flat, which means that he can beat nearly anyone when he&#x27;s finding lines, but can also lose to nearly anyone when he&#x27;s not. This makes it tough for me to price him as a favorite against someone who tends to rise to the level of his opponent. Don&#x27;t get me wrong: Wu likes to crush the ball as well, but I find that he plays with a degree of tactical intelligence that allows him to not hit himself off the court. Neither player has a world-beating serve, and so I expect this match to be decided from the baseline, where Wu should be able to garner some crowd support and get off to a hot start. As I said, I feel that Wu should easily have enough in the tank for one good set; after that, I&#x27;m not sure, which is why I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the ML at slightly better odds.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Jordan James 1+ SOT (+125) 1 unit to win 1.25 units

**Write Up:** What an ending to the City-Chelsea game. Our guy Enzo came through for us again with a clutch stoppage time goal to level the score and secure Chelsea a point. He actually landed 2 SOTs in that one play, as his first shot was saved. Gotta love a big play late in the game, what a sweat, but moments like this are why soccer can be so much fun to watch. 

Day off for the Premier League <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, so we&#x27;re giving the Championship a try as Leicester host West Brom in a mid table battle. Leicester have underperformed this season, especially after being relegated from the Premier League at the end of last season. They just haven&#x27;t quite clicked. West Brom have fairly well become furniture in the middle of the Championship table, after their latest promotion and immediate relegation back in 2020. They are also in terrible away form, losing their last 9 away matches. 

Jordan James is a 21 year old midfielder playing his first season in English football on loan from France. He is a true midfielder, so he does not take a ton of shots. The shots he does take though he makes count. He is currently Leicester&#x27;s leading Goalscorer with 8 goals in 20 appearances. He is also in the form of his young life, **scoring a goal in each of his last 3 matches**. This play is more about current form than about overall year stats, as he goes through good and bad shooting form spells. 

James actually plays a fairly similar role and position to Enzo Fernandez, with a little less box crashing with headers and more finding space in the center of the box and shooting. I love the odds we&#x27;re getting on this for the form the lad is in. As always, **please mind the lineups before going to heavy on this**. He has started and played most of 20/21 games he has been fit for this season (the only game he didnt start was the first match of the season), but you never know when a coach may get cheeky with lineups.  

BOL and happy Monday!</td></tr>

NIGERIA VS MOZAMBIQUE

Date: 05 JANUARY 2026 at 20:00

BET ON: Over / Under team Corners- NIGERIA Over +5.50

Odd: 1.72



\- Nigeria Over 5.5 Corners is strongly supported by the tactical and motivational context of this matchup. Eric Chelle has repeatedly stressed in Nigerian and French-language AFCON press briefings that his team’s identity is built around front-foot football, sustained pressure and wide attacking play, regardless of the opponent. Nigeria’s tournament games back this up: with Osimhen, Lookman and Chukwueze constantly attacking the box, the Super Eagles spend long spells in the final third, forcing deep defensive blocks and generating repeated wide deliveries and second-ball situations — a consistent recipe for corners rather than clean open-play finishes. The lack of injuries in the squad allows Chelle to maintain high intensity and aggressive wing usage for 90 minutes, while Mozambique arrive weakened defensively, missing both starting centre-backs Diogo Calila and Nené, which African tactical previews highlight as a major blow against aerial pressure and overlapping full-backs. Mozambique are expected to defend extremely deep and narrow to survive, inviting crosses and sustained pressure rather than engaging higher up the pitch. With Nigeria highly motivated to assert dominance early in a knockout match and structurally set up to attack from the flanks, the game script strongly points toward sustained pressure and a healthy Nigeria corner count rather than a low-tempo, possession-sharing contest.</td></tr>

**Unit stake:** 2U 

**Odds:** 1.75 

**To win:** 1.50U 

**Recap:** 

Fulham scored a quick goal and even managed a draw after an amazing last minute goal 

Man City had a devastating last minute equaliser but Chelsea had an extremely good second half and it was, sadly, deserved but unlucky for me 

**Write Up:** 

Egypt has looked better than their results show in my opinion 

First game dominating Zimbabwe but needing a late game winner from Salah. Second game getting an early lead and having to cling on due to a red card right before halftime. Final group stage game getting a draw while resting key players 

I expect them to win here and I think they will want to gain some confidence going into the final stage of AFCON 

Benin lost twice versus Senegal and DR Congo. They did manage a narrow win versus Botswana. Botswana themselves have been extremely out of form in 2025 so a win against them doesn&#x27;t say much 

Egypt have the star players, better form and something to prove

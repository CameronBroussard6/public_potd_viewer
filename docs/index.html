Last POTD: __Mark Williams O22.5 PR @1.90 1U__ ❌

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: __Jamal Murray O9.5 RA @1.83 1U (Bet365)__

NBA | Nuggets v Kings | 🏀  

1 FGA for Mark Williams the whole game, weirdest bet I think I’ve taken ever. With his latest game logs it doesn’t make any sense why he would take 1 shot and especially in this matchup. Pretty embarrassing, I apologise for this one fellas.

Jamal logged 14 RA in the recent matchup against the Kings where he had 12 potential assists and 10 rebound chances (22 potential RA). Has been pretty consistent this season aswell going over in 5/7 games with 26+ minutes avg 10.9 RA and 19.4 chances per game.

Runs the offense to start with Jokic and his rotation lets him run it alone at times when Jokic gets subbed and he remains in. 

Has cleared this line 3/L3 H2H matchups against the Kings where he’s had 14, 12 &amp; 11 RA.

High total of 242.5 and Kings present a good matchup for assists as they’ve allowed 6th most this season and ranking top 4 in pace.

Like the rebound upside as he’s getting a lot of unchallenged rebounds and has grabbed 6 7, 8 &amp; 4 lately.

Like Jamal to continue the trend in what should be a high scoring game</td></tr>

Lowry has cleared this line by 12 yards+ in his last 4 games and is averaging 17 carries in his last 6 in an upward trend from the start of the season. 

He managed 22 and 20 carries over the last 2, and has a season average of 4.7 yards per carry.

Lowry’s longest rush in his last 4 games have been 26, 22, 37, 17 and has averaged 91 yards per game over that time. 

His passing game has also been strong recently completing at over 72% in his last 5 and if he can get it going then more rushing opportunities will start to arise, with potential for long gains. 

Lowry&#x27;s limited carries and yards in opening games can be attributed to more difficult opposition but his recent form suggests that there has been a shift in his confidence to run the ball,

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>:** Jonas Valanciunas o6.5 points (Nuggets vs Kings)

**Odds:** -130

**Units:** 1.3u

Tip off is 8:10pm PST. This is really the first real season where Jonas Valanciunas is coming off the bench. In July he nearly inked a 3 year deal in the Euroleague where he would have kept him a starter. I bring this up because he agreed to take (slightly) less money to play fewer minutes, in Denver, and be a back up to Jokic. That is a tall task. 

Tonight the Nuggets are 8.5 point favorites in a game that has over/under at 242.5. Its going to be a high scoring game and unless it&#x27;s a complete barn burner then I see Jokic resting normal minutes and Valanciunas keeping up the rhythm that is expected of this championship caliber team. 

Valanciunas has hit o6.5 points in 6 of 9 of the games this season. He also hit it in the game where they played Sacramento on Nov 03rd.

why: Both the Knicks and Nuggets are in spots where it just makes sense to back them. The Knicks have been rolling at home — winning big, defending hard, and feeding off the Garden crowd. The Grizzlies can’t keep up offensively, and their defense has looked flat, especially against teams that move the ball as well as New York does. This one feels like another double-digit win for the Knicks.

As for the Nuggets, they’re simply the more reliable team right now. They’ve been efficient, steady, and take care of business against weaker defenses — exactly what the Kings have been lately. Sacramento gives up way too many easy looks, and Denver’s shooting and inside play should tear that apart. Both games line up perfectly for the favorites to handle business.</td></tr>

**Write up:**

Not much football this tuesday but we do have a Champions League matchup in the Women&#x27;s version of this prestigious tournament.

**OL Lyoness (W) v VfL Wolfsburg (W)**

This is a matchup between good teams, but I reckon Lyon is the better team here. They are 3rd and 4th in the standings and are both on a 100% win rate so far. But Wolfsburg have faced Valerenga and PSG, who are starting to look like they will eventually finish outside play-off spots. Whereas Lyon has faced and won against Arsenal and St. Polten. A win against Arsenal is quite impressive, as they won the CL last year. OL Lyoness also haven&#x27;t lost in 16 games, since April this year. Wolfsburg lost this weekend to Frankfurt, even whilst having a player advantage for 60 minutes, and they play Europa Cup.

Best of luck if tailing! 🍀

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: NBA Raptors v Nets 

1U Sandro Mamukelashvili O0.5 1Q assists @ $2.30 (+130 American), B365 

Write-Up: My initial bet was going to be Embiid 1Q points as I have that bet on speed dial but u/Busy_Presentation463 got in first (which I don’t think necessarily matters) BUT also had better odds than I can access in Australia - which *DOES* matter. So for the predominantly US audience reading this thread that may want to tail, I highly recommend tailing that poster as Embiid 6 1Q is a fantastic bet *BUT* do your odds shop! As we saw last game, variance happens in NBA, it’s a winning pattern bet but you will still lose sometimes, so much better to shop around and give yourself more of a chance in the long run. Every game he plays - I spam it with the best odds I can find. 

Now, onto my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. Sandro (Raptors) has hit this line 8 games in a row, all for 3 pointers. See the list below of the first quarters he’s had in relation to who he assisted and what their basket was, plus minutes played &amp; Poetl playing or not (as he generally comes on for Poetl). 

V 76ers - Shead 3 pt, 6 minutes 

V Hawks game 2 - Quickley 3 pt, 7 minutes, Poetl played 

V Bucks game 2 - Shead 3 pt, 7 minutes, Poetl played

V Grizzlies - Shead 3 pt, 5 minutes 

V Cavs - Barnes 3 pt, 4 minutes 

V Rockets - Barnes 3 pt, 3 minutes 

V Spurs - Murray-Boyles 3 pt, 5 minutes, Poetl played 

V Mavs - Barrett 3 pt, 5 minutes, Poetl played 

V Bucks game 1 - miss, 5 minutes 

V Hawks game 1 - miss 

So basically we have to rely on him kicking out for a 3 pointer and that player hitting, but I love getting &gt;+100 odds for something that is 8 straight. Obviously it’s unlikely to continue forever but I don’t see a good reason why it will be the Nets who stop this play. The Nets concede 33.2 points on average in 1st quarters, 3rd worst in the comp. Their 3 point field goal % defence is EASILY the worst in the comp - 41% ahead of Spurs with 39.7%. So we have a team that gets scored on heavily and can’t defend 3 pointers, we have a player who assists heavily on 3 pointers on a team that is ranked 5th for 3 point %. 

He is marked questionable with neck soreness but no big deal, he’ll either miss entirely and it’ll be void, or if he does play it seems unlikely he’ll be on a minutes restriction if he passes fit to play. 

Yes he is a bench player but solidly gets on as 7th man I’d say for 5-6 minutes, plus Poetl averages 4.8 fouls a game and is always a risk to sit early by attracting 2 early fouls.  

As always, manage units responsibly as variance will inevitably occur, but fuck, if you don’t like these odds on a play like this, I don’t know what to tell you. Will see you all again next Raptors game if he doesn’t hit playing it again as hopefully in that case odds have only gone up further.</td></tr>

Event: Texas tech @ Illinois (7:30pm central)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: over 165 (-120)

-everything is bet to win unit amount-

Write up: 

Illinois has looked every bit the part offensively to start the season. They’ve brought in a ridiculous amount of talent from across the globe, adding serious scorers to bolster their three-point percentage. The Ivišić brothers, both towering over seven feet, give Illinois a size advantage that Texas Tech simply cannot match — Tech doesn’t have a single player over seven feet. These bigs aren’t just rim protectors; they can step out and shoot threes themselves, stretching the floor and creating mismatches. On the other side, Texas Tech counters with star power of their own. JT Toppin may be the best player in the nation, and breakout sophomore Christian Anderson is proving to be a stud. This game sets up less like a grind and more like a shootout.


Illinois ranks fourth nationally in offensive efficiency and plays at a much faster tempo than Tech, meaning they’ll control the pace and force the Red Raiders to keep up. Tech is no slouch either, sitting 23rd in offensive efficiency. Both teams are elite at converting possessions into points: Illinois is the number one team in the nation in floor percentage, while Tech ranks 31st. That efficiency ensures that every trip down the floor has a high chance of ending in buckets. 

Defensively, neither team has shown much resistance against weaker competition. Illinois sits 30th in defensive efficiency, Tech 68th, but those numbers come against opponents that don’t measure up to the talent they’ll face here. Translation: expect both offenses to shine.
The three-point battle is another reason to expect fireworks. Both teams rank inside the top 13 nationally in three-pointers attempted per game, and they’re hitting them at impressive clips — 39% and 41%. When two teams shoot this well from deep and take this many attempts, the scoreboard climbs quickly. Illinois’s revamped spacing and Tech’s shot creation will force defenses into rotations, opening up clean looks all night.
Shot volume tells the same story. Illinois has allowed opponents to attempt 70.5 field goals and 28 threes per game through just two contests, numbers that rank near the bottom nationally. FGCU still managed to score 70 points against them despite shooting only 32% from the field and 25% from three. Tech has been similarly permissive, allowing opponents 63 field goal attempts per game, ranking around 260th nationally. Sam Houston even dropped 77 points on them in Lubbock. If either team gives up this kind of shot volume again, the pace will resemble an NBA game more than a college one.


Matchups only reinforce the expectation of points. Illinois’s size advantage with the Ivišić brothers should allow them to bully Tech inside, while still spacing the floor with perimeter shooting. Tech’s undeniable talent, led by Toppin and Anderson, ensures they can trade buckets possession for possession. Illinois’s faster tempo and elite floor percentage will drive a high-possession game, while Tech’s efficiency keeps them competitive throughout.


Market context supports the Over as well. Oddsmakers opened the total around 162.5, with Illinois favored slightly at home. Both teams have already cashed Overs in their early-season games: Illinois dropped 113 on FGCU with Kylan Boswell scoring 31, while Tech put up 98 on Sam Houston with Toppin scoring 31. Last season, Illinois averaged 83.6 points per game, and Tech consistently scored in the 70s and 80s. These trends show that offense travels and sustains even against stronger competition

This is a beautiful line. And for plus money. Got to go for it:

\- MPJ has cashed in L3/3 vs Raptors, getting 8, 9, 9 boards.

\- Cashed in L3/5, with his last two games going under due to blow-outs. Pure numbers, he&#x27;s at 9.2 REB Avg over L5

\- Despite Barnes, Ingram and Poetl, Raptors are not a good rebounding team. They rank 25th in Total Rebound % and 23rd in Rebounds allowed to SFs.

\- Averaging 13.9 Potential Rebounds / game. He&#x27;s in the middle of it.

\- MPJ gets significantly more rebounds after rest. He&#x27;s on 1 day rest with his last game seeing a light load of 26 minutes. Rest factors boost this.

\- Game spread pretty nasty at 10.5 but they&#x27;ll lean on MPJ pretty heavy at home without Cam Thomas. I expect him to see minutes.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Joel Embiid over 5.5 pts in the 1Q (+105)(Stake)

Event: NBA Sixers vs Celtics

Bet 4U

This is a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> i have seen a couple of times in this subreddit by u/vet100 and ever since ive tailed for the last 4 games embiid has played.

Embiid has gone over this in 4/5 of his last games and yes he scored only a underwhelming 4 pts the first time he faced boston but the 2nd time he faced them this season, he dropped 8 pts in the 1st plus i think he has found his form again scoring well over 20+ pts per game average in the last 5 games even with 25 min restriction

Boston gives up an average of 30 pts in the first qtr to opposing teams this season and embiid plays around 8 mins in the 1st qtr and the last time he missed this line, he only played 6 mins also i&#x27;m very confident embiid can handle his own against the undersized queta

Finally he averages well over 4 FGA per 1Q with half of them being inside shots with the other being <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> and pops with maxey where has he has shot over 50% in the 1Q this season so far with an average of 2 attempts.

Hopefully the undefeated status remains intact tomorrow and always remember to bet within your bankroll limits but other than that BOL

*Merrill started this game so cold. He missed every shot he got in the first 3 quarters and came out in the fourth and made it 0/7 three pointers made and then he got the hot hand. He hit 4 three pointers in less than 3 minutes!! The Miami heat numbers of allowing three point attempts really helped this bet hit, by the time it hit over time the Cavs already had 57 three pointers attempted and Merrill shot 13 of those. He ended the game with 16 three pointers attempted. Another win for us and another one at 2+ odds.*

NCAAB // Bucknell Bison @ Princeton Tigers

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Bucknell +4.5 (-105) 1u**

I am really not sure how Bucknell is the underdog in this game after Princeton just got smoked in their first game of the year by the Akron Zips. Now granted, Akron is actually expected to be a pretty good team this year, but a 35 point loss in a game that was over at halftime doesn&#x27;t project a whole lot of confidence. Akron scored any way they wanted, making 15 3s at a 41% clip and having 12 different players score ending at 104 points. Akron was expected to win comfortably but 35 points is tough considering Princeton was only a 12.5 point dog.

Meanwhile Bucknell sits at 2-0 with wins over Mt. Saint Mary&#x27;s and Delaware, two teams that are very similar in quality to Princeton. Not a whole lot to glean from the stats as we are so early in the season, this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> is more just based on a lack of confidence that Princeton is going to put forth a significantly better performance on a three day turnaround.

Bucknell #243 in KenPom

Princeton #247 in KenPom

Bucknell 2-0 ATS covering with average margin of +9.

Princeton 0-1 ATS not covering by a margin of -22.5.

Well fuck. A push might be my least favorite outcome in gambling. For me, the whole point is to feel something. The rush, the heartbreak, whatever. But a push? Nothing. Just irritation. At least a loss stings. A push is just empty. 

Anyways back at it, and write up will be shorter again, because I’m busy the next few days and my god does this slate blow. There is one game though that jumps out and a matchup I attacked earlier this season.

**76ers -1.5**

I bet this exact matchup at almost the exact number (-1) on Halloween. Philly got down big in the 1st Q, but rallied back with a chance to win it at the end losing by 1. I expect Philly to exploit Boston’s holes, and not get off to such a bad start.

Maxey is a a rampage right now, avg 33.2 a game (2nd in NBA) with two 40pt games (also two games with 39pts). Embiid isn’t who he used to be, however is still very efficient / productive when on the court. VJ is a stud, and grimes is in the running for 6th ma of the year early this season. 

Boston is a team I’ve faded a lot this season; and have for the most part been on the wrong side. I know they have championship players, and Queta is a revelation. I mentioned this in my last post involving Boston, his +/- this season is +82, with the second player being +46. I mean aside from the numbers, when I watch this team they are a totally different team with him off the court. 

The thesis for me of this play really centers around my belief that Boston will be a bottom tier team when the season ends, and that they’re talent and motivation just don’t align with the respect their given from betting lines. I’ve been wrong a lot fading this team, but also can’t ignore my feelings. Or maybe I’m just stubborn. Regardless Philly has impressed me, and I’m backing them again.</td></tr>

Not a lot I like <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, so I picked this—keep that in mind. 

Don&#x27;t have much time <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> to do a full write-up, but here&#x27;s the thinking behind the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. 

\- Two of the top five scoring teams in the league  
\- While South Shields have been the best defensive side in the league by a long way, they&#x27;ve conceded in their last two league games, and last three games in all comps.   
\- Merthyr games seem to have a LOT of goals in them... along with being one of the top attacking sides, they&#x27;ve also conceded the second most goals in the league  
  
Now, South burned my a couple of days ago, so I guess we&#x27;ll see.</td></tr>

Last Pick: LA Lakers -7.0 vs Charlotte Hornets @ 1.91. 3U. ✅

Another game spread, another strong team at closing out games, and another win. That’s two game spreads in a row, let’s try to make it three! That also brings up 150 <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> wins!

 

Next <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **Toronto Raptors -9.5 vs Brooklyn Nets @ 1.91**. 3U play.

It might surprise you to hear that the Nets have lost 4 out of their last 5 games by 16 or more points. They are also 1-9 SU this season and will continue to be without their primary scorer, Cam Thomas. This squad doesn’t really have a playmaker and doesn’t really have a scorer, two things that are kind of important in this sport. The Raptors meanwhile coming off a loss against the 76ers, a team they typically struggle against, but they had 4 wins prior to it, covering their spread in each of those. With Jakob Poeltl returning, the Raptors are at full strength here and I think they’re finally starting to show some promise with their starting 5 getting some minutes together. Let’s go Raptors!</td></tr>

Todays <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: **Stockport County FC v Wigan Athletic EFL Trophy: Stockport County DC &amp; u3.5 goals @1.82**

With qualification still hanging in the balance in Northern Section Group A, Stockport County host Wigan Athletic at Edgeley Park on Tuesday in what’s effectively a knockout clash for both sides. Stockport sit second with three points — a win guarantees progression, while a draw might be enough depending on results elsewhere. Wigan, meanwhile, are winless and need a two-goal victory plus a Salford win to stay alive.

Dave Challinor’s men were humbled 3–0 by Luton at the weekend, missing a penalty and seeing red, but that blip shouldn’t overshadow their recent form. Prior to that, they’d won four straight, conceding just once, and they’ve been solid at home, unbeaten in seven at Edgeley Park. Stockport’s previous EFL Trophy outing was a 3–1 loss to Salford, but their earlier 5–3 win over Wolves U21s shows they can score freely when needed. Expect a more disciplined, controlled performance this time as progression is at stake.

Ryan Lowe’s side face a mountain to climb. They’ve lost both Trophy matches 2–0 against Salford and 2–1 to Wolves U21s and have only managed two wins in their last ten overall. Goals have been the issue, as Wigan haven’t scored more than once in any of those ten games. Their away record against Stockport is dire, with no win since 1982, and Stockport have made Edgeley Park a fortress this season.

Stockport have more momentum, home advantage, and scoring depth. Wigan’s lack of cutting edge and poor away form make it unlikely they can win by the margin they need. Stockport’s steady defense and Wigan’s goal struggles point to a low-scoring affair. Stockport are likely to secure progression with a draw or narrow win.

Best of luck.</td></tr>

Last Pick: Antoine Ghibaudo ML vs Clement Chidekh (-122, 1 unit): Win

Tennis | Montevideo Challenger | 11:30 AM EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Roman Andres Burruchaga vs Federico Agustin Gomez | **Burruchaga ML at -200 (BetRivers). 2 units.**

Write-up: Not sure how to feel about that <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. In terms of CLV, it was one of my worst picks ever, as Ghibaudo was pushed all the way up to +144 by the market before the match. However, it was somewhat redeemed by the result, as Ghibaudo came back from being an early break down to secure a 2-0 win. In general, it obviously wasn&#x27;t the greatest play, and I think I should have been more careful about analyzing how the player (particularly Chidekh) had recently been priced by the market.

South American clay has always been Roman Burruchaga&#x27;s favorite surface, and he&#x27;s shown that over the past few months. In 6 SA clay tournaments since the US Open, Burruchaga has captured two titles (with just one set dropped between them), and gone 6/6 in first-round matches. Here in Montevideo, his history is mixed, as he defeated Tirante and Guillen Meza to reach the quarterfinals in 2023, but suffered a tough first-round loss in 2024. Still, Gomez has only played one career match here in 2024, in which he won just two games in the first round against Gustavo Heide. 

Gomez, a talented player who has consistently battled injuries throughout his career, has had a tough run as of late. Fede has suffered a tough third-set loss in the first round of three consecutive tournaments, despite none of the draws he faced being particularly tough. In general, a lot of Gomez&#x27;s best results this season of actually come on hard courts, where his aggressive game can shine and his lack of fitness can be masked to some extent. However, that lack of fitness was actually brought to the fore in the first round of the US Open, where he actually gave Jack Draper a run for his money but ended up gassing out in the fourth set.

I considered taking the 2-0 here, but I decided that I preferred the ML odds instead. Still, I think that Burruchaga has the game to dominate this one from the start. The sun will be shining, as temperatures are expected to climb above 28 degrees Celsius, and wind gusts will reach above 20 mph, which should have some impact on Gomez&#x27;s signature serve and forehand combination. To me, someone like Burruchaga, who plays with heavy topspin and can extend rallies at will, is simply not the type of player Gomez wants to face right now.

For the odds analysis, we actually have a pretty good comparison match: both players faced off against Juan Pablo Varillas last week in Lima, and while Gomez was priced at around even money (3-set loss, 7.21 performance rating), Burruchaga&#x27;s ML closed at around -333, which implies that he should be closer to that number in this encounter (he did indeed end up winning 6-3, 6-2, with an 8.27/10). Burruchaga was similarly priced in the next round against Alvaro Guillen Meza, who I believe is in better form than Gomez, although he ended up losing that in 3 (7.12/10). Finally, Teelo&#x27;s model gives Roman a 70.3% chance of winning this, which is higher than the 67.43% implied by his ML odds. 

If the market ends up hating this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> as much as my last one, I might have to take a break for a bit. However, I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m expecting that, and the combination of value and risk level makes this a 2-unit play for me.

Event CBB: Kentucky vs Louisville 8PM Eastern Time

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **Ortega Oweh Over 18.5pts** (-118 Fanduel)

Back with another player prop. The UK/Louisville rivalry game is expected to be extremely high scoring. The Over/Under is currently 173 and opened at 169.

Ortega Oweh is the returning top scorer from last years Kentucky team. Oweh cleared this 18.5 line in 7 of his last 11 games last season. Of those 11 games he cleared the line 7/8 games in which he played 26+ minutes. 

With it being a rivalry game and spread being only 3.5 and an O/U of 173 i expect the high scoring and close game and can almost guarantee he will play those 26+mins. More like 32+ imo.

Also, Louisville just allowed 2 different guards for 276th ranked Jackson St go for 20pts &amp; 22pts on a combined 60% FG. Another guard also went for 18pts in the same game. It seems like Louisville will struggle to guard the perimeter players against Kentucky.

Take Ortega Oweh Over 18.5pts</td></tr>

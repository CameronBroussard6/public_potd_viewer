Let&#x27;s give this a go.

First <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>

18:00 CET, basketball, Partizan-Maccabi Tel-Aviv

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: 4/5 units

KK Partizan is in all sorts of turmoil; coach left, fans are booing their own players when they score. Defense is shite and so is the atmosphere in the team. Whether or not the new coach can solidify the team, I think after 3 days of signing that it&#x27;ll not be on time. Maccabi is quite alright on offense.

Maccabi over 84,5+ (I got 1.84 odds)</td></tr>

**ODDS:** 1.86 / -116

https://preview.redd.it/60q5xjf19j9g1.png?width=930&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fdbef41e0a2ad972cc3340363e039607d4713dfb



# Reasoning:

This matchup profiles much more like a tactical, half-court game than a high-scoring one, especially given the current rotations on both sides.

Monaco, even at home, are not a fast-paced team by default. With **Cory Joseph out**, their guard rotation becomes shorter and more ball-dominant through **Mike James and Okobo**, which usually slows the game down and leads to longer possessions rather than early offense.

Real Madrid, on the other hand, are a team that clearly reduce tempo on the road. They prioritize defensive balance, limit transition opportunities and are comfortable playing through structured half-court sets. Against Monaco’s physical perimeter defense and switching schemes, easy points should be limited.

From a matchup standpoint, there is a lot of defensive versatility on the floor: Diallo, Blossomgame and Theis for Monaco, and strong positional defenders on Madrid’s side. This usually translates into contested shots, fewer fast breaks and a game decided more by execution than rhythm.

The total at **174.5** feels a bit inflated for a game where both teams are likely to control pace, especially in the second half. Barring an unusually hot shooting night from both sides, this sets up well for an **under**.</td></tr>

Event:  ABA: Dubai - Krka, 15:00h

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Dubai to win and cover -15.5 handicap, 1.90, 1u

I like all 3 favorites in ABA <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, and I played all 3. I chose this one as the obvious one, first team on the table against the last one, Krka 2-8 score, Dubai 9-0.

Although I like it more when I play Dubai as guests since it makes no difference to them and the handicap is more generous, this should also be covered.

They played their last game on the 23rd, also at home, so they should be rested.

I like to look for some extra reasons, and maybe the fact that a good number of Krka players had Christmas yesterday and had to travel to Dubai is not going to sit well with them. On the other hand, a good number of Dubai players didn&#x27;t even have Christmas yesterday, I counted 8 of them.

Will this matter? I have no idea, but I like it.</td></tr>

Football | EFL Championship | Birmingham vs Derby| in \~3hrs

BTTS @ 1.99

Writeup : Birmingham have been outstanding at home this season and are extremely difficult to beat. They’ve lost just once at home, scored in all 10 home matches, and have hit 2+ goals in 6 of their last 7 there. Defensively, they’re not perfect though — they’ve conceded in their last 3, which has opened the door for BTTS outcomes.  
Overall, Birmingham’s recent matches have been very goal-friendly, with BTTS landing in 7 of their last 8.  
Derby County arrive in excellent scoring form, having scored in 12 straight matches, showing remarkable attacking consistency, and their games have followed the same pattern — BTTS has landed in 9 of their last 10. Derby rarely fail to contribute to the scoreboard, even away from home.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Man United vs Newcastle - Matheus Cunha &amp; Nick Woltemade 1 SOT - 2.15 Odds on Bet365 (1 U to win 1.15 U) 

Cunha has recorded 2, 3, and 3 shots on target in his last three games, and with Amad, Bruno, and Mbuemo missing, he will likely be United’s main attacking outlet. Because of that, it’s reasonable to expect him to be the primary shooter, and I even see some value in backing him for 2 shots on target.
Woltemade, after the disastrous own goal against Sunderland, responded with a brace against Chelsea, and I can see him continuing that form. United are still missing De Ligt and Maguire, and with Yoro struggling for form and Heaven lacking consistency, I expect the German to be heavily involved in the attack.

Last POTD: **Athletic Bilbao v Espanyol: Espanyol DC + u4.5 goals @2.06** 🏆

Todays <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: **Sheffield Wed v Hull City: Hull City ML @1.90**

Sheffield Wednesday are in serious trouble at both ends of the pitch. They’re scoring just 0.8 goals per game with an xG of 0.81, while conceding 2.2 goals per game and allowing 2.35 xGA; all well below league standards. They sit 24th, have 0 wins in their last 5, and haven’t kept a single clean sheet.

Hull City, on the other hand, are flying. They’re 4th in the table, scoring 1.8 goals per game, generating 1.67 xG, and taking 11 shots per match. Defensively they’re solid too, conceding only 1.2 goals per game with a strong 1.02 xGA and a 40% clean-sheet rate.

Our model gives Hull a 51% chance to win, compared to just 25% for Sheffield Wednesday. Bookmakers price Hull at 1.91 (52% implied), which is close to fair but still playable given the massive gap in form, quality, and momentum.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Trae Young 9+ assists (-157 on DK); 5 units

Though tempted to fade the Hawks again, the prior loss has soured me on point spreads for now. So I will move to a hopefully more reliable player prop with a short/simple explanation.

Trae may be a defensive liability, but he is an excellent passer/playmaker and thrives in fast-paced games.

He is over this line in 5 of L5, which includes the 3 games since returning from injury and the 2 games prior to the injury (I am not including the game in which he got injured as he only played 7 minutes). Overall for the season, he is over in 6 of 8 total games played.

The Heat have the highest pace rating in the league this year meaning lots of possessions and high-scoring game, and they are tied for 4th in most assists given up to opposing point guards. They haven&#x27;t faced off this season yet, but against a similarly fast-paced team, Chicago, Trae was over in 3/3 this season.

In Egypt&#x27;s last game against Zimbabwe Marmoush had an insane 4 SOT, one of which ending in a goal. As a City fan, I know Marmoush is going to be using this tournament as his proof to Pep that he deserves more game time at City, and the first game of the tournament proved that. Marmoush was by far the best player on the pitch that day and I see that run of form continuing for the Egyptian. Not many stats to back this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> given there has only been 1 game in the tournament but looking at last game in addition to Omar&#x27;s motives I can see this play does very well, and won&#x27;t be surprised if he wins player of the tournament if Egypt go far.

**Event:** AFCON, Angola v Zimbabwe, 7:30 am EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Zimbabwe Win or Draw + Under 3.5 goals +130, 4 units

**Write Up:** Despite both Angola and Zimbabwe losing their opening AFCON group stage fixtures - Angola narrowly went down 2-1 to South Africa while Zimbabwe were dramatically beaten 2-1 by paper favorites Egypt - there are solid enough reasons to back **Zimbabwe to avoid defeat <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>**. Angola’s AFCON history shows they’ve **only won one of their 10 opening games** at the tournament and have often dropped points in their second fixture after an initial loss, with draws in 1996 and 2006 following opening defeats. Meanwhile, **Zimbabwe have historically absolutely held their own against Angola**, and the overall **H2H is well balanced,** with both teams winning **eight times apiece and registering three draws** across their numerous encounters.

Zimbabwe’s squad is certainly not noticeably weaker than that of Angola, and it carries momentum from the recent goalscoring form, including **Prince Dube**, who scored a silky goal against Egypt, and they’ve shown they can score in successive matches. Angola are missing striker **Zini** through injury, which could blunt their attack and give Zimbabwe a tactical edge. Add to that Angola’s inconsistent form and Zimbabwe’s resilience in tight games, and a **Zimbabwe win or draw** looks like a sensible, value-backed prediction for this crucial AFCON group game. There&#x27;s also the possibility of neither team wanting to risk it ahead of the important Egypt - South Africa clash, thus making the draw even more likely (works for us). I&#x27;m certainly loving this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> and **pairing it with an Under 3.5 match goals** leg (I&#x27;m very positive this will be a **low scoring affair,** *personally feeling a 1-1 or a 2-1 Zimbabwe masterclass).* They&#x27;ve **nearly stunned Egypt,** so why can&#x27;t they take it a step further? Exactly, there&#x27;s no reason they can&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve spent hours researching the underlying data behind this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, so I&#x27;m feeling very confident that it&#x27;s gonna hit and finally release me out of the shackles of the horror run that I&#x27;m having atm - staking 4 units on this. Covering two outcomes and sprinkling an Under feels like great value for these odds, and the more I look at it, the better I feel about this. I don&#x27;t mind the BTTS Yes <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> either, but I&#x27;ve gone with the outlined <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> in the end.

This combination targets value while keeping risk controlled, rather than forcing aggressive lines.

**Write Up:** Happy Boxing Day! Oddly enough there&#x27;s only one match <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, but it&#x27;s bound to be an entertaining one as 7th place Man United hosting 11th place Newcastle. This is an important match as both teams are vying for spots in European football next season. 

Manchester United has been a mixed bag this year. They score a lot of goals and concede a lot of goals, in fact they have the highest # of total goals per match in the EPL. They are currently missing a ton of players, including their leading Goalscorer and leader of assist with Mbuemo,  Bruno Fernandes, and Amad all out due to AFCON/injury. They&#x27;re going to be looking for creativity and Cunha looks tocbe the guy to try to fill those shoes. 

Cunha has been on a year lately, after some injuryy struggles early in the season. In his last 3 games, he has really turned it on. In these last 3 matches, he has averaged 7.3 shots/game, 2.7 SOTs per game, and scored 2 goals. With Bruno now out, I see him getting even more of the ball and taking more shots. The books currently have his as Man U&#x27;s most probable Goalscorer, most probable shot taker, but behind Sesko and Zirkee in probable SOTs. I think this line is mispriced based on these trends, but we will certainly take it. 

Newcastle is a decent team defensively, but play much better at home than on the road. They have not had a lot of tough road tests this season, but notably they conceded 7 SOTs on 15 shots away at Brentford, 9 SOTs on 15 shots away at West Ham (who only had 38% possession). Predicting a lot of shots and goals here - love this line in this spot.

International Hockey U20 - World Junior Championship

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: USA vs. Germany | USA -5.5 (-110)

Time: 6:00pm EST

What’s going on everyone, I&#x27;m back again for my favorite week and a half of the year. If anybody&#x27;s been around, we’ve been on a roll the past few years and looking to continue with more of the same. It’s a pretty even split this year as far as the playing field goes. A clear top 5, a Slovakia team that can be a little scrappy and the last 4 fighting to stay out of relegation.

With that being said, we’re going to start the slate off with the US covering against the Germans. The Americans have the Germans number in this tournament, routinely dominating them year in and year out. The US didn’t bring a gold favorite to the tournament like last year, but they should still comfortably fight for a medal. The Germans on the other hand will be fighting to stay in the top division for another year.

We only have a few pretournament games to go off of for both teams, but luckily for us they already played eachother 4 days ago, with the Americans winning by 8. Germany did start their backup in this game, but it wouldn&#x27;t have mattered much. USA also sat a few of their returnees to get some looks at depth players before the final round of cuts. Expect a pretty big mismatch between a gold medal hopeful and a team trying to just stay afloat to start us off</td></tr>

MIDDLESBROUGH VS BLACKBURN

Date: 26 DECEMBER 2025 at 16:00

BET ON: Match odds- MIDDLESBROUGH

Odd: 1.79



\- Despite their slip-up at Bristol City, Middlesbrough remain the form side and a strong bet to win at Riverside. Under Kim Hellberg, Boro have climbed to second in the Championship thanks to consistent performances and an aggressive, possession-oriented tactical setup that sees them dominate games and control midfield play — a philosophy Hellberg has publicly praised for its intensity and control in recent press comments after big wins like the 4-1 rout of Hull. At home they are particularly dangerous, with seven wins in ten league matches this season and a habit of starting games strongly, making them favorites in front of their supporters. Injuries to Lenihan and Fry are a concern, but Boro’s defensive reinforcements and creative balance — including form attackers Strelec and Conway — mean they have more depth than struggling Blackburn. Conversely, Blackburn’s squad is stretched with key absences including potential issue with Gudjohnsen and other regulars, and coach Valérien Ismaël has recently admitted attitude issues in training, undermining consistency and preparation. With Boro’s clear motivation to consolidate an automatic promotion spot and Blackburn still fighting just to climb away from the bottom, the hosts have both the tactical edge and psychological incentive to take all three points.</td></tr>

Last pick:

Brighton Vs Sunderland 

Brighton win and under 4.5 goals (1.90) ✖️

A game which never looked like producing too many goals, Brighton did finish the game very strong and had Sunderland hanging on but couldn&#x27;t find a way to break them down as time ran out. Ending 0-0.

Premier League 

Manchester United Vs Newcastle 

Matheus Chuna 2 or more shots on target.

(2.10) 2.5 units 

Both teams come into this game with a good portion of missing players, United missing some key attackers, Newcastle missing a lot of key players in defense.

With so many players on international duty or out with injuries, Chuna should get the full 90 minutes here to find these shots on target. He&#x27;s been in good form as of late coming back from an injury, 2 goals and an assist in his last 3 games.

Shot wise his breakdown is as followed for the past few games.

Aston villa away: **6 shots 3 on target**

Bournemouth at home: **8 shots 3 on target**

Wolves away **8 shots 2 on target**

Newcastle are also a team that really struggles to perform well away from home , they average about 7 shots on target conceded away from home if you take out the derby game against Sunderland last away game, which was a hard watch, constant fouls as it was a fierce rivalry match,  which meant there was very few chances for either side.

Chuna is a very direct player, great at picking up the ball from deep and going on a run and getting shots away, he should again get plenty of shooting opportunities to cover this line again like he has been for the past few weeks and for the price were getting it&#x27;s too good for me to pass up a bet on this.

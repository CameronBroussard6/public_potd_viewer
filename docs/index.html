Last Pick: Nebraska -7 (-125) (1U) ✅

Easy winner! If you hopped off the train after 4 straight wins and a bad UConn loss then you done messed up!! We don’t lose two in a row baby! For those who remained on the train we cashed in tonight on a soft line!🤣🤣

Event: South Carolina vs Butler (NCAAB) (1pm central) 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Butler -1.5 (-110) (1U)

-everything is bet to win unit amount-

Write up: 

When you break this matchup down, Butler simply profiles as the more polished team heading into this neutral-site tournament. Through four games, the Bulldogs are averaging 95.8 points per game on 49% shooting from the field and an elite 40.2% from three. Compare that to South Carolina, who despite their 4-0 start, are hitting just 39% from the field and 33% from deep. That gap in perimeter efficiency is massive: Butler is knocking down over 10 threes per game, while the Gamecocks are closer to 6–7 per game, meaning the Bulldogs can stretch defenses and create separation quickly. Butler also dominates the glass, pulling down 46 rebounds per game with a +15 margin, showing they’re not just a finesse team but one that controls possessions.

Tempo is another key differentiator. Butler plays at the 70th-ranked adjusted tempo, reflecting Thad Matta’s fast-paced style that emphasizes quick possessions and high shot volume. They average 65 field goal attempts per game, compared to South Carolina’s 60 attempts, and they convert those looks at far superior splits. South Carolina, meanwhile, ranks 270th in adjusted tempo, preferring slower, grind-it-out possessions. That’s a dangerous mismatch against Butler’s pace and shooting, especially on a neutral floor where early-season chemistry matters.
Continuity matters in November tournaments, and Butler has it. Matta’s squad features returning contributors like leading guard Finley Bizjack, who have stepped seamlessly into bigger roles, and a slew of talented transfers in Michael Ajayi off a solid year at Gonzaga who is averaging a double double and Jalen Jackson (senior) who was a 20ppg player on a competitive IPFW team for two years while South Carolina is still piecing together rotations with transfers like Meechie Johnson, who has bounced between Ohio State and Columbia multiple times. That lack of stability shows in the Gamecocks’ reliance on depth—ten players averaging double-digit minutes—but depth doesn’t equal cohesion. Butler’s core has been built within the program, and their offensive chemistry is evident in their 21 assists per game compared to South Carolina’s 13.8.
South Carolina’s bench explosion against Radford (50 points) looks impressive on paper, but Butler is a different animal. The Bulldogs’ defense is holding opponents to 43% shooting and just 28% from three, meaning those secondary scorers won’t find the same rhythm. Meanwhile, Butler’s offensive leaders are efficient: Bizjack is shooting 47.8% from three, Jamie Kaiser Jr. is at 42.1%, and Jalen Jackson adds another 40% from deep. South Carolina’s top scorer, Meechie Johnson, is hitting only 39% from the field, and while his 40% from three is respectable, he doesn’t have the supporting cast of consistent shooters to match Butler’s arsenal.

The one weakness for Butler has been turnovers—15 per game—but this is mitigated by South Carolina’s inability to force them. The Gamecocks rank 324th nationally in steals and average just 11 turnovers themselves, meaning Butler’s Achilles heel is unlikely to be exploited here. In fact, Butler’s pace and shot volume should magnify their efficiency advantage, while South Carolina’s slower style leaves them vulnerable to runs.

Finally, Butler has already proven they can compete against continuity and talent, going on the road and losing by just two to an SMU team loaded with returning pieces. That performance showed Butler’s guards can handle pressure and execute in tough environments. On a neutral court, with their superior shooting, rebounding margin, faster tempo, and more cohesive backcourt, Butler’s continuity at the pg position should shine.

Bottom line: Butler’s shooting edge, rebounding margin, and program continuity make them the right side. South Carolina’s depth is smoke and mirrors against elite competition, and their slower tempo won’t hold up against Butler’s pace. My power ratings make this closer to -4, so laying -1.5 is tremendous value. Butler is the play. I would bet this right now! As every bet I submit the lines change shortly after. Nebraska was -6.5 when I bet it last night and closed at -8.5 this morning, and still won by double digits like I said! Let’s get a win with butler and take this momentum into another successful football weekend! As always, cheers 🍻

Update: line has already moved to 2.5… not too worried there but definitely get in there before anything more</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>POTD RECORD: 174-129

Season record: 11-6

Last POTD: __Jalen Suggs O4.5 AST @1.86 1U__ ✅

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: __Davion Mitchell O6.5 AST @1.86 1U (Bet365)__

NBA | Bulls vs Heat | 🏀  

Suggs gets it done with 5 minutes left in the first half what a beast, we move 6-1 run.

NBA Cup games is back and this just stands out immediately, we get a high total of 247.5 in this one and it’s for the right reasons. Heat is ranked #1 in pace this season whilst Bulls are ranked 4th, expect a high speed high scoring game here which is golden for assist props. Cup game should mean starters playing more minutes with every point mattering, lost minutes last game due to foul trouble but should be in store for 30+ minutes here at least.

With 29+ minutes Davion is over in 7/10 games this season avg 8 assists per game &amp; 13.6 potentials per game. Over in 3/3 H2H against the Bulls with those same filters Avg 8.3 assists per game.

Davion is leading the Heat team in passes made per game, assists per game and potential assists per game, so expect Davion to keep facilitating and run the offense in what should be a great game.</td></tr>

Write Up:  
 




Raptors are coming in hot after taking down the Sixers yesterday, and this is a great spot for them. The Wizards might be down two bigs — Sarr is questionable and Bagley is basically doubtful. If both sit, they’re stuck rolling with Vukcevic, and yeah… he’s fine offensively but he’s not stopping anybody on defense.


With Washington’s frontcourt that thin, Toronto should eat inside , easy paint touches, putbacks, second-chance points, all of that. And the Wizards’ defense is already a mess: they turn it over a ton, don’t rebound well, and get cooked in transition.


Put it all together and it’s a perfect setup for Toronto to pull away and cover big. This matchup really favors the Raptors. Expecting Blowout here .

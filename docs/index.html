Damm ML @ 1.74 (1u)

Writeup - Damm&#x27;s been returning well in Montpellier contrary to his usual return stats and has beaten Hurcakz and a washed RBA in straight sets. A lot depends here on his big lefty serve and in case of a TB ,  Damm with his big serve should have an edge over Nardi is by no means any slouch and he&#x27;s very talented but he&#x27;s still coming off a challenger final in Bahrain and imo is more likely to falter here than Damm.   
  
Nardi is 2-4 against lefties in his last 6 matches and 14-21 career which kind of gives Damm and edge here and has the perfect game suited to Indoors and is well acclimatised to the conditions

Hope we get the W &amp; BoL</td></tr>

**Write Up:** Lovely Rivalry to Get The Curling Day Started With some Great Matchups On The Day. Yesterday Canada played twice winning 6-3 against Norway and a huge 7-2 against Italy. Italy was the favourite to win gold coming into the tournament especially being on home ice and coming in as current Mixed Doubles World Champions. USA also played twice beating Switzerland 7-4 and Norway 8-6 With the Norway Match being much closer and only winning in the 8th end with Norway missing their last stone. With Canada coming off of their great win vs Italy as well as some extra motivation because they are playing their rival I see them winning this match by at least 2 points.

Writeup:

* Can&#x27;t catch a break recently unfortunately some times nothing swings your way, TigeRES right projected map, 10-2 lead and choked the game away.
* Knight is averaging the most kills of any mid laner in any of the 4 major leagues currently and it isn&#x27;t even close, with Knight at 5.8 kills per game with the next highest being CallMe at 4.4, this isn&#x27;t just a small sample size thing as Knight showed this last season as well averaging the most kills in the LPL again in all of 2025 at 5.2 kills per game, again by far the most in the league
* Shanks is averaging the 5th most kills at 3.8 kills per game, he had a really slow start to the split in terms of kills but has been picking up his numbers recently, off the back of a couple of big Orianna performances
* On one hand, I will stand by that this LPL roster is the most talented LPL roster put forward in the last 5 years in terms of raw talent for BLG, the pieces haven&#x27;t looked great and they have undoubtably been shaky throughout the season, however AL haven&#x27;t been as good as I expected, their drafts have really taken a hit as has their mid/late game macro. BLG have looked slightly better recently and I still don&#x27;t think they have hit their peak at all yet, and are getting closer by the weak
* BLG have the entire lingering incident of Bin rage quitting the team, but he came back and they have won back to back clean 2-0s against IG/WBG. Last time they faced off BLG hand checked them throughout game 2 and game 3, went completely different then how I expected. BLG are currently the favorites to win this map and see almost no world Knight misses a h2h against Shanks in a map win.
* Knight is 25-17 against Shanks h2h in his career, in the L3 years, Knight is 19/19 hitrate against Shanks in the h2h matchup in map wins meaning he has never missed this line when his team wins the map, but also has beaten Shanks 3 times when losing the map in the h2h, as well as putting up significantly higher kill averages overall. Knight has averaged 4.94 kills per game against Shanks in the L3 years h2h, while Shanks is averaging 3.42 kills against Knight in the same period despite similar identical h2h records in that period)</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: **UConn -1.5 (-104 FanDuel) 2U**

Event: CBB | UConn @ St. John&#x27;s (7 p.m. EST) | 🏀

*Recap: Honor Huff scored 16 points - all in the second half - as WVU erased a 14-point deficit to win outright. They absolutely strangled Cincinnati after the break. Color me impressed.*

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s reasoning:** What. 👏 A. 👏 Game. 👏 This will be. We get the fifth-most efficient defense in NCAA, according to KenPom, travelling to the second-most prolific scoring offense in the Big East. If we&#x27;re getting what is essentially a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>&#x27;em for a line, then there are so many more reasons to hitch your wagon to the Huskies. Not the least of which is straight-up revenge. Let&#x27;s dive in.

Forget KenPom, UConn (22-1) ranks even higher with Bart Torvik, where the Huskies are second in adjusted defensive efficiency and third in effective field goal percentage defense - and that&#x27;s for all of NCAA, not just the Big East. UConn also ranks sixth in 3-point percentage defense. Plus, opponents are only hitting 40.4 percent of close two-pointers (shots within the restricted area). This is a UConn defense that grabs you by the throat and squeezes the shooting life out of you. In its last outing, UConn held Xavier to 36 percent en route to a 32-point win. All that to say this: UConn is tops in the Big East, allowing 63.8 points per game - good for ninth in all the land.

And yes, St. John&#x27;s *is* an impressive 10-2 at home. But they can be got, especially by a UConn team that hasn&#x27;t lost on the road. St. John&#x27;s first home defeat came in its second game of the season, when the Johnnies (17-5) tried to get into a track meet with Alabama. St. John&#x27;s lost, 103-96, despite making 49 percent from the field and attempting 40 free throws. We&#x27;ll chalk that up to a system loss early in the season. But the second home loss came on Jan. 3, with a 77-71 defeat at the hands of sub-.500 Providence, when the Friars were getting 14.5 points. In that game, St. John&#x27;s was held to 28 percent shooting - 22 percent from beyond the arc - and missed 13 of their 37 free throws. There is the blueprint for beating St. John&#x27;s. Mind you, Providence&#x27;s KenPom defensive rating is 190 spots below UConn, which is currently holding conference opponents to a league-best 39.5 percent shooting and 28.5 from beyond the arc. If St. John&#x27;s isn&#x27;t shooting well, I suspect they&#x27;ll revert to bully ball and try to earn free points at the charity stripe.

Meanwhile, St. John&#x27;s recent shooting has been bipolar in general. Over their last five contests, they&#x27;ve hit over 50 percent twice (56, 51) and exactly 35 percent twice, including their previous outing - a 68-56 win over DePaul on Tuesday. To be fair, St. John&#x27;s might&#x27;ve been looking ahead to UConn, and they *did* cover, but I think the Huskies pose a unique challenge. St. John&#x27;s is third in the Big East in rebounding, just ahead of UConn. On the other hand, the Huskies might negate that advantage with their first-place ranking in opponent rebounding.

As for offense, UConn is *the* best shooting team in the Big East at 48.8 percent. KenPom has their offensive efficiency ranked No. 25 I&#x27;m the NCAA (St. John&#x27;s is 26). Interestingly, UConn&#x27;s adjusted tempo ranks quite low (310). Basically, they find the best shot each time down the court in a controlled, methodical way. To wit, UConn ranks 12th in NCAA in assists, and 23rd in assist-to-turnover ratio. When they hit their shots *AND* play suffocating defense, the result is the 10th best scoring margin in the nation at +15.7 points per game. For context, Duke leads with +20.5. I just don&#x27;t see how St. John&#x27;s plays within a possession. And did I mention they shoot incredibly well? UConn is making 65 percent of their shots in the paint, and they&#x27;re getting nearly 10 percent of their shot attempts from dunks.

Devil&#x27;s advocate: UConn does foul teams. They&#x27;re second-worst in the Big East in opponent attempts, although St. John&#x27;s isn&#x27;t exactly crushing it from the free-throw line. St. John&#x27;s *is* really good at forcing turnovers. The Red Storm rank second in the Big East in turnover margin (UConn is middle of the pack). Oh, and the Huskies have been awful against the number, going 8-15 ATS. If you want the records, UConn is 5-7 ATS in Big East play, 3-3 on the road in conference, and 4-3 on the road all season. But this is basically a bet that they will win by one measly basket in a hostile environment. On the other hand, St. John&#x27;s is 5-7 ATS at home, including 2-3 ATS in conference home games. So if bully ball doesn&#x27;t result in easy points, and St. John&#x27;s isn&#x27;t turning the Huskies over, what else is left?

There&#x27;s another consideration. Revenge. St. John&#x27;s swept UConn last year, including a 14-point loss the last time these teams played on this court. Don&#x27;t think Solo Ball and Alex Karaban have forgotten. My thesis: St. John&#x27;s will struggle to shoot and try to bully its way to points or simply outrun UConn. But I think St. John&#x27;s shoots sub-40 percent shooting, while UConn plays its steady, methodical offense. Despite their spread woes this season, the Huskies have covered two in a row. Let&#x27;s make it three.

Good luck and Godspeed!

Chaves vs Penafiel, Over 2.5 goals @ 2.1

Chaves host Penafiel in a competitive Segunda Liga clash where both sides need points. Chaves at home usually play attacking football and have scored regularly in recent matches. Penafiel also arrive in good scoring form and often leave space at the back. Recent meetings have produced open chances and defensive mistakes. With both teams pushing forward, this fixture has strong potential to finish with over 2.5 goals. Expect goals here.</td></tr>

Anyway, Sweden are underdogs in this one against Great Britain. Despite the loss to Estonia, Sweden has looked like the strongest team at the event so far.

Time: 9:00 AM EST

​<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Heroic -1.5 Maps @ 1.93 odds (3u)

​Write Up:

I know, Heroic has been frustrating to watch in the Group Stage. They’ve been throwing leads and making games harder than they need to be. But this is the play-ins now. It’s a BO3, not a random BO1, and the skill gap here is just massive.

Rekonix is a fun Indonesian stack (Jikroy,  inYourdreaM and Fbz), but they are completely outclassed here. They are riding a losing streak and have struggled to take maps off actual Tier 1 teams. They just don&#x27;t have the macro to punish Heroic for 2 straight games.

Heroic played Rekonix in the Group Stage yesterday, and it was a massacre. Heroic stomped them 23-7 in just 24 minutes. They ran over them in the laning phase, took every objective, and didn&#x27;t give Rekonix a single inch of the map.

Heroic is ranked #9 in the world for a reason. They need a clean confidence booster, and a BO3 against a Tier 2 squad is exactly where they lock in.

Sometimes you don&#x27;t overthink it. You just bet on them to do it again the next day.

​BOL.

Tennis | Davis Cup World Group I (Kazakstan vs Monaco) + Cleveland Challenger | Times TBD

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Alexander Bublik vs Hugo Nys | **Bublik to win 2-0 at -500.**

Borna Gojo vs Quinn Vandecasteele | **Gojo ML at -364.**

**Combined odds: -192 (DK). 1 unit.**

Write-up: Gojo closed at -312, and while he faced a break point early in the first set, it was smooth sailing after that. 

Reasoning for the first leg is pretty simple: Hugo Nys is a solid doubles player, but he hasn&#x27;t stepped foot on the singles court in over a year. In fact, he hasn&#x27;t been a full-time singles player since 2020, with his only singles appearances since then consisting of two as an alternate into ATP qualifying (this can sometimes happen when no singles players are available on site), two as a wildcard into his home Monte-Carlo tournament, and two Davis Cup appearances due to a lack of options for Monaco beyond Valentin Vacherot. In the 3 Monte-Carlo appearances, he faced Munar, Ruusuvuori, and Rinderknech, had higher odds than this in all of those matches (even though I think this is an even tougher matchup), and lost all of them 2-0. He did actually score one win over Morrocco&#x27;s Yassine Dlimi at the 2024 Davis Cup; however, Dlimi is an ITF-level player, and Nys was still priced as a significant underdog. Bublik obviously has a massive advantage in this matchup, and the only concerns would be him not taking things seriously or Nys somehow servebotting his way to a set on indoor hard. In terms of Bublik&#x27;s motivation, I feel like he&#x27;s become a new player in that regard lately, and he&#x27;ll be playing in front of a home crowd in Astana, one of his primary training bases. In addition, the surface being used (GreenSet Comfort) isn&#x27;t known for being particularly fast, and it&#x27;s hard to see Nys consistently holding serve, especially as he&#x27;s far from the biggest server on the doubles tour. I expect Bublik to serve well and take control of this from the start. 

For the second leg of this play, I&#x27;m going with Gojo again, this time to defeat Quinn Vandecasteele in the quarterfinals. As I mentioned in my last write-up, I think this could be a week where Gojo wins the title, and I don&#x27;t see Vandecasteele being able to stop him. Quinn has had a long week, playing four matches back-to-back (6.68/10, 6.45, 6.61, 6.82), and I don&#x27;t see him at the same level as Boyer. If you want evidence, he was a +175 dog against Cassone in R32; Boyer faced off against Cassone a couple weeks ago and was favored. As a result, I don&#x27;t think these odds should be so close to where Gojo closed against Boyer. Vandecasteele is a solid grinder, but I don&#x27;t think he has the weapons to keep up with Gojo on these fast courts.</td></tr>

**Explanation:**

Dalla Valle has been on a good run in this tournament already winning 4 matches and only throwing one set to a really well playing Bertola, who was just in a final last week. I see multiple reasons for Dalla to win this match

1) He is leading their H2H with a 1-0, winning their last match 2-0

2) He has played 4 good matches already and qualified to this tournament, while Romano got a wild card. I see him in better shape and form right now.

3) He is ranked better and got more experience than the young Romano, who is only 20 years old.

I see a good value in this bet and good luck!

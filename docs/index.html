Football | Netherlands Eerste Divisie | AZ Alkmaar II vs Dordrecht | in \~17hrs

BTTS &amp; o2.5 @ 1.62 (1u)

Writeup: Going back to the Netherlands lower division to try my luck again. This event has been hit in all of Jong AZ&#x27;s last five games and four of Dordrecht&#x27;s last five games. Only concern would be their last meeting was a 1-1 draw, though that was a few months ago. Lets just hope we see the goal in first half.

Hope we get the W &amp; BoL</td></tr>

Fenerbahce vs Genclerbirligi, OVER 5.5 CORNERS FIRST HALF @3

Fenerbahce take on Genclerbirligi in a game where corner opportunities should be frequent. Fenerbahce play very attacking football at home, using wide players and fullbacks to deliver constant crosses into the box. Genclerbirligi are likely to sit deep and defend for long periods, which usually results in plenty of set-piece situations. With strong pressure expected from the hosts and counterattacks from the visitors, over 5.5 corners at odds of 3.00 looks a very solid option.</td></tr>

Last pick:  Inter -1 Asian handicap @1.70 ✅

Event: Roma vs Cagliari 

Time: 2:45 Pm EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Roma -1 Asian handicap @1.85


Cagliari is on a very good streak, 3 wins in a row Including Juventus, Roma on the other hand, is 3 games without a win, so why are we betting on Roma and on Monday? Well Roma rotated in UEL, because they need to focus in top 4, specially after Juventus dropped points, I can&#x27;t hide that I also like Cagliari +1 but the Olímpico stadium will be a deciding factor, Cagliari strength is a solid defense but I believe Gasperini can figure them out.

In boca al lupo</td></tr>

### ⚽ <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Estudiantes de La Plata ML @ 1.82 (-122) - 1.5 Units

**8 IN A ROW.** The derby was exactly the war we expected—8 yellow cards and another 3-unit bomb cashed. We are on an absolute heater, but we stay disciplined. Back to a 1.5-unit play for tomorrow.

* **The Matchup:** Estudiantes is playing at home, where they are incredibly solid. They are arguably the strongest team in Argentina outside of the &quot;Big 5.&quot; They have a clear tactical identity and a much higher quality roster than their opponents.
* **The Opponent:** Riestra is a &quot;peculiar&quot; team. They are known for being very physical, &quot;dirtying&quot; the game, and having strong ties with AFA officials (which often leads to favorable refereeing). However, in terms of actual football and talent, they are tiers below Estudiantes.
* **The Play:** If Estudiantes plays their game and doesn&#x27;t get frustrated by Riestra&#x27;s antics, they should take the 3 points comfortably. The 1.82 price offers great value considering the massive gap in quality.

PORTO VS SPORTING

Date: 09 FEBRUARY 2026 at 21:45

BET ON: Both teams to score- Yes

Odd: 1.92



\- Porto’s Francesco Farioli has made it abundantly clear in the lead-up press that his side will not sit back after their surprising loss to Casa Pia, emphasizing repeatedly that Porto must enter the clássico with “atitude e grande espírito” and proactive aggression, using the rare full week of preparation to work specifically on ball entries, transitions and high pressing patterns — a sign he plans to impose his typical vertical, possession-oriented attacking style rather than bottleneck into a low block. Sporting’s Rui Borges, on the other hand, has publicly stated that his team only thinks about winning even if the game isn’t “decisivo” for the title, underlining his motivation to attack with purpose and not simply manage the match, which fits his tactical profile of possession control, dynamic wing play and pressure after loss seen in training reports this week. Porto’s defensive lines are weakened by suspensions and absentees, forcing Farioli into a less familiar back setup that could be exploited on transitions, while Sporting, although also missing squad members through injury, has repeatedly trained with a compact midfield and quick vertical passes to exploit half-spaces — a risky but attacking-leaning tactical setup. With both coaches stressing attacking intent and competitive spirit in their Portuguese press build-ups, and tactical plans that favor forward momentum rather than containment, BTTS Yes becomes a highly plausible outcome.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Donyell Malen 2+ SOT (+110) 1 unit to win 1.1 units

**Write Up:** We can&#x27;t catch a break, Semenyo had a great chance at the start of the 2nd half and opted to blast his shot into the keeper rather than find a corner. These <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> plays have become sacrificial plays, unfortunately. But we will turn it around, please tail with caution while I recalibrate.

No EPL <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> so we&#x27;re going to head to Italy and try out Serie A. But the player we&#x27;re backing <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> will be familiar to many of you who have followed my picks. Malen, the ex-Aston Villa striker, was sent to Roma a few weeks back on loan. Since joining he has only played 3 Serie A matches, but has racked up some great numbers in those games. He is averaging 5 shots and 2 SOTs per game, scoring one goal between the three matches. He has recieved fantastic praise from the coach and I&#x27;m excited to see what he can do for Roma through the rest of the season.

BOL and happy Monday!</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Famalicao over 0.5 goals + AVS over 2.5 corners @ 1.75 - 1.5 Units


Avs might be last in the league but they get a great matchup to get corners here and also get a good amount themselves. Avs in away games average around 4.20 for, whereas Famalicao  allow 5.70 at home. Famalicao with 3+ corners allowed in 10/10 home games this season and in 19/20 total games. AVS getting 3+ in 7/9 away games. AVS got 5 corners in the reverse matchup this season. Now onto the single goal for Famalicao, with their scoring form especially recently it looks almost guaranteed - in most recent 3 games at home they scored 3,2,4 on better sides and have scored 1+ in 7/10 home games, now they get pretty much the worst team in the league vs them who have 28 allowed goals in 9 games away.</td></tr>

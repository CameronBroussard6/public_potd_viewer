**Write Up:** Galatasaray have won almost all their home matches this season. In 4 of their last 5 matches, there were over 2.5 goals.

Not a lot of data to go off of since this is the first game of the season. However, UNC was 41-6 last year, and ECU was 35-27. Both teams are also playing at their home stadiums which I&#x27;m banking on that to be worth a run or two.

Write Up: MOH is undefeated, and they&#x27;re playing at home. Where Ohio is losing to other MAC opponents, MOH is beating them. Ohio is especially bad on the road, allowing over 80ppojts a game (though one of those was 106 points to Louisville, but their average is still high 70s on the road without that one). 


MOH has been on the road the last two games, and they&#x27;ll be at home on a Friday night for this one. No classes tomorrow, students will be out to support their undefeated team. 3 of Ohio&#x27;s last 5 losses have been double digits, and all to teams MOH beat.

We go back to the well, I particular like this play based off Wrexham scoring in their last 9/10 games (7 of these being BTTS). On the other side while Ipswich comes into this game 2nd in their respected league in goals scored, 71% of their games have ended with both teams scoring.

I could see this game ending 2-1 with Ipswich taking the dub.</td></tr>

3-0 ✅ <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: North Carolina A&amp;T over UNC Wilmington women’s basketball. I Usually post in r/Kalshi figured I’d join here. 
Here’s the kindergarten‑level version of why I’m slapping $2,000 on North Carolina A&amp;T: they’ve beaten UNC Wilmington five straight times, not once, not twice, not “split the series,” but FIVE. IN. A. ROW. Since 2013, UNCW hasn’t touched them, and that kind of dominance isn’t random — it’s a matchup edge that keeps showing up. A&amp;T consistently wins the rebounding battle, forces UNCW into bad possessions, and controls the tempo in a way that kills volatility, which is exactly what you want when you’re putting real money down. UNCW’s offense has been shaky, their late‑game execution has been rough, and the books still price these mid‑major games soft because the public doesn’t follow them closely. That’s where the value is. A&amp;T has the history, the style advantage, and the momentum, and that’s why this is the lock. If that’s still not simple enough, I can draw it in crayon next.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Wisconsin Team Total o77.5

**Odds // Units:** DraftKings (+199) 1u

**Write-up:** No NBA, so we&#x27;re moving to the game of the night in NCAAB. Michigan St has been elite on defense, holding most teams below 70 for the entire season. So why the hell are we taking Wisconsin to get 78? Well, because Wisconsin is consistently getting 80-100 points a game this season, granted, against cans. Against top-ranked teams and top-ranked defenses, Wisconsin has dropped 78 points 3/7 times. In two of their last three games, they got 92 points. This team plays so much better at home, where they have covered 11/14 times, averaging 86 ppg. Boyd and Blackwell have ignited Wisconsins offensive. This one-two punch combo can beat you in a variety of ways.  In Boyd&#x27;s last 6 games at home hes reached 20 points + Blackwell is averaging 18.7 ppg. Wisconsin&#x27;s offensive attack has been ELITE at home; they rank 91st in tempo and push the pace. They limit turnovers, ranking 14th. They also shoot the hell out of the three, where 51% of their shots come from, shooting 35%. Michigan St ranks 42nd in opponent three-point %, at 31%, but has slipped up defensively at 36%. Michigan St. has been getting burned in their last four games, allowing 79, 83, 76, and 82. On average, those teams went 12 points over their team total line (Wisconsin&#x27;s is 71-72). Here are those teams&#x27; offensive scoring ranks this year:

* Illinois 22nd
* Minnesota 255th
* Michigan 3rd
* Rutgers 279th
* **Wisconsin 34th**

Expect this game to go to the final seconds, if not OT. These two teams play each other hard. Wisconsin has been HOT lately and should be winners of their last 9/10. They should be a little more desperate as well, since they sit on the edge of making or not making the NCAA Tournament. Bit of a long shot tonight, so do not go crazy with your unit sizing. Like I mentioned game could go to OT to cash. And yes, I have Wisconsin winning if you couldn&#x27;t tell, haha. GL</td></tr>

Basketball | NCAAM | 18:00pm CST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Quinnipiac @ Siena u143.5 (-110) - 1u

New here.. I’m just a guy who loves betting cbb unders. This game sets up as a slower, half-court matchup anchored by Siena’s deliberate tempo. Neither offense consistently generates easy points, and both teams rely more on structured execution than transition scoring. With limited foul inflation and a tight spread, the game environment points toward fewer possessions and controlled scoring rather than volatility.

The main risk would be an unexpected pace spike or both teams shooting well from three, which could push efficiency above typical expectations. 

Looks like a great combination for an under to me and I’m not so worried about the risk, so I’m rolling. BOL!</td></tr>

Hocevar has won in the trucks before even winning a season championship back in 2023. He has 5 wins across 81 truck starts and 34 top 10s.

Rennes vs Psg , over 3.6 goals @2


PSG matches are rarely quiet, especially against attacking sides like Rennes who are strong at home and willing to press high. When PSG score early, games often open up quickly with space on the counter. Both teams have the quality in attack to contribute, and Ligue 1 fixtures involving PSG regularly produce high totals. Over 3.5 goals offers strong value in what could be an open, entertaining game</td></tr>

Second day of group C in modus super series. Coleman finishing 4-1 with leg differential of +11 and Platt finishing 1-4 with a leg differential of -9. Platt always plays one week in the Modus super series and his average is always around the 77. Yesterday was not any different. He averaged 78.53 in those 5 games, with a checkout percentage of 31%. Coleman is an average player, averaging 85 in the last 12 months. Yesterday, he had an average of 85.26 with a checkout percentage of 42%. I expect to see the same stats <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. I don&#x27;t see any reason why Coleman shouldn&#x27;t be able to cover this one.

It is a short format, only going to 4 legs, so only betting 1u.

**Write Up:** The top three athletes will most likely be Norwegians and while I consider one of them a &quot;lock&quot;, the odds are too low and the value is just not there. Instead, the value is at Hoesfot Klaebo. Those of you who&#x27;ve been following the Winter Olympics have probably noticed Desloges performances and I recon he&#x27;s the main danger for the Norwegians. I&#x27;ll be laddering Desloges to place 1-3 as well.

**Event:** Dortmund vs Mainz

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Dortmund ML + o1,5 goals @1,81

**WriteUp:** Dortmund is a menace at home in the Bundesliga. They won their last 5 games, they scored at least 2 goals in their last 7 games, they are in great form. They are the most in form team in the last 6 games in the Bundesliga. My only concern is Mainz is gaining momentum in their home games, but away they are atrocious - only beating Leipzig (while being worse in every stat during the game + Mainz had a penalty) since 2025 September.  They also had a lucky draw in december against Bayern who had 4,5 xg and scored 2 goals compared to mainz&#x27;s 0,6 xg and 2 goals. They were completely outclassed.
All things considered I don&#x27;t think Mainz can get points against the 2nd best team in the league in front of their home crowd.</td></tr>

Match: Hull City v Chelsea &amp; Rennes v PSG

Time: 20:45 &amp; 19:00 CET

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Chelsea ML + PSG ML (1.73)

Reasoning: 

Even away from home, the quality gap here is significant. Chelsea have far greater squad depth and come from a borderline shocking draw against Leeds so they will want to bounce back. Rosenoir has been great since coming in as the head coach of the Blues and doesn’t seem to rotate a lot. Even though some rotation will for sure take place, even the second team of Chelsea is capable of beating Hull <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. I don’t see them throwing the FA Cup tonight, they have the depth to compete in all competitions. Hull may compete physically at home, but over 90 minutes the technical and tactical superiority should show.

PSG are still operating at a different level than most domestic opponents. Their attacking output remains among the highest in the league, and they consistently create high xG chances regardless of venue. Lens is only two points behind them so there is no place for mistakes. I would think they want to have a comfortable lead before their UCL campaign starts again. On top of that Rennes has been in terrible form  and I don’t think they are a match here for PSG who battered them 5-0 on their previous encounter this season.

**Short Write Up:** 

This hit 4 out of 5 last games (including domestic) so I value it 80% possibility of hitting

Books value it at 1.57 that means 1/1.57=63%

So our <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> edge is 17%

Tubelis is becoming the main man for Zalgiris when it comes to scoring while Francisco is becoming more of a playmaker and while getting double teamed every possession he opens shooting opportunities for his team mates including our man

Tubelis is playing 25-30 minutes out of 40 available that&#x27;s plenty of time for a player to score at least 1 three while shooting 3-5 three pointers per game</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: NBL (Wildcats v Bullets) Dylan Windler over 24.5 PRA 2u** $1.80 (Bet365) 9:40PM AEDT

With the guards back for Perth, Windler should resume his natural forward position and will be in a position to crash the boards a lot more, not having to initiate with ball in hand. 

Brisbane are gonna jack up shots. And they havent been very good at hitting them. With Harrison back and Holt a big body, the thin Perth centers will need all the help they can get with rebounding. 

Brisbane don&#x27;t have anyone this athletic at the forward position and given how nice his shot has been recently, this line seems low. He has slowed down with the 3s but with no McDaniel bothering him, he should find his way to the rim quite easily. Once he has that threat, the 3 should open up and hes been knocking them down at a decent rate lately. Doolittle and Duke will find him. 

2U only because Brisbane sucks and a blowout is on the cards.

Hangtuah started strong, but as the league progresses, it seems to be coming back to its place. They still have a decent 5-4 score, but they are definitely not a top 5 team in this league. A comfortable 20-point loss against Satria 57-77 showed this; they may hold on in the first half, but I don&#x27;t see them keeping this under 14-15 points, if Pelita plays it strong until the end of course.</td></tr>

Write-up: Not much to say here. I&#x27;m sticking to my words from my last post. Whoever can hold the ball for more than 10 shots against Dostanic is gotta win and i think Pieczkowski is him. He comfortably defeated Vandecasteele in 2 last match and i expect him to at least give Dostanic some trouble. The only thing a bit concerning about all this is the high odds that feels like a trap, but im assuming the bookies still hold Dostanic as a strong favorite cuz of his pretty good run after the US Open being 16-4, but all those wins came against average opposition so taking a set off of him is gonna be achievable for Pieczkowski. And at 2.20 there&#x27;s plenty value so I&#x27;ll take it.

Dahlin is a top defenseman for Sweden. He had the 2nd most TOI and 3 points last game against Italy. Dahlin is expected to be the lone blue-liner for the Swedish PP1.

As an NHLer, Dahlin ranks 13th (out of 187 defensemen w/ 500+ TOI) in xGF/60 and 17th in actual GF/60. He&#x27;s 7th among D-man in points.

Parlay: India A women ML + Gàlfi ML @ 1.75 (1u)

Writeup - Galfi has already beaten Kalinina here and these Oeiras courts are not standard fast indoor courts, instead they play medium slow, which helps players with good rally tolerance. Galfi is playing quite well here, while Vidmanova is struggling and huffing her way to victories, with her poor return play and her serve not suiting these conditions.  
I see this being a very routine 2 setter and wouldnt be surprised if Galfi covers a big spread like a -4.5 or better here. My only worry here would be WTA being WTA :)

The 2nd bet is a very low odds, backing the favourites bet, to boost our overall odds for the day. Unless India really tanks, their player quality should get them an easy win, even if it&#x27;s their B team

Kobe also played on Tuesday as they had little problem beating FC Seoul in the ACL 2-0 and should have done it with a bigger scoreline. 

Nagasaki got somewhat humbled by Sanfrecce Hiroshima that beat them 3-1 at their own ground in their return to top division football, it was a pretty decent game and could quickly have seen more goals for both teams. 

It looks like Skibbe has eased in pretty nicely as Kobe manager and hasn’t really changed much yet on the team, it does look like they will use this Special Tournament to figure out the team a bit before going big before the real season starts. However, it is still important to do well in this cup as a spot in the ACL for next season is on the line. Nagasaki of the newly promoted teams has done the most business in winter and does look like the best team to cope with this new level.

I think Vissel Kobe should win this in regular play, but Nagasaki definitely has enough about them to make this “fun”. The odds on BTTS have fallen a bit, but as long as it is above 1.80 I think it holds value.

**Write Up:** Well I will say Ouattara had a great game for Brentford, but opted to pass/cross the ball every time he got it in a dangerous area, including one time where he had a close chance at goal he could have scored. Disappointing but I still think it was a good read and I&#x27;d play it again. 

FA Cup action is back and we&#x27;ve got one Friday match where Championship side Hull City host EPL side Chelsea in this 2nd round matchup. In the previous round, Chelsea beat Charlton (another Championship side) 5-1 away. I actually backed Chelsea for a similar play in that match. While Hull City is significantly higher up on the Championship table than Charlton was, they actually have a worst defensive record and have conceded 5 more goals than Charlton this season. 

Chelsea will likely follow their typical early cup round blueprint, they will send out almost their entire 2nd team and hope they can do the job. If at halftime they aren&#x27;t up by a few goals, they&#x27;ll bring in their big names and take control of the game. Last round they scored four 2nd half goals, as an example. With that said, don&#x27;t be shocked if they don&#x27;t score much in the first half, but having been knocked out of the Carabao Cup, they&#x27;ll take this game seriously as coach Rosenior will want silverware in his first season.

I love the value here for Chelsea to get 3 goals at even money. BOL and happy Friday!</td></tr>

Macklin Celebrini is a young gun who’s going to show he has what it takes to keep up with the best. Last time I picked him to score a goal in the NHL season it didn’t go right for me. That game though, he didn’t have Conor Mcdavid on his line. He scored on Thursday and played very well. He’s on a line with Connor Mcdavid (the best player in the league right now) and Tom Wilson. Mcdavid seems to be choosing to be a play maker over a goal scorer which helps this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> even more.

Time: 9:00 AM EST 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Parlay: Falcons ML + Yandex vs Heroic Over 3.5 Maps @ 1.88 odds (5u)

Write Up:

Team Falcons are simply the better team. In a Best-of-5, you can&#x27;t cheese your way to victory, you need a deep hero pool, strategy and superior macro. Falcons have all of &#x27;em. Liquid might steal a game or two, but Falcons will win the series.

On the other hand, Yandex is playing with Malik instead of Noticed. While Malik is good, playing with a stand-in usually causes some communication breakdowns. That makes a clean 3-0 sweep for Yandex very unlikely. Heroic just beat Tundra by playing pure chaos Dota. They are scrappy enough to take at least one map off anyone. We don&#x27;t need to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> a winner here. We just need both teams to win at least one map. Given Yandex&#x27;s firepower and Heroic&#x27;s momentum, a 3-1 or 3-2 scoreline is almost guaranteed.

Falcons win, and the other series turns into a brawl. We cash.

*Recap: Arsenal just had to bottle the lead. Oh well. On to the next.*

Write Up:

I&#x27;m headed for the league with clearly defined hierarchies and a status quo that doesn&#x27;t deviate often.

Dortmund are phenomenal at home having not lost a single game there (8W-2D-0L). They drew against Stuttgart and Leipzig, two very strong opponents. However, their opponent <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> is far from strong.

Mainz have managed just 2 away wins in the Bundesliga and honestly, I don&#x27;t see them even managing a draw in this game. I expect a barrage of attacks from Dortmund that&#x27;ll hopefully lead to goals and a good number of corners in each half.

Under 6.5 goals (-135)

Although Canada has the better team, Switzerland (#3 in IIHF world rankings) has always been a threat on the international level. With now notable NHL players like Roman Josi, Timo Meier, Nico Hichsier, Nino Niederreiter and J.J Moser on the team, I expect Switzerland to put up a good fight and keep it under 6 goals especially after a great 4-0 performance against France yesterday. I know France isn&#x27;t Canada but Canada has always struggled against Switzerland in the Olympics so I expect them to not take their opponents lightly and not go for a super aggressive game.

In net for Switzerland will either be Leonardo Genoni who is a Swiss legend and has brought Switzerland to a 2nd place in 2024 and 2025 at the IIHF World Championships while dominating the Swiss league over the years or it will be Akira Schmid who although hasn&#x27;t had the best stats this year in the NHL has played very well with the Swiss team in 2024 with a 3-0 record .946 percentage and 0.86 goals allowed on average.

Milan is back after a long break, unfortunately they have a lot of injuries in attack, Leao will miss the game most likely, the only other alternative is Loftus-cheek as per the last game, that&#x27;s why the odds are so juicy, but Pisa is a very weak team defensively, Inter scored 6 against them just a few weeks ago, I expect Milan midfield to step up, with Rabiot and Modric shooting and serving balls all over, Allegri struggles against defensive teams so we might see goals until the second half (I will probably sprinkle something at halftime)  Pisa has no arguments to get a draw like they did in the previous match between these 2 teams, they are one of the teams that will get relegated, Milan will at least win by 1, if we get a push I&#x27;ll take it but the odds are too good to let it pass.

___

ADM is, understandably, the heavy favorite here but I do think he&#x27;s overvalued.  Van de Zandschulp has been playing some of his best tennis lately.  In the AUS Open, despite losing in straight sets, he frustrated the hell out of Djokovic — who was playing out of his mind.  He has a remarkably high court IQ, which shows in his ability to manipulate his opponent&#x27;s position on the court and create tough angles.  ADM owns the H2H here 3-0, but their last meeting a year ago ended 6-4, 6-4, which would net us a win here.  Van de Zandschulp just surprised bettors in his massive upset of Tsitsipas, and I expect him to maintain that momentum going into these quarterfinals.  He should be able to overpower and outplay ADM in a sufficient number of points in order to keep this one close and get us back into the win column.  BOL.</td></tr>

Monaco have historically had the edge in this matchup and are typically much stronger at home. They create more chances, score more consistently, and usually control games against mid-to-lower table sides like Nantes. From a win probability standpoint, Monaco are generally in that 55–60% range here.

As for the goals, this fixture regularly produces at least two. Over 1.5 goals hits at a high rate in their head-to-head history, and Monaco alone are often capable of covering that line. With Nantes tending to concede on the road, a 2-0 or 2-1 type result feels statistically aligned with the trends.

Overall, you’re backing the better team in a matchup that usually sees multiple goals — a logical and data-supported angle.

Write-up: Back with Dota 2 Blast slam VI playoffs, very excited because this is a **Best of 5 (Bo5)** match and value parlay. For the &quot;Over 3.5&quot; to hit, we simply need the underdog in each match to win at least **one map**.

Since it&#x27;s Bo5, I don&#x27;t like to bet on maps over/under without seeing the draft live. However both of these matches are closer than the odds suggest. Team liquid won against Falcons in their group stage match a couple of days ago. Heroic as well; they took a map off of Yandex in a 28-minute stomp game. Both of the underdogs won their matches in the group stage. Falcons have also been very shaky and inconsistent after their TI win; I can totally see Liquid putting up a good fight. at the same time Heroic has been the biggest trap team in Dota; they always somehow turn up in Bo3-Bo5 playoffs and play great. We just need both matches to not finish 3-0. BOL!

League of Ireland Premier Division.

Derry City vs Dundalk

Derry City win and over 1.5 goals

(1.95) 3 units

The Candystripes host their 2nd game of the season, after a strong performance that even got the better of Sligo Rovers.

Derry City have a ridiculous financial advantage over the rest of the teams in the league of Ireland who outside Shamrock Rovers general struggle to generate any revenue.

Derry is owned by a self made Billionaire, who has bailed them a few years back and invested not a crazy amount but they did have a solid transfer window bringing in local legend James McClean and the impressive James Clark in midfield from Bohemians.

They finished last season very strong, if it wasn&#x27;t for a poor start to the season they would have challenged Shamrock Rovers for the title, with the squad they have assembled they could very win the league this season.

Dundalk managed to get promoted back to the top division, but they have had financial issues the past few years which is why they got relegated last season, they have not managed to sign anyone that  stands out on paper, and they would do well to not finish bottom imo.

The weather in Dundalk has been absolutely brutal the last couple of weeks, they had their first match with Shamrock Rovers postponed due to a waterlogged pitch

Derry have 2 competitive match under their belt, looking strong from the small sample so far. Dundalk haven&#x27;t played since their friendly loss to Shelburne 23 days ago, they will lack that sharpness and the very heavy rainfall has left training facilities in poor condition also.

Between the clear gulf in class, Dundalk&#x27;s obvious lack of preparation and match fitness and the ridiculous financial gap between these sides, I see this being a one sided match. I would be very surprised if Derry didn&#x27;t manage at least 2 goals and they should manage a comfortable win at home to make it 2 wins from 2 in the league to add to the win against rovers before that in the Super Cup.

Explanation: Not alot to explain, other than PSV being on a completely different level compared to their opponents and leading big on H2H record. I do believe that they will end this game in the first half by going all out, and not do the same mistake as last time. They were losing 1-0 vs Gronningen in their last game and then managed to win it in the second half. The scenario here is that they will be focused to the max and dominate in possession, chances created and xG. They will have at least 2-0 here in the first half. But I do suspect a 3-0 score more. Let´s get this one in!

GKS KATOWICE VS LEGIA

Date: 13 FEBRUARY 2026 at 20:30

BET ON: Match odds- LEGIA

Odd: 2.23



\- Backing Legia Warsaw to win against GKS Katowice is strongly supported when combining injuries, motivation, and tactical signals from recent Polish media coverage. Coach Marek Papszun has made it clear in press conferences that excuses are over — despite absences like Rafał Augustyniak, Jean-Pierre Nsame and Rúben Vinagre, he has emphasized visible structural progress, improved defensive organization, and intensive work on set pieces and compactness within the 3-4-2-1 system. Legia’s recent performance in Gdynia showed better spacing between lines and greater midfield control, suggesting the breakthrough is close. Crucially, the motivational edge lies with the Warsaw side: the pressure to collect points has created a “reaction game” mentality, with players publicly speaking about responsibility and restoring standards. Meanwhile, GKS Katowice are also weakened (Jirka, Paluszek, Rejczyk absent), limiting their pace in transition and defensive stability, and their recent messaging has been more cautious than assertive. With Legia tactically tightening up, drilling defensive discipline, holding historical superiority in head-to-head meetings, and entering this fixture with heightened urgency, the value clearly leans toward a Legia victory.

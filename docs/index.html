**Real Betis - Atletico Madrid** ⚽ Spain La Liga



Recent examples for Betis:

vs Real Sociedad (September 19, 2025): 20 + 20 = 40

vs Athletic (August 31, 2025): 18 + 22 = 40

vs Alaves (August 22, 2025): 15 + 19 = 34



Atlético&#x27;s recent examples:

@ Celta (October 5, 2025): 24 + 11 = 35

@ Mallorca (September 21, 2025): 14 + 24 = 38

@ Alaves (August 30, 2025): 13 + 18 = 31



Head-to-head (H2H) crown data – last 6 league matches

May 18, 2025 (Atlético 4–1 Betis): 16 + 13 = 29

October 27, 2024 (Betis 1–0 Atlético): 20 + 26 = 46

March 3, 2024 (Atlético 2–1 Betis): 10 + 27 = 37

August 20, 2023 (Betis 0–0 Atlético): 19 + 11 = 30

April 2, 2023 (Atlético 1–0 Betis): 28 + 25 = 53

October 23, 2022 (Betis 1–2 Atlético): 22 + 27 = 49 Average = 40.7



Betis&#x27; recent matches have yielded a tempo in the 35–40 range; Atlético has seen examples both dipping to 28 and exceeding 40 in recent times. Overall, the 34 mark is a “reachable” threshold.I expect 34+ corners in the Real Betis – Atlético Madrid match. The average corner total in the last 6 league meetings between the two teams is 40.7 (median 41.5), and the 34 threshold was exceeded in 4 of those matches. While Betis&#x27; recent matches have been in the 35–40 range, Atlético&#x27;s matches have varied between 28 and 41, but have reached 37–41. The evening kickoff at La Cartuja could increase the likelihood of wet field play-off sequences. This data set suggests an expectation slightly above the 34 line.

Pacheco has been seeing an increased work load recently and with this spread being -10, the game script should be in his favor. As big of a spread that is, I expect the Chiefs to dominate this game and feed Pacheco. He has cleared this line in the last 2 games against the Lions and Raiders. He had 77% snap percentage against the Lions (two weeks ago) which to me is a good sign that they are starting to trust him more and more over Kareem Hunt. Something to note but may not be of too much value is that Kareem Hunt was limited in practice on Friday and was a full participant on Saturday but the Chiefs may not feed him as much if Pacheco is running well.</td></tr>

First pitch is 5:00pm PST. Game 3 of the World Series should be a chess match. Barger having no hits in the previous game gives me more confidence in this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. He knows his role on the team is to be someone they can count on to bring in runs and make hits. Even if he is not on the starting roster I suspect we will see him pinch at some point. 

Personally I wont be placing my wager until after the roster is announced (1pm PST the latest) but most sources speculate he will be starting. 

Barger has zero hits vs Glasnow in 5 plate appearances but he does have a much better hit average against righties. 

It is a sound choice to expect a hit from Barger tonight and if it does not happen I will be continuing to place this wager using a modified martingale system. BOL!

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: (5u) Devin Booker o29.5 (-106 FD)**

Booker has scored 30+ pts in 2/3 games so far this season with no sign of stopping. I expect him to take advantage of a young Jazz team that he has scored 30+ pts against in his last 4 matchups. With Beal and KD gone and Jalen Green still out, the Suns have little offensive power to rely on outside of Booker. While his shot volume is concerning, he has been getting to the ft line at a much higher rate than his career avg indicating aggression. I have a hard time imagining a backcourt of Keyonte George, Svi Mykhailiuk, Brice Sensabaugh, Ace Bailey and Walter Clayton Jr. being able to slow down Booker.</td></tr>

Game: Suns @ Jazz 9:10 EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Jazz ML, -102, 2u -&gt; 3.96u

Reasoning: the jazz have looked plenty good so far over 2 games. They beat the clippers in a dominating fashion and held it close against the kings. Although the sample size is low, the pieces feel in place for them to have another explosive home game win against a suns team that doesn’t look good. They beat the kings in their home opener while the kings were missing sabonis. Since then, they’ve lost to the clippers by 27 and the nuggets by 22. Although betting on trash vs trash is bad, by transitivity and home court advantage, it seems like the Jazz are underpriced here to me</td></tr>

NBA | Pelicans vs Celtics | 🏀  

Strong performance from Miles who finishes with a double double, we move.

Celtics have looked very bad to start the season with almost no interior protection at all where they’ve been bleeding points. KAT dropped 26 points, Duren just had 24 points and Ausar Thompson had 21 against this Celtics side who’s clearly struggling to contain bigs and players similiar to what Zion can bring tonight.

Zion is over this line in 2/2 games this season with 41 &amp; 44 PRA, and no one on this Celtics team has the strength or power to contain Zion in this matchup imo so I like the trend to continue.

Think Zion has a great game here, there’s upside in both assists and rebounds aswell with Zion being comfortable facilitating if he gets doubled avg 6.0 APG and with 9 &amp; 10 rebound games so far avg 18.0 rebound chances per game. Players like Ausar and Duren I mentioned earlier had 12 &amp; 18 rebounds along their 20+ point performances against Celtics most recently.

Celtics playing b2b whilst Pels are fresher, everything is in favour for a Zion masterclass and I’m on it.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Todays Pick</mark>:** Odense - Brondby

-**Brondby to win**

**Odds:** $1.91

**Wager:** 2 units

**When:** 6 hours from post


**Why:**

Here’s why I’m tipping Brondby to beat Odense, Odense seem to have left their rear guard door slightly ajar this season, having conceded 29 goals in 12 games in the league so far. Brondby, though defend much more solidly (just 14 conceded in the same number of games) and have won the last two head-to-head showdowns against Odense (Most recent h2h was a huge blowout, where Brondby won 5-1)


So, imagine Odense kicking off full of hope, only for Brondby to stroll in, nick control, <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> holes in that iffy defence and stroll away happy with the three points. Add in the fact that Brondby maintain momentum and confidence at the moment, while Odense aren’t punching above their weight right now, and you’ve got all the ingredients for the away win. And yes, Odense might score, but the history and statistics tell me Brondby are likely to come out on top. Considering the odds, im happy to make this my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick of the day</mark>.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: Rashee Rice O59.5 receiving yards. (-158 DK) 

(NFL Washington Commanders @ Kansas City Chiefs; 8:15 EST)

Write Up: Keeping it simple is the name of the game! <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> we have a matchup against the rising chiefs, who had a tough go at it to start the year but have since gotten back into contender form. We saw last week Rice get most of the quick look’s in zone coverage, as the Raiders (whose defense is admittedly devoid of talent for the most part) tried to suppress this loaded offense, and failed to do so. Rice recorded a team high 10 targets, hauling in 7 of those targets in route to 42 yards and 2 touchdowns. Though I will be the first to mention, 42 yards is laughable for a game where you receive the ball 7 times. However, this number is bound to go up even if by just 18 yards. <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>, in a game where they are playing a former NFC champion hopeful in the depleted Commanders, we should see a display of what the Kansas City Chiefs are capable. With Rice stepping right back into his former roll of the dominate ball toucher (pause) in this offense, this lines value is much to sweet to pass up. Additionally this one is in arrow head, which is one of the biggest advantages in all of football. The spread is also in play here but that’s for someone else to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> lol.

Bookies are pricing this line assuming Maxey cools off from his hot start. The metrics tell a different story though.

Maxey opened the season from deep: 7/9 against Boston, then 4/9 against Hornets. That’s 11/18 3pt range (61%) yes only his first two games this season but this isn’t a random hot streak. **This is structural role expansion.**

With Embiid sidelined by knee issue their team will rely on Maxey as primary ball handler, shot creator, and perimeter scorer.

Only concern is Suggs is an elite perimeter defender for the Magic. Suggs could slow down Maxey but not stop him. **When Suggs rotates off to defend other players or takes a breather, Maxey faces Anthony Black and reserve Magic guards. That’s when he gets the clean looks he needs to hit 4 threes.**

Maxey is in peak form from deep showing no signs of slowing down. I&#x27;m trusting the hot hand general to hit at least another 4 deep ones for this matchup.

If tailing, only risk what you can afford to lose! Best of luck family!

<tr><td class='post'>Watford u21 vs Swansea u21, @ 1.77  over 3.5 goals

Record: 69 - 68 Profit: -3.19 u

Form(old to new): ✅✅✅✅❌✅✅❌❌✅❌✅❌✅✅❌❌✅❌✅✅❌✅✅✅❌✅❌✅✅❌❌✅❌❌✅✅❌❌✅❌✅✅❌✅✅✅✅❌❌❌❌✅✅❌✅✅✅❌✅❌✅✅✅✅❌✅❌✅✅✅❌❌✅❌✅✅✅❌✅❌

Watford U21 and Swansea U21 meet in what should be another lively contest in the Premier League Development League. Both sides have developed reputations for playing open, attacking football, and when they face each other, goals tend to flow. Although youth football is often unpredictable, the patterns in both teams’ recent results point strongly toward another high-scoring match.

Watford’s academy side has been entertaining but inconsistent. They like to build from the back and push fullbacks high, which often leaves gaps when possession is lost. Their last few matches have featured plenty of scoring chances at both ends  Watford have conceded at least two goals in several consecutive games, but they also create opportunities through their pace in wide areas. Matches at home have been especially chaotic, with multiple games finishing 3-2 or 4-1 this season. The Hornets’ approach prioritizes development and expression over results, which often leads to open games rather than cautious, defensive setups.

Swansea U21, meanwhile, arrive in better form and with a more refined attacking style. The Welsh side is known for quick ball circulation and strong technical midfielders who can create overloads in the final third. They’ve scored three or more goals in several of their recent outings, including impressive wins away from home. However, like many U21 teams, their defensive concentration sometimes drops, allowing opponents to score even when Swansea are in control of the game. Their matches have averaged well over three goals per game this season, and the over 3.5 line has landed frequently.

The head-to-head record between these sides supports the idea of another goal-filled match. In the last six meetings, every single game has gone over 2.5 goals, and several have cleared the 3.5 mark comfortably. Swansea’s U21s have generally had the upper hand, but Watford have managed to score in almost all those fixtures. That combination, both teams scoring, with one side having slightly more quality in attack,  often produces wide open contests where momentum swings quickly.

Tactically, this matchup suits an over goals scenario. Both teams prefer attacking transitions and aren’t afraid to commit numbers forward. Set-pieces also play a role; both sides have been vulnerable from corners and free kicks, which can add to the goal total. Neither team is expected to sit back, especially in a developmental league where the emphasis is on playing proactive football.

Of course, caution is always needed when expecting goals in youth matches. Some games can stall if the intensity drops or if finishing is poor. Still, given recent performances and historical trends, there’s solid reasoning to expect a fast tempo and multiple scoring chances. If either team scores early, the match could easily open up further, as both sides tend to chase goals rather than protect leads.

Overall, while nothing is certain, this fixture consistently produces entertainment. With both teams favoring attack over defense and recent form pointing to plenty of chances, the Over 3.5 Goals line looks like a realistic outcome , not guaranteed, but well within reach if the game follows its usual pattern. Expect an energetic, end-to-end match where youth football’s unpredictability keeps things lively right to the final whistle.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Over 2.5 Goals @ **1.70** (Betano) – 1.0 Unit

**Write Up:**  
Leaning into the tempo here. Fenerbahçe play front-foot football: high line, aggressive counter-press, fullbacks stepping into midfield, and lots of touches in the half-spaces. That creates sustained territory and shot volume, but it also leaves transition lanes open the other way. Gaziantep at home are proactive enough to trade chances—they’ll press in moments, attack early passes into the channels, and they don’t mind quick shots after regains.

Recent form supports goals: both sides have been involved in chance-heavy matches (shot counts and xG trending above league average on Sofascore), and neither profile is built to kill games off for 90 minutes. Set pieces are a meaningful secondary path here—both teams draw fouls in advanced areas, and Gaziantep’s home matches often feature multiple restart situations around the box. If the first goal lands, the game state should accelerate rather than slow down.

BOL!</td></tr>

For <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> we are going back to the Swedish league where 3rd placed GAIS are taking on Brommapojkarna, who are fighting for relegation. GAIS are looking to solidy their spot that gets them European football next season. With their topscorer Diabate back in goal contributing form (2 goals, 1 assist) in their last three matches they look the stronger side to me here. Brommapojkarna aren&#x27;t performing well in recent matches and drew last week to last place Varnamo to top that off in negative fashion.



**Best of luck if tailing!** 🍀

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>**: Clippers vs Trail Blazers – Under 224.5 (-110) 

*Result*: ✅ Winner (Total: 221)

Mistakenly posted this in the wrong thread yesterday evening. 

Both teams played slow, half-court basketball, and neither shot well.
The Clippers were efficient but sloppy (24 turnovers), while the Blazers couldn’t find a rhythm (37% FG, 26% 3PT). Even with Kawhi dropping 30 &amp; 10, LA controlled tempo and held Portland to 107 points.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Utah Jazz Moneyline (+105)**

Markkanen + Kessler can dominate a thin Suns interior. Utah at home is a sneaky spot for value. Phoenix hasn’t looked sharp defensively and will likely struggle with altitude and fatigue. Expect the Jazz to push tempo selectively and lean on their bench energy.

The Suns come in banged up and on tired legs after a long road stretch, and that’s not ideal in Salt Lake City. Utah was impressive at home to open the season against the clippers, and this is another spot where that momentum could carry them over a vulnerable Suns team.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Marcus Mariota UNDER 198.5 Passing Yards + KC -2.5 (+110). Betting 1 unit 

Write up: 

I don&#x27;t particularly like betting on KC receivers and RBs because the offense is very spread out and there are a lot of good options for the team to use. I do, however, like betting on opposing teams facing the Chiefs.

Right now, the Chiefs are on fire and handedly beat the Lions and Raiders. Their defense has also been impressive this year, despite the very apparent lack of DLine talent outside of CJ. I like this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> for a few reasons:

Only 3 QBs have thrown for 200 yards against KC this season: Herbert, Trevor Lawrence, and Jared Goff who are all much better passers than Mariota with arguably better weapons. I don&#x27;t expect Mariota to be able to compete on the level of those guys against a very good KC secondary. [Source](https://www.statmuse.com/nfl/ask?q=qb+logs+against+chiefs+with+10%2B+attempts)

Mariota has only cleared this line once and it was against the Raiders team that Mahomes just shredded. Mariota also beat it by just 8 yards. Something to note is that in that Raiders game, he only threw 21 times and I expect him to throw a bit more this game.

Washington is also a team that does not like to throw the ball as much as other teams. Neither Mariota nor Daniels has thrown the ball more than 30 times this season aside from one outlier game (42 attempts by JD against GB).

Regarding the Chiefs spread, they&#x27;re playing like mad men right now and I&#x27;d like to continue to ride that wave.  I don&#x27;t see this game coming within 3 points either as their only losses have been by 3+ points each, meanwhile every game they&#x27;ve won was by a good margin. If the Chiefs somehow don&#x27;t cover the spread, then that would mean Mariota had himself a great game and therefore both bets would lose so the risk of a hook is low. The addition of the spread is strictly a narrative addition, I don&#x27;t see a case where one hits and the other doesn&#x27;t.

If you disagree with this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, please comment! Definitely open to criticism, as our money is on the line.

1U Payton Pritchard O1.5 FTM @ $1.95 (-105 American), B365 

Running this back as I think it’s still value. Slight regression <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> going 3-5 but getting to the line 3 times was a good sign.  

Good things are that the Pelicans have given up 43 (v Grizzlies) &amp; 26 (v Spurs) free throws, with Herb Jones &amp; Poole in particular a foul concern. In these games Harper, Castle, Morant &amp; KCP all going well over with Vassell going 1-2 from the line. 

The same theory as yesterday applies - his FTA line is 1.5 @ $1.68, his FTM line is 1.5 @ $1.95. At 85% career shooting, if he gets to the FT twice, we back him to make it. 

Issues to consider for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> are B2B and how that impacts his minutes, recording a season low of 34 against the Pistons. I think B2B are a big one even early in the season but it’s also an intangible to a degree - every player is different, so I’m choosing to go ahead with the play. The Celtics are 0-3 &amp; while it isn’t panic stations yet, they may look for some change-ups I.e Simons starting as they figure out their best way forward.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Todays pick</mark>: Isaiah Pacheco U60.5 Rush+Receing (-112 on DK) 1u to win 0.89 U

Writeup: Didn&#x27;t really like many plays for this game but this one&#x27;s looking pretty good. Taking a look at Pacheco, he&#x27;s been averaging 9.4 carries a game with 4.1 yards/carry. In terms of receptions, he&#x27;s been averaging 1.57 per game, for 6.1 receiving yards. In total, 44.9 Rush + Receiving.

Pacheco has not hit this line all season, even in games where the chiefs are winning (Eagles, Giants, Lions, Raiders), Pacheco&#x27;s been averaging only 11.75 carries and 45.5 rushing yards in those games

Mahomes has been slinging it all season averaging just over 35 attempts and 23.4 completions. I see no reason for that to change significantly, seeing how he&#x27;s gone over that average the last game with the raiders.

 Chiefs have a top 5 offense and defense while the commanders are 25th and 27th respectively in those two categories. Chiefs moneyline is at -675 and the spread is at -10.5, the Chiefs are expected to dominate like they did the raiders. Mahomes will be slinging it, and sure Pacheco will get 1 or 2 receptions throughout the game, and start getting more rushes in the second half. However, his averages are low, even against teams like the raiders, giants, and ravens who all have lackluster rushing defenses.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: NBA 🏀Denver Nuggets vs Minnesota Timberwolves 9:30 P.M. E.T. OVER 228 (-110) BETONLINE

Yesterday&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> was another brutal loss. 2 penalties taken away to which the announcers expected penalty and one was downright shocking and VAR only gave the official 1 camera angle to look at which was the worst angle not giving the foul deserving merit. Extremely odd. Throw in 3 more offsides goals with 1 where you couldn&#x27;t even tell after VAR. Literally by &quot;a millimeter&quot; quoted from the announcer. Still  had 3 goals in the first half and an early second half penalty awarded to RM and Mbappe misses the penalty do to a world class save. Goes the remaining 40 minutes without a goal. Absolutely brutal result for a game that easily could&#x27;ve pitched 6+goals.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> going NBA where this one is set up for a lot of offense. Nuggets have great offense and so can the Wolves. I feel the Nuggets defense isn&#x27;t great, and while the Wolves have a few very good defenders, its still early regular season where defense can tend to lax and Joker is unguardable. Lakers lit up the Wolves D without Lebron, and the Blazers even put up 114 on them. I think the Wolves&#x27; decision to bench Conley and start Donte D at the point favors the overs by adding more pace to the game pushing totals potentially higher and i don&#x27;t think vegas has caught up to the fact the Wolves are going to be in some really high scoring games because of this. 

The other thing here is that ANT MAN went out with hamstring tightness but reports are saying he&#x27;s expected to be a go for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. If he gets officially put in the lineup (which I&#x27;m hoping and expecting) i think this line bumps up more. It also has a solid shot even without him.

Betonline had the best line for this as other books were already a half point higher or more at the same odds.

Sport | NFL - 8:15pm EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Marcus Mariota OVER 11.5 longest rush  (-112 FanDuel) 3 units

Write Up: Initially I was looking at Brashard Smith and Isiah Pacheco props but ultimately I just feel there is too much uncertainty after last week KC backfield volume against the Raiders. I could easily see Brashard clear his receiving props but he’s becoming more and more touted this week and that scared me away.

I then stumbled across Marcus’s longest rush line. Mariota has played starter volume of snaps in Week 3 (Raiders), 4(Falcons), and 7(Cowboys). In those weeks he has 10 carries for 94 yards, averaging 9.4 yards per attempt. He’s already passed the 11.5 longest rush mark in the 3 games mentioned above with his longest rushes going for 22, 22, and 25. Not to mention he came into the Cowboys game after Jayden Daniel’s was reinjured and Mariota still hit over this line albeit against a weaker Cowboys defense. Regardless of the inconsistent arm, Mariota can create big gains on the ground when the pocket breaks down, which is something Chiefs do well. 

The Chiefs defense has allowed runs of 12+ yards to quarterbacks in four of seven games this year. Really this could easily have hit in five of the seven as this includes week 2 when Jalen Hurts longest was 11 on the dot. The Chiefs aggressive front often opens escape lanes, especially against mobile passers. With the Commanders expected to play from behind, Mariota should see more snaps in hurry up or broken play situations — good spots for a quarterback run. 

Lastly, Washington’s offense gets a boost as Terry McLaurin and Deebo Samuel are both expected to play. This gives the KC defense more offensive weapons to focus on covering all game, further opening running lanes. 

Given his ability to evade the pocket and Kansas City’s track record against 10+ yard rushes to QBs this season, I feel pretty confident we can get home on another POD. 

Expected outcome: Mariota longest rush 17 yards</td></tr>

Start Time &amp; TV: 8:00 &amp; 8:15pm EST (FOX &amp; ESPN)

Units: 2 Units

Reasoning: Going with a cross sport parlay for this Monday night with the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Kansas City Chiefs. I think the Dodgers have a huge advantage in starting pitching in this one as the Los Angeles Dodgers are starting Tyler Glasnow who finished his 2025 regular season with a 3.19 ERA, WHIP of 1.10 and an opponent slash line of .177/.279/.310. He has been lights out in the playoffs so far in his 3 appearances pitching 13.1 innings and only allowing one run. The Blue Jays are pitching Max Scherzer who has a 5.19 regular season ERA, a WHIP of 1.29 and a regular season opponent slash line of .262/.313/.497. Scherzer has made one postseason appearance and pitched for 5.2 innings striking out 5 batters, walking 4 batters and letting up 2 runs. I also dont see any way the Chiefs lose this game at home against the Commanders as the Commanders will be without quarterback Jayden Daniels again. This Chiefs offense also looks even better with Rashee Rice back in the lineup out of suspension so I definitely dont think the Commanders will be able to keep up with the Chiefs with Marcus Mariota starting for them under center.

Villa should have won the last match.  I was honestly disgusted by what I had watched.  They even missed a pen, a pretty easy 1-1 also, they had the quality, it honestly looked like they had given up I was disgusted. GA were 3 points off relegation in the Dutch league and Villa, well they just beat City yesterday.  Football is strange.  

Back to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>todays Pick</mark> of the day:

**Antony**

In his last 10 appearances in La Liga, Antony has scored 4 goals. 

For the 2025-26 season so far (partial data) at Real Betis: 418 minutes played, 18 shots, 7 on target. 

His expected goals (xG) in that data: 1.38 xG over those 418 minutes.

His recent match logs show he’s starting regularly and getting shot attempts. 

Why this supports a scoring chance:

A rate of 4 goals in 10 suggests he’s generating and converting chances at a decent clip for his role.

His shot volume and xG show he is being involved and getting into scoring positions.

If tomorrow’s match provides him similar minutes and service, the recent form suggests a real chance he could score.

**Julián Álvarez**

For the 2025-26 La Liga season: 9 matches, 709 minutes, 6 goals and 1 assist.

His goals per 90: about 0.76.

He has taken 20 shots in those 9 matches, with 14 on target (≈70 % accuracy) and averages ~2.53 shots per 90 minutes.

His non-penalty xG per 90 is ~0.52, placing him in the top 95th percentile of La Liga players in his role.

Recent big match: He scored a hat-trick in a comeback 3-2 win over Rayo Vallecano. 

Why this supports a scoring chance:

He’s converting at a high rate (6 in 9) and consistently getting into dangerous positions.

High accuracy of shots and good service/role in offence boost his odds.

His “big game” performance (hat-trick) shows he can deliver when it counts.</td></tr>

With Commanders missing their dual threat quarterback and their top Sacks leader I see Mr reliable for Maholmes still able to get a couple catches and grab the 40 yds receiving. Kelce and starters only played 3 quarters before they got a nice rest last game. With Rice back and Worthy, I absolutely see them stretching the defense to the max. Tempted to go with Rice or Worthy but I still see plenty of catches down the middle now being opened up by worthy and Rice for Kelce to get his chance. Maholmes and Kelce have such a good rapport and are going to keep breaking QB-TE duo records. I do think he will retire after this year and Maholmes is always going to feed his OG teammate. Kelce finished with over 40 yds last 4 games and even though they didn’t play a complete game last week Kelce still finished with 54 yds with Rice back in the group.

I don’t expect the chiefs to have too much trouble with the commanders and Mahomes shouldn’t be under the kind of pressure that would make him throw a possible int.

Altmaier’s had the better 2025 season so far — more wins and a stronger win percentage — and I really liked his form at the US Open with wins over Medjedovic and Tsitsipas. If he brings that level again, I think he has every chance to pull this one out outright.

BET ON: Asian handicap- HAMMARBY +0.50

Odd: 1.68

SWEDEN

\- Hammarby +0.50 looks like solid value here given the contrasting form and motivation between the two sides. Malmö are struggling to find rhythm after Henrik Rydström’s dismissal — interim coach Anes Mravac has managed just two wins in five matches, and the recent 1-1 draw with Dinamo Zagreb showed once again a lack of sharpness and stability. The atmosphere around the team feels flat, with little left to play for domestically. In contrast, Hammarby are full of purpose — coming off two straight wins, including a confident 2-1 derby victory over AIK, and just one result away from mathematically securing second place. They’ll approach this with discipline and energy, looking to control possession and frustrate Malmö’s inconsistent back line. With Malmö’s motivation questionable and Hammarby tactically organized and confident, the visitors are well positioned to avoid defeat — making Hammarby +0.50 an appealing bet.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Patrick Zahraj vs Thai-Son Kwiatkowski | **Zahraj ML at -125 (DraftKings). 2 unit.**

Write-up: Nice win for Comesaña, who closed at around -125. He also ended up defeating David Goffin via retirement to qualify for the main draw. 

Patrick Zahraj (ATP #243)&#x27;s form has significantly dipped since the start of the year, which saw him make a surprising run to the final of the Pau Challenger. Most recently, he crashed out of the Sioux Falls Challenger in the first round, winning just three games as the favorite. Still, I feel like this is the perfect match for him to regain some confidence and get a win under his belt. 

Thai-Son Kwiatkowski is actually unranked right now (career high of #181), as he hasn&#x27;t won a professional singles match in over a year. In fact, it would be a stretch to call him a full-time player at this point, as he has only played three matches all year and now works at a crypto investment company. He&#x27;s obviously still an extremely high-level player, but the reality is that it&#x27;s just tough to be competitive at this level when you&#x27;re only playing a few matches a year. This is especially true when you play the type of game he does, which relies on agility and timing as much as power. 

Even if Zahraj is out of form, I still believe that he has the weapons, including a big serve and solid net game, to to take control of this match. A lot of books have this around -150, but I would still play it for 1 unit at those odds.

ATP Paris: Cobolli vs Machac: Cobolli Ml @1.7

Cobolli just beat Machac last week in Vienna, and honestly not much has changed in seven days to flip that result. Cobolli looked really solid there, especially the level he showed against Sinner in the second set. If he brings even something close to that, he should be able to win this easily.

Machac is so up and down, and right now it’s definitely one of those down phases. He hasn’t beaten a good opponent in a while and his confidence looks shot. Cobolli at least keeps a solid base level and usually gets through his first match at tournaments.

For me it’s simple: Cobolli is playing better tennis, he already proved the matchup works for him, and Machac looks like he’s counting down to the offseason. Straight-sets win feels like the most likely outcome.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Not many games <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, but I&#x27;m a fan of this one. 

Porto last 2-0 to Forest mid-week, but I thought they were decent. Copped two penalties, had a goal disallowed, and looked like they&#x27;d score plenty of times.  

It was also away from home in Dyche&#x27;s first game. Was going to be a big one. 

In the league, Porto have been amazing so far. They&#x27;re first with a 7-1-0 record. 

Porto have only conceded one goal in the league so far - in a 2-1 win vs Sporting. 

In 6 of their 8 games so far, Porto have been winning at half time. The only two were against Benfica (nil all draw) and the Sporting game I mentioned. 

Now, they&#x27;ve conceded nearly 4 expected goals, so their defensive record is still outperforming their numbers a tad. Having said that, 3.9 xga in 7 games is elite.... Especially seeing they conceded over 1.0xga vs Sporting. 

Moreirense, to their credit, have great home form, having won all three of their home games. However, the teams they beat at home haven&#x27;t been great. The Portuguese league has (imo) the biggest gap between the good and bad teams. 

There&#x27;s a few bets here that I don&#x27;t mind, but the handicap is decent enough here to roll with.</td></tr>

PROFIT/LOSS = +18.64

PREVIOUS BET = Arsenal Win Second Half and Gyokeres 1 Shot on Target

RESULT = The streak is over, Gyokeres had 1 shot in the second half but honestly he was completely out of the game. Just a bad call from me. Just remember to only gamble what you can afford to lose, a few people got salty as soon as this lost and if that&#x27;s your attitude I&#x27;d rather you just stay away from my picks. No one can win them all and if they can, well they aren&#x27;t on this thread. Anyway let&#x27;s try get back to winning ways 

TODAYS BET 

EVENT/S = Porto VS Morierense

BET =  Porto to win and Both Teams to score/NO @1.90

UNITS = 3U to Profit 2.72

SUMMARY = Porto in the league have scored 19 goals and Conceded 1. Funnily enough the one goal they Conceded was an own goal. Porto have been solid in the Portuguese league not only keeping clean sheets but also holding opposition teams expected goals very low. An average of 0.49 Expected goals against Porto. They are just far too solid defensively and attacking they are also in good form. Scoring 19 goals with an XG of 2.01. Analysing Morierense aren&#x27;t a bad side, they score goals and win games but against sides in the top 4 they are 0-2 this season. Losing 2-0 and 3-0 and getting dominated. The 2 top sides in the league right now and Porto and Sporting and when Sporting played Morierense they won 3-0 and had over 5XG with Morierense getting 0.16XG. I&#x27;m not expecting Porto to hit 5XG they aren&#x27;t as good going forward as Sporting but they are a lot more solid defensively and that&#x27;s what they build off. I expect Porto to win 2 or 3-0. 

If my picks help you and you&#x27;d like to show your appreciation a thumbs up is perfect, if you&#x27;d like to tip which is never expected but always appreciated and does help motivate me for the research here you go. [Beer Money](http://Paypal.me/smoothsailinnomore)</td></tr>

__Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:__ [✅ C Olave o59.5 rec yds (-115), 3.6u](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/s/FlQygVzdkm)

__Event:__ NFL: Commanders @ Chiefs 8:15pm EST

__POTD:__ Rashee Rice o6.5 rec (+125 FD), 3u to win 3.75u

__Write Up:__ To close out Week 8 of the NFL season, the Chiefs are hosting the Washington Commanders. __The Chiefs have won 4 of their last 5 games &amp; have scored 28+ points in each of their past 4 games. Over that stretch, they lead the NFL with 390.6 yards per game, they’re 5th with 29.6 points per game, &amp; they’ve committed only 1 turnover, fewest in the league. The Chiefs have turned the ball over on a league low 3.1% of their possessions.__ This run has put them in the lead for Super Bowl Odd &amp; QB Patrick Mahomes as the favorite for the MVP award. They are coming off a 31-0 shutout vs the Raiders where Mahomes just kept passing. The Chiefs had a 1st down differential 31-0 &amp; the Raiders had 0 1st downs on 30 plays. The Commanders on the other hand will be without their star QB Jayden Daniels &amp; will be starting backup Marcus Mariota. Even with Daniels starting the last 2 games Washington lost both to the Bears &amp; Cowboys, with the Cowboys winning 44-22. That’s a lot of points, now they’re facing the hottest offense in the NFL led by Patrick Mahomes. 

Pat is an elite form. __Mahomes has a higher completion percentage than the week before in 5 straight games. Over the last 4 weeks, he has a 71.3% completion % for 7.9 yards per pass with 11 TD’s &amp; just 1 INT.__ KC is a heavy favorite at -11.5 in a game where Mahomes is going to light up a weak pass defense. __Washington’s defense has allowed a league high 8.3 yards per pass attempt, the most yards per completion (12.9 yards), &amp; a 5.6% TD rate (22nd). They’ve allowed 54 plays of 15 or more yards, (2nd worst). They have a takeaway on 4.1% of opponent possessions (2nd worst). In the last 4 week they’ve given up 2.59 points per drive (27th).__ To make things worse for Washington, Dorance Armstrong was just put on the IR, who led the defense in sacks (6) &amp; pressures (22). __Which won’t be good vs a KC offense that has reached the red zone on 14.9% more drives than their opponents (highest in NFL). The Chiefs are now 2nd in the NFL in scoring rate per drive (52.3%) &amp; points per drive (2.86).__ This has been due to the rate at which their passing &amp; the success. __KC leads the NFL in success rate on passing plays over the past 4 weeks (59.5%), while dropping back at a 72.1% rate in neutral game scripts (highest rate).__ Last game their offense was at a completely different level with 3rd year WR Rashee Rice returning from suspension.

Playing in his first game since Week 4 of last season, Rashee Rice made an immediate impact. __Rice caught 7 of 10 targets for 42 yards with 2 TD’s &amp; he was on the field for only 47.5% of the dropbacks with Mahomes, but he was targeted on 52.6% of his routes with 2.21 yards per route run.__ The Chiefs scored a TD in all 4 series he played rotating in. Head coach Andy Reid said on Friday: “We set out to get him to 40% or around that area… but I think he can keep his numbers going up.” Rice is just the 2nd player for KC to earn double digit targets in a game all season &amp; he did so in only 2.5 quarters. __Over his last 10 games, Rice is averaging 2.91 yards per route run &amp; 10 with a target rate of 31.3% of his routes. The last time he was targeted on less than 20% of his routes was Week 11 of 2023.__ Now he gets a juicy matchup not only vs the entire defense, but the specific corner that will be covering him. __Rice played 43% of his routes in the slot. Washington CB Mike Sainristil is their corner who covers the slot &amp; he is allowing the 4th most yards per coverage of any slot defender (min. 50 slot snaps). In fantasy football, they give up the most points per game to the slot (15.7).__ Rice was utilized on a lot of short passes last week &amp; it felt like he was open every play. There were designed screens, there were flip plays, &amp; there were back shoulder timing plays. __Rice averaged 0.8 air yards per target. It was 4.8 and 5.2 air yards in the previous 2 seasons.__ Both the routes and depth to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> up as the weeks continue. __I prefer reception over yards but it should be mention Washington is surrendering a 70.8% percent completion rate on the road, as well as 14.1 yards per catch to wide receivers specifically.__ He also didn’t have much competition for target. Their WR2 Xavier Worthy is in a bit of a slump since producing 121 yards in his return from injury in Week 4. In his 3 games since then, he&#x27;s totaled only 125 yards &amp; 1 TD. The 2024 1st rd <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>’s target share dipped to just 11.4%, the lowest it has been in a full game since Week 9 of last year. As for Travis Kelce, he had just 3 receptions on 3 targets. __Here are the target shares from the other pass catchers last week in Rice’s 1st game back: Brashard Smith - 14.3%, Xavier Worthy - 11.4%, Marquise Brown - 11.4%, Travis Kelce - 8.6%.__ Rice is going to get open a ton &amp; Pat will be looking for him.

The Chiefs play the Bills next week &amp; it’s clear Pat wants to make up for lost time with his top WR &amp; get back up to speed. With KC back to their scoring ways, Rice’s instant involvement will only grow.

__Rashee Rice over 6.5 receptions__

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: BTTS + Over 2.5 goals @ 2.10


The two teams met in September in a game that ended 5-1 for Brondby at their stadium. Odense are a team that averages the most total goals per match with around 4.1 per game, covering this line in 9 of 12 games played, at home in 5/6. Brondby have had some contrasting results in away games, with no games hitting this line in 5 games, they never really had as good of a  matchup for this line as <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, and they kept a clean sheet in 3/5 games, so I believe the third most prolific home team, with the 2nd worst defence will end that streak as they&#x27;ve scored on tough teams such as Midtjylland, Copenhagen, Aarhus.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>** Ohwaki Yui ML vs Kawagishi Nana (+137) 4u (bet365) ❌ fuck

27.10.2025, 01:30, Makinohara ITF, Qualification - round of 16, hard

6:30PM MST (**starts in approximately 15 minutes**) 9:30AM local Japan time 10/27. Apologies for the short notice, was hoping the thread would be posted sooner. Tennis matches are often delayed beyond the official start time, sometimes by hours, so might still be some time to catch it.

Ohwaki has been on an absolute tear as of late, winning 10 of her last 11 matches. Her lone loss during this time period was to a good player, Kayla McPhee, who has a hard court record of 66-9 this year and has been as high as the top 200 in rankings. Very impressively, Ohwaki avenged this defeat against McPhee a month later in straight sets, as a +400 dog.

That was last week, and the very next match after that, she annihilated a certain Kawagishi Nana (6-1, 6-3). The same Kawagishi who’s playing in the match we’re betting on <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.

Their head to head record is 1-1 (Ohwaki lost to her back in April), but she was in pretty awful form at that time going off of her results around then. She had failed to qualify in her previous 4 matches prior to the defeat, losing in the first two rounds of qualifying in 5 straight tournaments, including the match vs. Kawagishi.

This is in stark contrast to her current form, in which she is dominating. In the first qualifying round of this tournament she double-bageled her opponent. That’s (6-0, 6-0) for those unaware, and it’s a good indicator that she’s going to destroy Kawagishi again <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.

Kawagishi has been in dreadful form. In her previous two matches before this tournament, she lost as the favorite twice—to an unranked player as a -450 favorite and then to Ohwaki. Her record on outdoor hard this year is 13-20 and she has been getting bounced in the first two rounds of the vast majority of her tournaments this season.

To summarize: Ohwaki is in excellent form, just handily beat her opponent last week, and her opponent is in poor form. At +137, this is very good value. She should be the favorite at more like -150 to -200 in my opinion. ITF women’s tennis can be unpredictable, so be warned, but I like this bet.</td></tr>

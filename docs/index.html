NCAA
Charleston @ Campbell 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Campbell ML -145

Campbell’s got a real shot in this one. They’re at home, and that matters — they usually play tougher and more confident on their own floor. If they can slow the game down a bit, crash the boards, and make Charleston work in the half court, that plays right into their hands. The key will be staying physical and not letting Charleston get easy transition buckets. If Campbell keeps it tight, takes care of the ball, and makes their free throws late, they can absolutely grind this one out. It doesn’t need to be pretty — just controlled and disciplined — and that’s the kind of game that favors the Camels.</td></tr>

The final of the Dallas Open features the two top Americans. Fritz is the slight favorite to take the title, but I expect this to be a very close match. 

Shelton has won in 3 in his last several matches. He will have to step his game up <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, but I like his style in big matches not against the Sinners or Alcarazs. Fritz has also been in a good amount of 3 setters this tournament, but I think he has looked a little better in Dallas.

These two don’t have much of a H2H history. They have split their H2H while one was a 3 set win for Fritz. Looking forward to a fun match where both players will want to try to cement their argument for best American player.

Good Luck!</td></tr>

College Basketball | NCAA Men’s Basketball
Towson @ Monmouth | Time: 7:00 PM ET

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Full Game Under 135.5

Odds: -105 (DraftKings)

Write-Up:

Towson and Monmouth both profile as real half-court teams. Neither side thrives on transition chaos or early-clock three-point barrages. This should be a possession-by-possession game where shot clock usage trends long and scoring opportunities are earned, not manufactured off live-ball turnovers. When both teams are comfortable grinding in the half court, natural possession compression follows — and totals in the mid-130s become much more sensitive to efficiency spikes.

The other factor is defensive structure. Both teams show strong suppression indicators, and neither projects as a volatility-heavy perimeter group. That lowers the likelihood of a sudden 10–0 run fueled purely by hot shooting variance. With a competitive spread and no clear pace accelerator on either side, the late-game foul risk is moderate rather than extreme. If this game stays within its structural identity — deliberate tempo, limited transition, contested looks — the scoring profile points closer to the low 130s than the high 130s.

Nothing exotic here. Just two teams that prefer control over chaos, a total that assumes a bit more tempo than the matchup suggests, and a game that should lean grind over track meet.

Best of luck!!

I said I am giving up on Partizan for this season, but their latest few games pulled me back in. I think they are much better team than Buducnost and the spread is set too low, that&#x27;s it.

Write Up: Indiana is looking good lately, I was going to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> them to cover outright, but Illinois is getting a couple starters back potentially, and I hate betting on road teams in college. So I&#x27;m buying a few extra points. Illinois has been trending down lately, Indiana has looked great, so double digits just seems to much of a spread. 

Utah is awful. So bad. Cincinnati hasn&#x27;t been amazing, but they did beat Iowa State by 9, and this game is at their place. I don&#x27;t see Utah being able to keep this game (or most conference games) close, but Cincinnati hasn&#x27;t shown that they can play consistently, so I&#x27;m buying a few points to cover their potential sluggish game.

Albacete vs Sporting de Gijon, over 2.5 goals @ 2 

Over 2.5 goals is a strong play in this clash. Albacete are aggressive going forward and usually create plenty of clear chances at home. Sportings defensive record on the road is often shaky, and when they concede, the game tends to open up. Both teams are capable of scoring, which increases the pace and intensity. A 3-2 or 4-0 result would not be surprising here.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Boston University -2.5 (-115) Units: 3U 

Good start yesterday. Towson played it a bit tight early but like I thought, they were able to capitalize on Navy’s turnovers and eventually just ran down their defense.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>, I’m taking BU -2.5 at home. This is Dartmouth&#x27;s first game of the season, and playing at Nickerson Field for your opener is a tough draw.

BU lost by Syracuse by 7 in their opener, but honestly, Syracuse is looking like a juggernaut this year (they just dropped 20 on St. Joes and beat Maryland). Even in that loss, BU looked okay, and they proved it by bouncing back and putting up 23 goals on Siena (I know Siena isn&#x27;t a powerhouse). Dartmouth is always scrappy, but the lack of game speed experience compared to a BU team that already has two games under their belt is going to be the difference. I expect BU to jump out early and cover the spread.</td></tr>

Niagara has a bottom 10 offense in the country scoring 62 pts/game and less than 30 in the first half. Niagara has solid defense but is still somewhat weak on the inside and defending the 3. Iona has great 3 pt shooting and defense. The only way this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> doesn’t win is if the flip scripts from 3 which is highly unlikely given the numbers.

**Write-up:**

Look forward to posting in here daily as I&#x27;ve been watching from the sideline for years and have created my own lines for a while.   
  
🏀 I’m firing on Maryland +2.5. This one looks much closer to a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>’em than the line suggests. Maryland is the more consistent team possession-to-possession and they’ve played a tougher schedule and are more battle-tested. Maryland has won against some solid opponents including *Iowa, Minnesota and Marquette.* Rutgers have shown more volatility, so I’ll take the points.

Biggest swing factor: if Rutgers can get hot from the 3. Maryland’s 3PT defense can be iffy (opp 3pt 37.6%).

**WriteUp:** AEK is playing good football this year, outperforming almost everyone of their opponents. PAOK is also playing very good and both teams are in great form. Honestly this could be a 50/50 game, but AEK had more time to prepare, this is only their 3rd game in 15 days, they only play in the league basically.
PAOK is playing their 6th game since 29th january. EL, greek cup, greek superleague games. 
The fresh legs and more preparation time makes me believe AEK should take this game or the very least draw.

Competition: Ligue 1

Sport: Football

Odds: 17/20

Reasoning: Toulouse score around 1.5 goals per game and are averaging over 6 shots on target in their last five, so they’re creating consistent chances. Le Havre have conceded 26 goals and are missing defensive players, which weakens their ability to keep it tight.

Match: Grimsby v Wolves &amp; Kilmanrock v Celtic

Time: 14:30 &amp; 15:00 CET

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Wolves ML + Celtic ML (1.82)

Reasoning: 

In the FA Cup, Wolverhampton Wanderers face lower-league opposition in Grimsby Town, and purely on squad quality and league level this is a mismatch. Wolves, despite struggling in the Premier League, still possess significantly better individual talent and physicality compared to a League Two side.

Cup games can always bring surprises, but typically Premier League teams handle lower-tier opposition, especially when they field a strong lineup like Wolves has <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. They won their last cup game convincingly so they are taking FA cup seriously and I expect them to beat Grimsby.

Celtic are without a doubt the best team in Scotland and lately they have picked up form.  They have already beaten Kilmanrock twice this season and I don’t expect this to be any different. After a terrible start to the campaign they are chasing down Hearts who are 6 points ahead and play Rangers <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> so it is the perfect opportunity to close the gap. Expect Celtic to win <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> and grab those 3 points against a much weaker opposition.

Write up:
We are looking at the Grand Final of BLAST Slam VI and a crucial PGL Cluj-Napoca group match.

Team Liquid (Dota 2): Liquid looked unstoppable in their 3-0 demolition of OG yesterday. They’ve finally found their rhythm in this tournament, and while NAVI pushed through a 3-2 thriller against Yandex, they looked much more vulnerable. Liquid already beat NAVI in the group stage earlier this month in a marathon 84-minute game; with the trophy on the line and Liquid&#x27;s current &quot;clean&quot; form, I expect them to take the series.

FUT Esports (CS2): Moving over to Counter-Strike, FUT is facing FURIA in Romania. FUT has been the &quot;giant killer&quot; lately, notably beating Liquid and FURIA 2-0 during IEM Katowice/Krakow stages just two weeks ago. FURIA is the favorite on paper, but they often struggle with consistency in BO3s. FUT coming off a 2-1 win over Aurora shows they have the map pool depth to at least take a map here, making the +1.5 handicap very safe value.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Illinois -5.5 (alt line) + Illinois team total o76.5 (alt line)

**Odds // Units:** DraftKings (-175) 3u

**Write-up:** Illinois possesses the best offense in college basketball HISTORY. They rank well in a variety of stats, including: three-point rate + percentage, offensive rebounding, protecting the ball, two-point percentage, and free-throw percentage. At home this season, Illinois has reached 77 points 14/15 times and covered -5.5 11/15 times. On top of this, Indiana has struggled on the road as an underdog going 1-3 and have went 1-4 versus ranked opponents. They are losing by an average of 11.5 points as a road dog + an average of 9 points to ranked opponents. Illinois is beating teams as a home favorite by an average of 22.3 points going 12-2.

Illinois ranks 22nd in ppg, INSANE 1st in offensive efficiency, which is even better at home - Indiana ranks 50th in ppg, 39th in efficiency, plays worse on the road. Illinois ranks top 10 in offensive &amp; defensive rebounding - Indiana ranks 216th and ranks 144th in opponent offensive rebounds allowed. 

Illinois&#x27; main guy, Wagler, is a problem. Averaging 19ppg, 5reb, 4.3 asts, and he’s playing even better in recent games. Dropping 46 against Purdue and 34 against Wisconsin. He operates in the ball screen, driving to the basket, drawing attention. This is what makes Illinois so dangerous. Wagner can take the shot and draw fouls, kick out for a three, where they shoot the lights out, or dish to one of their big men (the tallest team in the country) and can score easily. Illinois is coming off two road losses against Michigan State and Wisconsin, both went to OT, and lost by a combined 5 points. We know how good both of those teams are from a few picks ago… Illinois has severe issues guarding the three, so expect Indiana to light them up from behind the arc. However, Illinois’s interior defense is elite, and they allow zero second-chance scoring opportunities. 

Tread carefully, Indiana has been doing well themselves lately and this is a conference game. I just trust the offense and size advantage of the home team. They have proven themselves with wins and dog fights with tough ranked opponents. This is going to be high octane from the jump. Total opposite of the last game. Clemson&#x27;s offense left a bad taste in my mouth. Let’s watch the best offense in the nation make us some coin 👊. GL

**CET 16:15 Football La Liga**

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>: Rayo Vallecano vs **Atletico Madrid -1,5 handicap** at **3,4** odds

Explanation: First of all, this was one of the hardest decision making out of all these games. I had at least 5 games who were as close <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> as this one. All around similar odds or higher. They should honestly stop playing soo many games on weekends. It&#x27;s better to remove half of them to weekdays, because i got very few options on weekdays. But let&#x27;s get to the analysis. 

Factor 1: Rayo Vallecano is close to a demotion here as things stand and Atletico are fighting for top 4. They are basically too strong teamwise. Even their bench will beat them and Atletico doesn&#x27;t have any weak bench players there. I am cautious this time around, because i suspect that early substitutions will take place after leading comfortably. The reason is that they have a Champions League game on Wednesday vs Brugge (away). Hence the -1.5 handicap and not -2,5.

Factor 2: I have seen this bounce happen before and regretted it soo badly. The time where Atletico beat Real Madrid with 2-5 away and then boosted their confidence to the max by destroying Eintracht Frankfurt with 5-1. Same thing is happening here. They take down another monster team in the name of Barcelona this time with 4-0 and their confidence has skyrocketed once again. They will now play with big belief in themselves. It&#x27;s hard to describe exactly what&#x27;s going on in the players mind but we can simply call it **momentum**. That&#x27;s what they got and they will ride it.

On the side note: My tactics won’t change by lowering the odds. The goal is to find high odds to play here. I’m trying to keep track of the results in all of the top leagues. We will **always aim for** **long term** gains here and make sure to manage your bankroll. I will try to post another <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> in the coming days. Next <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> tomorrow, will be with low units for the first time since I started. I had a 1 unit bet size the first 2 or 3 games as far as I can remember. Good luck everyone.

Bookie: **Coolbet** and a **5** unit bet. Gamble **responsibly**!

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Over 0 Goals for Atletico Madrid + Over 3 Corners for Rayo Vallecano - 1.70 (Bet365)

*Recap: Tough loss. M&#x27;gladbach had 20 shots and couldn&#x27;t manage a single goal. Talk about bad luck!*

Write Up:

Rayo may be 18th in La Liga but at home, they are fortified. Managing only 2 losses in 10 home games and getting draws against teams like Barcelona and Real Madrid. They&#x27;ve also gotten 4+ corners in 9/10 of those home games. I think they&#x27;ll be able to get 4 corners this game.

Atletico Madrid seems to be getting stronger especially with the addition of Lookman to their squad. There&#x27;s also going to be a huge confidence boost given the clinical dismantling of Barcelona just 3 days ago. I expect them to win <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> but just to be safe, I&#x27;ll go with them getting a goal.

Last Pick: Zurich-Luzern BTTS&amp;O2.5 @ 1.75 ✅

Last Pick Write Up: Did you see that? The <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> hit, plus the safety side bet hit (1.53) and all the four degen side bets at 2.3, 3.96, 2.4 and 3.96 hit. If you followed all the degen bets, you would have made up for the unlucky losses plus then some.

Now for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>..

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Aarhus win &amp; Midtjylland/Draw @ 1.75

Write Up: It was hard to find a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> because all of my moneyprinters (Aarhus, Midtjylland, Pafos and Thun) are playing <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. I decided this one was the most likely to hit.

1. 11th place Frederica hosts 1st place Aarhus. Aarhus away has 6W3D0L while Frederica at home has 2W1D6L. Last H2H, Aarhus won 4-1. They should win this comfortably.
2. 8th place OB hosts 2nd place Midtjylland. OB at home has 4W2D3L while Midtjylland away has 4W3D2L. I just don&#x27;t think Midtjylland will lose here, they haven&#x27;t lost against OB in L5 H2H. I originally was going to go with Midtjylland straight win, but their captain is injured.

**Safety angle:** The <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> is probably the safest, but Aarhus to win &amp; O1.5 goals is good at 1.55 odds, or Aarhus win&amp; 1h Aarhus/draw at 1.5.

**Degen angle:** Here&#x27;s a fun stat. BTTS&amp;O2.5 has hit in the last 10/10 OB-Midtjylland H2H. The reason this is not my main <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> is because of the Midtjylland captain injury. As a side bet though, I&#x27;m going **Midtjylland/Draw + BTTS&amp;O2.5 @ 2.2**. I&#x27;m also doing **Aarhus win &amp; O2.5 + Midtjylland/Draw @ 2.24**. I&#x27;m also going **OB-Midtjylland O3.5 goals @ 2.38** and **Frederica-Aarhus O 3.5 goals @ 2.24.** Finally, I&#x27;m doing **Midtjylland/Draw + O2.5&amp;BTTS + Aarhus win &amp; O2.5 at 4.** Will maybe add O4.5 in the Aarhus match. All these side bets are at 0.25 units. I will also do something with Pafos and Thun. Probably a bet on both of them to win, plus some win/draw and over goals combinations.

BOL!

Writeup - Going with a player prop parlay, so staking half a unit.

Leg 1 - Paik has had a shot in last 5 games. Concern would be that when they play better opposition, Paik usually doesnt get a chance to take a shot, but decent value for this to hit

Leg 2 - Roma often opting to play Wesley at left wingback, which is advantageous for shots as he is right footed - so his natural urge is to come inside on that stronger foot. Wesley has taken 20 shots across his 20 starts for Roma in Serie A this season. If ur bookie offers sub play on options (mine doesnt), then Wesley is likely to be replaced by Stephan El Shaarawy who has been an effective option from the bench for Roma this season - managing 13 shots across just 381 minutes of football

Game: Counterstrike 2 (CS2) | Tournament: PGL Cluj Napoca 2026 | Time: 9:00 AM EST.

**XANTARES&gt;VSM Map 1 Kills**   
Teams: Aurora vs. paiN

* This is one of those plays I&#x27;d take strictly off of the players alone without even factoring in map, XANTARES in form is one of the best riflers of all time, and is still a top two carry for Aurora, who are -260 favorites, VSM has been the 4th best player on the new paiN roster so far, has had a few moments but this tournament so far has been awful with a .51 KPR
* Projected Map of Nuke for paiN, has been their main first <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> and best map, despite this think that Aurora aren&#x27;t a bad Nuke team and will keep it close
* XANTARES best map in the pool, averaging a .80 KPR L3 months, .89 KPR L6 months and a .79 KPR L12 months 
* VSM worst map has always been Nuke even going back to tier two, since joining paiN it hasn&#x27;t been his worst rated map so far but he hasn&#x27;t been put in great spots to succeed and has had just average stats so far despite his team winning 2/3 of the games he has played on the map
* XANTARES gets a CT side start which is heavily favored on Nuke for kills, .95 KPR on CT side Nuke in the L6 months

**S1zzi U 7.5 headshots Map 1**   
Teams: B8 vs. HEROIC

* S1zzi is the new AWPer for B8, have said it before but 7.5 is a crazy high line for an AWPer in almost any case
* S1zzi has limited data so far 36.4% headshot in just 6 map sample size as a pro, and only 2 games in tier one which he averaged a 40% headshot overall. I am expecting this to drop closer to low-mid 30% range once he gets a better sample of maps
* Even being generous and taking his 40% number from <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, at 40%, he would need \~20 kills to hit 8 headshots in a normal game, this is a ton of kills, his kill line is currently set to 13.5 on both maps with even money on both sides
* On top of this, Map 1 is HEROIC map <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, which means B8 will start on CT side, this is the side you see the AWP more and on average has a 2-3% headshot decrease overall, 0/2 hitrate on this line <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, 

Love both of these lines, FUT Map 1 ML (+140) <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> also has a ton of value imo for those that don&#x27;t have player props available

Universitatea Craiova - FCSB

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: FCSB Win or Draw @ 1.72

FCSB are the team chasing victory and the side that must do everything to secure it. Of course, it won’t be easy, as they are facing the league leaders, but it’s worth remembering that they managed a 2–2 draw in the Cup using a starting XI without several key players. Some were introduced during the match, but they were still without captain Darius Olaru and Cisotti, both rested.


The team coached by Elias Charalambous and Mihai Pintilii has gained confidence after three consecutive wins and even from the Cup draw, so they will approach this clash with belief.


Universitatea Craiova have shown vulnerabilities recently as well—on Thursday, but also against Dinamo București (1–1) and away at Farul Constanța, where they suffered a heavy 4–1 defeat.


For these reasons, the bet is that the visitors will not lose this derby.</td></tr>

Well, it’s been a year since I last posted a cricket <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, but <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> feels like the day. It’s India vs Pakistan. I don’t know why India are playing Pakistan, but it is what it is.

Coming to the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, Agha seems to be out of form in Sri Lanka, as he was a completely different player in Pakistan conditions. He hasn’t hit a single six in the World Cup so far, so I’m backing him to get out early against this massive Indian bowling lineup, which will continuously pose a threat in the form of Bumrah, Kuldeep (if he gets a chance), and the No. 1 T20 bowler, Varun. Keep your stakes stricly to 1u as you never know what&#x27;s coming next.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: Indiana St. @ Valparaiso u143.5 (-110) - 1u

Basketball | NCAAM | 13:00pm CST

Write Up: Ended up finding my previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> at slightly better odds on FD and took that instead of the stated -110.

Indiana St. vs Valpo projects as a controlled, half-court game between two offenses that have struggled to consistently generate efficient scoring. Neither side relies on pressure defense that creates transition chaos, and both teams tend to avoid sending opponents to the free-throw line which keeps the clock moving and limits easy points. With a modest spread and no clear incentive for either team to dramatically change tempo, the game should lean toward deliberate possessions and lower overall scoring than the total implies.

I was going to mention the way this could blow up, but as someone that bets unders, it’s basically always the same: do they play faster than normal and shoot better than they were supposed to? BOL!</td></tr>

Betting 1.5U to win 0.9U

\---

Motivated home side against an already qualified away team. This is a must-win for Mirassol, who need a win here to qualify for the knockouts, while Portuguesa has already secured their spot.

Mirassol is a much better team than their current standing suggests. Their position is heavily influenced by the strength of their schedule, which plays a significant role in this new format, fixture congestion from other competitions that forces rotations, and even a weather-delayed match that disrupts their plans.

Mirassol is a menace at home, they haven&#x27;t lost a single game there in their last 24 matches, 14 wins and 10 draws across Série A and Paulistão, a 72% home efficiency rate. They press early, dictate tempo, and control matches well. Additionally, visiting teams face a 5h30 bus trip from São Paulo or Campinas to Mirassol, which can lead to players becoming tired before the match even starts.</td></tr>

Edit- best price MGM, I’d play it all the way to +200 / +190 though. 

Yes I’m running it back. CZE got smoked 0-5 by Canada in game one, it’s to be expected, the Canadian and American teams are just packed with talent. Game two however they put in 6, this is another matchup with closer skill levels. The key here is targeting NHL players on the teams that aren’t packed with other NHL players. Czechia has Pasternak, Necas and Hertl (not
Counting goalies). They play at much higher levels than these other guys (for the most part) and will do the bulk of the scoring. Necas will help carry the offensive load and PP for +230 this is well worth doubling down on.

As a side note, this is <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick of the day</mark> so I know almost everyone is concerned with just flat out wins. I gamble as a second income, I’m more concerned with return on investment. So I will be (and have been) posting value plays.

**Odds:** \+151

**Write Up:** Unfortunate misplacement of faith in the England rugby team, not the end of the world - such is betting, just a misread on my end apologies to those who tailed. Cardiff cleared their line though, good read for that fixture. 5 unit bet for this one and I would say I have \~80% confidence in this lay <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. 

First leg of the two is for RB Leipzig to take away the 3 points. So, Leipzig&#x27;s home record is currently 7-0-3 - Wolfsburg are 3-1-6 away. Secondly, head to head Leipzig have won the last 3 meetings (total record of 7-3 in favour of Leipzig in last 10). Current form for Wolfsburg is winless in 4 in the league. In terms of league standings Leipzig are in 6th, Wolfsburg are in 15th - one is fighting for champions league 3 points off 4th and the other staving off dropping into relegation spots. Leipzig are favourites to win here, in combination to current form, home/away form, squad depths and the motivations for both teams, Leipzig should win this.

Secondly is Lyon ML, they boast a 8-0-2 home record with Nice travelling to Lyon with a 2-1-7 away record. In their last 5 head-to-head games at Lyon the record goes 3-1-1 to Lyon, furthermore Lyon are 9-1 in their last 10 home fixtures (all competitions, only losing to PSG in November). While Lyon did have 2 red cards last fixture, they do posses decent enough bench quality and form to see this one through. League standings see Lyon in 3rd and Nice in 14th; Lyon are competing for a Champions league spot, with Nice mid-bottom table, giving them fuel for competing and taking 3 points away to extend their 2 point lead on Marseille into 5 points. It must be mentioned that Nice haven&#x27;t lost in 3 games - BUT two of these were draws and they are by no means playing quality football. Home form, motivation and Nice&#x27;s travelling form should see Lyon taking all 3 points.

Arsenal are coming off a disappointing draw against brentford and will look to start some momentum with a big win at home tomorrow.

Wigan have 6 losses in their last 8 games including a 6-1 battering by Peterborough who sit 10th in the Championship... that should really show how much their structure struggles at the moment.

This is a pure tempo play. North Texas is bottom-tier in pace (~61–63 possessions) and Temple isn’t much faster, so this projects as a half-court grind on both sides.

Both teams allow mid-60s per game, shoot in the mid-40% range, and neither plays with real offensive pace. Combined scoring averages land right around the mid-130s before even adjusting for two slow teams facing each other.

With projected possessions in the low 60s, this game likely lives in the mid-120s to low-130s unless shooting variance goes crazy or we get OT.

Event: CBB | Denver @ Omaha (1:00 p.m. EST) | 🏀

*Recap: Brandon Miller took 19 shots and made five. Unreal. He finished with 16 points in 35 minutes. If he hits even 25 percent of the shots he missed, we clear the line. And after the 2-unit loss with UConn, I.... I needed to take a few days off after two beats in a row that just felt... icky. We move.*

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s reasoning:** Two teams will enter the arena. Neither will showcase any amount of defense. Combined, they&#x27;re scoring 161 points per game. But defensively... yikes. This is a bet that neither team will suddenly figure out how to guard, stop the ball, or otherwise protect the basket. Denver is allowing 81.2 points on the road, and Omaha is giving up 73.6 at home - although that number jumps to 76.5 for the season. Denver has been the number one over team all season - going 19-6 - which makes sense for a squad that is averaging 83.5 points - 44th in NCAA. Omaha is only 12-11 to the over, but they&#x27;re 5-3 to the over at home and they tend to get sucked into track meets. Case in point: on Thursday, Omaha (13-14) beat St. Thomas, 98-94. Omaha also beat Denver (13-14) two weeks ago, 84-82. BartTorvik is 60 percent confident in projecting this game to 163 points. KenPom sees it as an 82-81 win for Omaha. Haslametrics and Dunkel Index also project the over. And with a line this tight (-2.5), I think these teams will see all-out offense as the only way to a victory.

I think Vegas is overvaluing the noon game scoring slump. Anecdotally, I expected a Penn State-Maryland noon game to go low earlier this season, and I was way off. But *those* schools play something at least resembling defense. Omaha and Denver flippantly do not. Both defenses allow opponents to shoot north of 53 percent overall and 56 percent from 2-point range. Yuck. Denver&#x27;s effective field goal percentage is particularly bad, ranking 331st. Their defensive efficiency is 346th. Omaha&#x27;s is 272nd. Go ahead. Line up a shot. It&#x27;s going in against either side. On the other hand, they can score at will. Denver is hitting 38.4 percent from beyond the arc (19th in NCAA), and their true shooting percentage is SIXTY percent! Omaha isn&#x27;t firing on quite the same level, but the Mavericks are netting 83.2 points per game at home. Plus, Omaha has been hitting 7.3 points over their season scoring average in their last five games -- they&#x27;re over in four of the five, so its not just one-game blowout outlier carrying the load.

Look. Neither of these teams are winning the Summit League. This is a who-cares? Sunday noon game with a couple of .500 squads that want to shoot fast and refuse to play transition defense. Whoever wins will need every last point. It might even end on a flurry of baskets in the final minute, but I&#x27;m thinking we&#x27;re looking at the 160s and not the 150s. Omaha is averaging 81.6 points in its last five home games. Denver is averaging 83 points in its last five road games. The math ain&#x27;t mathin&#x27; for a line in the upper 150s. Let&#x27;s root for another track meet.

Good luck and Godspeed!

**Event:** LaLiga, Rayo Vallecano v Atletico Madrid, 10:15 EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Rayo Vallecano +0.5 Asian Handicap, +103, 1 unit

**Write Up:** I really don’t envy any team that has to play at Rayo’s ground. Rayo, the masters of draws, are extremely tough to crack at home, thanks to their **compact defence,** quick **transitions that are facilitated through the nifty midfielder Isi Palazon,** and last but certainly not least, intense backing by their fans. The ground has that **vintage South American feel** and it seems like a lot of teams just crumble there as of late. **Rayo already took points off Barcelona AND Real Madrid this season.** *They did narrowly lose to Atletico in the first fixture,* but even then they showed they can absolutely compete and nick some points off them at their own ground.

Not only that, but the **Atletico players are going to be a bit tired from the intense Barcelona game** just a few days ago, as well as mentally preparing for the reverse fixture. The league has already been effectively lost, so **they’re not going to put 100% of their effort into it,** unless the top 4 spot starts to look endangered. I expect Rayo to get out of this match alive and kicking. I think **Isi Palazon is going to have a big match** and help his team well in transition <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.

This bet is essentially a DC but my book offers slightly better odds on the Asian Handicap for whatever reason. For comparison, the DC is priced at -111. If you want to stack something on top of this play, you can go for an Under 2.5 goals - I’m very positive this hits. BOL and let&#x27;s try to enjoy some Simeone ball ☘️🫡</td></tr>

**Write-up:**  
This is the first game of the season for many players on both sides, so some early rust to be expected.

4/5 matches finishing **under** 40.5 points.

The Indigenous All Stars hold a slight edge in the halves and backline, while the Maori All Stars’ forward pack and bench rotation are stronger overall, in my opinion.

Expect a tight game built around field position and forward dominance. The number is slightly inflated for a preseason-style fixture, making the **UNDER 40.5** my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick of the day</mark>.

Necas picked up 2 points last game against France, and while Switzerland is better, they really only have two defenseman worth mentioning, and they are on separate lines.</td></tr>

Event: T20 Cricket World Cup - USA vs Namibia

Bet: USA over 6.5 sixes @ -110 (DraftKings)

Time: 3:30AM CST

I comment some, but I haven&#x27;t done my own picks, so I figured I may as well dip my toes in the water here.  I&#x27;ve been following the T20 cricket tournament extremely close so far, and looking for all the best bets I can.  I can thank jaysial for getting me into it, by the way.

For my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> here, I&#x27;m going with the USA to hit at least 6.5 sixes against Namibia in their upcoming T20 match.  Reasons are as follows:

1.  The USA just hit 9 against the Netherlands, who are at least on Namibia&#x27;s level (and have defeated them), and are performing at a high level.

2.  Before that, in their first tournament match, they had 6 against Pakistan, and Pakistan is WAYYYYYYYYY above Namibia&#x27;s level.  Getting 6 off of them is actually pretty dang good.

3.  Namibia bowlers are giving up a lot of sixes so far in the tournament.  In their last match, they gave up 14 to India.  Now, India are the favorites and are obviously extremely good, but 14 is still a healthy chunk of them.  Before that, they played the Netherlands and gave up 9 to them.  Yes, that&#x27;s the same Netherlands team that the USA just defeated handily.

  
There&#x27;s also a bet on DK under &quot;match specials&quot; that gives +130 odds for a USA win and them to have more sixes than Namibia; I took that as well but that&#x27;s obviously riskier.

Good luck!</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Marie Bouzkova 🇨🇿 ML vs Elise Mertens 🇧🇪 2.4 units to win 3.6U @2.50 (Bet365)

Shouldn’t have posted my last pick considering my plan was to just cover the masters 1000’s and grand slams since those are where the players’ motivations are the highest. Good thing we’re in a masters week now and we have a busy couple of weeks ahead of us. As you can tell by the odds manage your bankroll as Bouzkova is the underdog for a reason, don’t crash out if the bet loses. Heard? Great. I would consider fairer odds to be around the 2.1 range so the value is there and the line is too wide for me.

Bouzkova hasn’t necessarily been setting the world alight but her results have been logical this year. Straight set losses to better players in Andreeva, Swiatek and Mboko, straight set victories against Cristian and Zarazua. She’s also faced Badosa twice which ended as three close sets, sharing the spoils with one victory each. Mertens on the other hand reached the Australian Open 4th round for the first time since her run to the semis in 2018 but she did have a very favourable draw. She easily took out Tararudee, Uchijima and Bartunkova before crashing out to the eventual champion Rybakina. Last week she defeated Pavlyuchenkova and bowed out to Kasatkina. 

The No. 22 has had a better start to the season compared to the No. 37 more so results-wise rather than performances but I’m backing the upset due to this in my opinion being a tough match-up for Mertens. The Belgian is a consistent all-courter who doesn’t have many holes in her game with a strong backhand and plays mainly with rhythm. Bouzkova on the other hand is an out-and-out counterpuncher whose gamestyle relies on extending rallies with her elite court coverage and depth on her shots. I suspect that Elise is going to have to take more risks in rallies to overcome Marie’s grit and find some sort of rhythm which is going to force more errors out of her. Being a better server and the fact she can be aggressive does mean she can pull it off but it’s not an ideal match-up, this is going to be fairly close. Bouzkova also leads the H2H 2-0 though only the victory in Cincinnati in 2023 is meaningful which proves that she has bothered her in the past (other match was 11 years ago). If I were to compare the Czech to another player, stylistically, it would be Kasatkina who leads the H2H 6-2 and just thrashed Mertens 0 and 4 last week despite her dreadful form. BOL !</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Iwaki To Win -2AH@2.80 (Lilibet) | **Stake: 4u**

**Short Write Up**:

Last season Iwaki (J2) failed to win any of their first nine rounds, but from round 10 and till the end, they were the 3rd best team in the league, only beaten by Mito and Nagasaki who eventually took 1st and 2nd place. They only won 1-0 in their opener, but were all over Sapporo and should have won that game 3 or 4-0. 

Fukushima United (J3) had some insane games last season like they almost have every season now and saw the most goals in their games last year, much helped by the fact that they had the worst defence. In the J3 history books the figure seven times in the biggest Wins/Defeats… Five of the times is on the wrong side. Fukushima doesn&#x27;t have any real money to build a promotion chasing team, so it’s mostly made up of University recruits and loans.

Kofu beat Fukushima 4-1, Iwaki who is even better, should be able to do something similar.  </td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Czech Republic vs Switzerland 6:10 am EST (Olympics/Men&#x27;s Hockey)

Czech Republic over 2.5 total goals (-130)

Two teams that need a win and goals in order to get the bye in the next round for the quarterfinals. Both teams have pretty much the same amount of NHL players so I&#x27;m going with who has the most skilled/experienced players. Czech Republic have Pastrnak, Necas, and Hertl who are lights out in the NHL this season. For Switzerland, although they have better defenders in Roman Josi and JJ Moser, they simply do not have the same firepower that Czechia has especially with the loss of Kevin Fiala in their last game vs Canada. The closest to a NHL point per game player that they have is Nico Hischier and he&#x27;s not close. Another interesting fact that I saw about the Czech team is that only **one player** in the team didn&#x27;t play in the NHL. Most of them have at least 100+ matches played in the NHL before going to Europe. Meanwhile Switzerland has 9 players who currently play in the NHL and everybody else **never** played a single game in the NHL. To me this will come down to skill and experience which Czechia is better in both so I expect 2 scenarios. First one is Czechia overpowers Switzerland with their talent and puts up plenty of goals OR the second scenario is that Switzerland puts up a good defensive effort and Czechia gets their third goal in an empty net. I just don&#x27;t see Czechia only scoring 2 goals or less especially with goals being this important for the standings. 

Finally, although they didn&#x27;t have NHL players playing in that tournament, the last time Czechia played vs Switzerland was in the 2025 IIHF World Championship and Czechia won 5-4. Why am I bringing this up? Because the goalie for Switzerland will be the same that will be starting tomorrow so if he can get scored on 5 times with no NHL players imagine with them being there.

BOL!

Edit : ✅️ Let&#x27;s go!!! Was not the scenario expected but Czechia&#x27;s best players prevails to get that 3rd goal in the last 2 minutes!</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:**  Eberechi Eze ATGS (+110) 1 unit to win 1.1 units

**Write Up:** I guess that&#x27;s what you get sometimes when you back bad teams. Absolutely terrible offensive showing from West Ham. Nothing more to be said. 

The FA Cup continues <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> and we are back to a player prop <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> and we&#x27;re taking a player who is &quot;due&quot;. Eze has really yet to click with his Arsenal team, after making the early season move over from Palace. This seems like the perfect opportunity for Eze to arrive. He is far too talented to continue his scoring drought. Eze has only scored 4 goals this season, 3 of them in one match back in November. I&#x27;m thinking he will slot into the #10 role and get some chances to shoot from the edge of the box, which is his most dangerous zone. 

Wigan are two tiers below Arsenal in England&#x27;s 3rd tier (League One) and are 22nd in League One to boot. They&#x27;ve got a relegation battle on their hands and I don&#x27;t see them being up for the task defensively away against Arsenal. BOL and happy Sunday!</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>PICK</mark> - Athletic Bilbao Draw No Bet &amp; Salzburg to win any HALF AGAINST Grazer AK - 2.12 ODDS / +112 ODDS FOR AMERICAN MARKET

\- Athletic Bilbao will likely control possession early and apply constant pressure, forcing Real Oviedo to defend deep. Despite the low performances for Athletic Bilbao in away games, in such game, the experience &amp; quality should make the difference.  
\- Oviedo is expected to focus on defensive organization and counterattacks, with limited offensive opportunities throughout the match.  
\- Expect a positive outcome, in the worst scenario - a draw.

\- FC Red Bull Salzburg has significantly higher squad quality and attacking depth, allowing them to dominate phases of the game and create consistent scoring pressure against weaker opponents like Grazer AK ( 19-31 GD ).  
\- Grazer AK tends to struggle defensively against top-tier teams, often conceding momentum and chances over time, making it difficult for them to remain competitive across both halves. - FC Red Bull Salzburg’s previous match was well below their usual standards, as they failed to score despite having an offside goal minutes after conceding 2 in the first half. However, scoring is typically a consistent strength for Salzburg, given their attacking quality and offensive structure. Therefore, this match is expected to present better attacking efficiency and a higher number of goals.

**Last:** N/A

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: First quarter winner/match winner** San Antonio Spurs / San Antonio Spurs

**Start Time:** 8:10 PM ET

**Odds:** \-135 (fanduel)

**Units:** 5U

**Reasoning:**  
The San Antonio Spurs are showing a pattern of strong starts this season, consistently coming out of the gate with high energy and efficient offensive execution. Their first-quarter scoring has been above league average, largely due to their disciplined ball movement, ability to hit open shots, and tendency to exploit mismatches early. Tonight’s matchup further favors the Spurs, as their opponent has struggled historically in the opening quarter, often allowing fast-paced teams to dictate tempo and rack up early points.

Additionally, the Spurs’ depth on both ends of the floor gives them an advantage over a team that relies heavily on one or two primary scorers. This not only increases the likelihood of a first-quarter lead but also positions them to sustain that momentum into the full game. The -135 odds on FanDuel for a first-quarter winner and match winner represent value given their statistical trends, matchup dynamics, and recent form. A 5-unit allocation is justified for this play, considering both the probability of hitting and potential payout.</td></tr>

Phoenix Suns 🌞@ Minnesota Timberwolves 🐺 7:30PM EST / GMT -5 (19 hours from time of comment)

**Dillon Brooks UNDER 2.5 three pointers made (-154 DK) 1 Unit**

￼Write Up: Minnesota is elite in defending the perimeter and limiting three pointers to the tune of allowing only 12 per game this season. Over their last three games they’ve allowed a lowly 9.3 threes per game.

The last time Brooks eclipsed 2.5 threes made was 7 games ago, going a cruddy 9-for-38 (23.7%) in his last 6 games, including an 0-for-4 effort against the Rockets on Friday. Reports indicate he’s questionable due to an ankle injury. It’s likely he plays, but in a game that could be a blowout, they might curtail his minutes in an effort to not exacerbate his injury. 

Sure there’s a good amount of juice here at -154, but all signs point to Dillon staying cold from beyond the arc. You may be able to shop for better odds on another book, but here in Maine we have limited options for sportsbooks.

Write up: Model says these are the top plays for the day. The 2 <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> parlays are 6-1 thus far, so why fix something that’s not broken! We keep rocking with the 2 legs. Unfortunately, model got the wrong read with Baltimore and Brown.

• ⁠Model is projecting the game to go under 42.5 at 53%

• ⁠Models&#x27; projection is 52% ML for the Eagles - which in return means it could be a slow, close matchup based off of the lines

• Model projects Eagles win 23-20 

• One thing that I am nervous about with the Chargers spread is that Herbet is playing with his hurt wrist/hand - I am hoping that he is capable of still being himself

• My intuition is telling me this game will be like a majority of the prime-time games this year, boring - which means low scoring - I do not understand the O/U line being set at 41.5, that does seem very low considering these two offenses can light it up any day of the week

• I could see the Eagles scoring less than 20 points in this matchup

• Model also loved AJ Brown and D Smith for this one, but I don&#x27;t trust Hurts - Brown is due for a bad game while Smith is due for a big game... but the Eagles man, they have been weird this year

Let&#x27;s keep rolling.

**EPL | Wolverhampton v Man Utd**

Man Utd is facing Wolves, who have one of the worst home defenses in the league. Wolves have conceded 17 goals in 7 home games. And 86% of Wolves&#x27; goals are at home. Man Utd have failed to keep a clean sheet in 13 of their 14 games this season.

Man Utd Vs a Defensively Weak Team this season:  
vs Burney: 5 (Total goals)  
vs West Ham: 2  
vs Nottm Forest: 4  
vs Brentford: 4

Manchester United can definitely capitalize on poor defense, but they are vulnerable to late goals and have failed to keep a clean sheet even against a weak offense. Since wolves are at home and most of their goals have been on home ground this season, they have to score in this matchup even to have a glimpse of hope. Man United have an obvious backline concern, so I hope the goal line goes over 3.

***Note: This is an Asian goal line. If the total goal is at 3, it is a push.***

**Streak**: 1L

**Last 10:** WWWWWWWW L \_

**Last Pick:** Chicago Bears +6.5 (-105) 5 units vs Green Bay Packers

**Last Pick Reflections:** Tough to feel that first loss but it had to happen eventually. I hate chalking up picks to bad beats because for every bad beat, there&#x27;s a win that you get just as lucky on. I will take this one on the chin...it was just a tough loss honestly but really pleased with my read of the game. While the Bears had a lackluster first half, it felt like the only thing the packers found success on offensively was when the Bears sent blitz packages which Love absolutely diced up. It was unfortunate in the end that they had Jacobs bottled up on 3rd and 1 and couldn&#x27;t make a tackle that would&#x27;ve given the Packers 3 instead of 7. Then caleb unable to find moore underneath on the final play that would&#x27;ve scored the TD. Had he even thrown it to the end zone with a little more velocity and not underthrown it, feel like this would be a different story. just the way it goes sometimes :(

**Event:** Los Angeles Chargers vs Philadelphia Eagles NFL

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Los Angeles Chargers Moneyline (+115) 5 units

**Rationale:** Will keep it short and to the point. The Eagles offense has looked lackluster lately (15.5 point average over the past 4 games) and I expect it to continue against the Chargers. The issue is that they&#x27;re not utilizing Saquon well and Hurts has clearly taken a step back. They found some signs of life feeding Brown, but I anticipate LAC will key in on this to neutralize Brown and Smith as much as possible. More importantly, the Chargers defense has been rock solid against the run all year, barely giving up anything on the ground and consistently getting off the field on third down. Offensively, they finally found rhythm in the run game last week with nearly 200 rushing yards and a pair of scores, and now they get a Philly front that’s been leaking yards and losing leverage in the run game all season. With the return of Hampton, I anticipate this Chargers offense to find its groove backed by the likes of QJ, Gadsden, and Allen. Put those pieces together, and this is a spot where L.A.’s strengths line up perfectly with the Eagles’ weaknesses

Just to reiterate, in conjunction with my model, I use the eye test as well as my gut feeling to play what I believe is the most-valuable <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> on the slate. Cheers to a great game, and please remember to gamble responsibly and to only wager what you can afford to lose.

Game/Time/League: League of Legends (LOL) | 4:45 am EST. | Kespa Cup

**Writeup:**

* So far thru two days of Kespa Cup and it has been all favorites throughout this tournament and it is pretty obvious to see why in most matchups, DRX and DNF are both playing in group B and tomorrow is the final day of playoff contention, this is a big game for seeding so both teams should be giving it their all
* DRX are currently 2-1 with wins vs. KT Rolster and BRO, while losing a relatively one sided game against DK who are at the top of the group at 3-0. They are playing with their full roster with Rich top, Vincenzo/Willer jungle, Ucal mid, and Jiwoo/Andil in the bot lane. Both their wins have been very dominant so far, beating KT by 14 kills in a 26 minute stomp, and beating BRO on day 1, in a 30 minute game where they won by 14 kills as well. 
* DNF are current 1-2, with a win against KT Rolster, and big losses to BRO and DKia, DNF are playing with 0/5 of their LCK roster meaning it is their full LCK Challenger roster, while they have a decent roster of players, their is just such a massive gap between LCK Challenger teams and full LCK teams. Their win against KT who is using 4/5 LCK Challenger roster was evenly fought because of that, but BRO who were using LCK players destroyed them 24-7 beating them by 17 kills total, they also lost to DK in 26 minutes and were down by 13 kills overall
* Nearly every game at this tournament so far has been relatively one sided and ended under 31 minutes outside of a 50 minute marathon game with Team Liquid, games are snowballing hard and can&#x27;t stress enough the gap between LCK and LCK Challenger teams, favorites have had major success thru the first two days and see no reason why it doesn&#x27;t continue here in day 3, DRX are a win away from guaranteeing the 2 seed in the group, trust the more experienced and better players to get the job done</td></tr>

Write Up:  




The Eagles–Chargers Over 41 has that “don’t overthink it” energy. Both offenses have shown they can move the ball even when they’re pretending they can’t, and both defenses have a habit of giving up chunk plays like they’re handing out free samples at Costco. The Eagles still have enough firepower to finish drives, while the Chargers at home always seem to find a way to accidentally stumble into a 24point night. Add in a couple blown coverages, a random explosive play, and suddenly you’re sweating the Over with 10 minutes still left in the third.

Monday’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> - Eagles -1.5 vs Chargers -115 (1.15u to win 1u)

This feels too easy, which always makes me nervous. However, I’m going to trust the process here. The Eagles usually do a good job at responding after a not so good game. That didn’t happen last week, but I think it happens here. They have had an extended break to prepare and get ready. They will be out Jalen Carter, but they be going up against an O-Line that is so banged up that they’re going to be able to do just fine. There is also a chance that Justin Herbert doesn’t play, or he is very limited.

As far as the offense goes, I don’t think they need to score 30 to win. I think 20 could do the job. The Chargers defense is tough, but I don’t see them being able to overcome their offensive struggles.

Good luck!</td></tr>

Sport: Italian Serie A - Torino vs. AC Milan @ 2:45pm EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: AC Milan Win + Under 4 Goals = +130 (5 units)

Write Up: Torino has been in poor form, they’re not a great team. They’re currently on a five game losing streak and took a big home loss to Como on Nov 24th, proving their grounds aren’t a “12th man.” AC Milan, on the other hand, has the best defence in Serie A so far this season, they’ve only let in 9 goals. AC Milan isn’t a team that wins by large margins either, they’ve scored 5 goals in their last 5 games (2 of which were against Parma). Allegri has kept AC Milan very focused on defense and therefore I believe they’ll score first with the fire power they have (Pulisic, Modric and Leao) and then do what they do best, defend.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** **Kartal vs Pieri - Kartal Handicap -6.5 Games @ 1.71**

We head into another week of Indoor tournaments, with some talented WTA players entering the draw, such as Kartal and Krejcikova, with this 125 tournament being quite stacked, which should certainly create one-sided matchups, and one of them is this one.

Kartal had a decent season, with superb performances in her last tournament in Beijing, where she dominated strong players such as Kasatkina, Maya Joint and Mirra Andreeva. She&#x27;s quite short, but her court speed and agility are fantastic. Not only that, but she also serves at a high percentage for someone with her height and has a powerful backhand. Currently ranked 69th, she certainly can be at least a top 30 player.

Pieri was never able to get out of the top 200, and fast surfaces were never her speciality. If we look at her current season, she played 52 matches on clay and only 13 matches on hard courts. When it comes to recent form, she isn&#x27;t performing particularly well, having lost 5 out of her last 6 matches in straight sets (all on clay). The Italian player is only 1.60m and should struggle to close service games against a player of Kartal&#x27;s quality from the baseline.

These types of handicaps can certainly be dangerous when the underdog has the possibility of doing a phenomenal game, but I&#x27;m quite certain that this will be a walk in the park for Kartal. Expect her to dominate Pieri on an indoor hard court.

Good luck!</td></tr>

__Event:__ NFL: Eagles @ Chargers 8:15pm EST

__POTD:__ AJ Brown o60.5 receiving yards (-110), 3.3u to win 3u

__Write Up:__ The 8-4 Philadelphia Eagles are traveling to LA to take on the 8-4 Chargers on Monday Night Football. Just 2 games ago the Chargers were blown out 6-35 by the Jags, then luckily had a bye week the following week. They used the rest &amp; put a beat down on the (2-10) Raiders 31-14. They are currently 2 games back behind the Broncos in the AFC West &amp; are looking to gain stay in contention for the top spot of the Division. The Eagles suffered their 2nd straight loss last week to the Bears on Black Friday in their last game 24-15, but they still are on top of the NFC East. The Eagles led the entire game as they were up 7-0 after the 1st quarter, 10-3 at the half, &amp; 10-9 after the 3rd quarter. But then they gave up 2 TD’s in the 4th &amp; couldn’t come back. Starting OL Lane Johnson was injured with a foot injury &amp; has this has significantly affected the Eagles run game, leading to more passing.

No team in the NFL has won more games than the defending Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles (47-16), since the start of the 2022 season. The Eagles offense has been stagnant lately, but they have played some good competition. Whereas the Chargers have had a weak schedule. The Chargers have done really well at shutting down the pass. LA ranks 7th in the NFL in EPA/Dropback allowed. Phili hasn’t been great through the air lately, but they are still above average passing, ranking 13th in the NFL in EPA/Dropback. QB Jalen Hurts has been slinging deep this season. __Hurts is 2nd in the league in rate of throws 20+ yards downfield (15.2%). He ranks 4th in the NFL in completions of 40+ yards with 8. Hurts has a 118.6 passer rating on those deep throws, the fourth highest in the NFL. Spreading the field has also helped Hurts, who has a league leading 113.3 passer rating in sets with four or five wide receivers.__ Who has Hurts primary downfield target been lately? Star WR AJ Brown. The Eagles may have had a rough game vs the Bears last week, but Brown had a huge game, catching 10 balls for 132 yards &amp; 2 TD’s. Brown has become the focal point of this Eagles offense the past few weeks. __AJ Brown has double digit targets in 3 straight games. Brown leads the NFL in designed/first read targets over the last 3 weeks with 32.__ Over that same time period, other Eagles star WR DeVonta Smith has only 23 designed/first read targets. The pecking order has been reestablished in Philadelphia &amp; AJ Brown is the clear WR1. Brown has been the best receiver in football since then. __In his last 2 games he ranks #1 in Receiving Yards (242), #1 in Receptions (18), &amp; #2 in Targets (22). He has 47% of the Eagles receiving yards in those games.__ He has been the guy the guy all season that they get the ball to when they need to move the ball. __Brown has the 3rd most receiving yards amongst WR’s in the 4th quarter with 268. He has had 50% of the red zone targets over the last 5 weeks.__ The Chargers have great stats this season at shutting down opposing WR’s, but most of the WR’s they’ve played this season have to wear helmets off of the field as well. __All of the pass catchers they’ve played this year that don’t have the tism’ all hit this number this season- Bowers: 4/63, Jakobi Meyers: 5/64, Jettas: 7/74, Alec Pierce: 5/98, Waddle: 6/95, Deebo: 8/96, &amp; Sutton: 6/118.__ Not only is this a good play due to AJ Brown’s recent success, but also due to the Chargers defensive scheme. __The Chargers run Zone coverage at the highest rate in the league, as they only run man on 14.1% of their snaps, the league’s lowest rate.__ Brown has been a monster vs zone defense lately, &amp; Hurts has been targeting him way more than other star Eagles WR Devonta Smith. Here are the 2 WR’s stats vs Zone coverage over the last 3 games:

Brown: 1st Read: 48.8%, Yards/Route: 3.59, Targets/Route: 0.37, Air Yard Share: 44.3%, 1st Down/Route: 0.18, ASS: 0.106 (Average Separation Score)

Smith: 1st Read: 24.4%, Yards/Route: 1.54, Targets/Route: 0.20, Air Yard Share: 36.4%, 1st Down/Route: 0.06, ASS: 0.05

Smith also has been playing in the slot in a majority of his snaps this season. __Devonta has ran 59% of his routes from the slot. Whereas AJ has ran 89% of his routes out wide.__ That’s not good news for Smith as he’ll be lined up against Chargers star defensive back Derwin James Jr. The Chargers have been using safety Derwin James Jr. as their primary slot coverage player. __Among qualified cornerbacks &amp; safeties, James allows the lowest yards per slot coverage snap (0.28), ahead of notable safeties like Kyle Hamilton (0.42) &amp; Minkah Fitzpatrick (0.49).__ Smith is going to struggle this Monday night opening up even more opportunities for AJ. Brown is also much bigger than the Chargers DB’s &amp; I think Hurts continues to target him all game, especially with the run game situation. 

Eagles RB Saquon Barkley has been a shell of what he was last year. Barkley had 14 games with 100+ rushing yards last season. This season he has just 1 game with 100+. He has only rushed for more than 60 yards twice in his last 10 games, getting held to less than 50 yards in half of those. This week he’ll be behind an offensive line that will be without star LT Lane Johnson. Barkley is not the same back with Johnson off the field as he is with him on. __On 124 rushes with Johnson on the field, Barkley has ran for 4.2 yards per carry with a run of 10 + yards on 11.3% of his carries. With Johnson off the field, Barkley has ran 74 times for 218 yards (2.9 YPC) &amp; a run of 10+ yards on just 4.1% of his carries (38th in the NFL).__ The Eagles are going to have trouble getting things going on the ground &amp; will have to turn to Brown through the air.

In a defensive game where points are going to be hard to come by, AJ Brown is going to get fed as the most efficient weapon on the field.

__AJ Brown o60.5 receiving yards__

**Write-Up**

Arsenal comes into this match red hot. They have won their last 7 matches. In those matches there has been 4 goals only scored once which all came within 20 minutes. Arsenal controls the entire match and have a suffocating defense. They are amazing at set pieces. Brighton can score but I don&#x27;t see them scoring much this game. I see Arsenal controlling the clock and possession. I see them winning a low scoring match around 2-1 but wouldn&#x27;t be shocked if it went 1-0 or 2-0.

**Writeup:**¬†*As per request, I&#x27;ve added an event label to help those not familiar with US sports locate my plays!*

*Death, taxes, and the Celtics killer covering his lines against the Celtics.*

*DM has covered this line in 10 out of the last 11 games vs the Celtics, averaging 30.8 points and 4.9 boards across 20 career meetings (\~35.7 P+R), and he‚Äôs posted multiple 30‚Äì40 point nights versus them in the past two seasons.* 

*With Cleveland down two starters‚ÄîDarius Garland (toe) and Max Strus (foot)‚Äîplus Sam Merrill (hip), Mitchell‚Äôs on-ball load consolidates, and he‚Äôs already opened the season at 31.3 PPG with \~33+ P+R in 33 minutes per game.* 

 *Boston‚Äôs roster context also tilts toward volume for him: the Celtics are without Jayson Tatum (Achilles), and they moved Jrue Holiday and Kristaps Porzi≈Üƒ£is this summer, leaving Derrick White/Jaylen Brown (hamstring GTD) and Simons as the primary perimeter stoppers and less backline deterrence than last year.* 

 *Coaching and team trends align, too‚ÄîKenny Atkinson (2025 Coach of the Year) has Cleveland playing fast and efficient since last season (No. 1 in scoring at 121.9 PPG in 2024-25).*

*Celtics are giving up the 9th most points to SGs on the year and the MOST rebounds, allowing VJ Edgecomb, Josh Hart, and Jordan Poole to smash their lines against them.*

*With a competitive spread of +/- 4.5 and a respectable game total, expect Mitchell to steal a major slice of the pie.*</td></tr>

Last Pick: Rafael J√≥dar to win 2-0 vs Murphy Cassone (+125, 1 unit): Win 

Tennis | Charlottesville Challenger | 11:30 AM EST (estimated)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Jay Clarke vs Dylan Dietrich | Dietrich ML at +135 (MGM). 1 unit. 

Write-up: Jodar closed around -120. The match one was a bit more competitive than I expected, as Jodar was actually down a break for the majority of the second set (and even faced a break point at 1-3, but it felt like he was able to get his nose into all of Cassone&#x27;s service games. For that reason, it wasn&#x27;t a huge surprise to see him break back with Murphy serving for the set and roll from there.

Jodar might be an exceptional player, but he wasn&#x27;t the only one behind Virginia&#x27;s success (9-4 record in competitive conference and NCAA tournament QF appearance) last season. <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>, I&#x27;m actually going with another strong Virginia player, Dylan Dietrich, to get a win on familiar grounds. Last year, Dietrich played at either #2 or #1 in the lineup depending on whether Jodar was available. He put together a really nice dual season (6-3 at No. 1, 12-2 at No. 2) that led to him being ranked at #9 in the ITA&#x27;s preseason ranking for this year. He was especially strong at home, where he scored wins over ITA #2 Sebastian Gorzny, #11 Aidan Kim, and #6 Jay Friend. All of that is to say that his current ranking of #1172 in the world is in no way representative of his playing ability. 

Dylan already got off to a strong start here in Charlottesville, defeating world No. 318 Alfredo Perez in straight sets (7.04 performance rating) after being pushed down to 2.20 from a 2.70 opening price. That match serves as a useful comparison, since he&#x27;s being priced similarly to his closing odds here. Similar to Jodar, I feel that Dietrich has a very strong indoor game. He&#x27;s definitely not as stable from the baseline from Rafa; however, he stands at 6&#x27;5&quot; and possesses a massive serve that produced 11 aces and a 9.0 shot quality rating in that match. 

Meanwhile, Jay Clarke had an absolutely horrific start to the season, but was able to rebuild his form by playing some ITFs. However, he&#x27;s not really your average Brit in that his strongest career results (including this season) have come on clay, not fast indoor hard courts. He got a solid first-round win over Tyler Zink (7.12 performance rating); however, the fact that he was priced as a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>&#x27;em in that match isn&#x27;t a great sign of the market&#x27;s confidence in him (Zink had one big run in Tiburon, but his Challenger results haven&#x27;t been too great outside of that). Going back to the Perez match, I feel that Clarke is the slightly weaker player compared to Alfredo, who has recently taken sets off guys like Abdullah Shelbayh and Michael Zheng. 

Overall, this match feels like a toss-up to me, so I like Dietrich at plus money. Clarke&#x27;s biggest asset is his heavy topspin forehand, which doesn&#x27;t work as well on this surface, and Dylan&#x27;s game should be better suited to these conditions. Prices on this play vary quite a bit across books - I would take it down to +120/2.20 or so, but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s value beyond that.

I‚Äôm going with **under 2.5 goals** for Parma vs Roma because both teams usually play cautious football. Parma tend to sit deep and defend in numbers, while Roma prefer controlling the game rather than rushing forward. Neither side creates many clear chances, so it‚Äôs likely to be a tight, low-scoring match.</td></tr>

Donovan Mitchell OVER 27.5 Points (-112 FD)

Cleveland Cavaliers @ Boston Celtics 
(7 PM)
Anaysis :  

Mitchell has absolutely torched the Celtics in past matchups, clearing this line in 9 straight games against them (100% hit rate) while averaging 33.0 points per game over that stretch. And those were all with Garland active.

Across those 9 meetings, Mitchell averaged 37.8 minutes and 23.7 FGA. In games where he logs 36+ minutes on 22+ FGA, he‚Äôs gone over in 24 of his last 28.

The Celtics have struggled to contain guards this season, allowing 3 of 4 to smash their lines: ‚¨áÔ∏è

Jordan Poole ‚Äì 22 PTS (Line: 20.5)
Jalen Brunson ‚Äì 31 PTS (Line: 24.5)
Tyrese Maxey ‚Äì 40 PTS (Line: 25.5)

With this game expected to stay close (Cavs -4.5), Mitchell should see heavy minutes and strong usage. And with Sam Merrill out, Cleveland‚Äôs guard depth is thin, meaning Donovan should have the green light all night</td></tr>

Last Pick: Lecce +3 corner handicap vs Napoli ‚úÖ

Event: SPFL (Scottish Premiership) ‚öΩÔ∏è

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Motherwell U1.5 cards vs Dundee United 4U @ 2.37 (Bet365)

Write-up: Napoli keep their place at the top of the league but were truly made to work for it. Napoli had two quick corners around the 15th minute in a first half pretty poor of opportunities despite Lecce being incapable of keeping the ball. The Giallorossi then started the second half much better than their opponents winning two corners shortly and Camarda missed a penalty. Napoli then brought on their rested big guns in Mctominay and Hojlund to regain conrol, taking the lead shortly after through Anguissa. This coincided with the corner count ending 5-3 to the Napolitans with late heartbreak for those on the +2 handicap that the line moved to after they were afforded a 95th minute corner.

Motherwell find themselves mid-table in 7th spot and defeated Livingston at the last minute in their previous match. They also are into the Scottish League Cup semis where they‚Äôll face off against St.Mirren in a couple of days. Since Askou took over the club in June the steelemen have been playing some nice attacking football and have averaged just 1 card per match this season. On the other hand Dundee United are in fourth spot, ahead of Rangers in what has been a strange season where Hearts are well clear of Celtic and the Gers. They tend to be quite aggressive, averaging 3 cards per match this year. Those stats are in line with referee of the day Chris Graham who has averaged 3.9 cards over his career in Scotland (4.3 this season though the sample size is very small). Using all the stats I have I get a mean of 1.1 yellows for Motherwell.

That gives this play an estimated 72% chance of winning. Honestly I‚Äôm quite surprised at the odds as they‚Äôve covered this line in 7/10 matches this season. Obviously it‚Äôs quite risky as a red card would kill the bet and in general there isn‚Äôt much lee-way but the value is too good to ignore for me so will assume the risk that comes with it. BOL !

**KEPCO - Hyundai Capital**
South Korea üèêV League ‚è≥9 Hour

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **Hyundai Capital -1.5 Set Handicap** @ 1.65

Hyundai Capital has retained its champions from last season and, on top of that, re-signed Leo (Leonardo Leyva). Keeping last season&#x27;s MVP maintains their attacking ceiling. National-level outside player Lim Sung-jin left for KB Insurance during the April FA season; this departure has weakened KEPCO&#x27;s wing scoring. KEPCO&#x27;s revision in wing scoring and their 0-3 performance in the opening week, combined with Hyundai&#x27;s serve-blocking dominance, could tip the balance in the early sets. Hyundai&#x27;s side is reasonable in this match; my scoreline is 3-1 Hyundai. The risk is that KEPCO&#x27;s new outsider might steal a set in a &quot;warm-up&quot; scenario, but Hyundai&#x27;s passing and blocking discipline throughout the match favor them.</td></tr>

Last Five Predictions (Old - New): ‚ùå‚úÖ‚úÖ‚ùå‚úÖ¬†

Net Units: +22.49

Yesterday&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Thun v Winterthur. Thun (-1.0 &amp;-1.5) Asian Handicap. 3u @ $1.87 ‚úÖ¬†

I&#x27;m writing this as the game goes on. So apologies for any tense jumping...

Thun started really well, scoring two goals within the first 36 minutes. However, three minutes after their second goal, they copped a straight red card, so they played 50+ minutes with 10 men.¬†

Winterthur dominated possession in the second half - but the shot count was pretty even. As the half went on, though, Thun dominated the xG stat, even though they had next to no possession‚Äîwhich is precisely what you want when you&#x27;re a man down and in a winning position.... Give away limited decent chances, and hit them on the break when you do have the ball.¬†

Thun even had a great chance in the 78th minute to make it 3-0, which would have given some breathing room.¬†

However, Thun then scored a couple of minutes later to make it 3-0 with under 10 minutes left.

Thun held out for the rest of the game to win 3-0. Was unsure how we&#x27;d go with this once the red card happened, but a good win for us.¬†

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Roma to beat Parma and u3.5 total goals. 3u @ $2.05

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Off to Italy <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> as 15th-placed Parma travel to Rome to play 2nd-placed Roma.

Most of the time, I would be all about the 2nd-place team comfortably beating the 15th-place team at home... And I&#x27;m not against that... But I like the u3.5 goals here.¬†

Now, you could say a lot of things against Gasperini&#x27;s Atalanta, but you wouldn&#x27;t say they played boring games.¬†

At Roma, though, his side looks a little different. There are a hell of a lot fewer chances. Parma are not much different.

Both teams have played 8 games in Serie A this season.¬†

Roma matches have had 11 total goals.

Parma matches have had 10 total goals

Roma have scored eight goals and won six games. Now, that&#x27;s efficiency.

It&#x27;s not like they&#x27;ve been smashing xG and missing goals either; they&#x27;re 9th in the league for expected goals with an even 10 in 8 games.¬†

It&#x27;s their defensive work that&#x27;s put them in second so far; they&#x27;ve conceded 3 goals this season off a league-beating 7.0 expected goals.

Parma games have been super tight, but very low scoring too.¬†

Parma have only scored three goals in their games so far off their 6.6 expected goals.¬†

On top of that, none of their goals scored have been away from home.

However, they&#x27;ve only conceded seven goals themselves. Parma have the 7th best defence xG-wise with 8.3 expected goals against.¬†

Parma have also played Como, Atalanta, and Juventus.... So it&#x27;s not like they&#x27;ve had a super easy run.

Still, I can&#x27;t see Parma scoring enough to do anything.

I was tossing up between this and the overall under 2.5 goals scored at $1.73. Obviously pros and cons for both. Putting half your stake on both of those results wouldn&#x27;t be the worst idea - but it&#x27;s not exactly a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> if I do that!¬†</td></tr>

TODAYS BET 

EVENT/S = PSG VS Lorient 

BET =¬† PSG to score over 2 goals @1.83

UNITS = 5U to Profit 4.16U

SUMMARY = I love this line and think it has way too much value with the current form of PSG. They come up against 16th place Lorient which in the French league is a relegation playoff spot. Lorient have played 3 teams in the current top 6. Monaco, Lille and Marsielle. Monaco had a first half red card so they actually lost to Lorient but Marsielle and Lille beat them 4-0 and 7-1 completely dominating them. So when Lorient come up against a good team they struggle. Psg haven&#x27;t cleared this in every game they should in my opinion but I think that&#x27;s because they haven&#x27;t had PSG calibre line-ups most of the season. PSG have had some world class attackers return from injuries recently including Dembele which is huge for them. He has only been coming off the bench for 30 mins in the last couple of games but I feel like this would be the perfect game for him to come back in and start. Honestly I don&#x27;t really see how PSG don&#x27;t score 3 goals here, they have potentially their strongest line up coming up against a team that struggles that don&#x27;t have a world class keeper that bails them out. I can see this being 4 or 5-0 

If my picks help you and you&#x27;d like to show your appreciation a thumbs up is perfect, if you&#x27;d like to tip which is never expected but always appreciated and does help motivate me for the research here you go.  [Beer üç∫ ](http://Paypal.me/smoothsailinnomore)</td></tr>

A dominant display by England has seen 19 bets straight without consecutive losses.

An early red card to Aus was ideal and England capitalised, scoring 2 in the first half.

Brest will travel to Le Havre midweek for a competitive clash of two league strugglers.

Brest will be looking to return to the form that saw them make the knockout stages of the Champions League last year.

I‚Äôd back them to score against an inconsistent Le Havre that has shipped 16 league goals in 9 games including 6 to Marseille recently.

As for Brest they have conceded 17 goals and managed to score 14 giving them 31 total goals over their 9 games in comparison to Le Havre&#x27;s total of 27 meaning there is over an average of 3 goals per game between these 2, with both averaging over a goal scored and goal conceded.

These stats alone are enough to suggest BTTS. I like the fact that it‚Äôs a Le Havre home fixture too, and I see the right value in this bet.



**14 wins in 19 bets,** well done to any followers. No pressure whatsoever, but if you are willing, any help will go a long way.

Bayern have won 13 straight matches to start the season, which ties the all-time European record, and they will be looking to extend that run to be the record holders for the only team in top 5 league to have won 14 straight wins to start the season. Bayern have scored 47 goals in those 13 games while only letting in 8 goals, showing they are unstoppable in both attack and defense. Harry Kane is in incredible form with 20 goals already this season including 12 in the Bundesliga, and Bayern just destroyed Gladbach 3-0 away last Saturday showing they score lots of goals even on the road. 

Bayern have not lost to Koln since 2011 and have won 18 of their last 20 meetings against them. Koln are struggling badly right now, losing 1-0 to Dortmund last weekend without managing a single shot on target, and they barely survived the first round of the cup needing two goals in the 95th minute to beat a third-division team. Bayern are very motivated to win the DFB Pokal because they have not won it since 2020, and their coach Vincent Kompany just got a contract extension and wants to win trophies. With Bayern scoring almost 4 goals per game this season and Koln&#x27;s weak defense and terrible form, a scoreline like 3-0, 4-0, or 3-1 is very likely, making the -1.5 handicap one of the safest bets tonight.

Sweaty Dub - 2 goals in the last 20 minutes to hit, but a dub is a dub. 

Todays <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: NCAAF, Jacksonville State -6 v MTSU -110. 

Units 1.1 units to win 1 

This game is a bit of a rule breaker for me. I don‚Äôt like betting against home dogs. Especially in less than a TD spread but this one is the exception to the rule. 

The reason I‚Äôm breaking my rule is I think a run game travels, and boy can JVST run. They are third in the country in rush yards per game at 277. MTSU allows on average 142 a game putting them at 67th defensively. 

MTSU is also not a very good team offensively. They rank 125th in points scored per game, 60th in passing and 134th in rushing yards per game. 

Added bonus, JVST is coming off a bye week so they should be fresh and fired up. 

Sagarin has JVST at 118 and MTSU at 171. 
JVST 4-3 MTSU 1-6

Not a transitive property of football believer but worth noting, 
MTSU lost to Delaware last week by 3
JVST beat them by 13 2 weeks ago. 

Tailer Beware: JVST is 1-5 ATS last 6. 

35-24 JVST</td></tr>

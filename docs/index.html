**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: BTTS and Over 2.5 Goals @ 1.83**

**League - Premier League**

**Game: Manchester United VS Newcastle**

**Time: 3:00 PM EST**

**---**

**It looks like two other people have already had Cunha SOT, so I&#x27;m going with the next best option here.**

**You&#x27;ve got 2 teams that both have great attacking talent, but defensively, there are more than just issues**

\---

**BTTS Over 2.5 Goals stats:**

Manchester United have had BTTS hit for 5 games straight and BTTS/Over 2.5 has hit in 4 of their last 5 games

Manchester United have hit this line in 9 out of their last 10 games (90%).

\-

Newcastle United have had this line hit for 2 games straight

NUFC have hit in 9 out of their last 10 games as well (90%).

\--

**Last 5 games:**

**Manchester United: 2-1, 4-4, 1-4, 1-1, 1-2 (5/5)**

**Newcastle United: 2-1, 1-0, 2-2, 2-1, 2-2 (4/5)**

\---

**As I love to say, expecting an end-to-end game with 2 good attacking sides that struggle to keep a defensive structure out of possession.**

<tr><td class='post'>POTD record 87-5-65 (W-P-L)

Last pick: Vitality to win against Faze -1.5 maps handicap, 2u @ -118 ✅

**EPL: Chelsea vs Aston Villa BTTS, 2u @ -143**

This EPL clash of 3rd vs 4th place is a crucial fixture in the race for the top four. Aston Villa have been in scintillating form with a record 10 wins in a row in all competitions. They are traveling to Stamford Bridge the home of the Blues in what should be a tense and closely fought contest. Chelsea have scored in every home game this season bar the opening fixture whilst Aston Villa have been scoring consistently in their win streak which includes a 2-1 win over league leaders Arsenal (just four matches back). What makes this bet more compelling is the defensive form of both teams - Aston Villa have conceded in each of their last five games whilst Chelsea have conceded in three of their last five and in their last fixture drew 2-2 with Newcastle. The oddsmakers favor Chelsea here but Aston Villa are very live for the upset. Official prediction 2-1 Chelsea but it’s going to be tight- taking both teams to score seems like the best bet. Please bet responsibly.

<tr><td class='post'>**POTD Record:** 5-14-3 *Our journey in Vietnam ends in disappointment as my losing streak is extended to five, and I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m winless in well over 10 picks by now. If you&#x27;ve been diligently fading me, congrats, you&#x27;re probably a millionaire now. Guess I should&#x27;ve paid more attention to the H2H in that last game, but I think the Christmas miracle just wasn&#x27;t meant to be. Inversely, I&#x27;m pretty sure that had I bet on under 8.5 goals, they would&#x27;ve found a way to score 9, bonus points if half of them would&#x27;ve come past the 80th minute. Anyway, moving on to the competition that I still haven&#x27;t managed to tame (the AFCON), but I&#x27;m determined to change that with my next, well-researched <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. Let&#x27;s get it done*

**Last Five:** ❌❌❌❌❌

**Event:** AFCON, Angola v Zimbabwe, 7:30 am EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Zimbabwe Win or Draw + Under 3.5 goals +130, 4 units

**Write Up:** Despite both Angola and Zimbabwe losing their opening AFCON group stage fixtures - Angola narrowly went down 2-1 to South Africa while Zimbabwe were dramatically beaten 2-1 by paper favorites Egypt - there are solid enough reasons to back **Zimbabwe to avoid defeat <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>**. Angola’s AFCON history shows they’ve **only won one of their 10 opening games** at the tournament and have often dropped points in their second fixture after an initial loss, with draws in 1996 and 2006 following opening defeats. Meanwhile, **Zimbabwe have historically absolutely held their own against Angola**, and the overall **H2H is well balanced,** with both teams winning **eight times apiece and registering three draws** across their numerous encounters.

Zimbabwe’s squad is certainly not noticeably weaker than that of Angola, and it carries momentum from the recent goalscoring form, including **Prince Dube**, who scored a silky goal against Egypt, and they’ve shown they can score in successive matches. Angola are missing striker **Zini** through injury, which could blunt their attack and give Zimbabwe a tactical edge. Add to that Angola’s inconsistent form and Zimbabwe’s resilience in tight games, and a **Zimbabwe win or draw** looks like a sensible, value-backed prediction for this crucial AFCON group game. There&#x27;s also the possibility of neither team wanting to risk it ahead of the important Egypt - South Africa clash, thus making the draw even more likely (works for us). I&#x27;m certainly loving this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> and **pairing it with an Under 3.5 match goals** leg (I&#x27;m very positive this will be a **low scoring affair,** *personally feeling a 1-1 or a 2-1 Zimbabwe masterclass).* They&#x27;ve **nearly stunned Egypt,** so why can&#x27;t they take it a step further? Exactly, there&#x27;s no reason they can&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve spent hours researching the underlying data behind this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, so I&#x27;m feeling very confident that it&#x27;s gonna hit and finally release me out of the shackles of the horror run that I&#x27;m having atm - staking 4 units on this. Covering two outcomes and sprinkling an Under feels like great value for these odds, and the more I look at it, the better I feel about this. I don&#x27;t mind the BTTS Yes <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> either, but I&#x27;ve gone with the outlined <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> in the end. BOL whether you tail or fade, let&#x27;s have some fun and hopefully make some money together ☘️</td></tr>

Writeup: <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s picks are built from my ai model on the reccomendstion of Ipswich to win paired with a conservative goals angle, based on their stronger attacking metrics and ability to control matches against similar opposition. The data shows Ipswich creating higher-quality chances while the game profile still supports goals without needing a high-scoring shootout. This combination targets value while keeping risk controlled, rather than forcing aggressive lines.

**Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Bryan Mbuemo Over 1 SOT (+131) 🅿️

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s Event:** English Premier League (Soccer) | Manchewter United vs Newcastle (12:00PM PST)

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Mattheus Cunha 2+ SOT (+180) 1 unit to win 1.8 units

**Write Up:** Happy Boxing Day! Oddly enough there&#x27;s only one match <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, but it&#x27;s bound to be an entertaining one as 7th place Man United hosting 11th place Newcastle. This is an important match as both teams are vying for spots in European football next season. 

Manchester United has been a mixed bag this year. They score a lot of goals and concede a lot of goals, in fact they have the highest # of total goals per match in the EPL. They are currently missing a ton of players, including their leading Goalscorer and leader of assist with Mbuemo,  Bruno Fernandes, and Amad all out due to AFCON/injury. They&#x27;re going to be looking for creativity and Cunha looks tocbe the guy to try to fill those shoes. 

Cunha has been on a year lately, after some injuryy struggles early in the season. In his last 3 games, he has really turned it on. In these last 3 matches, he has averaged 7.3 shots/game, 2.7 SOTs per game, and scored 2 goals. With Bruno now out, I see him getting even more of the ball and taking more shots. The books currently have his as Man U&#x27;s most probable Goalscorer, most probable shot taker, but behind Sesko and Zirkee in probable SOTs. I think this line is mispriced based on these trends, but we will certainly take it. 

Newcastle is a decent team defensively, but play much better at home than on the road. They have not had a lot of tough road tests this season, but notably they conceded 7 SOTs on 15 shots away at Brentford, 9 SOTs on 15 shots away at West Ham (who only had 38% possession). Predicting a lot of shots and goals here - love this line in this spot. 

BOL and hope you all had a great Christmas!</td></tr>

Match : Angola Vs Zimbabwe


<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Angola ML + Under 3.5 Goals @2.26 Odds ( 1xBet ) 2unit to win 2.52u


Write Up: 


I’m confident on Angola win + under 3.5 goals. Angola are clearly the better side and should control this game from start to finish. They’re more organized, better in midfield, and don’t need chaos to win.


Zimbabwe will sit back and defend deep, but they don’t have enough quality going forward to really threaten for 90 minutes. Angola aren’t a high-tempo, high-scoring team anyway they’re happy to score, manage the game, and close it out.</td></tr>

CFB🏈 New Mexico vs Minnesota Commanders, 4:30 pm ET 12/26/25

Record: 9-10
Net Units: -3.96 Units

Explanation: I think New Mexico can beat Minnesota tomorrow because New Mexico should be able to control most of  the game. They run a balanced offense and their run defense is much improved over the season, only allowing 113.4 rushing yards per game, and that’s good in this matchup since Minnesota’s run game is struggling barely topping 100 rushing yards per game. 

New Mexico is hot on 6 game winning streak and set a school record of 484.5 total yards per game. I foresee and conclude too many things that can go right for New Mexico , and too many things that can go wrong for Minnesota.</td></tr>

International Hockey U20 - World Junior Championship

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: USA vs. Germany | USA -5.5 (-110)

Time: 6:00pm EST

What’s going on everyone, I&#x27;m back again for my favorite week and a half of the year. If anybody&#x27;s been around, we’ve been on a roll the past few years and looking to continue with more of the same. It’s a pretty even split this year as far as the playing field goes. A clear top 5, a Slovakia team that can be a little scrappy and the last 4 fighting to stay out of relegation.

With that being said, we’re going to start the slate off with the US covering against the Germans. The Americans have the Germans number in this tournament, routinely dominating them year in and year out. The US didn’t bring a gold favorite to the tournament like last year, but they should still comfortably fight for a medal. The Germans on the other hand will be fighting to stay in the top division for another year.

We only have a few pretournament games to go off of for both teams, but luckily for us they already played eachother 4 days ago, with the Americans winning by 8. Germany did start their backup in this game, but it wouldn&#x27;t have mattered much. USA also sat a few of their returnees to get some looks at depth players before the final round of cuts. Expect a pretty big mismatch between a gold medal hopeful and a team trying to just stay afloat to start us off</td></tr>

MIDDLESBROUGH VS BLACKBURN

Date: 26 DECEMBER 2025 at 16:00

BET ON: Match odds- MIDDLESBROUGH

Odd: 1.79



\- Despite their slip-up at Bristol City, Middlesbrough remain the form side and a strong bet to win at Riverside. Under Kim Hellberg, Boro have climbed to second in the Championship thanks to consistent performances and an aggressive, possession-oriented tactical setup that sees them dominate games and control midfield play — a philosophy Hellberg has publicly praised for its intensity and control in recent press comments after big wins like the 4-1 rout of Hull. At home they are particularly dangerous, with seven wins in ten league matches this season and a habit of starting games strongly, making them favorites in front of their supporters. Injuries to Lenihan and Fry are a concern, but Boro’s defensive reinforcements and creative balance — including form attackers Strelec and Conway — mean they have more depth than struggling Blackburn. Conversely, Blackburn’s squad is stretched with key absences including potential issue with Gudjohnsen and other regulars, and coach Valérien Ismaël has recently admitted attitude issues in training, undermining consistency and preparation. With Boro’s clear motivation to consolidate an automatic promotion spot and Blackburn still fighting just to climb away from the bottom, the hosts have both the tactical edge and psychological incentive to take all three points.</td></tr>

Last pick:

Brighton Vs Sunderland 

Brighton win and under 4.5 goals (1.90) ✖️

A game which never looked like producing too many goals, Brighton did finish the game very strong and had Sunderland hanging on but couldn&#x27;t find a way to break them down as time ran out. Ending 0-0.


<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>:
 
Premier League 

Manchester United Vs Newcastle 

Matheus Chuna 2 or more shots on target.

(2.10) 2.5 units 

Both teams come into this game with a good portion of missing players, United missing some key attackers, Newcastle missing a lot of key players in defense.

With so many players on international duty or out with injuries, Chuna should get the full 90 minutes here to find these shots on target. He&#x27;s been in good form as of late coming back from an injury, 2 goals and an assist in his last 3 games.

Shot wise his breakdown is as followed for the past few games.

Aston villa away: **6 shots 3 on target**

Bournemouth at home: **8 shots 3 on target**

Wolves away **8 shots 2 on target**

Newcastle are also a team that really struggles to perform well away from home , they average about 7 shots on target conceded away from home if you take out the derby game against Sunderland last away game, which was a hard watch, constant fouls as it was a fierce rivalry match,  which meant there was very few chances for either side.

Chuna is a very direct player, great at picking up the ball from deep and going on a run and getting shots away, he should again get plenty of shooting opportunities to cover this line again like he has been for the past few weeks and for the price were getting it&#x27;s too good for me to pass up a bet on this.

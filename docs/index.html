<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **1st Half Total Points Over  87.5**  (-108 FanDuel)

Shorter write-up <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.

Once again Alabama is expected to be involved in an extremely high scoring game. Over/Under is set at 181 right now. Both have been very high scoring and fast paced to start the season.

Illinois and Bama both rank at 2 and 12 in the country in 1st half scoring. At 51.3 and 47.3 avg points in the 1st half respectively.
This game will be no exception.

Illinois on the other hand should be getting good looks and plenty driving lanes to the basket against a not so good Alabama D that will be running fast on their heels. Could easily see a 52-50 first half.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>PICK</mark>: NCAAB 7pm CST USF Bulls + 5.5 @ OK ST


Writeup: Don’t have tons of time for the write up. USF currently ranks 71 in Kenpom rankings, OKST ranks 55th

USF is averaging 101.3 ppg and haven’t REALLY been tested outside of a 4pt loss to a solid George Washington team

OKST is averaging 90.3 ppg and have had a similar schedule, playing nobodies, but achieving a pretty impressive underdog win against a TAMU team that played incredibly sloppy. 

I think the difference maker here is USFs ability to limit opponents from beyond the arc, limiting opponents to 26% from long range. OKST is absolutely abysmal from deep at a measly 26% accuracy rate from the 3pt line. 

Lastly, USF is averaging 1.3pts per 100 possessions more than OKST and limiting opponents to shooting 40% from the field while shooting 47.9% from the field

I honestly like them to win outright potentially but I will happily take the points in what I would consider a pretty even matchup, if not better

**Writeup:** Grêmio won every single home game against Vasco since 2012. Grêmio needs to win to avoid relegation for good, considering this is probably their easiest game until the end of the season. Vasco is in very bad shape, losing the last three games, one of them to 18th place Juventude at home. Vasco&#x27;s coach, Diniz, is a very peculiar manager: it&#x27;s well known in Brazil that when he starts losing, he doesn&#x27;t stop until he&#x27;s sacked. Grêmio&#x27;s team is not good at all, but is organized enough to take advantage of the spaces that Diniz&#x27;s teams always leave.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Miami Heat +2.5 &amp; Central Michigan ML

Bet 1 unit to win .7 units

Why: Central Michigan plays at a higher level than Kent state in most areas - better run game, better defense, better clock management. Central Michigan is also the more physical team between the two. Kent state is a threat if their pass game is on point, but I think CMU will still have the slightly better offense. 

Miami plays Golden State tonight. Golden state just lost to the magic, and curry may have tweaked his ankle (not sure if he&#x27;s playing tonight). in that game, curry and butler both put up more than 30 points and they still lost. What this tells me is that this might be a high scoring affair but the heat should still pull away with the win. I&#x27;m teasing it 2.5 points just to be safe.

***Reason:*** Mathurin is playing in his second game back from injury, and he scored 25pts in 25 mins in Mondays game. The reason I&#x27;m leaning towards Mathurn is because LaMelo has only scored more than 20pt in 3 games this year. (Yeah I get he&#x27;s been hurt some games) Ball is averaging nearly 10 assists a game and seems like he&#x27;s looking to pass first before chucking up shots like he&#x27;s known to do. Also, Mathurn is on a Pacers team who is about to be in tank mode. Coming off an injury he&#x27;s just wanting to score and I&#x27;m expecting him to have around 20 shot attempts tonight and have about 15 free throw attempts. GL!</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'><mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: NHL 7:30pm ET - Islanders at Devils Under 6.5 (-115), 2u.



My numbers have this closer to 6.1 total goals (58% hit rate on full-game unders this season). Isles are a low-event team at 5v5 and sit near the bottom in rush chances; Devils’ 5v5 shooting cooled the last week and their PP hasn’t been drawing as many opportunities on the road. Both clubs suppress slot shots well, which trims high-danger looks. I’m fine down to -125, would pass if it hits -130 or if the total drops to 6 flat. If both starters go as projected, I like it a bit more; if there’s surprise backup news, I’d cut to 1u. I line shop on Pinnacle and DraftKings; for quick crypto live totals during intermission, Betpanda is handy.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Anaheim Ducks 3-Way ML @ 2.10 (1u)

**Last Pick:** Alabama -6 @ 1.90 ❌

Taken a few days off after this one, to see Bama not cover the spread was one thing but to lose outright given the unreal home record and winning run they were on makes it even worse. The turnovers and scores from them were just killer, always gonna be hard to win and cover when you&#x27;re giving up that many points to the opposition defence.

**Write Up:**  
Going to the NHL here and backing Anaheim - they’re riding a hot streak at home (they’ve won all five of their most recent home games), and that could be huge in this matchup. Their forward group is creating chances, especially with Leo Carlsson and Cutter Gauthier leading the way offensively. Adding to the fact that the Ducks have covered the line in 14 out of their last 15 home games against Atlantic Division teams. 

Meanwhile, Boston don’t look completely locked-in on the road. Their performances away from home, especially in night games and against teams like Anaheim, have been hit or miss. The Bruins don’t have a great record in spots like this, and they’ve struggled to deliver consistent puck-line cover in past, similar matchups.

Given Anaheim’s home momentum and offensive firepower - plus Boston’s shaky road tendencies - I like the Ducks to take this one in regulation.</td></tr>

*Write up: Yes, both of these teams can light it up, but Illinois likes to control the pace. Illinois is efficient and while Alabama&#x27;s defense isn&#x27;t the greatest, I do not think it&#x27;s THAT bad.* 

* *I think Bama will be able to limit and control the board, limiting Illinois ability to get offensive rebounds*
*  *Illinois will have to play their game to win, and they have less tempo than Bama, and need to be able to slow the pace if they want to have a chance against this fast, athletic Bama side*
* *They both have a lower 3pt volume/percentage on the year - Bama is avg 6.5 which is is north of 250th in the NCAA and Illinois is north of 100 averaging 8.8*
* *When you calculate the total points scored for both teams this year, it comes out to a whopping 175.8 PPG*
* *This game should be lower pace to keep it close for Illinois* 
* *Although the total o/u is high for a reason, 182.5 is a lot of points and I can see a slower paced, more controlled game for both sides tonight* 



*My prediction is the game ends between 175 - 180 points, making this a close play. Let&#x27;s hope Illinois can control the pace, slow Alabama down a bit, and cash the under.*

1U Mitchell Robinson O7.5 rebounds @ $1.74, Sportsbet (Aus) 

Write-Up: Mavericks concede the most rebounds to opposition in the league (60 per game). No AD still, they’ve got no one to go with Robinson. Robinson has hit this in his last 5 and 6/7 for the year (albeit twice he landed on 8). 

Blow-out risk yes but Robinson is averaging just 16.6 minutes a game this year anyway. If anything he might get 18-19 if it’s a blow-out. He does rely heavily on offensive rebounds (18 in his last 3 games) so if the Knicks are shooting hot that would be worst case scenario for me, but I’m hoping he can get pad 3-4 defensive ones and then doesn’t need to do all the work on the offensive end.</td></tr>

For the followers of this, you would understand how painful this bet was. He had hit 208 yards with minutes to go in the 3rd quarter. He then cleared the bet in the 3rd quarter but there was a flag. 

He was sacked and fumbled multiple times through the game, threw 2 intercepts including a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> 6, and fumbled for an 85 yard defensive TD.

He had multiple chances to hit the line, but failed and then he copped 1 final sack in their own red zone, and was hooked, leaving us agonisingly close. Only some relief in the fact that some may have got the bet up due to a drift in the line late.

**Todays <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** NCAAF - Miami OH v Buffalo - *Ta-Quan Roberson o199.5 Passing -* $1.95 - 2.0 Units 

Yep - we’re going again   
  
Roberson would have cleared this line so easy if his O line didn’t shit the bed last week, but to be fair the Chips QB rush was just too much. He will be looking to bounce back after a very polarising performance to the rest of the season. I can’t see the same mistakes happening as frequently.

Miami’s pass defence is only average ranking 53rd for yardage allowed. They have excelled more with their rush defence so I see TR giving himself plenty of attempts to redeem himself.

There is obviously the chance that they revert to more of a running game, but I personally believe they stick to what’s brought them some success this year and that is with Roberson’s arm. 

I like the passing market here because of the game scenarios. If Buffalo manage to get on a roll and lead, it’s sure to be through their QB. If Miami maintain an expected lead as favourites then Buffalo may be forced to pass.

Barely any football <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, but I&#x27;ve found a decent odd here in the Women&#x27;s CL. OL Lyoness are a powerhouse in Women&#x27;s football. They&#x27;re sitting in second without dropping any points so far, 9 out of 9. They haven&#x27;t dropped any points dometically o far this season either. They&#x27;ve already faced good teams like Wolfsburg and Arsenal, whereas Juventus gained 6 points from wins against Atletico Madrid and Benfica, teams that are going to end up near the bottom of the league I reckon.

OL Lyoness&#x27;s games have featured over 2,5 goals in 8/10 matches this season so far!  
Juventus has had games domestically ending under 2,5 goals, but all CL matches (where they face better teams) the over 2,5 <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> has hit.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: KB Stars -4.5 Handicap @ 1.75

Shock at Blue Minx: Star guard Kianna Smith retired on October 30, 2025, after a knee injury and a failed citizenship application process. With Kianna Smith (who was named to the Season&#x27;s Best 5) healthy, the team&#x27;s offensive output was high; the team was the league&#x27;s leading scorer (64.6 points per game). His absence will significantly impact the team. Park Ji-su returns to KB Stars: Park Ji-su, the team&#x27;s superstar and arguably the league&#x27;s best player, returned to KB Stars after his stint in Türkiye (Galatasaray). With his return, KB Stars instantly rose from 4th place last season to the number one favorite for the championship. In preseason polls, 60% of players and 75% of the media projected KB Stars as champions. With Park Ji-su&#x27;s dominance from below the basket and Kang Yi-seul&#x27;s shooting prowess, they became the league&#x27;s most feared team. KB is the clear favorite due to Park Ji-su’s return, their dominance at the perimeter, KB’s wider wing rotation, and the Blue Minx’s lack of primary creators after Kianna Smith.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Cedevita to win by 17 or more, 1.84, 1u

Cedevita is doing great in Eurocup, 5-2, and they have also had some important wins in the ABA league. The latest was a 1-point win against a favored Crvena Zvezda, a big upset against the Euroleague top team (at the moment, at least). Some combo of a halftime spread and a game spread would not help here a lot; their stats show different starts, not always the strongest ones. A good example is Venezia 7 days ago, only a 5-point lead at half turned into a 28-point win. So I am gonna leave it with the full spread. Their team is well-balanced, a mix of home players and foreigners. Jaka Blazic and Aleksej Nikolic, for example, played for Slovenia in the Eurobasket this summer.

Not gonna spend much time on Hamburg, they simply don&#x27;t have the quality for any results this season, the budget and spending are probably cut significantly. If the way to run the club is to spend less and not play in the BBL next season, they are on the right track. 0-7 in Eurocup, 0-6 in the league.

Still, since the spread is significant, back to the standard 1 unit.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Bennedict Mathurin OVER 19.5 Points (-120 HR)

Time &amp; TV: Charlotte Hornets at Indiana Pacers

Mathrurin has taken on this lead role very well since Halliburton’s injury, playing the SG position and since then he’s been dominating, clearing this line in all 3 games he’s played in this season averaging 29 PPG.

Mathurin has seen a huge increase in usage this season compared to last, he’s averaging 32 minutes per game this season on 15.7 FGA per game compared to last season where he saw just 19.7 minutes per game on just 7.9 FGA per game.

Mathurin has always been a dawg, he just hasn’t gotten the minutes and now that he is he’s been dominating and he will continue to do so as he wants to prove himself as a long term starter for the Pacers and continue to get the minutes he is now when the Pacers are fully healthy.

Maturin gets a good matchup in this game against the Hornets who rank 19th versus PNR ball handler where Mathurin gets 37% of his points from, Mathurin gets another 43% of his points come from beyond the arch an area the Hornets allow the 8th most points against, he gets another 39% from the RA and the Hornets allow the 9th most points in the RA.

This game is expected to stay close favoring the Hornets by just 1 so I expect full minutes out of Mathurin in this game which should lead to great usage once again.

Spida is averaging 6.4 asts dating back from last 
 season whenever Garland is not playing. (remains out for this match) 

Mitchell’s offensive usage and mins should uptick here and with the Cavs running a tight rotation in a likely competitive game like this (given the 1.5 pt spread), we’re likely to see Mitchell run a full shift (35+ mins of production.)

Rockets defense prioritizes interior defense but often leaves perimeter rotations and weakside coverage less effective. This creates more driving lanes and kick out opportunities for Mitchell to rack up assists, especially on picknroll possessions.

This matchup provides a perfect strom feel for Spida to hit the over here and for the + money value it&#x27;s a no brainer opportunity.

Kon is still logging 35-40 minutes a game. Beautiful.

He has not hesitated in going for boards and Hornets&#x27; strong rebounding rankings this year are in large part because of him.

Has cashed in L7/9:  
\- Missing once against the Thunder in a 27 minute showing  
\- And once against the Bucks.  
\- But has gotten 10+ rebounds 4 of those 7 cashes

Pacers are 29th in allowing Rebounds to SGs and overall middle of the pack in rebounding rankings.

Should be a fast paced game, with the over/under at 235.5, with hopefully many missed shots.

**Write-up:** I know this is not within the -200 to +200 range allowed for the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> but I’d appreciate a lil +5 -5 area of grace for my first <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> and the odds on this are amazing. 

I get these odds on Bovada and it is Paris FC (W) over 0.5 goals at -525 parlayed with VFL Wolfsburg (W) over 0.5 goals at -400 for a parlay at -205 odds. 

Both teams are favored to win the match and are hosts for the matches. This is Champions League football so I believe the home sides will have an edge in these games. Wolfsburg have scored in all 3 previous Champions League matches averaging 2.3 goals per match. The one match at home, they scored 4 goals. Paris have scored in 2 out of 3 Champions League matches and were only held scoreless in an away game at Chelsea who have only conceded 1 goal in the Champions League this year.

If you parlay this on any other sportsbook, I almost guarantee the odds are worse than -205. Going forward, I will do picks within the -200 to +200 range, I just thought these odds I found were too good not to share.

BOL and God bless

Awful first half from Fox unfortunately sold us big time, amazing second half and gave us life but ultimately PA wasn’t the move and points cashes instead. Hope some of yall got that instead, 4-0 run over. We move

Mathurin looked really sharp his first game back against the Pistons dropping 25 points with 16 FGA and 11 FTA in 25 minutes in a blowout loss. Minutes will be monitored like last game but With Nesmith and Hali out he should get close to 30+ minutes here if the game stays competitive which the spread suggests it will. Mathurin is well needed for this short handed Pacers team and his point production aswell.

Over in 3/3 games this season with 36, 26 and 25 points avg 29 points per game and has gone over this line in 8/L10 games without Haliburton. His ability to get to the line is always a huge upside when betting his points with the aggression he brings in offense, 13 and 14 FTA in his last two games. 

Over the L10 games Hornets has allowed 5th most above the break threes and 6th most points in the restricted area which is Matburins two main scoring areas (72% of his points).</td></tr>

[Under write up](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/s/P6MIMVweHv)

Let me just go ahead and say that Michigan state played WELL ABOVE their average shooting splits and this game still went under. That team is dangerous if they can continue to shoot like that because that defense is lockdown.  

Event: Arizona @ UConn (6pm central)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: UConn -5 (-120) (1U)

-everything is bet to win unit amount-

Write up: 

Arizona may have opened the season with wins over Florida and UCLA, but both victories came with major red flags. Against Florida, the Wildcats trailed by double digits before clawing back, and they needed another 10+ point comeback to escape UCLA. I also don’t believe Florida and ucla are really that good (at least compared to UConn) if you remember we smashed Arizona +4.5 against florida for 2 units when they took care of business! But that kind of pattern is dangerous against a disciplined UConn team that thrives on building early leads and suffocating opponents with relentless defense. Yes, BYU nearly erased a 20-point deficit against UConn, but that was on a neutral court, and Danny Hurley is not the type of coach to let his team slip like that twice—especially not at home in Storrs. Expect a sharper, more locked-in Huskies squad that won’t allow Arizona the same margin for error.

Travel fatigue is another factor working against Arizona. They’ve already played in Las Vegas and Los Angeles, and now they fly across the country to face UConn in Storrs—a team that has barely left Connecticut this season. The Huskies are comfortable at home, and the environment will be electric with a white-out crowd at Gampel Pavilion and $2 millers! Place is going to be JUMPING. Arizona’s freshman star Koa Peat has been impressive, averaging over 16 points per game, but asking a freshman to lead the charge in such a hostile setting is a tall order.

Statistically, UConn holds clear advantages. The Huskies rank 7th nationally in effective field goal percentage (63.4%), compared to Arizona’s 77th (55%). UConn also forces turnovers at a high clip, ranking 35th in steals per game (~10), while Arizona is sloppy with the ball, averaging nearly 14 turnovers per game (242nd nationally). That’s a recipe for disaster against a veteran Huskies squad that converts mistakes into points. Offensively, UConn boasts balance and depth, with four of five starters averaging double figures, led by Tarris Reed Jr. (20 PPG, 9.3 RPG) and Alex Karaban (18.3 PPG). Arizona, by contrast, has just two starters averaging over double-digit numbers, one being Peat, and lacks the same veteran firepower.

Size won’t save Arizona either. While they’ve leaned on their frontcourt to compete, UConn counters with elite length of their own—starters at 6’8, 6’7, and 6’11, two of whom are putting up 15 and 20 points per game. Beyond that, UConn ranks 15th nationally in offensive efficiency (133.6 ORtg) and 19th in defensive efficiency (78.8 DRtg), showing dominance on both ends of the floor. They’re also averaging 92.7 points per game (Top 60 nationally) while holding opponents to just 54.7 points per game (Top 15 nationally). That combination of high-powered offense and suffocating defense is exactly what separates them from Arizona, who has been winning more on raw athleticism than disciplined execution.

Combine UConn’s home-court dominance (14-2 at home last season), their ability to jump out early (up nearly 20 on BYU at one point), and their superior efficiency metrics, and the matchup tilts heavily toward the Huskies. If Arizona falls behind again, this time they won’t have the luxury of a soft opponent to bail them out.

Bottom line: UConn’s efficiency, depth, defensive pressure, and home-court advantage make them the superior side. Arizona’s reliance on comebacks early in the year and a freshman leader is a dangerous formula against a veteran, battle-tested Huskies team. Laying the -5 is the smart play. Let’s go for 5 in a row fellas! And as always, cheers 🍻

Last Pick: Hernan Casanova ML vs Alex Hernández (-138, 1 unit): Win

Tennis | Guayaquil Challenger | 12:00 PM EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Juan Pablo Varillas vs Murkel Dellien | **Varillas ML at -147 (DK). 1 unit.**

Write-up: In terms of CLV, that was one of my best picks ever, as Casanova closed at around -330. He did end up dropping the second set after dominating the first, but came back strong in the third. 

Juan Pablo Varillas is a talented Pervian clay-courter who has in recent years suffered from injuries and inconsistent form. That trend has continued this season, as a solid start to the year that saw him win a pretty stacked Buenos Aires Challenger was disrupted by a three-month injury break from May to September. However, Varillas seems to be rounding into form again, with some nice wins over guys like Guillen Meza and Gomez and no terrible losses. The market has been giving him a decent amount of respect lately, as he was only priced at +229 against a pretty strong clay-courter in Roman Burruchaga. 

Murkel Dellien, meanwhile, is another player with years of experience on this surface and a game that suits it quite well. However, he&#x27;s been playing practically nonstop this year, and I feel that it&#x27;s started to affect his results. Sure, he threw in a splashy upset over Mariano Navone earlier this month, but he was priced at nearly +475 in that match, and Navone wasn&#x27;t a huge favorite over Burruchaga in a recent match (around -227, and lost in straight sets). Other than that one win, Dellien&#x27;s form has been pretty dismal, with losses to mid-tier ITF guys like Cundom and Gimenez as well as a recent drubbing at the hands of Guido Ivan Justo (6.35 performance rating). 

While the odds analysis showed a small edge for Varillas, it didn&#x27;t totally convince me that there was enough value to post this. However, watching both players&#x27; first-round matches here in full pushed this play over the edge. Varillas faced Juan Carlos Aguilar, who lacks a bit in size and power but makes up for it with strong net skills and touch. I felt that there was a clear gap in quality, as Varillas&#x27;s heavy forehand and flat, powerful backhand gave him the edge in most rallies. There were points in the match were he was missing first serves or maybe taking a few too many risks, but he never really let it affect his strategy or looked vulnerable. 

Meanwhile, Dellien won his match by a lopsided 6-1, 6-1 scoreline, but I don&#x27;t feel that that scoreline tells the full story of his match. His opponent, American Ryan Dickerson, didn&#x27;t seem especially comfortable in these conditions and had trouble working around a weak backhand wing. However, there were still moments where Dickerson looked to be troubling Murkel with his serve and forehand, and he missed several opportunities to make the match much more competitive. Dellien hits with big windups and lots of margin, and his forehand grip seems to be pretty close to a full western. What that means in practice is that he can struggle against someone like Varillas, who is going to be ripping the ball and forcing you to find a way out of defensive positions. 

In terms of the head-to-head, Dellien holds a 1-0 lead, having defeated Varillas in straight sets last year. However, I&#x27;ve found some recent success going against the head-to-head; the match was also close in terms of points, and Varillas was a -250 favorite. Varillas certainly comes into this match with less form and rhythm than last year, but so does Dellien. This isn&#x27;t a smash spot, but I think Varillas should be a bigger favorite than the 59.51% implied here.

NCAAB // Alabama Crimson Tide @ Illinois Fighting Illini

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Illinois -3.5 (-106 FD) 1u**

Heading to the house that Michael Jordan built for a &quot;neutral site game&quot; between two ranked teams. Alabama comes in ranked #11 at 2-1 and Illinois is ranked #8 sitting at 4-0. This game figures to be a high scoring affair with two of the nation&#x27;s best offenses. One key difference in this game however is Illinois actually plays strong defense as well, limiting their opponents to an average of just 66.8ppg while Alabama prefers the race to 100 approach allowing 81.7ppg.

Both have had early challenges so far this year with Alabama splitting their big games against St. Johns and Purdue and Illinois winning their game against Texas Tech.

The most troubling thing about Alabama&#x27;s loss to Purdue was the rebounding discrepancy. They got absolutely embarrassed on the glass by the Boilermakers to the tune of 28-52, yikes. Ok, well that could be expected as Purdue sits at a respectable #54 in the country with a rebounding margin of +10.2. Uh oh....Illinois is ranked #2 in the country in rebounding margin at a gaudy +21.8.

Illinois +21.8 rebounding margin, Alabama rebounding margin -1. This is going to be a problem for the Crimson Tide.

Now, if you are unfamiliar with Nate Oats&#x27;s team they will be shooting the 3, like a lot. They are #7 in the country in three-point attempts at 35 a game. Throw this whole write up in the trash if they catch fire from 3, there isn&#x27;t a team in the country that wouldn&#x27;t get blown out if that is the case. So, they are shooting from range it must be their specialty, right? Let&#x27;s see where they sit...scrolling down a long ways....there&#x27;s two other Alabama teams, Alabama A&amp;M and South Alabama....oh there&#x27;s the Crimson Tide down at #175 in the country, 33.33%. If they throw up 35 3s an only make 12 of them against Illinois, they are in for a rough evening. Maybe Illinois isn&#x27;t so hot at defending the three...uh oh, Illinois is tops in the Big Ten allowing a measly 25.8%. Illinois likes to shoot the three ball as well and they will be putting their fair share up from range, Alabama ranks #250 at defending the three.

So, we have a team that is below average at rebounding against one the best rebounding teams in the country, a team that is going to shoot a ton of threes, hasn&#x27;t really been making a bunch of them, against a great three-point defensive team. These seem like two huge problems for Alabama. Add on top of this that Illinois is an elite scoring team so far at 97.8ppg and I see them covering the -3.5 spread fairly easily. Again, this all goes out the window if Alabama shoots the lights out of the United Center, but they haven&#x27;t proven the ability to do that yet this year with their best outing being 37% in their loss to Purdue.

Illinois #6 in KenPom

Alabama #20 in KenPom

Illinois 3-1 ATS (3-1 at home) with a margin of +8.1 ppg.

Alabama 1-2 ATS (1-0 on the road) with a margin of -8.3 ppg.

Either way this is must watch TV and should be one of the most entertaining games of the season. Go Illini! (Threw up in my mouth a little bit as an Iowa fan...)</td></tr>

I’m higher on the Raptors than most people and will be happy to bet on them against the 6ers who will be missing Embiid and PG13, as well as Oubre and Bona. For Philly, once again it will be the Maxey show with VJ as an inconsistent secondary. This Raptors team has its best team available, and they continue to play well together, with all starters contributing each game. They are 7-2 ATS ad 8-1 SU in the L9 games. The 6ers have lost 4 ATS in a row. Add in that the Raptors have much better depth and rotations, and I’ll happily bet on the underdog.

Event: NBA | Hornets @ Pacers


<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:  Miles Bridges Over 21.5P @1.79 3u to win 2.3u


Write Up:  
 


Bridges has pretty much been the Hornets’ go-to guy whenever they need someone to actually get a bucket. With all the injuries and the up-and-down play from the rest of the roster, he usually ends up with a solid chunk of the offense, and that usage jumps even more when Tre Mann or Brandon Miller aren’t fully out there. He’s the one they trust late in the shot clock or when they need someone to create something on their own.


The matchup helps a ton too. Indiana’s defense just isn’t the same without Hali and the other guys they’re missing. They don’t really have that big, physical wing who can stay in front of Bridges, so forwards like him usually get good looks specially in the mid-range .


And the nice part is Bridges isn’t one-dimensional. He gets points in transition, he can pull up in the mid-range, and he’ll hit spot-ups or pops from 3s. Because he scores in so many different ways, he doesn’t need a perfect shooting night to get past 21.5.


In games like this, he usually ends up taking around 15–20 FTs, and if that happens again, he’s basically sitting right in the 22+ range without needing anything crazy. It’s just a good spot for him.

__Event:__ NCAAB: Alabama vs Illinois 9pm EST

__POTD:__ Illinois -3.5 (-110), 2.2u to win 2u

__Write Up:__ 1st basketball writeup of the year for one of the biggest games of the early season. Was much easier watching film on these teams opposed to football as they’ve only played 7 games combined. This game is taking place in Chicago, Illinois at the United Center, home of the Bulls &amp; Blackhawks. This is a “neutral site” game but it takes place just 2 hours north of the University of Illinois, the arena will be packed with Illinois fans. #8 Illinois is coming into the game undefeated at 4-0, with a huge 81-77 win vs #11 Texas Tech (rank last week), an elite team that KenPom has ranked #15. They’ll be facing #11 Alabama who are 2-1, with one of the toughest non conference schedules in the nation. They scheduled 4 games in a row vs teams in the top 15: #14 St Johns, #1 Purdue, #8 Illinois, &amp; #13 Gonzaga. Then in a few weeks they play #4 Arizona. They beat #14 St Johns on the road 10 days ago 103-96, but lost their last game at home vs #1 Purdue 87-80. There was one huge reason they lost this game &amp; Bama’s coach roasted them for it.

In the postgame interview after last week’s loss to Purdue, Alabama coach Nate Oats said “They out rebounded us by 24, that’s embarrassing… We&#x27;ve got issues on the glass. We knew it in our exhibition games. We knew it in our intrasquad scrimmages. We knew it at St. John&#x27;s. They’re 5’10 PG had 7 rebounds &amp; our starting frontcourt had 6 combined.” Bama has a horrible rebounding problem &amp; it won’t get easier this week vs a large athletic Illinois team. Illinois coach Brad Underwood preaches crashing the boards to his team as evident in year’s past. __In 2023 Illinois ranked 5th in reb’s in the NCAA (40.9). Last year Illinois ranked #1 in the nation in reb’s (42.6). Through 4 games, Illinois is currently ranked 3rd in the nation in reb’s with 48.8 rpg.__ Bama was 2nd in reb’s last year, with a great rebounding trio of Grant Nelson, Clifford Omoruyi, &amp; Mouhamed Dioubate who combined for an avg of 20 of Bama’s 43 rpg. All 3 are not on the team this year. Bama has a skinny, fast frontcourt this season. Coach Oats elected to go with this squad because of his offensive style. His strategy is to push run a fast paced, analytical offense that bombs 3’s &amp; gets in the paint, eliminating mid range jumpers. __Bama ranked #1 in Tempo last year &amp; sit at #4 through their first 3 games this season.__ They’ve led the country in scoring the last 2 season, 2 of the only 3 teams in NCAA history to avg 90+ ppg. Last week vs Purdue they put up 43 three’s, 15 shots in the paint, &amp; shot just 8 mid range jumpers. Bama wins games with their backcourt: Aden Holloway (21.0 ppg), LaBaron Philon (19.3 ppg, 6.0 apg), Latrell Wrightsell Jr. (11.5 ppg) &amp; Houston Mallette. The problem is Illinois is a huge versatile team. I’ll get into injuries in a bit, but besides PG Kylan Boswell (6’2), every player that played for Illinois last week was between 6’6 - 7’2. They’re long, lengthy, &amp; are elite at contesting 3’s.  __Illinois allows just a 25.8% 3 pt % (36th), giving up just 6.3 3s per game. Texas Tech is an elite 3 point shooting team &amp; shot just 27% (6-22). In their 3 previous games TT went 13-31, 12-28, &amp; 17-45 from 3, 42-104 total. That 40.3% 3 point percentage would’ve led the NCAA last year.__ If Bama can’t make 3’s it’s over, because they won’t be able to rebound with an extremely weak frontcourt. Especially with 6’11 freshman Collins Onyejiaka out with a medical condition, &amp; a rotation that deploys 3 freshmen forwards: Amari Allen, London Jemison, and Davion Hannah. __Illinois comes into this game ranked 2nd in the NCAA in rebound margin (+21.7 per game). They are led by 6’9 250 pound Freshman David Mirkovic from Montenegro who had 27 points &amp; 21 rebounds on Friday against Colgate. He became the 8th Big Ten player in the last 8 seasons to have a 20-20 game. 4 games into his college career he is averaging 19.5 ppg &amp; 12.5 rpg, with 3 double doubles.__ Illinois rebuilt their front court this offseason around returning Center Tomislav Ivisic. It started with his brother, Arkansas transfer, Zvonimir Ivisic (8.5 ppg &amp; 6.5 rpg), then with Mirkovic. The 7’2 Croation brothers are dominant in the post. Tomislav injured his knee last week &amp; has been out but may return this game. Even if he isn&#x27;t ready for this one, Illinois has plenty of lineup options to replace him.

Illinois is elite on offense as well, ranking #3 in the nation in KenPom’s offensive ratings. Coach Underwood runs a spread offense using spacing, motion, &amp; ball movement. They focus on a high low attack, dribble penetration, &amp; <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> &amp; rolls. They utilize the “Gortat screen”. I can’t add links due to Reddit rules, so __Google “LeBron &amp; JJ Reddick Gortat Screen”__ to learn how Marcin Gortat changed the game with his impossible to guard screens. A Gortat screen prevents drop coverage when guarding <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> &amp; rolls. After a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> &amp; roll, while the defender is guarding the ballhandler, the screener rolls back into his man in drop coverage &amp; seals him off which creates an open lane to the basket &amp; it’s completely legal. It’s the basketball version of the tush push. Purdue used this vs Bama &amp; dominated them. With the Ivisic twins it’s unstoppable for Illinois. Their offense pushes the pace, &amp; their ball movement creates open 3’s or wide open cutting bigs. This offense is elite as Brad Underwood is the best international recruiter in the NCAA. He’s has the entire United Nations on his team: 2 Croatians (Ivisic bros), 1 Serbian, 1 Puerto Rican, 1 Greek, &amp; 1 Montenegrin. Illinois has elite guard play as well. Starting PG Mihailo Petrovic has been out (hamstring), but Keaton Wagler has started in his place averaging 17.5 points with 8 FT’s per game. Senior G Kylan Boswell has been killing as well averaging 18.5 points &amp; 3.8 assists per game. Alabama has no defense whatsoever &amp; gives up a ton of points. __Last year Bama ranked 348th in points allowed (81.3) &amp; 350th the year before (81.2).__ Illinois also has a 6’7 wing Andrej Stojakovic, projected to go in the NBA 2026 draft &amp; is on the Naismith Player of the Year watchlist. He is an elite scorer &amp; is phenomenal on defense. In their game vs TT he locked up their 2nd leading scorer Christian Anderson, holding him to just 8 points (0-6 from 3). Anderson is a projected 1st round <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> who has a 38% 3 pt %. Their ability to contain Alabama’s guard heavy offense will be the deciding factor in this game. Illinois is long, athletic, plays great defense, rebounds, &amp; consistently creates open shots. This is a bad matchup for Bama &amp; Illinois will take advantage of their weaknesses.

I ran out of room but the Tide aint rolling Wednesday.

__Illinois -3.5__

Annoying one last time out with Romania winning 7-1 but Austria being held to a 1–1 draw in a game they dominated. Can’t win them all.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Todays pick</mark> is the definitely rogue to what people expect on this thread lol. Women’s cricket isn’t exactly top of the agenda for most people including me. 

First and foremost from the outside looking in this seems a weird <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> as Sydney thunder a 0-3 facing the Scorchers who are 2-2. However, The thunder are punching way below their weight and should find their form and get rolling at home - a ground which favours the bowling attack, of which they have the better! 

Back them to get the job done and wake up to some great profit. Really confident with this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> and backing with 3 Units.

 If you appreciate my picks, any tip is appreciated link below for the research etc.

**Last:** RB Leipzig ML vs St.Pauli + Werder Bremen vs Hoffenheim U11 corners (2.5u) ❌

**Europa League @ 8PM GMT (soccer)**

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Bologna ML +** Aston Villa/Salzburg **U11 corners (4u)**

**Odds:** \+122

**Write Up:** I know this is a strange one and I am aware that singles are the way to go BUT I do this for a bit of fun - with some research and any picks I like I will post and put into a two leg. I often have more than one two leg and so far those are proving to be more successful than the ones I am posting, <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> curse? (I kid this is all for fun).

ANYWAY onto todays, quick and simple Bologna face Maccabi Tel Aviv. Simply put MTA are not doing well, they are dead last in the league going 0-1-6 (W-D-L) and have a massive goal difference of -17. I can&#x27;t see them beating Bologna who are mid table at 15th and have qualified for the round of 16 knockout phase - despite this I do think Bologna put their better foot forward and still will be too much for MTA especially when they now have nothing to play for. Bologna are too much for a very poor MTA side that have proven they are not the same quality as their opposition in the league this year.

Aston Villa/Salzburg is at Villa park, an absolute fortress of a European ground. AV average 10 corners per game at home (for both teams), they have seen u10.5 corners 6/last 7 games and Salzburg have gone under this same line 4/last 5 games. I do think that this is a game that will be won or lost in midfield, given AV&#x27;s injuries I do think there will be some rotation - HOWEVER it is important to know that both midfields posses the quality to counter and seek out breaks. This being said I like it for more open play shots and less corners and set pieces. Lets hope that these streaks continue and it is a good game either way. 

BOL and always bet what you can afford to lose!</td></tr>

Writeup: Wisconsin triumphs over an 18 point deficit at halftime to win by 3 with 1 second left..insane.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: 🏀 Hawaii @ UC Irvine under 138.5 total points (-112)

Game starts at 11pm EST. Bet 2u

Writeup: I’ll keep this one simple. UC Irvine is top 30 in defensive efficiency, whereas Hawaii is nearing 200th in offensive efficiency. The reverse shows the same pattern. Hawaii is also top 30 in defensive efficiency, while UC Irvine is 216th in offensive efficiency. Both teams have a mediocre shooting percentage, average rebounding, average free throws, etc. I expect UC Irvine to create some turnovers however, and with their average pace of play, I expect only an average number of points off of said turnovers. UC Irvine has been playing better recently, but is one of the worst teams while playing at home. Hawaii has been playing worse recently, but plays better away. All in all, expect a lot of mediocracy. The books already have this as a low total, but I like it even lower. If I had to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> a side, give me UC Irvine +1.5, but I like the under more in this one.

Teams have a lot of success shooting the 3 ball against the Sydney Kings and Tyler Harvey is the biggest threat for Illawarra. It will be between he and QJ but there&#x27;s opportunity for both and at 15, hes cleared this 63% of the games this season and 4/5 of his last matchups with the Kings the last 2 seasons. 

Hes dropped some big numbers on both Delly and  Davis before, and with Bul Kuol out for the season, he might in for a big one tomorrow. 

Next best odds $1.80 on TAB. Anything below, take his 15.5 line instead at even odds.

**Write Up:** I’ve been waiting for this horse to pop up on debut and here he does on Thursday night at Paky, unfortunately it seems everyone else in the whole world has too, because the opening price of $2.40 is well and truly gone.     
      
This horse was absolutely strangled in its latest trial, and cruised past all of the horses in the heat bar EUROCANTO, a stakes winning 2yo. Now the even better part of this trial is that 2 of the other 4 horses were also in said trial, so on that basis we’ve easily got them covered. Both horses were under a lot more pressure and struggled to match motors with us. The other two horses also have raced each other and I’m not sure they showed enough there to be winning tonight.     
     
We’ve been a bit tardy away in both jump outs, however in a 5 horse field even if we’re last we won’t be too far away. Pak has been playing a little off-fence lately, so sweeping down the outside isn’t a disadvantage, and that’s exactly what we did in our trial.     
     
Edit: Adding on that the trainer was on radio this morning and said he’d be very disappointed if this horse didn’t win tonight. If the horse wants any chance of making the Blue Diamond field (one of 2 big 2yo races) in a couple weeks time he must be winning tonight.

**Write Up:** 

**Celtic VS Utrecht | 21:00 GMT +2**

* Celtic have won the 1st half in 9 of their last 10 games
* Utrecht have lost at halftime in 3/3 Europa League away games 

To understand the Scottish league, all you need to know is that since the 84/85 season only Rangers (18 times) &amp; Celtic (22 times) have won it. To further expand on this the last 13 of the last 14 league titles has gone to Celtic! So when they suddenly find themselves eight points of Hearths in 1st place and fail to qualify for the Champions League against a team close to the Chinese border, things aren’t great. When you then also as manager starts bitching about the management it’s just over.

So in comes Martin O’Neil as interim manager and he wins every league game and knocks bitter rivals Rangers out of the League Cup to make the finals.

Then they hire their new guy who is going to instill a new vision for the team and really change the way the club plays… They have decided on Wilfred Nancy, who is unproven in European football and what proves to be the most evident of all, he has no big club experience. 

His first game in charge is league leader Hearts and Celtic not only fails to make any ground on them, they lose 2-1 at home! He followed that up with 3-0 beating at home again against Roma and then lose 3-1 in the League Cup final against bottom of the table St. Mirren. At this point the crowd has turned properly on him. He somehow survives a couple more games until he loses 3-1 at home against bitter rivals Rangers and finally gets the sack.

So in comes Martin O’Neil for a second time and instantly beats Dundee United 4-0 at home, a club Nancy lost 2-1 against a couple weeks ago. Celtic failed once again to beat Hearts last weekend as they took the lead twice against them away, but a red card made things very hard and it ended 2-2. Celtic also drew 2-2 against Bologna last midweek in the Europa League, but that was a pretty good performance as they played for 60 minutes with a player less. 

Utrecht had an amazing last season that saw them finish 4th in Eredivisie, but they are currently 11th in the league and have only seen 1 win from their last 14 games across all comps. Their Europa League dreams are dead after only one point earned and three goals scored in seven games… Celtic on the other hand needs a win here to progress. 

O’Neil in his two periods in charge has seen 

* First periode in Charge 6/8 1st half wins
* Second Period in charge 5/5 1st half wins 

This should be an easy enough win for the host which the odds reflect and doing it by halftime as they usually do should also be very possible.

\++++

**Midtjylland vs Dinamo Zagreb | 21:00 GMT +2**

* No team has seen more goals in their EL games than Midjylland &amp; Dinamo Zagreb who both have seen 26 goals from seven games.

We are going with the over this time after the spectacular fail last time around when I was tempted to take the under 3 goals line and was met with a crazy 3-3 draw against Brann. 

Midtjylland&#x27;s chances of finishing top in the Europa League table is more or less gone now after last round&#x27;s result, but they still need to fight to secure a top 8 finish. Dinamo Zagreb with a massive win 4-1 over Romanian FCSB saw them more or less secure a spot in the top 24.

The host will still miss their top scorer for this game, which is unfortunate, but they showed against Brann that they do have other players that can contribute with goals. Dinamo are playing really well in the league at the moment after being a bit off the pace at the start of the season. 2-1 or 2-2 is my guess for this game.  </td></tr>

Nice should have enough chances here as the hosts will push for the win and Nice themselves also very rarely see clean sheets.</td></tr>

**Reasoning:** The Blues have sucked. Last game both Jake Neighbours and Jordan Kyrou got hurt and left the game (still hit the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> prop!) and are DTD, they sent Stenberg down to the AHL so he can continue to play during the Olympic Break. The Blues have the second worst goal difference in the league, and if you watched their first game in December it was a thrashing, the Blues won 6-2. I doubt that&#x27;ll happen again and will motivate Florida to leave a statement in St. Louis. Even if the Blues can make it to OT, they are 1-9 in OT. Not a good team. I&#x27;d <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> a player SOG prop but with all those injuries....I don&#x27;t know.

The week has begun and it went bad. Champions League saw so many bets come close but only a few won 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> also didn&#x27;t hit. PSG were the way better team but didn&#x27;t manage better than a draw. 

Europa League will cheer me up. I&#x27;ve found a few gems that I love. 

**Write Up:** 

Celtic are looking to secure their spot in the top 24 to continue in the Europa League. FC Utrecht are already eliminated from contention and will aim for a good result against Heerenveen instead. A game vs a direct rival for chasing european football next year. 

Celtic are 1-0-2 at home so far with losses against strong opponents AS Roma and SC Braga. Away they&#x27;ve won their game against Feyenoord, a team from the Netherlands who are a definite step up from FC Utrecht. 

FC Utrecht, as mentioned, won&#x27;t care about a good result as much as Celtic do. 

Going 0-0-3 away from home and 1-3-5 away in the league. Winning only once in 12 away games will not give them the confidence they&#x27;ll desperately need

Celtic went 1-0 up against Bologna in their last game, received a red card, went 2-0 up before being outmatched in the second half due to being down to 10 men. Ending the game 2-2 and missing out on important points. 

Those points will be secured <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> in convincing fashion. 

So far I&#x27;ve had 1x5U play and 2x4U plays. All have hit so far and I&#x27;m confident in keeping that 100% alive.

Tennis | Quimper Challenger | 9:50 AM EST (estimated)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Pavel Kotov vs Remy Bertola | Kotov ML at -154 (DK). 2 units. 

Write-up: Happy to get a win in the midst of some rough form. Neither match was quite as straightforward as I expected, but neither player actually faced a set point. 

Feels weird to go with this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, as I actually faded Kotov in the opening round of qualifying. That was his first match of the season, and I wasn&#x27;t particularly confident about his fitness coming in. He didn&#x27;t play great tennis in that match, but it was enough to win, and he has steadily raised his level since then. Do I think his movement looks great? Not really, but the courts here in Quimper are playing fast enough that his strong serve and overall talent pay dividends. In the last round, he closed at a really short price (around +130) against Mark Lajal, one of the better indoor CH players out there, and scored a three-set win. 

In comparison, Remy Bertola&#x27;s first-round win over Mannarino would have looked really nice...about three months ago. The 37-year-old Frenchman has experienced some severe backsliding to start the year, and the market has reflected that. Even still, Bertola closed as a significant underdog despite having a dominant indoor win on the record last year, when Adrian was actually playing solid ball. I believe a significant factor in this price was Bertola&#x27;s poor form to start the year, including a first-round ITF loss as a 1.1 favorite and winning just three games against Kukushkin in Glasgow. Speaking of Kukushkin, Bertola was around a 2.7 dog in that matchup as well, while Lajal played Kuku recently and was a 1.4 favorite. If you compare the odds, Kotov&#x27;s price in this one doesn&#x27;t make a ton of sense: the market seems to be valuing him higher than a player who closed as a much bigger favorite than this against Bertola. Keep in mind that all of the matches mentioned were played indoors.

On top of the odds seeming off, Kotov had a higher performance rating in the first round (7.34 vs 7.14). Bertola has a solid serve for his height and a creative game, but I think his one-handed backhand could cause issues here. Kotov has a solid career record against one-handers, including wins over Stan Wawrinka and Lorenzo Musetti; while Bertola can certainly generate some pace off that wing when he strikes the ball clean, Kotov&#x27;s reliable backhand stroke, which almost comes off as &quot;pushy&quot; at times, can be an effective counter. Overall, this is starting to feel like the right setup for a breakthrough run from Kotov, and I don&#x27;t see Bertola taking him down here. As a result, this is my first 2-unit play of the year.</td></tr>

Kairat scored at the last second to ruin the streak

Valur vs Grotta, over 5.5.goals @ 2.4

Valur are heavy favorites and usually play with high tempo, especially against weaker opposition. Their attacking depth and pressing style can quickly open the game and lead to multiple goals. Grótta tend to struggle defensively and often concede heavily when facing top teams. If Valur score early, this match could turn into a one-sided goal fest, making over 5.5 goals a high-risk but attractive option</td></tr>

**Diving into ML <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> and were looking at 2 sides that are oh so close to achieving automatic qualification (top 8) but the only thing standing in their way is an underperforming opponent at home. Only 3 points separate 4th from 18th and these sides are going to take full advantage of the final day being at home. Stuttgart are 2 points of Qual while Porto are just one spot off but a draw is not safe at all.**

**---**

**9.Porto VS 31.Rangers**

* Porto are currently unbeaten in their last 11 games with 10 W, 1D, 0L games
* Porto have won all 3 games at home in the Europa league this season.
* Porto have played 12 Home games this season and have a record of 11 W, 1D, 0L.
* Rangers have only won 1 game so far in the Europa league, drawing 1 and Losing 5.
* Rangers have lost all 3 Away games they&#x27;ve played in the Europa League so far.
* In each of these away games they conceded a minimum of 2 goals each
* Rangers are in good form in the Scottish league but its evident the European opponents are just a step up to them
* Rangers with 4 points are already disqualified from the competition and cannot proceed

\---

**13.Stuttgart VS 24.Young Boys**

* Stuttgart have won every home game in the Europa league this season with all their dropped points coming away from home. Simply a confident home side that gets a big boost from the crowd
* Stuttgart have played 13 home games in all comps this season and have a record of 10 W, 1D, 2L.
* Keep in mind that both their losses at home this season have come against Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich. Other than that they&#x27;ve only dropped points in 1 home game all season and it was a draw.
* Young Boys are currently on a 7 game losing streak.
* YB have played 3 away games in the EL this season losing 2 and winning 1 against 29th placed FCSB.

\---

**Expecting both sides to push for automatic qualification and nothing less than all 3 points tomorrow as even a win may not be enough, goal difference may have to come into play which is even better in our case**

**Nothing expected, everything appreciated!**

‎**Writeup** :

‎First off, Lyon are absolutely flying right now. They&#x27;re sitting pretty at the top of the whole Europa League table with a perfect record in most spots **18 points from 7 games**, best defense in the comp (only 3 goals let in total), and they&#x27;ve been on this mad winning run. Their last Europa League away was a clean 1-0 at Young Boys, and domestically they just slapped Metz 5-2. At home in Groupama? They&#x27;re beasts strong attack, Tolisso and Lacazette types banging them in, and that backline is rock solid. They want to lock in that top seed for the knockouts, no messing about. **They also have won 8 match in a row**

‎PAOK? Yeah, they&#x27;re buzzing too on a 7 game unbeaten streak or whatever, smashed Betis 2-0 recently, and they&#x27;ve got goals in them (15 scored already, second best). But look closer: their away form in Europe this season has been shaky. They&#x27;ve only got one win on the road from a few games, and when they face proper quality sides away, they leak. Facing the league leaders who concede almost nothing at home? Nah, that&#x27;s a tough ask. Greek sides can be brave, but Lyon at home in a must-win vibe for top spot is different gravy.

‎so much value this odds in the world.

‎Fingers crossed it lands easy tomorrow. Up the Lyon! 🍻

**DISCLAIMER: I took this same line at -4.5 @ 1.72 a few hours before this thread was created, it has moved up to -5.5 on my main sportsbook before I could post <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>. -5.5 is still good value, especially now that the odds are higher, BUT please exercise caution. Lower your usual bet size or outright fade. I have lowered the usual 2u <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> bet to 1.5u for that reason as well.**

**If it goes up higher to -6.5, its an automatic fade for me. If you can find it anywhere at -4.5, that was the original intended line for this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> and you can increase your units. Gamble responsibly and only bet what you can lose.**

**Writeup:**

DN SOOPers (1-3) are lacking in firepower. All of their players are just about outside of their primes and they are simply regressing. This roster five years ago would&#x27;ve been legit, but the next generation are already making waves and these old fellas aren&#x27;t cutting it. They&#x27;re second last in their group and only marginally better than HANJIN BRION who have ZERO match wins.

BNK FearX (2-2). What more can I say about this team that hasn&#x27;t been covered in previous POTDs. I&#x27;m loving how this team is right now and their playstyle. They can play slow, turn up the pace, and challenge the top teams all in one. They&#x27;re playing great League of Legends.

Coming into this match, I fully expect FearX to take Map 1, and it&#x27;ll just come down to the manner in which they execute. Just like most games, FearX will most likely make early game plays botside to give their star player Diable a lead. If they can end the first 10-15 minutes of the game ahead, DNS will have a tough time breaking through the line to destroy towers.

In order for the tower handicap to win, FearX must destroy six MORE towers than DNS. In all losses, DNS average -7.14 tower difference, meaning they destroy seven LESS towers on losses. In all wins, FearX average +5.4 tower difference, meaning they destroy five MORE towers on wins. FearX&#x27;s schedule has been really rough and a lot of their wins are from behind so this number should be higher based on their ability.

In losing efforts, DNS aren&#x27;t staying in the game and taking these towers which speaks to their lack of ability to claw back deficits. On the other hand, FearX likes to take the game slow from winning positions, which includes slowly breaking down the map and taking towers. If FearX gets ahead, I suspect they&#x27;ll smash the over easily. If it&#x27;s close, I expect FearX to play it slower and still comfortably hit the over. And if they&#x27;re behind, I&#x27;m not convinced in DNS&#x27; ability to get snowball a lead so they won&#x27;t destroy too many towers before FearX fights back. BOL!

**Last:** (CBB) Houston -5.5 (1.5u) - Pending 

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** (CBB) No. 9 Illinois (-12.5) vs Washington

**Start Time:** 9:00 PM ET (FS1)

**Odds:** -108 (DraftKings)

**Units:** 1.5U

**Reasoning:** No hurdle has proven to be too tall for this year’s Illinois squad. 

Lost senior guard Kylan Boswell to a broken hand? Junior Andrej Stojakovic responded with a career-high 30 points in a commanding 89-70 victory over Maryland. Down 11 to then-No. 4 Purdue—which started 14-of-18 (77.8%) from the field—on the road? Freshman Keaton Wagler took the reins, pouring in an eye-popping 46 points on 13-of-17 shooting to help pull off the 88-82 upset. Now, off the high of that victory, and with a Sunday road trip to No. 5 Nebraska looming, surely this has all the makings of a letdown spot?

Meh. Trap game, smap game. 

The Fighting Illini (17-3) might very well be the best offense in the country right now, ranking 1st in offensive efficiency (1.247), 25th in scoring (85.5 PPG), 65th in field-goal percentage (47.1%) and 68th in three-point shooting (36.0%). The team leads the nation in adjusted offensive efficiency (130.5), owning what currently stands as the highest offensive rating in the history of the kenPom era (since 1996-97). Furthermore, Illinois seems to feed off the energy of the home fans, averaging 90.3 points on 49.1% shooting while boasting a +24.1 scoring margin in 11 home contests. That’s very concerning for a middle-of-the-pack Washington defense that enters ranked 80th in opponent three-point shooting (31.7%), 108th in defensive efficiency (1.020), 118th in opponent field-goal percentage (43.3%), 140th in scoring defense (73.3 PPGA). 

Unfortunately for the Huskies (11-9), they lack the kind of offensive firepower to keep up. 

Through 20 games, the team ranks 97th in scoring (79.0 PPG), 101st offensive efficiency (1.100), 162nd in field-goal percentage (44.9%) and 288th in three-point shooting (31.4%). Although the Illini don’t boast elite numbers defensively—25th in opponent field-goal percentage (40.4%), 41st in scoring defense (68.3 PPGA), 68th in defensive efficiency (0.997) and 77th in opponent three-point shooting (31.6%)—the team does step it up against sub-par offensive units. In nine contests against opponents that rank outside the Top 100 in offensive efficiency, Illinois has conceded just 63.1 points on a porous 37.3% shooting from the field (29.6% from beyond the arc). That includes allowing just one opponent to top 40% shooting and holding all but three to 65 points or less. 

But if the Illini want to cover the double-digit spread, it’s imperative that they continue their dominance on the glass.

On the year, Illinois ranks 7th in offensive rebounding (12.2 per game), 11th in total rebounding (41.6) and 17th in defensive rebounding (26.4). That includes holding a double-digit rebounding edge in each their last three games. However, if there’s one downside, it’s the team’s tendency to cough up second-chance opportunities to opponents, ranking just 194th in opponent offensive rebounding (9.2). This is an area Washington will look to pounce, as the team ranks 44th in offensive rebounding (11.0), 49th in total rebounding (38.3) and 65th in defensive rebounding (24.3). Limiting the team’s impact on the glass will be critical for the Illini. 

All things considered, look for Illinois to put it together on both ends of the floor for a convincing victory. 

BOL if tailing, and as always, please do so responsibly. One loss should not have you crashing out all over Reddit. </td></tr>

Write Up:

The stakes here are massive. Both rosters are desperate to reach the Grand Finals because neither team has qualified for a major event yet, and losing here means waiting months for the next opportunity. Nobody is rolling over or calling GG early with their season on the line.

If you look at the rosters, this is basically a SEA All-Star match. On one side, you have the PlayTime veterans (Gabbi, Armel, Kuku, DJ, Akashi). On the other side, Nemesis is absolutely stacked with firepower (23savage, Mac, Jabz, Q, Jaunuel). When you have this much talent and this much desperation on the server, sweeps are rare. Nemesis has the raw carry potential with 23savage to take over a game, but PlayTime’s shot-calling usually drags matches into the late game where things get messy.

Both teams are prone to clown fiestas and throwing leads. I expect them to trade games, with the veterans stealing one and the young guns taking another, forcing a decisive Game 3.

BOL.

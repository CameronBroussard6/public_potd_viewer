‚öΩ | Liga Portugal | [Time, 23:15 EEST]

Moreirense vs Porto

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Porto ML and under 5 goals in the match ‚åõ

Odds: [-187/1.53]

Units: [3U to win 1.59U]

**Write-Up:** Porto and their amazing defense line are playing against a weaker opponent that is just no match to them. so I expect an easy win.

also I can&#x27;t remember the last time Porto had more than 4 goals in a match, their matches are usually low scoring and we have enough cushion.

**Only** bet what you can afford to lose, good luck to everyone.</td></tr>

Write up:
Been pretty lucky so far, lets hope it holds up.

I don‚Äôt expect the chiefs to have too much trouble with the commanders and Mahomes shouldn‚Äôt be under the kind of pressure that would make him throw a possible int. 

That said, ints can just happen from time to time with no fault of the qb, but I think its much less likely mahomes throws an interception than the -135 odds imply.</td></tr>

El Tio Sharp has another hot one here:

The line here doesn‚Äôt make a lot of sense to me. Giron sitting at -185 feels too steep given how these two match up. I actually like Altmaier +150 ML, but I‚Äôll take the spread out of respect for Giron‚Äôs consistency.

Altmaier‚Äôs had the better 2025 season so far ‚Äî more wins and a stronger win percentage ‚Äî and I really liked his form at the US Open with wins over Medjedovic and Tsitsipas. If he brings that level again, I think he has every chance to pull this one out outright.

MALMO VS HAMMARBY

Date: 27 OCTOBER 2025 at 19:10

BET ON: Asian handicap- HAMMARBY +0.50

Odd: 1.68

SWEDEN

\- Hammarby +0.50 looks like solid value here given the contrasting form and motivation between the two sides. Malm√∂ are struggling to find rhythm after Henrik Rydstr√∂m‚Äôs dismissal ‚Äî interim coach Anes Mravac has managed just two wins in five matches, and the recent 1-1 draw with Dinamo Zagreb showed once again a lack of sharpness and stability. The atmosphere around the team feels flat, with little left to play for domestically. In contrast, Hammarby are full of purpose ‚Äî coming off two straight wins, including a confident 2-1 derby victory over AIK, and just one result away from mathematically securing second place. They‚Äôll approach this with discipline and energy, looking to control possession and frustrate Malm√∂‚Äôs inconsistent back line. With Malm√∂‚Äôs motivation questionable and Hammarby tactically organized and confident, the visitors are well positioned to avoid defeat ‚Äî making Hammarby +0.50 an appealing bet.</td></tr>

Last Pick: Francisco Comesa√±a ML vs Luca van Assche (+100, 1 unit): Win

Tennis | Charlottesville Challenger | 1:40 PM EST (estimated)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Patrick Zahraj vs Thai-Son Kwiatkowski | **Zahraj ML at -125 (DraftKings). 2 unit.**

Write-up: Nice win for Comesa√±a, who closed at around -125. He also ended up defeating David Goffin via retirement to qualify for the main draw. 

Patrick Zahraj (ATP #243)&#x27;s form has significantly dipped since the start of the year, which saw him make a surprising run to the final of the Pau Challenger. Most recently, he crashed out of the Sioux Falls Challenger in the first round, winning just three games as the favorite. Still, I feel like this is the perfect match for him to regain some confidence and get a win under his belt. 

Thai-Son Kwiatkowski is actually unranked right now (career high of #181), as he hasn&#x27;t won a professional singles match in over a year. In fact, it would be a stretch to call him a full-time player at this point, as he has only played three matches all year and now works at a crypto investment company. He&#x27;s obviously still an extremely high-level player, but the reality is that it&#x27;s just tough to be competitive at this level when you&#x27;re only playing a few matches a year. This is especially true when you play the type of game he does, which relies on agility and timing as much as power. 

Even if Zahraj is out of form, I still believe that he has the weapons, including a big serve and solid net game, to to take control of this match. A lot of books have this around -150, but I would still play it for 1 unit at those odds.

Last Pick: Real Madrid vs Barcelona: Real Madrid ML‚úÖ

What a game that was. The score doesnt do it justice for how dominant madrid was. They couldve scored 3 in the first half alone. As i wrote in my analysis the backline of cubarsi and garcia couldnt handle madrids attack. Shame mbappe couldnt get more goals but we take the W. 


<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> there are not many football/soccer matches and the betis-atletico game looks kinda unpredictable (will probably put a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> for the game in the soccer thread) . I will go for a tennis <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> as its my second most watched sport.


ATP Paris: Cobolli vs Machac: Cobolli Ml @1.7

Cobolli just beat Machac last week in Vienna, and honestly not much has changed in seven days to flip that result. Cobolli looked really solid there, especially the level he showed against Sinner in the second set. If he brings even something close to that, he should be able to win this easily.

Machac is so up and down, and right now it‚Äôs definitely one of those down phases. He hasn‚Äôt beaten a good opponent in a while and his confidence looks shot. Cobolli at least keeps a solid base level and usually gets through his first match at tournaments.

For me it‚Äôs simple: Cobolli is playing better tennis, he already proved the matchup works for him, and Machac looks like he‚Äôs counting down to the offseason. Straight-sets win feels like the most likely outcome.

Yesterday&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Mjallby to win and u3.5 v Norrkoping 3u $2.50 ‚úÖ

Good come from behind win. 2-1 and enough to get us over the line.

Happy with the result, and happy with the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>.¬†

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Moreirense v Porto. Porto (-1.0 &amp;-1.5) Asian Handicap. 3u @ $1.54

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Not many games <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, but I&#x27;m a fan of this one.¬†

Porto last 2-0 to Forest mid-week, but I thought they were decent. Copped two penalties, had a goal disallowed, and looked like they&#x27;d score plenty of times.¬†¬†

It was also away from home in Dyche&#x27;s first game. Was going to be a big one.¬†

In the league, Porto have been amazing so far. They&#x27;re first with a 7-1-0 record.¬†

Porto have only conceded one goal in the league so far - in a 2-1 win vs Sporting.¬†

In 6 of their 8 games so far, Porto have been winning at half time. The only two were against Benfica (nil all draw) and the Sporting game I mentioned.¬†

Now, they&#x27;ve conceded nearly 4 expected goals, so their defensive record is still outperforming their numbers a tad. Having said that, 3.9 xga in 7 games is elite.... Especially seeing they conceded over 1.0xga vs Sporting.¬†

Moreirense, to their credit, have great home form, having won all three of their home games. However, the teams they beat at home haven&#x27;t been great. The Portuguese league has (imo) the biggest gap between the good and bad teams.¬†

There&#x27;s a few bets here that I don&#x27;t mind, but the handicap is decent enough here to roll with.</td></tr>

PREVIOUS BET = Arsenal Win Second Half and Gyokeres 1 Shot on Target

RESULT = The streak is over, Gyokeres had 1 shot in the second half but honestly he was completely out of the game. Just a bad call from me. Just remember to only gamble what you can afford to lose, a few people got salty as soon as this lost and if that&#x27;s your attitude I&#x27;d rather you just stay away from my picks. No one can win them all and if they can, well they aren&#x27;t on this thread. Anyway let&#x27;s try get back to winning ways 

TODAYS BET 

EVENT/S = Porto VS Morierense

BET =¬† Porto to win and Both Teams to score/NO @1.90

UNITS = 3U to Profit 2.72

SUMMARY = Porto in the league have scored 19 goals and Conceded 1. Funnily enough the one goal they Conceded was an own goal. Porto have been solid in the Portuguese league not only keeping clean sheets but also holding opposition teams expected goals very low. An average of 0.49 Expected goals against Porto. They are just far too solid defensively and attacking they are also in good form. Scoring 19 goals with an XG of 2.01. Analysing Morierense aren&#x27;t a bad side, they score goals and win games but against sides in the top 4 they are 0-2 this season. Losing 2-0 and 3-0 and getting dominated. The 2 top sides in the league right now and Porto and Sporting and when Sporting played Morierense they won 3-0 and had over 5XG with Morierense getting 0.16XG. I&#x27;m not expecting Porto to hit 5XG they aren&#x27;t as good going forward as Sporting but they are a lot more solid defensively and that&#x27;s what they build off. I expect Porto to win 2 or 3-0. 

If my picks help you and you&#x27;d like to show your appreciation a thumbs up is perfect, if you&#x27;d like to tip which is never expected but always appreciated and does help motivate me for the research here you go. [Beer Money](http://Paypal.me/smoothsailinnomore)</td></tr>

__Event:__ NFL: Commanders @ Chiefs 8:15pm EST

__POTD:__ Rashee Rice o6.5 rec (+125 FD), 3u to win 3.75u

__Write Up:__ To close out Week 8 of the NFL season, the Chiefs are hosting the Washington Commanders. __The Chiefs have won 4 of their last 5 games &amp; have scored 28+ points in each of their past 4 games. Over that stretch, they lead the NFL with 390.6 yards per game, they‚Äôre 5th with 29.6 points per game, &amp; they‚Äôve committed only 1 turnover, fewest in the league. The Chiefs have turned the ball over on a league low 3.1% of their possessions.__ This run has put them in the lead for Super Bowl Odd &amp; QB Patrick Mahomes as the favorite for the MVP award. They are coming off a 31-0 shutout vs the Raiders where Mahomes just kept passing. The Chiefs had a 1st down differential 31-0 &amp; the Raiders had 0 1st downs on 30 plays. The Commanders on the other hand will be without their star QB Jayden Daniels &amp; will be starting backup Marcus Mariota. Even with Daniels starting the last 2 games Washington lost both to the Bears &amp; Cowboys, with the Cowboys winning 44-22. That‚Äôs a lot of points, now they‚Äôre facing the hottest offense in the NFL led by Patrick Mahomes. 

Pat is an elite form. __Mahomes has a higher completion percentage than the week before in 5 straight games. Over the last 4 weeks, he has a 71.3% completion % for 7.9 yards per pass with 11 TD‚Äôs &amp; just 1 INT.__ KC is a heavy favorite at -11.5 in a game where Mahomes is going to light up a weak pass defense. __Washington‚Äôs defense has allowed a league high 8.3 yards per pass attempt, the most yards per completion (12.9 yards), &amp; a 5.6% TD rate (22nd). They‚Äôve allowed 54 plays of 15 or more yards, (2nd worst). They have a takeaway on 4.1% of opponent possessions (2nd worst). In the last 4 week they‚Äôve given up 2.59 points per drive (27th).__ To make things worse for Washington, Dorance Armstrong was just put on the IR, who led the defense in sacks (6) &amp; pressures (22). __Which won‚Äôt be good vs a KC offense that has reached the red zone on 14.9% more drives than their opponents (highest in NFL). The Chiefs are now 2nd in the NFL in scoring rate per drive (52.3%) &amp; points per drive (2.86).__ This has been due to the rate at which their passing &amp; the success. __KC leads the NFL in success rate on passing plays over the past 4 weeks (59.5%), while dropping back at a 72.1% rate in neutral game scripts (highest rate).__ Last game their offense was at a completely different level with 3rd year WR Rashee Rice returning from suspension.

Playing in his first game since Week 4 of last season, Rashee Rice made an immediate impact. __Rice caught 7 of 10 targets for 42 yards with 2 TD‚Äôs &amp; he was on the field for only 47.5% of the dropbacks with Mahomes, but he was targeted on 52.6% of his routes with 2.21 yards per route run.__ The Chiefs scored a TD in all 4 series he played rotating in. Head coach Andy Reid said on Friday: ‚ÄúWe set out to get him to 40% or around that area‚Ä¶ but I think he can keep his numbers going up.‚Äù Rice is just the 2nd player for KC to earn double digit targets in a game all season &amp; he did so in only 2.5 quarters. __Over his last 10 games, Rice is averaging 2.91 yards per route run &amp; 10 with a target rate of 31.3% of his routes. The last time he was targeted on less than 20% of his routes was Week 11 of 2023.__ Now he gets a juicy matchup not only vs the entire defense, but the specific corner that will be covering him. __Rice played 43% of his routes in the slot. Washington CB Mike Sainristil is their corner who covers the slot &amp; he is allowing the 4th most yards per coverage of any slot defender (min. 50 slot snaps). In fantasy football, they give up the most points per game to the slot (15.7).__ Rice was utilized on a lot of short passes last week &amp; it felt like he was open every play. There were designed screens, there were flip plays, &amp; there were back shoulder timing plays. __Rice averaged 0.8 air yards per target. It was 4.8 and 5.2 air yards in the previous 2 seasons.__ Both the routes and depth to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> up as the weeks continue. __I prefer reception over yards but it should be mention Washington is surrendering a 70.8% percent completion rate on the road, as well as 14.1 yards per catch to wide receivers specifically.__ He also didn‚Äôt have much competition for target. Their WR2 Xavier Worthy is in a bit of a slump since producing 121 yards in his return from injury in Week 4. In his 3 games since then, he&#x27;s totaled only 125 yards &amp; 1 TD. The 2024 1st rd <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>‚Äôs target share dipped to just 11.4%, the lowest it has been in a full game since Week 9 of last year. As for Travis Kelce, he had just 3 receptions on 3 targets. __Here are the target shares from the other pass catchers last week in Rice‚Äôs 1st game back: Brashard Smith - 14.3%, Xavier Worthy - 11.4%, Marquise Brown - 11.4%, Travis Kelce - 8.6%.__ Rice is going to get open a ton &amp; Pat will be looking for him.

The Chiefs play the Bills next week &amp; it‚Äôs clear Pat wants to make up for lost time with his top WR &amp; get back up to speed. With KC back to their scoring ways, Rice‚Äôs instant involvement will only grow.

__Rashee Rice over 6.5 receptions__

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>** Ohwaki Yui ML vs Kawagishi Nana (+137) 4u (bet365)

27.10.2025, 01:30, Makinohara ITF, Qualification - round of 16, hard

6:30PM MST (**starts in approximately 15 minutes**) 9:30AM local Japan time 10/27. Apologies for the short notice, was hoping the thread would be posted sooner. Tennis matches are often delayed beyond the official start time, sometimes by hours, so might still be some time to catch it.

Ohwaki has been on an absolute tear as of late, winning 10 of her last 11 matches. Her lone loss during this time period was to a good player, Kayla McPhee, who has a hard court record of 66-9 this year and has been as high as the top 200 in rankings. Very impressively, Ohwaki avenged this defeat against McPhee a month later in straight sets, as a +400 dog.

That was last week, and the very next match after that, she annihilated a certain Kawagishi Nana (6-1, 6-3). The same Kawagishi who‚Äôs playing in the match we‚Äôre betting on <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.

Their head to head record is 1-1 (Ohwaki lost to her back in April), but she was in pretty awful form at that time going off of her results around then. She had failed to qualify in her previous 4 matches prior to the defeat, losing in the first two rounds of qualifying in 5 straight tournaments, including the match vs. Kawagishi.

This is in stark contrast to her current form, in which she is dominating. In the first qualifying round of this tournament she double-bageled her opponent. That‚Äôs (6-0, 6-0) for those unaware, and it‚Äôs a good indicator that she‚Äôs going to destroy Kawagishi again <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.

Kawagishi has been in dreadful form. In her previous two matches before this tournament, she lost as the favorite twice‚Äîto an unranked player as a -450 favorite and then to Ohwaki. Her record on outdoor hard this year is 13-20 and she has been getting bounced in the first two rounds of the vast majority of her tournaments this season.

To summarize: Ohwaki is in excellent form, just handily beat her opponent last week, and her opponent is in poor form. At +137, this is very good value. She should be the favorite at more like -150 to -200 in my opinion. ITF women‚Äôs tennis can be unpredictable, so be warned, but I like this bet.</td></tr>

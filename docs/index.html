**Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Matty Cash 1+ SOT (+220) ❌️ 

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s Event:** UEFA World Cup Quals | Georgia vs Spain (9:00 AM PST)

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Khvicha Kvaratskhelia 1+ SOT (-110) 1.1 units to win 1 unit

**Write Up:** Tough loss yesterday as Cash had an attempt early but couldn&#x27;t land it on target. Poland changed their strategy and played through the left much more than the right. Bad read on my part, sorry friends. Bounce back day <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. 

Back to our roots here, taking a high energy forward against a clearly stronger team. Kvaratskhelia plays his club soccer with PSG and wound up with a goal in his last match before this break. In his last 4 competitive matches with Georgia, he has two goals and is averaging 3 shots with 1 on target. Kvaratskhelia will chase any ball kicked his way and will With Georgia&#x27;s main striker out injured, I see our guy taking a few shots, especially on counter attacks. 

Now to Spain. They&#x27;ve been nothing short of dominant in this World Cup Qualifier and have not yet conceded a goal. However, if one can fault them anywhere, they are giving their opponents opportunities on the road. With Turkiye firing off 13 shots (3 on target) and a very poor Bulgaria team taking 4 shots (2 on target),  Spain is not bulletproof on the road. Georgia also plays tough at home, having not been shut out since October 2024. 

Make no mistake, Spain should dominate this game. But I like rooting for underdogs and I like our guy Kvaratskhelia to land a shot on target (and maybe even find the back of the net) in front of the home crowd. 

BOL!</td></tr>

Event: Soccer/Football, [World Cup qualifiers] Turkey v Bulgaria


<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: total goals over 3.5 @ 1.80 - 3 Units


Already eliminated Bulgaria, already beaten 6-1 at home, now missing notable players including their starting goalie. Turkey are a very prolific team, Spain arguably held back a bit vs Bulgaria however when Turkey start scoring they don&#x27;t stop - so far they beat Georgia 4-1, 3-2, Bulgaria 6-1 and lost to Spain 0-6. Nothing really noticeable here that shows how another high scoring game won&#x27;t occur, with score difference being very important as well.</td></tr>

France U21 just couldn&#x27;t find the back of the net! They went into half time 1-0 down and came out in the second half and had chance after chance but just kept wasting them. They managed to get one back but it just wasn&#x27;t enough in the end. England U21 had a penalty in the first half and didn&#x27;t convert it and then went into half time 0-0. In the second half they got another penalty and this time they converted it and then didn&#x27;t really do much until the 91st minute where they scored again to make it 2-0. Gonna take a break from soccer and go back to basketball for this next <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>.

***POTD6***  
***-*** *Melbourne United -15*  
***-*** *Brisbane Bullets Team Total Under 90.5*  
***Odds:*** *2.00*  
***Units:*** *3*

***Sport:*** *Basketball 🏀*  
***Teams:*** *Melbourne United v Brisbane Bullets*  
***⏰:*** *4:30PM AEST (7 hours and 40mins from time of posting)*

***Reasoning:***  
***-*** *In their last game Brisbane Bullets lost their best scorer and player Casey Prather. He was the only player on their side who consistently puts up around 20+ points*  
***-*** *Melbourne United are top of the table and by far the best team with a +- 60 higher than the second place side. They have played one more game but 60 points won&#x27;t be made up in that game*  
***-*** *Brisbane are 8th (10 sides in NBL Top 6 make finals) and have really struggled lately. In their last game they lost by 29 points against 9th place, they won against 7th place but it was 83-81 so they were the winner out of two bad sides and before that they lost by 37 to 2nd place*  
***-*** *The last time these two sides met Melbourne won 95-86, Melbourne played a really bad game and still won by 9. Two players on Melbourne shot 14% and 10% who are both just below 50% average scorers*  
***-*** *10/13 games Brisbane haven&#x27;t scored 90 and that&#x27;s including a game against bottom of the league Cairns who have 9/13 of their games having 90+ scored against them*  
***-*** *Melbourne have only let the opposition score 90+ 3/12 times and that was against top 6 teams and two games where someone scored 30+ points*  
***-*** *Casey Prather usually scores about 30% of Brisbane&#x27;s points, they have played one game without him this season and they scored 82*</td></tr>

It assigns ELO ratings to players and projects a win chance based on the combined ELO ratings of the players on each team.

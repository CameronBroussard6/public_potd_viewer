Event: PlayTime vs. YB.Tearlaments | 12:00 AM EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: PlayTime ML @ 1.94 (5u)


Write Up:

We are taking PlayTime Moneyline because the market is disrespecting the experience on this roster.

While recent results have been mixed, these guys (Gabbi, Armel, Kuku, DJ) have way more high-pressure LAN experience than their opponents. In elimination matches like these, decision-making beats mechanics. YB.Tearlaments is a volatile Chinese stack that tends to get messy in the mid-to-late game.

PlayTime’s win condition is simple survive the laning phase and let Kuku and DJ out-maneuver them on the map. At 1.94 odds, we are getting a coin flip price on a team that actually knows how to close out games. I’m banking on veteran discipline to force errors from the younger squad.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** **RB Leipzig ML** vs St.Pauli **+** Werder Bremen vs Hoffenheim **U11 corners** (2.5u)

**Odds:** \+182

**Write Up:** Right in a rough space here, last 3 have been healthy scratches barely missing by the smallest margins on each play. All from hitting woodwork and poor finishing to getting 11 corners in the last minutes of the game. It is what it is, onto the next.

Im staying confident in my methodology which has proven to work for me. Todays we are visiting the German Bundesliga 1 for TWO fixtures but a mixture of the both. First up is RB Leipzig moneyline, where St.Pauli are winless in 5 fixtures and head to head RB Leipzig haven&#x27;t lost in the last 3. RB sit 5th in the league with St.Pauli fighting relegation in 17th, most of RB&#x27;s losses have come from teams which are similar or are powerhouses in the league (Dortmund, Bayern, even Hoffenheim and Stuttgart in current form). They seem to be winning 62% of their fixtures at these odds with St.Pauli only coming through on 8% - this alone, PLUS their current form gives me confidence that RB will deal with SP and come through. SP are the home team, currently in terrible form going 2-2-4 (W-D-L), RB are 4-2-3 respectively and despite these numbers I am confident enough they have the quality to win.

Second leg of the bet is u11 corners for the other Bundesliga fixture, which has hit u10.5 in their last 8 encounters - current form for corners is last 4/5 for Hoffenheim and 7/8 for Werder Bremen. Hoffenheim sit 3rd and WB sit 15th, WB are winless in 9 games I see them playing for a point at least especially being at home and trying to create a cushion from the relegation zone which they sit 5 points ahead of. Because of this I do think both teams find the net and it could result in an attacking centred but defensively controlled game. Corners tend to be better for unders in games that teams are looking for control in the midfield and defence, while taking advantages of breaks and big chances. Lets hope this plays out how we expect and teams can convert on their chances unlike the last few! If I stuck to my gut yesterday we would be 2W-3L and \~+4.0 units but such is life.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> we head to Germany for a matchup between 17th place St Pauli and 5th place Leipzig. I don&#x27;t understand the odds here, St Pauli are real bad (we saw this with last Friday&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> in the 0-0 draw) and Leipzig are in good form. Leipzig are coming off a 3-0 away win at Heidenheim, who are equally in points with St Pauli. While they can be a bit inconsistent, this is a game they should win and I expect them to win handily.

Tonight’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> Arkansas -2.5 vs Oklahoma (7 pm)

Oklahoma has lost six in a row. Arkansas has one of the most efficient offenses in the country and do a great job of spreading assists and playing with tempo. Oklahoma’s hope to win relies on home court advantage, lots of turnovers from Arkansas, or a career night from Xzavier Brown. I think Arkansas is way more talented, more disciplined, and better coached. Arkansas has a size advantage at guard, which I think will be hard to defend. Oklahoma has some size with their bigs, but they struggle in transition and are not as athletic as Arkansas. I look for Arkansas to get to an early lead and push the pace, neutralizing Oklahoma’s bigs and causing foul trouble for Oklahoma’s guards.

**---**

**RB Leipzig** are an impressive attacking side given their position this season. They just put up 8 shots on target against Heidenheim, who sit next to St. Pauli in the table. After such a strong attacking display, I expect them to run it back here as well.

* Leipzig rank third in the league for shots on target at 5.83 per game, and I see them hitting well <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>
* Leipzig have covered this line in 9 of their last 10 games.

\---

**Como** under Fàbregas are something to watch. They just beat Torino 6–0, so there’s clearly no lack of confidence in shooting with this side.

* Como rank third in the league for shots on target as well, sitting at 5.18 per game.
* Como have covered this line in 9 of their last 10 games.

**Write Up:** 

* Nusa with a shot on target in 4/6 away games
* St.Pauli averages the 5th most shots on target against
* RB Leipzig averages the 3rd most shots on target

I love Nusa! When he is in form, he is just so fun to watch. Unfortunately he just gets injured way too often to go on any longstreaks, but he is injury free again now. In his first game back from start he failed to get any on target, but managed five against Bayern Munich and should probably have had a goal with the chances he had, then last round away against Heidenheim he scored and had two on target.

St. Pauli is currently in the relegation zone which is not so surprising when you have only won once since the third round, that win came against the only team that is below them in the league table… So things aren’t going so hot for the host. 

Despite playing out wide on RB Leipzig’s left wing, he gets centrally very often. If you look at St. Pauli’s map over shots faced, you will see a lot of shots in areas Nusa thrives in. 

I see most bookies have it between 1.6-1.65, so one could add St. Pauli over 2.5 corners to boost the odds above evens (Coolbet gives 2.15). 

*St. Pauli has managed 3+ corners in:*

Event: Australian Open QF 🎾

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Carlos Alcaraz 🇪🇸 3-0 vs Alex De Minaur 🇦🇺 3 units to win 3.8U @2.25 (Bet365)

Alcaraz is the closest to tennis perfection we have in <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>’s game with his elite mix of variety, ball striking/power and movement bringing him to the No. 1 spot. It seems as though he had no holes in his game most of the time except when his focus drops and becomes unrecognisable spraying errors for portions of matches. With how electric his game is it’s almost part of the fun he brings to the court as it can bring some momentary drama to his matches. He’s won 59 of his last 63 matches with only losses to Sinner and Norrie (lmao) but since the US Open it’s just felt like he’s gained a serious boost in consistency in his matches. Alcaraz has dropped just one set in grand slams since Flushing Meadows (against Sinner in the final) and has been dominant yet again here in Melbourne. Following two opening rounds where he was solid if unspectacular he did well to deal steamroll past Moutet’s tricky game and managed to beat Paul in straights in spite of the American playing the match of his life. Carlos is looking to be the youngest person ever to win the golden slam and has been getting better and better, when in confidence he can genuinely be unplayable in the literal sense of the term.

As I’ve said before De Minaur is a very consistently great player with a glass ceiling when playing against stronger opposition. He will give everything he’s got in front to the home crowd, play a lot of balls back but simply doesn’t have the weapons to harm the top of the top. To have a chance at being competitive with a Sinner or Alcaraz you have to either hope they’re having a truly terrible day or redline as they’re simply better in all aspects. It’s almost impossible to sustain such a level of intensity in BO5 like this but De Minaur physically doesn’t have the raw power to do such so I believe he doesn’t even win a set here. ADM loves rhythm which Alcaraz just doesn’t provide but won’t be able to get out of his metronomic style due to the Spaniard’s intensity putting him on the back foot which his opponent should feast on. I expect the demon’s serve to be largely neutralised in this match-up considering it’s already a weakness of his compared to the elite and with how well Carlos has been returning so far. As a result, ADM’s service games should be more contested than his opponent’s throughout the match. 

As I said Carlitos does sometimes dip in quality in matches which is why asking him to not drop a set is risky but I believe fairer odds should be around the 1.9 mark and therefore see value. I have found that Alcaraz has been dropping the tempo in the less important moments (e.g. Moutet recovering from a double break in the second set) by playing with his food before turning the machine back on when it matters (still won 6-4). This seems similar to last year’s AO where De Minaur brushed aside the competition until reaching the quarters where he lost 3,2,1 to Sinner. BOL !</td></tr>

**Last:** (CBB) Arizona -2.5 (1.5u) - Pending

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** (CBB) No. 7 Michigan State (-13.5) at Rutgers

**Start Time:** 6:30 PM ET (FS1)

**Odds:** -110 (DraftKings)

**Units:** 1.5U

**Reasoning:** Death. Taxes. Vegas disrespecting Sparty.

If that Washington line was disrespectful, and if that Oregon line was downright blasphemous, then this line is straight up unforgivable. Especially given that we just got a good look at the disaster of a runaway train that is the Rutgers men’s basketball team when fading them for Friday’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>. 

But mostly, it’s because Michigan State has been playing some of the best basketball in the country right now. 

Since a 58-56 loss at Nebraska back on Jan. 2, the Spartans (18-2) have reeled off six consecutive victories. All have come by 10 or more points with all but one by 16+. Even more impressive, is the fact that the team has done so by an average margin of victory of 22.7 points, including a 91-48 thumping of Maryland on Saturday. Not surprisingly, Michigan State’s recent form has helped it soar up to 4th in the KenPom rankings. 

As is the case with most Tom Izzo-led squads, the defense has been the backbone. 

Through 20 games, the unit finds itself among the nation’s elite, ranking 4th in scoring defense (62.8 PPGA), 6th in defensive efficiency (0.910), 7th in opponent field-goal percentage (38.8%) and 23rd in opponent three-point shooting (29.7%). But it’s the Spartans’ tendency to take it up a notch away from home that makes them a tough out, ranking 1st in defensive efficiency (0.901), 2nd in scoring defense (61.9 PPGA), 6th in opponent field-goal percentage (38.8%) and 31st in opponent three-point shooting (29.7%) on the road. Furthermore, ever since an uncharacteristic showing against lowly Cornell on Dec. 30—97 points allowed on 46% shooting—the unit has been in something of a flow state, conceding just 56.9 points on 37.8% shooting from the field (25.9% from beyond the arc) in seven outings. 

That all adds up to what should be yet another lackluster offensive effort from the suddenly reeling Scarlet Knights (9-11). 

Following a 82-59 beatdown at the hands of Indiana last Friday, the team enters as losers of three straight and four of its last five. And while Rutgers already ranks among the worst in the country offensively—258th in offensive efficiency (1.010), 270th in three-point shooting (31.9%), 277th in scoring (69.7 PPG) and 330th in field-goal percentage (40.7%)—things only take a turn for the worse against stiffer competition. In six contests against opponents that rank Top 75 in defensive efficiency, the team averages just 59.2 points on a porous 37.5% shooting (29.8% from the perimeter). That includes being held to 37% shooting or worse in all but one of those games. 

Unfortunately for the Scarlet Knights, things don’t get much better defensively. 

On the year, the team ranks 170th in scoring defense (74.5 PPGA), 196th in opponent field-goal percentage (44.8%), 239th in defensive efficiency (1.079) and 332nd in opponent three-point shooting (37.2%). Over the last three games, things have gone from bad to worse, as Rutgers has conceded 82.1 points on 48.5% shooting from the field (40.5% from beyond the arc). Not the kind of run of form you’d like to have when hosting a surging Michigan State offense that enters ranked 41st in field-goal percentage (47.9%), 47th in offensive efficiency (1.147), 71st in three-point shooting (35.8%) and 95th in scoring (79.1 PPG). 

But while those numbers won’t jump out of the page at you, take a look at what the team has managed to do in its last six meetings against opponents that rank outside of the Top 200 in defensive efficiency:

Oregon (208): 68 points on 57% shooting (35% from beyond the arc)
Maryland (278): 91 points on 61% shooting (47% from beyond the arc)
Toledo (286): 92 points on 51% shooting (43% from beyond the arc)
Penn State (306): 76 points on 46% shooting (56% from beyond the arc)
Oakland (333): 79 points on 46% shooting (27% from beyond the arc)
Cornell (351): 114 points on 55% shooting (46% from beyond the arc)

Not only did the Spartans go 6-0 in those contests, but they did so while averaging 86.7 points on 52.7% shooting (42.3% from long range). That includes shooting 51% or better in all but two games and shooting 43% or better from deep in all but two as well. 

It will be the intangibles that will play an X factor in this one. 

Michigan State topped 30 fast break points against Maryland on Saturday, marking the third time this season the team has accomplished the feat—the rest of the Big Ten has only done so twice. Not surprisingly, the Spartans rank 7th in fast break points (17.3 PPG; 98th percentile). That’s an area the team should continue to thrive in against a Scarlet Knights team that ranks 156th in opponent fast break points (9.8 PPG; 57th percentile). But where the team truly struggles is in conceding second-chance opportunities to opponents, ranking 222nd in the category (11.7 PPG; 39th percentile). This is another area Michigan State should be able to take advantage, as the team ranks 28th in second-chance points (14.3 PPG); 92nd percentile). 

Forget looking ahead. Expect Sparty to put together another dominant performance to springboard themselves into Friday night’s massive showdown with in-state rival Michigan.

Zverev is 38-1 in his career against lefties, and this is his 40th Grand Slam quarterfinal. It will be Tiens 1st. Zverev has a penchant for blowout sets. Even if this match goes 4 sets, I expect Zverev to win a set 6-2 or 6-1. 

Zverevs stronger stroke is actually his backhand, and Tien will not be able to dictate points from his left handed forehand like he did against Meddy. I expect a close start to the match and Zverev to pull away.</td></tr>

Write up: Half a unit bet for me on this one because of the injury concern for Nebraska &amp; Frager - Model has this as the highest confident Edge % and EV % for the day. Will add some personal information in this write-up as well.

• ⁠Model has Nebraska covering +11.5 at 56% (with Frager)

• Model says Michigan ML is at 62% (shows me that they are 11 point favorites with only a 62% chance of winning, might be a closer game than expected) 

• EV better betting 100$ = 10-11$ for this play

• I can’t wait for this game - Nebraska has been rolling this season &amp; Michigan is such a fun team to watch (still mad Cadeau left my Tarheels) - Nebraska is 6-0 ATS in L6 while Michigan is actually trending in the other direction, not covering the spread in their L6 - In the month of January, Michigan has dropped off significantly when playing at home, partially because they are playing conference games now, and not non-conference - the biggest concern here is obviously the pace of Michigan, and the fact that Frager is questionable - regardless, Nebraska is a great team in terms of defense, and I think they will be able to slow down Michigans offense just enough to cover the +11.5 - they have depth, and they really do play team ball - they have enough firepower to cover a bigger spread without Frager - Michigan is fast, Nebraska is not - because of this, the game might not be as fast as Michigan would like, leading to a closer matchup - Michigan will go on runs in this game, they are one of the best teams in the country, and I expect them to have a few good runs in this game - on the flip side, Nebraska is battled tested, they have proven to be resilient - I think they will be able to overcome those dangerous runs of Michigan - Nebraska ranks top 10 in the country in turnovers PG, and I really like that stat against this Michigan team because the less time Michigan can have the ball, the better chance Nebraska has - just like any sport, if you don’t turn the ball over, you have a chance to win - Nebraska is a high effeicent, low turnover team, who is 20-0 - you have to give them their flowers - Now do I think Nebraska is better then Michigan, no, but as you all know, I look for value, just like my bet Duke +1.5 vs Louisville - to get a great team like Nebraska, 20-0 at double digit underdogs, while Michigan hasn’t been great this month against the spread, you have to play it - Rolling with Nebraska here for 0.50U because of the injury questionability

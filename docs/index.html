**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Arsenal Over 1.5 Goals @ 1.66**

**League - Carabao Cup**

**Game: Arsenal vs Crystal Palace**

**Time: 3:00 PM EST**

**---**

Looking to bounce back and were looking at the last Carabao cup semi final <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.

Arsenal have been under some scrutiny in front of goal recently, and I see them setting things right tomorrow. Don&#x27;t see too much rotation tomorrow either, as Arteta has set the precedent of taking all competitions seriously this season.

Palace are coming off a 4-1 loss to Leeds and will set up a lot better structurally <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, but i see Arsenal closing this out in 90 minutes. Palace are now 3 games without a win and have conceded Over 1.5 goals in all 3 games. Watching them concede 4 goals and 20 shots to this Leeds side really sets a good stand for this game.

Arsenal has played 12 home games this season and covered this line in 10 out of 12 of those games. Keep in mind this includes a 1-0 win against Palace but I expect a better performance in front of goal tomorrow.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: PJ Washington Over 1.5 Three Pointers Made                                                                                    
Odds: 1.81 (10$ to pay 18.1$)                                                                                    

Time: about two hours from posting (02:00 EUW)                 

Reasoning:                                                                                    
Keeping it simple with a low line player prop. PJ Washington has a consistent role as a floor spacer in the Mavericks offense and regularly gets enough volume from three to clear this number. New Orleans defensive scheme often gives stretch forwards open perimeter looks, especially in half-court sets. Based on usage, matchup, and recent form, this is a solid high-percentage play and fits a disciplined <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark> approach.

Fair warning ⚠️                                                                                     
This is a conservative play, not a lock. Stick to proper unit sizing and don&#x27;t chase.

READ‼️                                                                                    
lost around 5k from doing stupid, crazy 30 leg parkays on favorits and hoping ill get rich from them. A few days ago i did a risky thing but it worked out and i could pay off all the money i owed my family and get some nice presents for them for chistmas. I cashed out my accounts from various books and only left 50 bucks. I will now try to get some of the money i am still missing back by doing smarter, researched bets. I am no professional analyst, but i like the sport and the hustle. I am never putting in more money in my accounts ever again so if i loose ill retire.

Start of the journey: 50€ now: pending

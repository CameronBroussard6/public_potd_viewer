Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Cade Cunningham O9.5 Assists @ -118 FanDuel / 2u (Pending)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Miles McBride O7.5 Points @ -113 DraftKings / 2u

Event: NBA / Knicks @ Spurs 7:00 pm EST

For Wednesday&#x27;s slate of games, I really like McBride&#x27;s chances of getting 8 points. This season, he has cleared this line 86% of the time. McBride is coming back from an ankle injury, but in his first game back vs the Pelicans, he grabbed 14 points (4-8 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 4-4 FT). Now, McBride should actually have an easier matchup against the Spurs, as they defend the PG position pretty weakly (30th) compared to the Pelicans (5th). 

With Josh Hart being out, he has grabbed 8 points 6/7 times in the last two seasons and 2/2 this season. He also attempts more shots (9 FGA vs 12 FGA) and gets about an 11% boost in playing time. Hopefully, they let him play a little longer this next game, as I think they will need him. Two powerhouse teams - should be a fun game.

<tr><td class='post'>POTD Record 15-12 (+3.02u)

Tuesday’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> ❌ - Canadiens vs Panthers o6.5 goals +114 (1u to win 1.14u

Wednesday’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> - Tampa Bay Lightning 3 way line +115 (1u to win 1.15u)

Final <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> for December. Nice to know that well under the month up until despite having a tough run to end the month.

The Lightning should have Vasilevsky back tomorrow as he had the night off in his previous matchup. He’s won his last 3 starts and the Lightning have won 4 in a row including Monday’s start with Johansson. Over the season, the Lightning have a +25 goal differential and are an impressive 11-4-3 on the road this year.

We don’t know who the Ducks goalie will be. Dostal has struggled quite a bit since coming back from his injury and Mrazek has a .865 save percentage in his appearances. The Ducks have also struggled with their goalie problem. They are 3-6-1 in their last 10 and now have a negative goal differential on the season.

The Lightning are on the road on this one, but they have an extra day of rest with their last game on Sunday.

Good Luck</td></tr>

Al Koolod vs Al Hilal, Over 4.5 goals @ 2.6

I’ve seen enough football in my lifetime to recognize a goal fest before kickoff. Al Hilal don’t slow down for anyone, they keep pressing until teams break. Al Kholood will try to fight, but their defense won’t hold for long. When Hilal start rolling, goals come in bunches. This match has chaos written all over it, over 4.5 goals is the smart call.</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>**POTD Record:** 6-18-3 *Officially three times as many losses as wins. Yikes. Villa sold us hopes and dreams in the first half before proceeding to get blown out by the ruthlessly clinical Arsenal side in the second half. Despite all this recent madness though, I&#x27;m more than positive I can end the year on a high note with this next <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. Let&#x27;s get an early one out of the way*

**Last Five:** ✅❌❌❌❌

**Event:** A-League Men, Central Coast Mariners v Brisbane Roar, starts in 6 hours and 54 minutes

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Central Coast Mariners Win or Draw -125, 5 units

**Write Up:** A quick glance at the league table might make this one seem fairly straightforward, while it&#x27;s anything but. The margins are actually much smaller when you see the games played and **how close the Mariners are to climbing all the way into the midtable,** and for that reason I&#x27;m willing to back the hosts to win or secure a cheeky draw. *While Brisbane Roar currently sit 8 places higher in the league standings* and have the better recent form, **this H2H matchup&#x27;s often been competitive and unpredictable.** Across their broader history, Central Coast have picked up plenty of positive results, including a series of wins against the Roar in the last few seasons, reminding us that this fixture often favours the underdog *(and make it known, the Mariners are barely an underdog here).* For example, they&#x27;ve **won 3 out of their last 5 meetings** and the 3 wins have all been very comfortable.

Central Coast haven’t collapsed even when struggling in the table, and they still **create chances at home, scoring at least once in most matches this season,** and having **scored more goals than their next opponents.** Their attack, led by **Jason Cummings and Tulio,** has shown it can trouble defences through their sheer technicality even when results don’t go their way. Their only issue is really their leaky defence, which has **also seen some slight improvements in defensive organisation** and especially the ability to execute pressing correctly, which makes it harder for Brisbane to simply dominate from start to finish. Not to mention Brisbane Roar have been pretty dreadful in front of goal themselves, scoring just a measly goal per game.

Taking into consideration the competitive historical clashes, Central Coast’s ability to score and keep themselves in games, and the fact that **this rivalry has produced its fair share of draws and Mariners wins**, I like the chances of **Central Coast Mariners getting a win or draw.** Sending it with 5 whole units and going to sleep soundly, knowing I&#x27;ll wake up to almost double the pretty sizeable stake. BOL y&#x27;all, let&#x27;s end the year with a bang and bring some better fortunes into 2026 ☘️🫡</td></tr>

Last event: Soccer/Football, [England national league North] Kidderminster vs Telford

Event: Soccer/Football, [AFCON] Mozambique vs Cameroon


<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Mozambique over 2.5 corners + Total shots (for both teams) over 18.5 @ 1.90 - 1.5 Units


Nothing to lose here for Mozambique, they should try their best to win and attempt to get second place or first depending on the other match result in the group. They&#x27;ve safely secured 3rd place, whereas Cameroon can choose to sit back and play more cautiously. In the group stage, this line cleared in both games with 4 corners, 29 shots for Mozambique vs Gabon and 3 corners, 19 shots vs Ivory coast who have some of the best defence. Cameroon also hit the shot line and allowed 5 and 7 corners to their opponents in both group games. Mozambique were amazing corner generators in the WC qualifiers, clearing in 8/10 games in the WC qualifiers with 7, 5, 5, 4, 5, 5, 8, 8 including games vs Uganda, Algeria, who are solid sides.
One last win for the year.
Enjoy the new years eve and best of luck.</td></tr>

**League - Saudi Pro League**

**Game: Neom SC VS Al - Ittihad**

**Time: 10:25 AM EST**

**---**

**Taking a trip to Saudi Arabia <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, and we&#x27;re backing a game with 2 teams neck in neck in the Saudi Pro League on 17 points - slowly dropping away from the top performers.**

**Last 10 games:**

**Neom Sc have scored in 9/10 of those games, currently on a 9-game scoring streak**

**At - Ittihad have scored in 7/10 of those games, currently on a 3-game scoring streak.**

\---

In Neom&#x27;s last 5 games, BTTS has hit 5/5, while BTTS and Over 2.5 has hit in 3/5. Expecting a similar scoreline tomorrow but with the attacking quality both sides have, I see the over playing well here. Both sides are already looking at a mountain climb when looking at the top of the league and winning tomorrow could kickstart a redemption run for both sides. Expecting an end-to-end game, as I love to say.

**Option 1 – Safe Bet**  
**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>:** Over 5.5 Drinks 🍺

Absolute lock of the night. Confidence is sky-high, defense is nonexistent, and hydration is already overrated. Early kickoff expected with strong momentum heading into the second half. No VAR, no cash-out needed — this one should cash well before midnight. Units: whatever’s left in the fridge.

**Option 2 – Parlay Style**  
**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>:**  
• Drink  
• Laugh  
• Forget the losses

Parlay odds: **+∞**  
Risk level: **Worth it**

This is a vibes-based parlay with elite chemistry. If one leg hits, the others usually follow. Correlated outcomes, zero hedging, and no emotional damage. Even if it “loses,” the memories still cash. Strong late-night upside.

Odds: 1.80

Write-up:
Algeria hold a clear edge going into this neutral-venue cup tie, and the advantage is consistent across the underlying metrics from my AI sports analysis model. They lead comfortably on ELO (1594 vs 1465), highlighting a strong historical and overall quality gap. This is reinforced by Strength of Record (93 vs 45) and Weighted Form (86 vs 23), which underline just how much more consistent Algeria have been in recent competitive fixtures.
From an attacking perspective, Algeria also profile as the superior side, showing a higher Attack Threat (68 vs 41) and a clear edge in expected goals — 1.8 xG for Algeria compared to 0.8 xG for Equatorial Guinea.

I have no idea which team is going to win, but it seems like a good value here.

I also like the fact they are starting the game 4.5 hours before the new year, so the girls should be a bit distracted. There are bigger problems than if they hit a basket <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Of course, they could also be distracted in the defense.</td></tr>

🏈Citrus Bowl, Michigan vs Texas, 3 pm ET 12/31/25

Record: 11-11
Net Units: -2.30 Units

Explanation: I’m not really worried about Texas, even with a lot of players opting out like Wisner, Moore Jr, etc.

Michigan has had a whirlwind of chaos recently with the firing of their head coach Sherrone Moore. Texas is going to be likely more poised, and with Michigan under change, I wouldn’t be surprised if they just resort to their typical run-first offense. Once Texas’ defense sniffs that out and gets good defensive reads as the game goes on, I see Texas slowly coming away with this game.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Ohio State team total (over 101.5 rushing yards)(-114 FD)


Write Up: OSU has averaged 162 rushing yards per game throughout the season. They should be in control of this game early and be relying on the run gun heavily. Yes, Miamis run defense is one of the best in college football but so is OSUs offensive line. In the one score games Miami has played in the opponents are averaging 110+ rushing yards.

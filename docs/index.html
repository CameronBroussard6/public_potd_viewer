**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s Event:** English FA Cup (Soccer) | Macclesfield vs Brentford (11:30 AM PST)

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:**  Mathias Jenson 1+ SOT (+120) 1 unit to win 1.2 units

**Write Up:** Last FA Cup match of this round and it&#x27;s one of the most interesting. Macclesfield shocked the world when they beat Crystal Palace in the previous round 2-1. Macclesfield is in the SIXTH tier of English football. They are a semi professional team and most all of their squad have day jobs. I saw a fun graph after they beat palace, their annual operating expenses for the entire club are below the annual salaries of 23 Palace players...

Anyway, I love a good Cinderella story so I decided to go for a shot prop. Jenson is a midfielder for Brentford, who can really sloy into any midfield position. He is the default penalty taker when Thaigo is not in the pitch, and had a great game last round of the FA Cup with a goal on two SOTs. I expect much of the Brentford team will get their shots in, as Brentford should have most of the ball given the differences in team tiers. **Watch for lineups** as I&#x27;ve mentioned before, Cup match lineups are tricky and while I think Jenson will start, there&#x27;s always a chance he won&#x27;t.

**Bet:** [Marcondes I.](https://www.flashscore.dk/spiller/marcondes-igor/GKJCcXKk/) \+4,5 games at odds 1.66

**Units:** 1 Units

**Explanation:**

We are back to turn around this losing streak. Marcondes is playing on home court against Buse and has been winning 2 matches already and won yesterday against Faria who has been playing really well this year. I think Marcondes is too much of an underdog here as he has had a solid start of the year, already played 2 matches in the tournament and are playing on the home court.

I am playing the &quot;safe choice&quot; here, instead of going for the +3,5 games at odds 2,1 which is also tempting, as I believe Marcondes has a solid chance to make this a close match.

Good luck!

Record: 2–4

Net Units: -2.72u

ROI: -32%

NCAAB | Grambling vs Prairie View | 

**Play** : OVER 151.5 (-110)
*Units* : 1.25u


Anticipating a fast-paced, high-possession matchup. Both Grambling and Prairie View push tempo, run in transition, and are comfortable taking early-clock threes. Neither side is built to slow the game down, which should create a steady back-and-forth scoring environment.

Both teams rely heavily on perimeter shooting and quick offensive sets, leading to scoring runs when shots fall. With projected possessions elevated and defenses that don’t consistently force long half-court possessions, this profiles as an up-and-down game.

Expectation is a high-tempo script with scoring opportunities throughout.

An interesting league, been doing nice here for a while, they like to score there. Home team 91 points at home on average, 90, 109, 103 in the last 3 games. Guests have 98 points (played as guests), and they have 1-4 in their last 5 games, so they are looking to change that. The limit is set about right after the previous H2H and the last games, but I like that both teams are of about the same quality, and both should go over 90 here.</td></tr>

Last Pick: Aarhus win &amp; Midtjylland/Draw @ 1.75 ❌

Last Pick Write Up: Very frustrating. Was deciding on Aarhus, Thun, Pafos and Midtjylland for ML win. Chose Aarhus for safety, it was the only one who lost. Ended up in profit for the day though because all the others won and my Midtjylland degen bets all hit.

Now for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>..

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: CFR Cluj win @ 1.88 

Write Up:

15th place Hermannstadt hosts 7th place Cluj. Hermannstadt has 1W4D8L at home while Cluj has 4W5D4L away. These two played three times last year and Cluj won them all. In last 6 Hermannstadt matches, they lost 4, won 1 and 1 draw. In last 6 Cluj matches, they won 5 and 1 draw. The bottom line is that Cluj is in good form and Hermannstadt is ass.

Safety angle: You can get Cluj/Draw + O1.5 at 1.6.

Degen angle: Cluj win &amp; O2.5 goals is at 3 odds. Add U11.5 corners and you get 3.5 odds. I will sprinkle on these.

Also, something interesting. Future FC vs Ismaila are playing in Egypt. In L8 Ismaila matches, 6/8 has O2.5, 4/8 has O3.5 and 8/8 have BTTS. You can get 2.09 odds for O2.5, 3.75 for O3.5 and 2.04 for BTTS. Future FC games tend to be low scoring but I’m gonna sprinkle on all these overs because Ismaila seems to open up games.

**Event:** NCAAB // 3 Houston @ 5 Iowa St @ 9:00 pm EST 

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Iowa State 

**Odds // Units:** FanDuel (-134) 3u

**Write-up:** Another battle on our hands with two of the best teams in the country. Number 3 Houston travels to 5 Iowa St. Both of these teams are used to winning, and both are great at covering spreads. Iowa St is 3-0 versus ranked opponents while Houston is 4-2. ATS Iowa St is 2-1, while Houston is 2-4. Houston hasn’t been a road dog this season, if that tells you how good they are. At home versus other Big 12 teams, Iowa is 6/6 covering -2.5. Houston has allowed -2.5 1/6 times. I also came across a neat stat: In games played among ranked teams, when the lower-ranked team is favored at home over a higher-ranked opponent, the home team is 11-4 SU and 10-5 ATS. To top it off, this game can impact March Madness seeding, and both of Houston’s losses have come on the road. 

Iowa St ranks 10th in offensive efficiency, and Houston ranks 31st. The Cyclones hit shots at an extremely high rate, ranking 4th in 3P% - 39.7% &amp; 35th in 2P% - 57.2% Houston sits average in both, ranking 179th in 3P% - 34.1% and 118th in 2P% - 53.3%. Houston doesn’t get many shots around the rim. They are extremely reliant on midrange and threes. This will be tough since the Cyclones rank 25th in limiting opponents three-point attempts, and both teams rank top 50% in opponent three-point percentage. Cyclones win the offensive battle. Both of these teams are defensive powerhouses. Houston ranks 3rd in defensive efficiency, while Iowa St ranks 5th. Both teams are similar in rebounding, so there is no edge there. Houston ranks 1st in limiting turnovers, but Iowa St ranks 9th in steals per game. 

Everywhere you look, this is a close game. This can easily be an elite eight or final four matchup, and we’re getting it early. The edge here is Houston’s two losses coming from the road. They rely a little too much on their defense, and have had some ugly games, granted, they’ve managed to still win them. With Iowa State at home, in one of the toughest places to play, I have to side with them. Yes, both teams are efficient on offense, but the Cyclones take more shots on a higher made %. They tote one of the best eFG% in the country, while the Cougars rank middle of the pack. Iowa State is averaging more possessions per game as well. If they can control the tempo and knock down threes like they have been (versus no. 9 Kansas, shot 37%), we have a good chance of cashing. GL

Here we have what should be a close match overall however I think FUT have a significant advantage on their map <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> which is Mirage, here are the relevant facts:

\- FUT have won an incredible 12 in a row on Mirage and (18W 2L over 3 months) including winning this map twice already in Cluj against Furia and Aurora who are arguably better than Astralis on this map

\- Astralis are in poor form on this map having lost six in a row on this map including once in Cluj

\- FUT already beat Astralis on this map on February 2nd in a comfortable 13-7 win

Overall I think these two teams are similarly matched in terms of their roster strength however on Mirage this should not be close and I struggle to see Astralis being competitive although it&#x27;s worth noting they get to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> their map first so could put pressure on FUT by winning their own map <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>.

Syracuse @ Duke CBB 7pm ET 

**Duke U/81.5 TT -105** best odds fanatics then Bovada &amp; DK

Duke has only gone over 81.5 in 3 of their last 10 games (SMU, LOU, Wake) showing some inconsistency hitting higher totals. They play at a slower pace than many high-scoring teams, meaning there are naturally fewer possessions in their games. Syracuse isn’t a top defensive team, but Duke’s scoring trends suggest that 81.5 is not a given, making the under a reasonable value play here. This will be a blow out game, but looking back over this years schedule, games won by 10 or more they still do not cover this line. One game is added when filtered by those parameters and it’s Lipscomb on 12/16, they scored 97 on 52% shooting / 69 attempts (higher than their average) against a much weaker team than the other 3 or Syracuse.</td></tr>

We hit another winner with Rosario Central! Now we are heading to the AFC Champions League where the gap between these two teams is massive.

* **World-Class Dominance:** Al Hilal is currently on an incredible 34-match unbeaten streak. They are the most powerful team in asia.
* **Squad Depth:** The difference in quality across the pitch is night and day. Al Hilal has top-tier talent in every position, while Al Wehda arrives in poor form, failing to win any of their last 3 matches.
* **Tactical Mismatch:** While Al Wehda has a decent attacking line that could pose a threat, their defense is their Achilles&#x27; heel. They struggle significantly against high-pressing teams with elite finishing.

The **-1 Asian Handicap** gives us a great safety net: If Al Hilal wins by exactly 1 goal, the bet is a **VOID (Refund)**. If they win by 2 or more, we cash the full ticket.

Yesterday was easy, but <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> is a different story. UAE is unpredictable as you never know which team will show up.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: NCAAM: Iowa State ML -130 vs Houston (1U TO WIN 0.70U)**

Write up: A Monday SHOWDOWN - Model has this as the highest confident percentages and hit rate for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Will add some personal information in this write-up as well.

• ⁠Model has Iowa State ML at 58%

• Going against Houston in this showdown - both of Houston&#x27;s loses come on the road this year, at Texas Tech and a neutral site vs Tennessee - One thing that stands out to me in this is that Iowa State is shooting almost 40% from three at home in the Big 12 while Houston is only around 32% - As always, it is Houston&#x27;s defense that typically wins them games, and while they force a lot of turnovers, Iowa State actually takes pretty good care of the ball at home recently - When looking into the data on Iowa State, they are a top 5 team in the country in terms of 3 point %, and top 35 in the country in 2 point % - that being said, on the flip side, Houston is right around the national average when it comes to 3 point shooting - If Iowa State can handle the disruption that Houston likes to cause on D, they have a very, very good chance of winning this game - Both teams have dominant scorers, both teams have good defenses, and this game will come down to the wire - I would like to mention something about home court advantage too, but the way that college basketball has been lately, home court just seems to not matter as much as maybe always thought it did - I really think if Iowa State cannot turn the ball over much, they got this game - they have the defense to stop Houston, and they have the offense to score the ball on a defense like Houston - Between Momcilovic, Jefferson, and Lipsey, I think they have enough firepower to walk away with the W in this one - A small note that I saw online, that I did not think much of was how good Momcilovic is at the FT line - in a close game, down to the wire, I like my chances with him at the FT line - Houston is reliant on their deep ball shot and a lot of mid-range shots - it takes one bad shooting night for them to not be the Houston team all of us have seen this year. Let&#x27;s go Cyclones.

Under 6.5 goals (-125)

Two teams that don&#x27;t allow a lot of goals since the beginning of the tournament. USA only allowed **1 goal** in their 5 games they played while Sweden only allowed 2. Sweden wasn&#x27;t supposed to be here and got a big upset against medal-favorite Czechia by playing a very good defensive game and their young sensation goalie playing once again another solid game. Sweden knows that they don&#x27;t have much chance vs team USA(+2000 to win) so they&#x27;ll definitely go with the same game plan that they did vs Czechia. Keep the score low and play defensively well enough to try to go for a 3-2 or 2-1 upset. With the majority of the crowd there being on their side I expect a solid effort from Sweden.

I know team USA is another beast but they never went the over 6.5 goals line in any of their games these Olympics while Sweden only went over the 6.5 goals once. Every quarterfinals game went under 6.5 also. Overall, I don&#x27;t expect this game to be a high scoring game especially since it&#x27;s the semi-finals and every goal will be important.

Writeup - Going with a Netherlands 2nd division parlay, so staking half a unit.

Leg 1 - Cambuur is 2nd in the league and playing against the bottom side.  Ajax Reserves were beaten 4-0 in their last game, while they lost the reverse fixture 4-1 at Cambuur. The visitors have scored three goals in three of five visits to bottom-half teams, and they can impress once again. Ideally, would go for o2.5 goals Cambuur, but going conservative, hoping for 2 from the visiting side.

Leg 2 - This event has been hit in all of Jong Utrecht&#x27;s last five games and four of Willem II&#x27;s last five matches. Three of the last four head-to-head meetings have also seen over 2.5 goals scored.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>** : Set 1 OVER 9.5 Games (-135)

*Write-Up* :

This sets up as a serve-dominant opener. Humbert holds in the mid-80% range indoors and Marozsan sits around 80%+, so early breaks should be limited. Both rely heavily on first-serve efficiency and tend to settle in on serve before return games open up.

With two strong indoor hold profiles, first sets between players like this usually stretch into the 10–12 game range. A single break likely isn’t enough to keep this under, and anything on serve through 5-5 clears comfortably.</td></tr>

Game: Counterstrike 2 (CS2) | Tournament: PGL Cluj Napoca 2026 | Time: 3:00 AM EST.

\-Will have ML picks posted in the esports channel for those interested/can&#x27;t bet player props  
\-**Aurora map 1 ML is a strong replacement imo if you can&#x27;t take player props**

**Initial Player Stats:**

* XANTARES is averaging a .75 KPR L3 months for Aurora, and a .77 KPR in the last month he is still their best player imo, currently in better form with Anubis back in map pool.
* iM is averaging a .72 KPR L3 months for NAVI, with a .68 KPR in the last month. He is the second best player for NAVI in the L3 months and in the last month he has dropped to third behind w0nderful/b1t

**Projected Veto:**

* Aurora ban Ancient, NAVI ban Overpass
* **Aurora <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> Anubis,** NAVI <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> Mirage

**Team Anubis Stats:**

* Aurora are 100% winrate on 4 maps of Anubis in the L3 months, they are the best Anubis team in the world, have been basically since the map was released, they were 22-6 on Anubis when it was in the map pool in early 2025 before being removed. In 2026 so far beaten some very strong Anubis teams (paiN/PARI as well as beating FUT/Falcons)
* NAVI are 0% winrate on 1 map of Anubis in the L3 months, they have always been staying away from this map even when it was in the pool and have struggled on it. They lost to PARIVISION 19-16 in their only map . Despite NAVI having a very strong 2024 on Anubis, they really fell off in 2025 with a 1-5 overall record and avoiding the map at all costs

**Player Anubis Stats:**

* iM averaged a .57 KPR on Anubis in his only map in 2026, a .58 KPR in 2025, and a .67 KPR on the map in 2024. In this 3 year period total, he averaged a .64 KPR on Anubis, a -.06 KPR from his regular average making it one of his worst maps statistically
* XANTARES has averaged a 1.07 KPR on Anubis in 4 maps played so far in 2026, a .79 KPR in 2025 on the map overall, and a .78 KPR in 2024. Overall he has averaged a .80 KPR in the three year period on Anubis, up +.05 KPR from his average making it one of his best maps. Most impressively is how big of a sample of games he has, it is much easier to see big jumps in KPR when sample is small-medium, but for a map he has played nearly 100 times, these are incredibly consistent and strong numbers
* Lots of reasons why its such a good map but one of the big ones is with Wicadia as A anchor, a lot of his kill threat on CT Side goes down, XANTARES has been their big output on CT Side, even historically when the map was much more T sided/favored overall.</td></tr>

Macclesfield vs Brentford, Over 3.5 goals @ 2.01

This matchup has strong potential for goals, especially with Brentford’s attacking quality against lower-league opposition. Brentford typically play with intensity and fluid movement in the final third, which can create multiple scoring chances. Macclesfield may struggle defensively but could contribute on the counter or from set pieces. If the tempo starts fast, this game can open up quickly and push past the four-goal mark.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Juncheng Shang 🇨🇳 to win a set vs Daniil Medvedev 🇷🇺 5 units to win 5U @2.00 (Bet365)

It ain’t 2021 anymore, Medvedev shouldn’t be this much of a favourite these days. I would have fairer odds closer to 1.7. After a really solid start to the season where Meddy won Brisbane, only dropping a single set, he has slightly slipped back into madness. He reached the fourth round in Melbourne beating De Jong 3-0, Halys 3-1, recovered from 2-0 down to Marozsan to seal a victory before being blown off the court by Tien 3-0. Last week, he played in Rotterdam where he lost 2-1 to Humbert and spent the entire match complaining about the balls (seriously a HOF crashout). Shang is entering the tournament with protected ranking as his body is made of glass but his level is very high whenever he plays. He started his 2026 with easy wins over Comesana and Sonego before falling to a red-hot Bublik in straights though had set point in the second. In Australia he took out RBA in four and lost to VDZ in straights but he was clearly unfit so I won’t read too much into it. 

So we have a Medvedev that hasn’t been winning easy recently against a big hitting prospect on a pretty fast court. I wouldn’t be surprised if Jerry was an outright winner in this match-up. Shang is also lefty and Medvedev has really been struggling against them as of late. Both matches he lost this year were against lefties and has lost a set in 10/12 (2-0’d Mannarino in Beijing 24’ where he saved SP, Norrie Beijing 25’) matches against them on hard courts, being 4-8 in that time span. Whilst Daniil is genuinely one of the best counterpunchers we’ve seen and thrives on absorbing power to grind out rallies, his deep positioning is a detriment against lefties as he gets pushed so far off the court by the slider that a player like Shang can just attack down the line after a  backhand cross. Shang’s explosive game fits this pattern perfectly and can also hang in the longer rallies as his rallying/defensive skills are also very strong, though Medvedev will obviously have the upper hand in those scenarios more often than not so he’ll want to avoid these patterns and can attack a neutral ball. Meddy’s second serve has also completely deteriorated over time (+ groundstroke pop has slightly reduced) and I expect Shang to punish it. Whilst the Russian is still an elite returner, Jerry’s serving abilities helped by the conditions should limit break opportunities and I feel like this is a pretty favourable match-up for him so I do think he at least grabs a set.

• Match: Tundra Esports vs. MOUZ


• <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Tundra Esports ML (To Win 2-0) vs MOUZ


• Odds: 2.38


• Unit Stake: 3 Units


Recap:
Liquid won as expected, and FUT took Mirage against Furia to keep the cash flow easy and sweat-free. We had great success at BLAST VI, and now we’re looking to carry that momentum into the opening day of DreamLeague Season 28.


Write up:
In DreamLeague, Group Stage 1 uses a Best-of-2 (BO2) format, which means the draw (1-1) is always a lurking threat. However, when the statistical gap is this wide, the &quot;Draw&quot; often becomes a value trap set by bookies. We are backing Tundra Esports to continue their total psychological and tactical dominance over MOUZ.

While Tundra had a slightly &quot;shaky&quot; 7th-place finish at BLAST Slam VI, losing their streak to HEROIC, they remain a tier above MOUZ in every measurable metric. The head-to-head record is as one-sided as it gets: Tundra has won all 7 of their previous encounters. More importantly, in their last three meetings (Dec 2025 – Feb 2026), Tundra hasn&#x27;t dropped a single map to this roster. On top of that Mouz has been horrific and ended their run at Blast slam by losing to a tier 3 Indonesian stack and bottomed the group stage.

At 2.38 odds, the bookmakers are giving us a &quot;Day 1 Discount,&quot; implying only a 42% chance for a sweep and favoring a draw. They are banking on Tundra being &quot;sleepy&quot; or experimental in the opening match or just because they lost against Heroic in Blast Slam VI. I’ll take that risk any day of the week—Tundra’s discipline in the laning phase (averaging a 76% win rate there) usually snuffs out MOUZ before they can even find their footing.

Final Play: Tundra 2-0. Stick to the unit sizing—don’t go over 3 units!

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: Houston vs Iowa State/ Iowa State ML (-130) 3u

Write up: Love the Cyclones here. To begin, playing on the road in the Big 12 is hard for anyone, I don’t care if you’re Houston. But Iowa State just pummeled Kansas and they get to carry that momentum 2 days later on their own court. Iowa State is 15th in the nation in points allowed (given the difficulty of their schedule that’s insane). They’re 12 in the country in Field Goal percentage, and 13th in the nation in assists. What does this tell us? They’re a very efficient offense that isn’t reliant on making difficult shots. They hound you on defense and work the ball around until they get THEIR shot. Their pace isn’t dictated by the other team. I say this because the Houston Cougars are a very smart and difficult team to play against, but Iowa State has proved this year they can show up against ANYONE. They have the home floor and it’s coming off a huge win against the Jayhawks. That place will be bumping and it will be ready to cash all of our slips. Why Iowa State will win, 1. Two-sided dominance 2. They can beat you a number of ways 3. Depth 4. Home court. Let me know if you’re tailing! Let’s do this.

**Event:** LaLiga, Girona v FC Barcelona, 3:00 pm EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Girona +1.5 Asian Handicap, -108, 5 units

**Write Up:** We’re going right back and hitting Barca while they’re down. The recent **dismantling at the hands of Atleti** *(who then went on to lose 3-0 yesterday lol)* has definitely left its mark, and I think the **injury-riddled Barcelona team** is going to struggle out there again <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Their next opponents are Girona, who managed to steady the ship after a terrible start to the league campaign. After a solid run of results, they now sit in midtable. The clashes with their fellow Catalan outfit are always hard fought and Barcelona really struggled the last time these two teams met in the league. Quick refresher, Barcelona needed a last second Araujo goal to secure a narrow 2-1 win, and these teams head into <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>’s match in a completely different context. **Girona have made huge strides** since then, while **Barcelona have clearly regressed** and it seems that their **defensive vulnerabilities** of their ridiculously high line are finally coming back to bite them. If they already struggled so much then, I can’t imagine how tough of a game Girona is going to throw at them <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Another thing to consider is that **this game will be held at Girona’s ground,** which only levels the playing field even more.

*To clarify, I still think Barcelona are the favorites to win it,* but I can’t see them winning comprehensively. And honestly, as long as Girona cover the spread, I really can’t complain. I’m so happy this game is on a Monday, because what’s a better way to start the week with than watching Barca get grilled? Feeling very confident, so another max unit play it is. Under 2.5 goals is also an option, as well as Axel Witsel to have a shot on target (he scored an absolute worldie in their last H2H), but I prefer taking money lines and spreads, so here we are.

Cagliari has been on a very good recent form, lost against Roma last Monday but won the previous 3 games including Verona and Fiorentina who are directly involved in relegation with Lecce, although Lecce is very good defending (31 goals conceded, less than 8th place Bologna) they have the worst attack in the league, only 15 goals scored in 24 games currently seating in the 18th place, Cagliari has a much more quality squad, goals are not guaranteed here but the ML is worth the odds.

Real Madrid&#x27;s emphatic win against Sociedad puts Barca now in second 2 points behind, a win and they sit first again and they&#x27;ll push for just that.

Write Up:

Supporting the home team to get one in <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Against Lecce, I see Cagliari getting at least one goal in and dominating a huge chunk of both halves. There should easily be 2 corners for Cagliari in the 2nd half. Also, Cagliari at home have only been goalless in games vs much stronger teams like Inter, AC Milan and Bologna. Lecce shouldn&#x27;t prove difficult, all things remaining equal.

Explanation: Really bad <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> yesterday, but that’s bound to happen as well. We move on to the next one. We have a final here between two of the best teams. They have been the best for the most part this season. And the expectation is lots of goals. The reason is simple, they have a lot of action in their games. Coventry has 98 goals scored + conceded together. The most so far and Middlesbrough are ranked 1 on the table at the moment. Talk about a heated game with lots at stake. The trigger that we need is an early goal and all hell will break loose. I definitely don’t expect these teams to lay back and play defensive. My expectations are 3-2, 3-3, 2-3 or anything higher here. This might be the last time I’m attempting **over/under** bet, if it fails. I need a sign that I’m decent at this, even if I won’t attempt it often. 

On the side note: My tactics won’t change by lowering the odds. The goal is to find high odds to play here. I’m trying to keep track of the results in all of the top leagues. We will **always aim for** **long term** gains here and make sure to manage your bankroll. I changed my mind in the end about lowering the units. The approach will rather be to **quit over/under**, if it goes horrible. I will try to post another <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> in the coming days. Good luck everyone.

Bookie: **Leovegas** and a **5** unit bet. Gamble **responsibly**!

Appreciate all the support:

Last 10 matches at Pallekele, only one had over 13 sixes.

Australian batting is struggling against spin as we saw in 3 matches against Pakistan and their last match against Zimbabwe.

Event: Serie A.  Pisa vs. Lazio 3:45pm EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:  Lazio ML (+110) 1 unit

Write up:  For my first contribution we go to Serie A.  The eagles fly north to Pisa to take on the black and blues.  Since their promotion back to top flight, Pisa have been struggling.  Between injuries and scoring the club still hasn‚Äôt secured a win in their first 8 matches.  The stat that stares us in the eyes <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> is they have not scored in their first 4 home matches.  

Lazio is also struggling with some injuries but as a mid table club their current form is looking good.  Coming off a win against Juventus and a draw against Atalanta both with clean sheets, I believe they will get the job done <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.  A win <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> would propel them from 12th place to 8th and give them a whiff of the 5-7 spots.  

I see great value at +110 so I‚Äôm riding with Lazio ML.  BOL</td></tr>

Raps got destroyed on the glass but Sengun didn‚Äôt seem that interested to grab his share of opportunities. A miscue read but we press forward.

NBA | MIA Heat @ SA Spurs | 8:30PM EST

Next <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **Victor Wembanyama Over 28.5 Pts** (-108 on Fanduel) Bet 2u to Win 1.85u

Wemby averaging 31 PPG thru 4 games (40, 29, 31, 24). The 24pt outlier came in a blowout win vs Raps with limited minutes played. 75% hit rate this season so far. He‚Äôs attempting 18.3 shots per game sufficient volume to accumulate 29+ points.

After learning the Spurs have never started 5-0 in franchise history, Wemby expressed genuine shock and immediate commitment: 

*‚ÄúSpurs never went 5-0? I‚Äôm surprised‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm really surprised because the Spurs have the highest winning percentage in the last 30 years or whatever. Let‚Äôs beat that record.‚Äù* **This is a potential psychological catalyst for elevated offensive volume <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.**

Wemby (7‚Äô4‚Äù) towers over Bam Adebayo (6‚Äô9‚Äù) creating a 6+ inch height advantage. At his release point contesting shots become difficult. Backup Kel‚Äôel Ware provides even less resistance making interior scoring accessible from multiple angles.

Heat ranks 12th in defensive rating this season allowing 115.8 PPG which is serviceable but not elite. However they specifically struggle defending centers allowing 14.8 PPG at 44.1% FG to that position key matchup advantage for Wemby.

Concerns: A Blowout spurs route will reduce Wemby play time in the 4th thus making the over more challenging. However I do believe we‚Äôre more likely to see a competitive game here as Heat hold opponents to 42.4% FG (#4 in NBA) from what we‚Äôve seen so far this season.

I&#x27;ve posted here a while ago but from another acc so im starting all over <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Big ups to the other handicappers in this thread helping me make some money. To thank you all, i have a very sweet odd for you <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.

Match: Rijnsburgse Boys vs NEC Nijmegen (KNVB Beker - Dutch Cup) 

Rijnsburgse Boys over 1.5 goals @ 4.20 (Unibet) 

Amateur teams generally perform well against professional teams in cup matches, especially teams from the top half of the second division, as they have more quality than a lot of people would presume. We&#x27;ve already seen a lot of upsets this week, and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if we see a couple more tonight. Nec is playing very attacking football and so their games often see a lot of goals. They score easily, but they are vulnerable in defense. Rijnsburgse Boys, on the other hand, is one of the better teams in the second division and play at home, where they beat a couple of professional teams last season in the cup before being eliminated by Feyenoord. Since, as I said, upsets happen regularly in the dutch cup, the amount of goals that nec concedes and the success Rijnsburgse Boys had against pro teams in previous seasons, this odd is simply to good to pass up. 

Best of luck!</td></tr>

<tr><td class='post'>Record: 1-0 

Last pick: Zack LaVine 20+points/Josh Giddey U8.5 Rebounds ‚úÖ 

Recap: As expected LaVine had no issue getting to 20 finishing the game with 30, he definitely fed into the crowd welcoming him back to Chicago. Giddey finished with 8, however at one point got a rebound, missed his own shot and rebounded that. It was a very awkward play, and I think I can say had that play not happened he finishes at 5. Either way he stayed under. 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today‚Äôs Pick</mark>: AJ Green +2 Three pointers/Alexandre Sarr +12 Points (+108 DraftKings) 

Golden State vs Bucks 
Washington Wizards vs OKC Thunder 

Reasoning: 

The Bucks play at home taking on Steph Curry and the Warriors. At this point AJ Green primarily takes 3 point shots. Taking at least 5 three point attempts per game averaging 59% from the 3. If Green gets the ball expect a 3 point attempt. With Steph Curry shooting on the other side of the court I expect it to be a game of who can make more 3‚Äôs. Sarr comes into tonight‚Äôs game averaging 19.5 points. Every game he‚Äôs built off the previous performance, last night he scored 31 against a weakened Joel and grabbed 11 boards. Without Chet in the lineup tonight for OKC I expect Sarr to have a lot of looks/opportunities down low.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Alex de Minaur -2 Games (-110) ‚Äî 3.3u to win 3u

Our resident tennis sharp El Tio Sharp is just on a roll. Here‚Äôs another one from him <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>:
I like what I‚Äôve been seeing from De Minaur lately ‚Äî impressive wins over bigger hitters like Berrettini and Diallo show how well he‚Äôs handling power right now.

Even with only one title this year, Alex still boasts a 71.8% win rate and is 10‚Äì2 on indoor hard courts. To beat him, you basically have to hit him off the court, and I just don‚Äôt see Khachanov doing that <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.

Alex is well within his prime, while Karen has seen better days. You rarely find this kind of value on De Minaur given his consistency, and I‚Äôll take it 9/10 times here.

I was between a ton of picks for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> including waddle, riley patterson, and mark andrews. But I saw most of those in this thread and I think this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> is the most game script independent.

Recap: Wow, yet another nail bitter. The breath I took once Giddey was subbed out in the fourth quarter was amazing. Despite it being close, I‚Äôm still happy with the reasoning I had. There were 4 rebounds that was kind of mickey mouse, and he only have 1 rebound in the first 1.5 quarters. Either way, it‚Äôs fine.


Game: Warriors @ Bucks 8:00pm EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Giannis o51 PAR, -120, 2u -&gt; 3.67u

Reasoning: Through the start of the season Giannis has been on an absolute tear and has smashed his PAR every game. I see this game as no difference especially given the lackluster size the Warriors have, especially with Al Horford being on a minutes restriction and them playing at Fiserv Forum. I also suspect this game will be close and Giannis will have to lock in to bring the bucks over the line, feeding AJ Green and other shooters as he draws attention.</td></tr>

Kuopio and Gnistan meet again in what could turn into an open match. Both sides have shown they can produce goals when given space. In their last six head-to-head meetings, over 3.5 goals were seen in three of them, suggesting some potential for a high score. KuPS usually dominate at home, but Gnistan can surprise.

Bad offensive showing from State early, they never got into any offensive rhythm in this one unfortunately. The offense couldn‚Äôt find consistent tempo or extend drives bad showing, bad bet. 

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>**: Warriors @ Bucks over 231.5 -110 

**Wager**: 2.2u 

Given their current pace metrics, offensive efficiency, and early-season rhythm, this total looks a touch low. Expect a fast tempo, plenty of open-floor scoring, and both stars pushing the scoreboard past 231.5. 

Both teams are playing with elite pace and efficiency to start the 2025 season. Golden State‚Äôs spacing and ball movement create high shot volume, while Milwaukee‚Äôs transition offense under Giannis has them averaging well over 120 PPG at home. Neither side has looked sharp defensively, and early-season tempo tends to stay high before rotations tighten.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: NBA Orlando Magic v Charlotte Hornets

1U LaMelo Ball O6.5 1Q points @ $1.76 (-132 American), B365 

Write-Up: 
Ball has gone 5, 10, 15, 15 (3/4) this year in 4 games, averaging 9.8 minutes on the court in the first quarter, averaging 7.3 FG attempts (about half from 3 point range), shooting at a fair clip too. His 1Q FG% is 55%, 3 pt 60%. He‚Äôs starting well, has no Miller so the responsibility is his. 

Match-up wise Suggs isn‚Äôt listed on the injury report but missed the last B2B as he returns from knee surgery, so expect limited minutes. Anthony Black I think has great defensive potential but isn‚Äôt quite complete just yet and the Magic have not brought the hustle early this season as a unit. Against guard shooters this year Cunningham 30, Young 25, Maxey 43 have gone well v the Magic, not necessarily from the get go but all play different minutes to Ball so not meant to be a direct comparison, just acknowledging the match-up is there. 

Both teams are in the top 10 in the NBA for pace (according to StatsMuse &amp; nba.com site itself), so I like that Ball will get the opportunities here. The Hornets are averaging 128.3 PPG, good for 3rd in the league. 

As always, I like to raise issues that should be considered before tailing - consider 1Q bets can be flaky as a player can have a cold 3-4 minutes easily and miss an otherwise solid prop spot. I do like this spot as I think the match-up, the pace, the usage &amp; the team dynamics (Miller out still) - but it is still a 1Q prop.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Todays Pick</mark>:** Cagliari - Sassuolo¬†


**Cagliari Win**


**Odds:** $2.55


**Wager:** 3 Units


**When:** 5 hours from post


**Why:**


Cagliari should just about edge this one, emphasis on just. They‚Äôve been scrappy at home, and while they‚Äôre not exactly Serie A‚Äôs goal machines, they do grind out results when it matters. Sassuolo, on the other hand, have been flatter then a pancake on the road lately, struggling to find the net in their last couple of away matches. Historically it‚Äôs been tight, most of their head-to-heads could‚Äôve gone either way. But Cagliari‚Äôs home comfort and Sassuolo‚Äôs travel sickness tip the scale ever so slightly toward the cags favour.


So yeah, expect a cagey match where one goal could be enough. Not one for the neutrals, but if Cagliari sneak a 1-0 win, don‚Äôt say I didn‚Äôt warn you, they‚Äôve been quietly making ‚Äúugly wins‚Äù look like an art form.</td></tr>

Baltimore Ravens @ Miami Dolphins; 8:15pm EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: PARLAY, Zay Flowers O4.5 Receptions(-196) + Derrick Henry O79.5 Rushing yards (-186).

Write Up: Back again for TNF, at first glance this looks like a bit of a stretch. But with Lamar Jackson returning both the rush and pass game will be greatly improved. With the defense showing improvement last week against a HOT Bears offense who hadn‚Äôt been held under 20 points all season, I expect the Ravens to build on this momentum. The Ravens should have the ball most of the game, and they need to get the run going if they want to make the climb to contend for the division. Expect Derrick Henry to have this line easily against an abysmal Miami run defense. Zay Flowers gets a handful of schemed touches a game in screens or jet sweeps. He is undoubtedly the guy on the outside they want to get the ball to. Despite a lack of SERIOUS production, he has been able to go over 4.5 receptions all but 1 game this season.

Great value here as Zvezda is the hottest team in European basketball right now under new coach Dusko Ivanovic having won 5 straight after starting the season 0-2. They should not be given outsider odds in this game so take advantage of the line before it moves. Feeling confident about the points too as the O/U line for this game is at 173,5 points and Maccabi averages 88.1 ppg while Zvezda averages 86.1 ppg.

**Write Up:**  
Not a flashy play ‚Äî just a small builder that relies on normal Serie A football doing normal Serie A things: someone scoring a goal.



Cagliari vs Sassuolo

Sassuolo‚Äôs away games are chaos more often than not. They press high, shoot early, and leave space behind.  
Cagliari at home aren‚Äôt sitting deep either ‚Äî they attack down the wings, draw fouls around the box, and have created chances in nearly every home match this month.  
Both sides rank among the top half of Serie A for total shots per 90, and both have conceded in 8 of their last 10 fixtures.  
One goal here feels more like probability than luck.



Pisa vs Lazio

Lazio have been starting games with intensity: quick passing, early transitions, and a first goal often before the 35th minute.  
Pisa‚Äôs defense tends to bend under pressure, especially when facing pacey wide play.  
Even if Lazio rotates a few starters, their style should still produce volume ‚Äî and Pisa‚Äôs own home xG trend suggests they‚Äôll get chances of their own.  
Again, we only need one to find the net.


Summary

This isn‚Äôt about squeezing value from obscure data ‚Äî it‚Äôs about trusting patterns that repeat week after week.  
Both matches project as open enough that a single goal is statistically very likely.  
At **1.79 combined**, the price is perfectly fine for a calm, low-variance parlay.

If either ends 0-0, it‚Äôll be an xG crime scene.

Zalgiris are looking like one of the best in Euroleague and their home crowd is top notch, they should win this one.

*  Map 2 is confirmed as Inferno, picked by GentleMates, meaning GamerLegion will start on CT side, the much worse side for headshots overall, especially for AWPers
* Inferno has been a map HypeX has struggled on heavily, his previous team perma banned the map meaning he has very little comp experience on the map, he is averaging a .58 KPR on Inferno since joining GamerLegion, well below his average of .69 KPR in the L3 months
* HypeX is averaging a 42.6% headshot percentage in the last month with a .65 KPR, his current kill line map 2 is set to 14.5, given this he is expected around 6 headshots total on the map based on this total.
* On Inferno, HypeX is averaging a 36% headshot percentage, a significant decrease. it would take him an average of 19-20 kills to hit this headshot line given the overall headshot percentage + side start</td></tr>

**Summary:** Another tough pill to swallow. Sweatiest game I&#x27;ve come across with my picks so far, with 2 disallowed goals and what we can only call an emotional rollercoaster that didn&#x27;t go as planned in the end. 

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** ***Vojvodina v Crvena Zvezda BTTS:Yes @ 1.72 -- 3 units***

**Write up:**

For <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> I had a full write up on Young Boys to win done, and then I stumbled upon this match. This is a match between two of the top teams in Serbia, with Vojvodina already being a team I&#x27;ve picked to win last week. The away team from Belgrade are favorites for the title once again but have seen their opponents score a goal against them 7/11 matches so far. Vojvodina have managed to score 23 goals in 12 matches so far. I see this as a game with two well performing teams that will see a few goals. I just think this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> has a higher likelihood of hitting then BSC Young Boys to win against Grasshoppers, and because I wanted to sway away from the moneylines for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, but it was still a close choice.

Going with Collignon here. He‚Äôs been playing some of the best tennis of his career lately and looks super comfortable indoors ‚Äî already piling up wins on fast courts this season. His confidence and rhythm are obvious right now, and he‚Äôs doing a really good job being aggressive on return, especially on second serves.

Wawrinka&#x27;s a legend, but this version of him struggles to maintain intensity against younger players who bring pace and consistency. When Stan isn‚Äôt landing the first serve, the rallies get tough for him, and Collignon has the legs and timing to push him around in longer points.

Form, energy, and matchup edge all lean Collignon <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Sticking with the in-form guy over the big name.

<tr><td class='post'>**POTD Record 36-34-1**

Okay, full disclosure: my bias really got the best of me. I backed Cleveland ‚Äì4 against Boston and ended up eating humble pie. I was being a little facetious when I under-played Boston‚Äôs big guys. Holy fuck. The guys I claimed to be ‚ÄúG-League plus‚Äù players(comment I made in the last post‚Ä¶) out-rebounded one of the best frontcourts in the NBA BY 10!!! (Minott &amp; Queta). I mean, let‚Äôs just sit with that for a second. Cleveland got worked on the boards, and while I had faith in Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen, those cats out-hustled them in a way that made me pause.

I know Cleveland is talented and I love this team but I‚Äôm stepping away from betting on them for a bit. They‚Äôre playing for the playoffs, not necessarily the regular season, and I don‚Äôt want to ride hype when the book says ‚Äúwait a second.‚Äù I‚Äôve got hope for these Cavs, but I‚Äôll sit on cash until Garland, Strus and Merrill are back and the rotation‚Äôs locked in and gets into form.

Anyways, my next play, I LOVE. I‚Äôve been waiting to get on this team for a while and the line is too good to pass up.

**Bucks +2.5**

What really convinced me to pull the trigger on the Bucks +2.5 is Giannis. We all know he grabbed a ring in 2021, and yes, that title run was special. But here‚Äôs the thing since then, the big games have been few and far between. He‚Äôs played just one complete playoff series win in the last three post-seasons and the Bucks have exited early more than once even though he‚Äôs still in his athletic prime. Giannis isn‚Äôt just playing for stats anymore. He‚Äôs deeply motivated. He knows he hasn‚Äôt been in those late-May/June playoff trenches the way he used to. That hunger matters.

So yes, I‚Äôm leaning into the Bucks tonight. With +2.5 at home, a motivated superstar and a team that‚Äôs clicked early this season. I really love the addition of Turner, and bet this teams over in win totals. I also have some $ on them to win the east and the title. I in no way put them as one of my favorite teams, however how the fuck can at team with this talented of a guy be such long shots?

The matchup versus Golden State favors Milwaukee. The Bucks‚Äô frontcourt and length give them an edge vs whatever Warriors are trotting out. +2.5 is a spot. I‚Äôm getting points at home with a motivated roster. That‚Äôs a luxury. Giannis, Turner + help side = size mismatch vs Warriors‚Äô front line running thinner.

I do have to say, GSW looks good so far, and I know I did not break them down too much, as no data or eye test could discard them, or show any significant edge that Milwaukee has vs them. GSW is 1-1 on the road so far this season, winning against the Lakers on the first night of the season, and losing to Portland several days ago on the 2^(nd) night of a B2B. This play is purely a play with a team I am high on getting points at home, and with not many other games that stuck out to me.

Giannis is pissed off and dominating right now, so +2.5 is a gift when you believe you‚Äôll hang tough or outright win.

PS: I was close to taking the Magic -2.5 at Charlotte tomorrow, and still might through a smaller bet down on it. I have bet charlotte once (lost) and faded them once (won) so far in my plays, and mentioned numerous times I like them compared to vegas, but Magic cant go 1-4 to start the season after they had arguable the biggest off-season in the NBA.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Tulane OVER 417.5 Total Yards (-114 FanDuel) 
3 units

Write Up: Going to keep it relatively short here - I simply don‚Äôt believe that UTSA has a middle of the line defense as the rankings would suggest. They have had an easy schedule outside of TAMU and North Texas. Yet they still dropped games to Temple and Texas State. The Road Runners almost allowed Colorado St and Incarcerate Word to hit this line. I have not seen their ability to stop the run or pass and unfortunately for them Tulane can do both. 

UTSA does have a good enough offense to stay in this. Led by Owen McCown and Robert Henry Jr the UTSA offense has the ability to chunk big plays forcing Tulane to keep their foot on the gas.

On the other side of the ball we have the 6-1 and Tulane Green Wave. Tulane has been rolling with BYU transfer Jake Retzlaf. Jake can <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> up yards through the air or on his feet. They also have a plethora of supporting options in the backfield and the wide receiver room. Tulane has a very balanced offense which will keep the UTSA defense guessing all game leading to big yardage drives.

Tulane is 2nd in the American conference, boasting an overall record of 6-1 (3-0). They are led by the BYU QB transfer Retzlaff, who finds ways to win football games. Honestly, I had a lot of fun watching him last year - and this year he is putting up impressive numbers yet again. UTSA, not much difference on their side of the ball compared to last year. McCown is back under center and is capable of energizing a high-powered offense, especially at home. Despite their overall record and conference standing, they are at home and are capable of putting points on the board. I don&#x27;t foresee either defense making a huge impact in this game. With clear skies and cool temperatures at kickoff, I expect there to be great football weather and an exciting night.

Still ended with 6 assists in both those games and had 12 dimes in the first game of the season. He‚Äôs avg 8.3 assists per game &amp; 14.8 potentials per game and is that guy for Heat to handle the ball.

Units: 2.25 Units

Reasoning: Going with a college football and NFL two legger for this Thursday night and well be riding with the Tulane Green Wave and the Baltimore Ravens. The Ravens will be getting back quarterback Lamar Jackson this week and this team is completely different with him under center so I am not looking into their record as they were ineffective with Cooper Rush as quarterback but last week they did find a win with Tyler Huntley as quarterback. My key factor in this Thursday night showdown focuses on the rushing offense and defenses of these teams. This Ravens rush attack is 8th in rushing yards per game with 134 a contest and averaging 5.3 yards a carry while the Dolphins are 23rd in the league averaging under 100 rushing yards per game while their rush defense is 28th in the league allowing 145 rushing yards a game so I think they will have their hands full with Derrick Henry in this one. I also like Tulane to defeat UTSA as they are a well put together squad that has two wins over power five schools, Duke and Northwestern. Texas San Antonio is coming off an ass whooping against North Texas where they lost 55-17. This weakness of this Roadrunners team is their secondary and I think Green Wave wide receivers Shazz Preston who averages 16 yards a reception and Omari Hayes will exploit this UTSA defense. Also quarterback Jake Retzlaff is dangerous on the ground and in the air as he has 1428 passing yards, a 6:1 touchdown to interception ratio and he averages 6.5 yards a carry and 8 rushing touchdowns to go along with that.

Prediction: 30-24 Tulane, 27-19 Ravens

The Warriors have struggled against forwards because they simply don‚Äôt have size or strength to keep up with them. Giannis is in fantastic form and is over this line in all four games this season (45, 54, 51 and 51), including against more physical teams like Cleveland and the Knicks. I just can‚Äôt see a way for the Warriors to stop him with Draymond and Horford, and he should be able to get to the basket and the FT line at will, especially as the Bucks have an effective cast of guys to space the floor.

I really wanted to hammer this as a trap game but even though I have seen a spark from Miami I worry that Lamar and Zay both from Florida are going to play this game harder for all the family and friends that will be there. Zay flowers without Lamar was able to go over 50 yds in every game without Jackson and so I feel safe with Lamar or heck Cooper throwing to him. As for Achane, Miami has really made him their number 1 especially with Hill out. He did good against two defenses that are able to stop the run including the falcons and browns and so I feel comfortable with him getting 40 yds.  Achane last game vs Falcons 67 yds rushing and 82 yds vs Cleveland despite Miami being blown out. So even if ravens do start pouring it on Miami will still be running through Achane. He has the 8th most rushing yds so far. Zay Flowers also has the 16th most receiving yards despite a transition in quarterbacks. I like both these players and have also noticed that Thursday games have been high scoring every week except for one game which was still over 30 points which isn‚Äôt a bad score either.

Brisbane have managed a 1-0 win at home against strugglers MacArthur and lost 2-1 to Wellington in NZ. Tbh I don‚Äôt see any of these teams making the finals.

Perth drew with Wellington the first game of the season so read into that form what you will. I‚Äôd probably take every City starting player if you match them up against Brisbane other than O Shea.

Melbourne have enjoyed a draw away from home and smoked Perth 4-0 in theiir last game, showing they were a class above.

Brisbane have managed under 40% of possession in both games and this will be no different.

Max Caputo is in scintillating form after reconnecting with the squad after the under 20‚Äôs World Cup. He has 6 goals in his last 4 games for Club and Country and with a maturing Mathew Leckie (former Bundesliga player) dominating the midfield, they are looking good for another push for the title.

Gnistan have struggled since the league split into the championship group, going 0-1-6.¬†

Leg 1 - Eala has been in really bad form, losing 4 of her last 5, with the only win being a walkover retirement win in round 1. Mboko has looked sharp in the past few matches, winning 3 of her last 4, with that loss being to the wrecking ball Rybakina. Both young rising stars, but Mboko is better and should win.

Leg 2 - Baltimore gets torched through the air by wide receivers. Washington has cleared 20 yards in 3 straight, 30 in 2 straight, and his overall involvement has been climbing. With Tua looking great last week and Lamar returning, this should be a high scoring, competitive game. Dude will probably cash this on 1 catch vs the Ravens.</td></tr>

**Verona - Milano** üèê Italy - Superlega UTC 19:30

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **Verona -1.5 Set Handicap** @ 1.55 Betsson

Verona has made a flawless start to the 2025-2026 season. Winning both of its first two matches, they share the top spot with reigning champions Trentino with 6 points. The team demonstrated its fitness by defeating Piacenza 3-1 in the first week and Grottazzolina 3-0 away in the second. One of the key factors behind this success is the appointment of **Fabio Soli**, the coach who won the championship with Trentino last season. Under Soli&#x27;s leadership, Verona has built a squad that blends experience and youth. The signing of American **Micah Christenson**, considered one of the best passers in the world, has taken the team&#x27;s playing style to a whole new level. At the opposite end, they feature 23-year-old Brazilian talent Darlan Souza, while the remaining outside hitters include Rok Mozic and Noumory Keita. This squad structure clearly demonstrates that Verona is aiming for the top spot this season, not just the playoffs.

Milano, on the other hand, started the season with mixed emotions. They showed &quot;solidity and character&quot; by beating Modena in their opening match, but suffered a hard-fought 3-1 defeat against Piacenza in the second week. After this defeat, they are looking at the away game against Verona as a &quot;redemption&quot; match. Milano&#x27;s biggest asset is undoubtedly their Belgian captain, Ferre Reggers, currently the league&#x27;s top scorer. Reggers has scored a staggering 55 points in two matches, averaging an incredible 6.11 per set. His 27 points in the last match against Piacenza alone demonstrates his vital role for the team. Milano will aim to capitalize on Reggers&#x27; exceptional performance and return from their challenging away game against Verona with a point or points.

While Milano may have a scoring machine like Ferre Reggers, Verona appears to have a more balanced squad. Christenson&#x27;s passing ability and ability to effectively utilize multiple scoring options like Darlan, Mozic, and Keita will make things difficult for Milan&#x27;s defense. My <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> is Verona, given their chemistry with their new coach and world-class passer Christenson. I predict a 3-1 result.</td></tr>

*The Ravens‚Äô WR table shows they‚Äôre stingy on yardage but will concede volume underneath; multiple WRs (Odunze, Zaccheaus, Kirk) hit their reception lines.*

*Waddle leads the team in targets per route and yards per route vs Cover-1 and Cover-3, with a mid-teens aDOT that pairs with Miami‚Äôs quick RPO/crosser game.*

*With Tyreek out, Waddle‚Äôs career splits jump to \~6.2 catches and \~70 yards per game, clearing 5+ receptions in \~67% of those games.*

*In his last game against the Ravens two year ago, Waddle came down with 11 receptions off of 19 targets. Easily the most on the season by a mile and Tyreek Hill was also on the field during that game.*

*On the defense side, the Ravens are top-tier in Cover-1/3 usage and tilt throws outside more than to the slot (Wide Tgt % &gt; Slot Tgt %), which favors Waddle‚Äôs perimeter snaps.*

*Even if Baltimore limits explosives, those looks force Tua to the underneath/out-breaking answers that feed Waddle.*

*With a spread greatly favoring the Ravens (+/-7.5) and the 4th highest game total of the week (+/- 50), expect the Dolphins to throw to their #1 option early and often as they attempt to stay in this game.*</td></tr>

__Event:__ NFL: Ravens @ Dolphins 8:15pm EST

__POTD:__ Jaylen Waddle o62.5 rec yards (-115), 3.75u to win 3.26

__Write Up:__ A couple of struggling AFC teams kick off Week 9 of the NFL as the (2-5) Baltimore Ravens travel to South Beach to take on the (2-5) Miami Dolphins on Thursday Night Football. Baltimore snapped a 4 game losing streak as they took down the Bears 30-16 at home on Sunday. This week they get back star QB Lamar Jackson who has been out since Week 5 with a hamstring injury. As for the Dolphins they destroyed my Atlanta Falcons on Sunday 34-10 after losing their 3 previous games. Their offense was rocking, which was much needed as it started to get scary in Miami.

Miami lost star WR Tyreek Hill for the season after his knee exploded in Week 4. WR2 Jaylen Waddle stepped into the WR1 role, &amp; he has absolutely dominated. Waddle had a huge game last week, catching 5 of 6 targets for 99 yards &amp; a TD. He had a 43 yard TD which he had 30+ yards after the catch. He had the 3rd highest air yard share Jaylen Waddle, 73% air yards share in Week 8. __Since Hill‚Äôs injury, Waddle has had at least 95 yards in 3 of those 4 games.__ Excluding the game against the Browns (horrible weather), he has been on fire:

24% target share

101 yards/game

4.1 YPRR

31% first read

He has had a huge amount of air yards as of late. __He leads all wide receivers in share of air yards (53%). Waddle has had receptions of 46, 45, &amp; 43 yards in those games. In his last 11 games without Tyreek, Waddle has 70 catches, 919 yards &amp; 7 TDs for an average of 6.4 rec &amp; 84.5 yards. He&#x27;s also averaging 8.4 targets/game &amp; he&#x27;s scored in 7 of those 11 games.__ His Yards After Catch has been insane. __Waddle is averaging 9.9 YAC, most in the NFL.__ He runs 10 yard slants &amp; just takes off at lightning speed. __He was clocked last week at 21.35 mph on his 43 yard TD, 3rd fastest speed in Week 8. He has averaged 16.8 yards per reception (268 yards/16 catches) since Week 4, 6th best of 41 qualified NFL WRs (League Avg: 12.7.)__ Now, Waddle gets his easiest matchup since Tyreek went down. 

The Ravens have had a really bad defense so far this season. __Baltimore ranks 30th in the NFL in EPA/Play allowed (0.148). Their pass defense has been poor ranking 28th in EPA/Dropback allowed (0.21) &amp; they have the 6th worst Dropback success rate allowed. Baltimore ranks 31st in turnover margin (-6).__ Last week the Ravens got torched by a pair of Bears WR‚Äôs. __Rome Odunze had 7 catches for 114 yards, DJ Moore had 73 yards on 4 catches. Both going over Waddle‚Äôs receiving line this week.__ But wasn‚Äôt the first occurrence of WR‚Äôs doing well vs the Ravens. __Baltimore has been getting lit up by WR‚Äôs all season, allowing the 3rd most receptions per game (14), the 9th most receiving yards per game (159), the 8th most yards per target (9.0), &amp; the 3rd most TD‚Äôs (10).__

The biggest reason their defense isn‚Äôt doing well is because QB‚Äôs are getting tons of time in the pocket. Baltimore has has a tough time generating pressure. __The Ravens rank 29th in pressure rate (27.1%).__ A key change they have made over the past 2 weeks to help with pressure is they are now deploying 3 safeties as part of their base defense. They are using Kyle Hamilton as a Swiss Army knife alongside Alohi Gilman &amp; rookie Malaki Starks. Hamilton has been all over the field. He played 18 snaps in the box on Sunday, playing linebacker on 19 snaps. He played another 24 snaps at slot corner &amp; 2 snaps out wide at corner. Hamilton rushed the passer on a season high 8 snaps. This was all to fix their pressure issues. But doing created a lot of space out wide for Bears receivers as evident by Odunze &amp; Moore‚Äôs stats. The Dolphins Defensive Coordinator Anthony Weaver actually came from the Ravens last year. He &amp; Ravens Defensive Coordinator Zach Orr coached together as assistants, so Weaver will know Orr‚Äôs gameplan &amp; schemes very well. As bad as Tua‚Äôs been this season, the Dolphins are going to actually be able to pass on this weak pass defense. But Tua wasn‚Äôt that bad this past Sunday.

Tuaturndaballova bounced back from a nightmare outing in Week 7, connecting on 20 of 26 passes (76.9%) for 205 yards (7.9 Y/A) &amp; a season high 4 TD‚Äôs Sunday in Atlanta. Now Tua gets to go back to Miami off a good game, &amp; he is a much better QB at home. Tua‚Äôs biggest thing is he is a first read guy. He focuses on that read &amp; struggles if he has to make a 2nd read. __Tagovailoa is averaging 8.3 yards per pass attempt on his first read throws compared to 6.4 yards per pass when he is moved off his first look.__ This is why Tyreek Hill had so many big games. Now Waddle is his 1st read guy. __Since Hill‚Äôs injury Waddle has been targeted as the 1st read on 31% of Tua‚Äôs dropbacks.__ But it‚Äôs not all Tua‚Äôs fault, Miami has one of the worst offensive line‚Äôs in the league. Their line has been so bad added a 6th offensive lineman last week, &amp; it actually worked. This shouldn‚Äôt be an issue this week vs a Ravens DLine that has had trouble pressuring QB‚Äôs. The Ravens may have had defensive issues, but Miami has had just as much. 

Miami has had major defensive troubles. __The Dolphins are currently 27th in the NFL in EPA per play allowed (0.114).__ They also have had trouble getting to the QB. __Miami ranks just 22nd in pressure rate (33.7%) even though they blitz at the 5th highest rate (33.1%). Only 40% of their blitzes generate pressure (22nd). When Miami has failed to get pressure, they have allowed a 79.3% completion percentage, worst in the league. Even when the Dolphins have gotten pressure, they have allowed a 58.3% completion percentage (30th) &amp; 7.5 yards per pass (31st).__ That‚Äôs going to be a problem vs the Ravens offense now that Lamar is back. Jackson‚Äôs return is a significant boost for the offense. __Baltimore was averaging 6.5 yards per play (best in NFL) when Lamar was on the field at the start of the season. Without Lamar they avg just 5.1 yards per play (24th in NFL).__ He is coming into the game with a hamstring injury, but if he doesn‚Äôt have any restrictions he‚Äôs going to run all over them. __The Dolphins have allowed a league high 4 rushing TD‚Äôs to QB‚Äôs &amp; 180 rushing yards on the season.__ The Ravens are going to score a lot of points this game. As bad as the vibes are surrounding Miami in bulk, they have found a way to score 21+ points in 6 of their last 7 games, with that performance in the rain in Cleveland being the exception. It‚Äôs also worth noting that the Over is 26-6 since 1983 in games with totals of 49.5 or higher involving a team that has lost 4 or 5 of its last 6 games &amp; 2 teams with winning percentages between 25% &amp; 40%. The average total points scored in that betting system is 60.8 points per game.

With the Ravens favored by 7.5 points, Miami should be trailing, which means a pass heavy game script, &amp; plenty of chances for Waddle to break one deep.

**Marshal @ Coastal Carolina 19:30 EST**

**Ravens @ Dolphins 20:15 EST**

All my picks so far have been exactly +200 odds. I‚Äôll continue to share plus odds picks that I‚Äôm confident in, as I have the most success with this method, and it‚Äôs going well so far on here. This one is a bit lower at +162.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

**Malik Washington 25+ receiving yards (-136) write up**

Washington‚Äôs role has expanded in recent weeks, clearing 30 receiving yards in each of his last two games while his snap share has surged from 44% three weeks ago to 64% and 62% in the past two.

Last week: 4/5 for 36 yards. Prior: 5/8 for 30. Trend‚Äôs clear ‚Äî more targets, more opportunity.

Baltimore is not good vs the pass and has a problem with slot receivers in particular‚Äîwhich I‚Äôll expand on more.

Marlon Humphrey was once a great cornerback. Just last year he was elite. He was a feisty lockdown corner that could shadow top receivers and hang with the best of them. A Gandalf corner as I like to call them: ‚ÄúTHOU SHALT NOT PASS!‚Äù

Nowadays, he‚Äôs more like Santa, and Malik Washington might be the primary beneficiary of his generosity tomorrow. 

He plays 63% of snaps as the scb. While he is ‚Äúonly‚Äù targeted on 17.8% of routes run, which is high, but not egregious, he is at the bottom of the barrel statistically in most of the productivity coverage stats. He gives up a lot of production. The stats don‚Äôt lie, this year has been a major regression season.

He‚Äôs allowing 52 ypg, 9.8 YPT, and ranks bottom-10 in most coverage stats (PFF grade 45.4, #109/113). 

Washington runs 52% of routes from the slot, so he‚Äôll see plenty of Humphrey.

The rest of the Ravens corners and secondary as a whole are nothing to write home about either. They‚Äôre the 2nd worst defense against WRs in terms of fantasy points allowed and they give up the 9th most yards to WRs.

Notable primary slot Wide Receiver lines against the Ravens:

Amon-Ra St. Brown - 7 / 77/ 1 (pre-game O/U 72.5) ‚úÖ

Khalil Shakir - 6 / 64 (pre-game O/U 47.5) ‚úÖ

Christian Kirk -  4 / 64 yards (pre-game O/U 36.5) ‚úÖ

DJ Moore - 4 / 73 (pre-game O/U 42.5) ‚úÖ

JuJu Smith-Schuster - 4 / 36 / 1 (pre-game O/U 14.5) ‚úÖ

Jordan Whittington - 3 /23 (pre-game O/U 12.5) ‚úÖ

That‚Äôs a clear rate in 6/7 games. I couldn‚Äôt find exactly who the primary was for the Browns so it could be 7/7.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

**Marshall -2.5 @ Coastal (-194) write up**

I don‚Äôt bet CFB often, but I stumbled across this game while browsing the ESPN app looking for my next victim, and it jumped out. Right off the bat, just looking at the previous games for both teams, Marshall seems to have much more impressive results despite both being 4-3. 

For instance, they beat Old Dominon 48-24 two weeks ago, and Coastal Carolina got absolutely dog walked, 47-7, by Old Dominion the week before that. Maybe the Old Dominion players partied all week, drunk off their victory against CCU, and got smashed by Marshall because of that, but more likely it‚Äôs a sign that Marshall is a cut or two above Coastal, I would think.

Looking at the stats of the QB for Marshall: Carlos Del Rio-Wilson, he looks really good. 1,131 yards passing with 12/1 TD/INT and a team high 347 yards rushing with 4 TDs. He‚Äôs a transfer and didn‚Äôt even start the first game of the season too.

Coastal Carolina has had some major quarterback problems this season. They benched their starter in week 2 after he threw 3 picks and then benched their replacement quarterback last week after he filled in with 447 passing yards and 3/3 TD/INT since then. Their latest quarterback, Samari Collier, will start this game. Maybe the third time‚Äôs the charm. 

He had a pretty good debut start in their win last week vs Appalachian state, but this guy‚Äôs a senior, 2 year JUCO transfer, who‚Äôs mobile but very much unproven.

Marshall‚Äôs QB Del Rio-Wilson is elite through the air and elite on the ground. He didn‚Äôt have a single interception until last game, and he‚Äôs averaging 293 total yards and 3.2 TDs per game since becoming the starter.

Big advantage for the Thundering Herd.

Marshall‚Äôs top wide receiver, Demarcus Lacey, has 35 / 484 / 4 on the year. Coastal‚Äôs top WR has 19/158. Lacey has more yards receiving than any of Coastal‚Äôs quarterbacks have passing.

Pretty primitive analysis, but compelling to me nonetheless. I don‚Äôt think home field advantage will make up for the deficit in quality between these two teams. My gut tells me Marshall will win on the road here and maybe stomp them. 

Teased down from -6.5 to -2.5 for extra safety, as Marshall has had 2 of their last 3 games decided by exactly 3 points (both in 2OT). They‚Äôve had 12 days off since their last game though, and will be well rested and ready to lay a beatdown on their enemy.

My <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> is combining these two alts to fit with my high odds strategy, but you can of course <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> to just tail one or the other, and the standard lines for both picks also seem good to me.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Rinky Hijikata vs Mats Rosenkranz | **Hijikata ML at -153 (DK). 1 unit.**

Write-up: The odds movement before the match was pretty wild, as things even swung in Clarke&#x27;s favor at one point. However, Dietrich closed at around +110 and played a very strong match. 

For <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, I&#x27;m sticking with Charlottesville and going with Rinky Hijikata to defeat Mats Rosenkranz in the second round. Hijikata is one of those guys who never really looks to be dominating his opponent, but always manages to score enough wins throughout the season to stay in the Grand Slam main draw range. He tends to perform fairly well indoors, as a strong net game makes up for a lackluster serve and fairly standard baseline game. His first-round match against clay-courter Matias Soto was tougher than expected, but he actually didn&#x27;t play badly, earning a 7.04 performance rating.

Meanwhile, Mats Rosenkranz has a more traditional indoor game - he&#x27;s a big lefty server that likes to take it to his opponent in rallies. However, he doesn&#x27;t really have the same consistency from the ground as Hijikata, and I feel that his approaches to the net can be a bit too lumbering when facing a speedster like Rinky. He got a decent first-round win over Andres Martin, but I still don&#x27;t feel that he&#x27;s in quite the same weight class as Hijikata. Looking at some common matchups, they both played Patrick Kypson indoors recently; Hijikata closed at around even money, while Rosenkranz was a 3.10 underdog. Rosenkranz was also priced similarly to this match in the first round against Martin, but I don&#x27;t feel that Andres is at the same level as Hijikata, as he&#x27;s more of an outdoor player and hasn&#x27;t scored any big wins recently. Teelo&#x27;s model supports the idea that there&#x27;s a gap in form between these two players, as it gives Rinky a 70.3% chance of winning this one (60.47% implied). 

Overall, I think Hijikata should be a bigger favorite here. This won&#x27;t be pretty, but he&#x27;s the more consistent player by far, and I simply see a bit of a level gap here. Some books have a worse price on this, but I would take it down to around -165.

should&#x27;ve taken it when it was o21.5 yesterday oh well

**Writeup:** Its been a while since Likely and Lamar have both been healthy and playing together. Last time it happened was week 4 for a whole 2.5 quarters until Lamar was taken out of the game. Now Likely did get 0 receptions that game but as mentioned, Lamar was not in the whole time and it was Likely&#x27;s first game back from  a fractured foot from over the summertime.

As Tyler Huntley clearly does not care much for Likely given he has 26 yards from 5 receptions over the 3 games they&#x27;ve played together, we&#x27;ll be looking at 2024 stats. Leaving out playoffs (which would make all these stats better mind you), Likely has been average 3.5 targets with 2.6 receptions, 29.8 receiving yards, and 11.4 Yards Per Reception per game. It&#x27;s clear that he&#x27;s got some good chemistry with Lamar.

Another aspect I want to look at is offensive snap share percentages. Aside from week 4 (where he played 45% of all snaps) and week 7 where I could not find data, Likely has played over 50% of the offensive snaps in each game.

Now let&#x27;s look at the Dolphins. They&#x27;ve given up the most fantasy points to Tight Ends this season. Opposing TEs have an average of just under 11 yards per reception (450 yards from 41 receptions). Dolphins also play zone nearly 70% of the time vs man, which Likely seemed to do better in last year. All these factors add up to what should be an explosive game to get Likely really going this season

&gt; **Write Up:** This <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> is from my soccer model that I&#x27;ve been using for the past two years. It assigns ELO ratings to players and projects a win chance based on the combined ELO ratings of the players on each team. TeamReddit is projecting a 62% win chance here which creates value here on the ML.</td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>

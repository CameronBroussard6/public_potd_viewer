**Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** [❌ Wendell Carter Jr o8.5 Rebounds -110](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/comments/1q525zw/comment/ny17au7/?context=3)

What a nasty way to end our streak. Professional malpractice by the Magic coach to pull all starters 5 minutes into the 2nd half and never put them back in a close game. Let&#x27;s get it back:

**🏀 Trey Murphy III o19.5 Points -122** vs the Atlanta Hawks

Fresh off a 42pt game last night vs the Lakers. Murphy&#x27;s usage is insane these days on the Pelicans.

In his last 5, he&#x27;s averaging 17.6 FG attempts a game over 37.2 minutes, making 50% of them for 25.8 PPG. Against the Hawks, he&#x27;s averaged 20.3 points over 3 games at 32.7 minutes.

Hawks in general lately have had an atrocious defense. They&#x27;re ranked 28th in the NBA in Points allowed to SFs and 27th overall in defensive rating. Trae Young is questionable to play so if he does, expect their defense to drop even more significantly.

The pace in this game is ridiculous. Hawks are the fastest paced team in the NBA, Pelicans are 3rd. Books have priced this game at a 247 over/under. Expecting points at a surplus.

Lastly, I&#x27;d say we do need to account for tiredness after playing 39 min last night but his rest splits show pretty decently that his points totals don&#x27;t fall off on B2Bs. Limited travel from New Orleans to Atlanta as well.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:: **Kacper Adamus ML** vs Lukasz Bernacki (-167)

Table Tennis // TT Elite Series // 12:30pm EST 

Kacper is 6-2 over his last 8 games and looks to face a guy who is on a bit of a fluke streak, going for 3 straight after being 1-4 beforehand. I think Kacper&#x27;s serve takes Bernacki out as he&#x27;s been failing on a lot of first serves, and I expect this to go very quickly given Bernacki is coming off a recent 5 set game where he gave up 9 points every game.

edit: for reference this is a tournament where they play multiple games per day, Adamus is playing Grzegorz Jurowicz in about 20 minutes which is not the game i&#x27;m referring to (per rules, sorry)</td></tr>

6/6 H2H, flawless H2H, Intanon is clearly better than Blichfeldt, past H2H, Intanon might be slightly better than now, but so is Blichfeldt, but Intanon definitely still has it in her, being ranked 7. Blichfeldt has slid to rank 20. Blichfeldt just won the first round by a razor thin margin, whereas Intanon cruised through. Mainly playing this due to the flawless H2H and difference in ranking, only downside is last match was in 2023.

Write up: Creighton is coming off a very frustrating loss against the Seton Hall Pirates. Coach Mac is known to bounce back and will make sure his guys come out ready to play. Nova is a talented squad but Creighton has experience and phenomenal coaching. On top of that this feels like a key point in the season and can dictate a lot moving forward. I trust the pedigree of coach Mac to have the Bluejays ready to go to at least keep it super close and maybe even steal the game. Sprinkle Creighton ML if you feel ballsy. If not ride the spread.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: **Belmont U31.5 1H points (FanDuel) 1U**

Event: CBB | Belmont @ Northern Iowa (7 pm EST) | 🏀

*Recap: It&#x27;s better to be lucky than good. Nembhard cleared his assists line early in the third quarter, but he needed one single free throw in the final \~15 seconds to clear his PA line. What a sweat! The Pacers fought the good fight, but couldn&#x27;t avoid a franchise-record 13th consecutive loss. In the meantime, Nembhard has found another gear dishing the rock, despite Mathurin not playing. I&#x27;m surprised he took so few shots, especially in the first half. But Indiana led for big stretches of the game, and he only looked to score when Cleveland started pulling ahead late.*

Before I begin, know this. I am *absolutely* pressing my luck with this bet. But after a 5-0 start to my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> experiment, I believe I&#x27;ve earned a little leeway to do something dumb. Tail at your own risk. That said... One of my favorite bets the last year or two was taking the first-half under for teams playing against the Houston Cougars. This year, that trendy <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> seems to be Northern Iowa (12-3). They&#x27;re 11-3 to the under this year, and they&#x27;ve held opponents under first-half scoring projections in four of their last five games. UNI is allowing a paltry 28.1 first-half points this season. And why is that? Put simply, Northern Iowa is the poster child for taking the air out of the ball. Their adjusted tempo ranks 362nd out of 365 teams, and KenPom ranks UNI&#x27;s defense 13th in all the land, right behind Kansas, Gonzaga, and Duke. The Panthers make you work deep into your shot clock and they grind out their own offensive possessions. Furthermore, Northern Iowa holds opponents to 24 percent from beyond the arc. If we think of first-half scoring outbursts coming from transition 3s and racking up possessions, UNI simply doesn&#x27;t allow either. Full stop.

Belmont (13-3) is already second-half team, and it&#x27;s not even close. They average 8.9 more points in the second half than the first. Good coaching and adjustments, I guess. Here&#x27;s the thing: Belmont does average 36.9 first-half points, but Southern Illinois (KenPom 79th defense) held them to 22 points just three days ago. Lipscomb (KenPom 132nd defense) held them to 25 points on Nov. 19. The question becomes: Can Belmont score 32+ points against an incredibly-stingy, top-shelf defense *on the road(!)*? I say no. And not for nothing, but Northern Iowa has won its last four against Belmont.

**EDIT @ 1145 a.m. EST:** I just noticed that Belmont starting guard Nic McClain is listed as a game-time-decision. That&#x27;s huge if he doesn&#x27;t play. He is *the* ball-handler for the Bruins, averaging 6.3 assists per game to go with 10.4 points. No one else on the team averages two assists. If he&#x27;s confirmed out, I suspect this line will drop.

Good luck and Godspeed!</td></tr>

**Game: Burnley vs Man United | Premier League | 8.15PM GMT**  
**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Man United to win - 1.74 @ Matchbook - 1u**

**Reasoning:**  
Amorim is out (Man United&#x27;s manager) so I expect the usual *&quot;new manager bounce/effect&quot;* to kick in for the away side. Historically and objectively a way stronger team that has had a turbulent few months (years lol). Their away form is not too bad with 2-2-1 in their last five, and they are up against a Burnley side who has 2 draws and 9 losses in their last 11 games. 

Obviously I&#x27;m punting on a team that hasn&#x27;t been reliable, but historically the new manager bounce is a true thing. Combined with their decent away form and their match-up against one of the weakest teams in the Premier League, I&#x27;m counting on Man United and their interim manager Darren Fletcher (Man United legend) to bring this home. 

Vamoooos🙏</td></tr>

**NHL - San Jose @ Los Angeles, 10:30 PM ET**

***o5.5 Total Goals (-163) 2u***

We head back to the ice for a late game that should be flooded with goals, as the Kings host the Sharks.

These two teams hold the West wild card spots right now, and they’ve done it with the net flooded as of late. **These two hold some of the longest over streaks in the NHL**, and we are hoping that continues with a ***2 unit bet***.

The Kings have **covered this line in 5 straight scoring 20 and conceding 17 in that span**. On the Sharks end of things, **10 games in a row have covered this total, scoring 42 and giving up 43**. Even in scaling down to the last 5 games, the Sharks have had **42 total goals** in those games.

Head to head tells the exact same story: **Goals**. This total has **covered in 5 straight**, but we can stretch it back to a 10 game benchmark for a trend here: **At least 5 goals have been scored in 9/10, 6 goals (cover) in 7 of those games, and 7 goals in 5 of them - which includes 4 of the last 5 and last 4 in a row - Goals.**

3 goals each gets us there, **SJ is 5/5, LA 4/5** - I’ll take the 5.5 as opposed to pushing for 7 incase someone goes anemic. If you feel like there will be more goals, *6.5 is + money on most books at the moment - which is why I don’t fully trust it*.

*Last play review:*

**Kent State -1.5 (-120) 1.5u** ✅

There are several interesting opportunities in this game imo, but I&#x27;m locking in **Issa Diop to get at least one foul**. He has not been a regular for Fulham in the past few months but has had to step up due to both injuries and AFCON, and played his first 90 min in a while last game against Liverpool and picked up 1 fould. Diop has fouled at least once in all of his PL appearances this season where he has played at least 20+ min. Last time two games he personally faced Chelsea has resulted in at least one foul (1 &amp; 2) 

For comparison, the odds on this is -525 at BetMGM which is criminally low, but again tells a story that there is value on this play.

**Previous:**  Manchester City ML vs Chelsea &amp; Bengals ML vs Browns - LOSS

**Recap:**  What seemed like the easy path to a victory resulted in anything but one for many folks myself included.  The <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> results were a sea of red regardless.  Just look at the tracker  [Jan 4 <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> Tracker](https://www.<mark style='background:#fff59d'>potd</mark>.lol/date/2026-01-04) .  Man City was winning and with a bit of carelessness allowed Chelsea a goal in the 94^(th) minute, to end 1-1.  We were toast at that point, but to add insult to injury, the hapless Browns beat the Bengals outright.  Just wasn’t my day.

**New Event:**  EPL – Manchester City vs Brighton &amp; Barcelona vs Athletic Bilbao

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:**  Manchester City ML (1.48) &amp; Barcelona ML (1.45) @ 2.15 (Usual 3 units)

**Leg 1 – Man City to win vs Brighton**

In Pep Guardiola we trust.  Love him or hate him, but there is no denying he is one of the most brilliant  coaches ever and he will surely not allow his players to make the same mistake twice.  Allowing a last minute goal due to hubris and unnecessary carelessness is not a trait that he will support.  The look on the players faces when the match ended was not so much one of “oh well, too bad”, it was more like “oh sh\*\*, we are going to get it from Pep”.  I will double down on this team <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> for many reasons.

* Currently in 2^(nd) place and just 6 points behind league leaders Arsenal, City can ill afford any more mishaps if they want to contend for the league title, which they clearly do. 
* Fun fact, City have won their last 22 Premier League matches that fall on the third Wednesday of the month.
* City are unbeaten in all 15 of their previous home league games against Brighton.  The most against any opponent on their home turf without losing.
* City’s defensive issues have taken a hit as both Dias and Guardiol were injured in the last match and will be out for weeks.  However, a talented pair in Ake and Khusanov will be filling those spots.
* This match will most likely be a case of Brighton looking to counterattack while City maintain possession and dominance as usual.  City will need to capitalize on their opportunities with Haaland up front .

**Leg 2 : Barcelona to win vs Athletic Bilbao (AB)**

Barcelona face AB in the semifinals of the Spanish Super Cup, a tournament they have won no less than 15 times.  The Catalan’s (Barcelona for those unfamiliar with the term) sit atop of their domestic league 4 points ahead of Real Madrid, which allows them some breathing room to go after this particular silverware. 

Some bulletpoints:

* Barcelona has not lost a match since October.
* AB has lost the last 6 times they played in Barcelona, the most recent in November 2025 by a margin of 4-0. 
* AB are struggling with form this season coming off a 1-1 draw against 12^(th) place Osasuna this past weekend and sitting in 28^(th) place in the Champions League Tournament.
* AB are 8^(th) in the Spanish League table, 25 points behind the leaders but only 8 points from the bottom relegation danger zone. 
* Barcelona are in top form with only 2 players Christensen and Gavi out due to injury.  Raphinha, Pedri and Lamine Yamal should have a field day up front.
* AB have 6 players out due to injury or suspension. 

Trying to surprise and beat Barcelona with the Williams brothers may seem nice, but is most certainly not a top priority for the Club at the moment.  Getting healthy, surviving La Liga and making a deep run at Copa del Rey is far more important for them.  They can ill afford more injuries as their squad is getting depleted.

This is an important home match for Barcelona to put them closer to the finals.  Little to no rotation has been announced.  No reason they should not win with their starting squad on the field and the talent pool they possess.  Just in case though, on the bench sit Marcus Rashford, Marc Casado and Fermin Lopez. </td></tr>

Torino - Udinese ⚽ Italy - Serie A UTC: 19.45

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Udinese Fouls Over (12.5) @ 1.75

The clearest argument supporting the &quot;Udinese over 12.5 fouls&quot; option is that Udinese has shifted to a more &quot;reactive/contactful&quot; style of play this season, especially away from home, increasing their foul count: averaging around 14 fouls per game on the road naturally makes the 12.5 mark achievable. Udinese appears to have committed 253 fouls in 18 Serie A games this season, averaging approximately 14.1 fouls per game. Against teams like Torino, who favor tackling and frequently play aggressively in midfield, Udinese&#x27;s need for defensive actions and tactical fouls aimed at &quot;stopping the transition&quot; increases; these types of fouls become even more frequent when the score remains level for a long time (0-0, 1-1, one-goal difference). Furthermore, referee Maresca has a high foul standard, averaging 26.63 fouls per game in his Serie A career.

League: Premier League  
Kick-Off: 21:15 CET  
Game: Burnley v Man Utd  
***Man Utd -0.75 @ 1.925***

Reasoning: Man United come into this game in much better form despite the sacking of their manager. Burnley have struggled against teams that press high and control possession, and that’s exactly where United are strongest right now in my opinion. I expect United to dominate the tempo, create more clear chances, and eventually break Burnley down. With the quality gap and current momentum, a one goal win looks very realistic, and there’s strong value on them to cover the -0.75 line if they push for a second late in the game.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Houston Rockets vs. Portland Trail Blazers — OVER 225 Total Points (-110)

Reasoning:
This play leans into the &quot;Usage Vacuum&quot; and &quot;Identity Shift&quot; we’ve been tracking. Houston is missing their primary defensive anchor and half-court engine (Alperen Sengun), while Portland&#x27;s defense has been a total sieve lately. When two teams play with questionable interior defense and high-volume offensive rebounders, the game naturally speeds up, creating more &quot;easy&quot; scoring opportunities.

Scenario A: The &quot;Sengun-less&quot; Track Meet
Without Sengun to dump the ball to in the post, Houston’s pace is forced to increase. They shift from a &quot;grind&quot; team to a transition-heavy team. Since Portland ranks 28th in transition defense, Houston will get a high volume of layups and dunks before the defense can set up, pushing the score over early.

Scenario B: The Clingan Rebound Feast
As you predicted, Donovan Clingan is a monster on the glass (17 boards last game). Without Sengun or Steven Adams to box him out, Clingan will create a massive amount of &quot;Second Chance Points.&quot; Put-backs are the fastest way to kill an &quot;Under&quot; because they occur in less than 3 seconds of shot-clock time.

Scenario C: Portland’s Home Hot Streak
Portland is averaging 137 points in their last home outing and has hit the Over in 54% of their games this season. With Deni Avdija and Shaedon Sharpe both scoring near 30 recently, they have the perimeter firepower to exploit a Rockets team that is currently allowing 40% from three over the last two weeks.

Scenario D: The White Flag 🏳️
The only danger here is a Houston Shooting Drought. If the Rockets miss their threes and can&#x27;t get out in transition, the game could stall. However, Portland’s defense is so poor (giving up 119.6 PPG) that even a &quot;bad&quot; Houston shooting night should still see them flirting with 110+ points.

Scenario Proof:
 Efficiency Gap: Expert models project this game at 233.4 total points, giving us nearly a 9-point cushion over the current 224.5 line.

 Trend Logic: Portland has hit the Over in 20 of 37 games this season, and Houston&#x27;s defensive rating has dropped significantly since Sengun&#x27;s injury.

 Stat Correlation: Houston is the #1 rebounding team, and Portland is a top-10 pace team when playing at home; more rebounds + more possessions = more points.</td></tr>

I actually don&#x27;t mind the heartbreak losses because it only makes the next nailbiter wins even better

**Write Up:**

First 3U play of the year. I bet 1-5 units normally so keep an eye out for those bigger ones

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> I am siding with Barcelona. Winners of last years Super Cup

They&#x27;ve won against Athletic 4-0 this season and also won against them in last years Super Cup 2-0

Technically both teams are away from home so let&#x27;s look at away records

Barcelona are 7-1-2 away from home with a 25-15 goal difference. Compare this to Athletic who are 2-2-5 away from home with a 7-14 goal difference and you&#x27;ll see why I favor Barcelona

I combine it with Napoli at home vs Hellas

Napoli are 6-1-0 at home with a 14-6 goal difference

Hellas are 1-3-5 away from home with a 5-16 goal difference

Napoli are the in form team with 4 wins out of their last 5 matches. Including winning the Super Cup. They&#x27;ve only conceded 1 goal in the L5 too which makes this an excellent addition to our bet

Hellas Verona is 2-0-3 in their last 5 with wins against Atalanta at home and Fiorentina away. You could argue they are in decent form but Atalanta have a 2-3-3 away record and Fiorentina have a 2-2-5 home record

Meanwhile Hellas Verona lost 3-0 vs AC Milan and Torino in their last 2 games. I expect Napoli to do the same to Hellas

I absolutely love this play <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Hence why the 3U bet

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Barcelona win at 1.5 odds

Write Up: Last time I was on a streak I started forcing picks, so I’m going for something safer here. This one just barely makes the odds requirements, but I think it’s still worth it. Barcelona is at home hosting Bilboa. Barca has won 8 matches in a row and won their last 4 H2H, including three times last year. This is the Super Cup, but in La Liga, Barca is in first place (16W1D2L, 53:20) while Bilboa are 8th (7W3D9L, 17:25). I know these odds are nothing special, but I think Barcelona will win here much more frequently than lose or draw, so I think the odds are worth a bet. BOL!</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Jack McVeigh (CAI) u5.5r, $1.70 - 5U

Poor run as of late, but NBL been treating me lately, especially unders with good statistical backing. McVeigh started the season off really well crashing the defensive and offensive glass clearing this line at a high rate. But since the return of forward/center Waardenburg, he has only cleared this line 1/5 games. This is due to Cairns running a double big lineup, pushing McVeigh away from any rebounding opportunities, which really limits his ability to go over this line. Simply put, his rebounding duties have taken a back seat since Waardenburgs return and I’m happy to back his unders which have hit L4/4.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Under 152.5 total points

Write up: 
The LG Sakers are the heavy favourite <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> (-9.5 handicap). They are known for half court offense-defense, set play and often burn the clock out at 4th quarter when they have the lead.
On the other side, Samsung Thunders seem to have lower average fg% while facing top defensive team like LG Sakers.
Maybe at some point, total points would go over expectations, that suppose to happens because surprising hot hand and turnover leads to fast break. Just keep calm or you guys can make another bet for like under 158.5-160.5 etc. Because game pace will be slow as hell.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Miles McBride over 10 Points and SGA 20 Points $1.70** 

**MUST USE TAB ALLOWS A MISS BY ONE POINT**

QUICKLY, Alright sometimes TAB falls asleep on the wheel and offers the same value as it does for 10 points for example other bookies have him at around $1.62- 65 which tab is offering for 9 points. That is very important as I will explain below.

Miles Mcbride has been on fire and also has an out which is ideal. Now what I mean by that is Mike Brown is a very contributing guy where every player must fight and gain their minutes. For example he gave Tyler Kolek minutes which Tibs refused to do and is willing to still play Clarkson and Mcbride depending on who is performing the best. Now with Shamet being injured as well as Hart, this opens the door for more players to soak up these minutes. McBride in his last 5 games has hit this line. However when he plays 25 minutes or more he has also hit this line at 14/16 games making this 87.5%. The slate is also decent, Miles McBride when the Knicks win he also shoots a higher clip, The Knicks are favoured in this match, furthermore at home his shooting clip increases as well.</td></tr>

**Tennis: ATP Brisbane - Kamil Majchrzak H2H vs Opelka 3u** $2.10 (Bet365) 7:00PM AEDT

Kamil might be a lucky loser entrant but he was knocked out by Quentin Halys who looks to be a purple patch in Australia. Kamil has been very competitive outside of that against top 100 players in the last few months and has always played relatively well for his ranking in Australian conditions. 

  
Opelka has slowly added to his game but remains a serve bot.  Given Kamil&#x27;s ability to handle big servers (look at his performances against Altmaier, Shelton, Royer, etc), he has the ability to neutralise that serve. Kamil&#x27;s got a solid serve himself, so it this comes down to a game of second serves and who has the ability to move the other around the court, I&#x27;m taking Kamil all day. He was able to produce 5 break point opportunities against Halys and even though Opelka has a bigger serve, he&#x27;s less mobile. So as long as Kamil can keep serves in play - and the stats say he can -  this should be a solid play.

This is a model play, converted my old model into a kenpom-esque model. Model seems to like Fordham in this spot, largely due to Fordham&#x27;s elite ability to score in the paint against a GMU team that struggles to defend it.  George mason is a team that relies heavily on FTs (rank 5th in FT attempts per game) but Fordham is ranked 32nd in limiting ft attempts.  I expect Fordham to play well at home here to atleast cover this number.  After giving up almost 70% 3 point shooting against Richmond in their last loss, I expect their coach to really be focusing on that 3 point defense in this game.  We&#x27;re getting George Mason here on a weird in between schedule where they played home on Dec 28th, road 31st, home on the 3rd, and now back on the road.  I like this spot for Fordham to keep it close.

Last Pick: Pisa vs Como- BTTS NO at 1.73 (2U)(W)



Two in a row!I told y&#x27;all im feeling it!



<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Lazio vs Fiorentina- BTTS- NO at1.90(2u)





Let&#x27;s get to the basics first.



Lazio have a had BTTS in 2/9 Home games, while Fiorentina have had BTTS in 4/9 away games.



Lazio have conceded just 7 times in 9 home games, Remove a the torino 3-3 game, and its 4 goals in 8 matches, Not bad at all.



Further, when playing teams ranked below 12th, they have kept a clean sheet on each of the 4 occasions. (Fiorentina are ranked 18th)



Fiorentina on the other hand have struggled to score away from home, with 5 goals in 9 matches, They&#x27;ve scored in 4/9 away games which isn&#x27;t bad, but lets get to the technical aspect now to make things clear.



A reason why Lazio have such a clean home record when it comes to not allowing BTTS to hit is that if they score, they are more than happy to sit back and defend and Fiorentina&#x27;s attack has been poor away anyway so both of those factors are in our favour.



Again, This is not a lock, just a +EV value bet imo. The market is very slightly favouring the BTTS when it should be slightly favouring the BTTS-NO. Expecting a 1-0 or 2-0 win from Lazio. GL to those tailing, I&#x27;m really positive about this process I&#x27;m following and I love doing the research and bringing y&#x27;all these bets.

Todays <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: **Barcelona v Bilbao: Barca -1 Asian Handicap @1.75**

Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Missed this by one corner, had Forest not conceded the third, there would have definitely been about 3-4 more.  And having a troll of a goalkeeper like Emi Martinez, the guy just likes to waste time.  We were already at 8 corners by the 75th minute, but I knew after that third goal they were cooked.  

Barcelona arrive in outstanding form, riding a **5-game winning streak** and performing well above league averages on both ends of the pitch. Over their last five matches they are scoring **2.0 goals per game** (rising to **2.5 gpg over the last 10**) while conceding just **0.2 gpg** recently (**0.9 gpg over 10**), numbers that clearly point to dominance rather than narrow wins. Their underlying metrics back this up, generating around **2.1 xG** per match and controlling territory for long stretches.

Athletic Club, on the other hand, continue to struggle in attack, managing only **0.6 goals per game** across both recent windows, while conceding **1.0–1.2 gpg**. That combination of limited attacking output and a leaky defence is a bad recipe against a Barcelona side that scores first in roughly **80% of matches** and averages **1.8 second-half goals**, making it more likely they extend leads rather than protect slim ones.

With a **69.8% modelled home win probability**, high goal expectancy (Over **2.5 goals ~66%**), low BTTS likelihood (~**51%**), and Athletic’s tendency to concede under sustained pressure, the data supports a comfortable Barcelona win more often than a narrow one. This isn’t a blowout chase — it’s a controlled margin play with protection built in.

Best of luck.</td></tr>

**Event**: English Premier League - Bournemouth vs Tottenham Hotspur - 20:00 GMT+0

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>**: Bournemouth to win @2.2

**Write Up**: Bournemouth are winless in 11, it&#x27;s not really a reflection of their quality as a team as most football fans will know what this team can do and how good of a manager Andoni Iraola is, but it is an unfortunate reality. But all things come to and end, good and bad. And I think the Cherries are going to get their win here <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Spurs are in poor form and have picked up just one win in their last five, a smash and grab away to a Palace side look to have run out of energy. The Thomas Frank experiment doesn&#x27;t seem to have worked, he has quality players in every position but they look like strangers on the pitch, they have 3 strikers they&#x27;ve paid £50m for and none of them are scoring. The fans are on his back and it seems like his fate is sort of inevitable at this point. Bournemouth, depsite their misfortune so far are ever positive. Taking on teams, playing positive football, working for each other while keeping fan support in a couple bad months. They feel like total opposites at the moment. Bournemouth sit 15th currently while Tottenham are 13th, 4 point separate them. But on the xPTS table, Tottenham are 12th showing that they are almost exactly where they deserve to be, while Bournemouth are 7th, showing they are underperforming their metrics. This Bournemouth side has always had a problem with seeing out results.

Other smaller things to note are Tottenham&#x27;s history of giving teams on bad runs points. So much so over the past couple years the &#x27;Dr Tottenham will see you now&#x27; meme has emerged. It shows frailties in Tottenhams ability to beating the teaems they &#x27;should&#x27; be beating given quality discrepancies. And it is also Antoine Semenyo&#x27;s last game for Bournemouth. He will be joining Manchester City after this game so his performance could really effect the result in whether he wants to &#x27;leave it all out there&#x27; or be conservative to avoid hurting himself and jeapordising his big move.

**Additional Thoughts**: Big Result from Forest to take us to 3-1. Bit lucky with a late penalty but I feel I deserve the luck after that City/Chelsea game. I&#x27;m getting a bit cocky with my betting right now. I&#x27;ve doubled my bankroll in the past week and I&#x27;m buzzing so watch out for me losing my head! But no, seriously, I&#x27;m confident on this one. Bournemouth are due, they won the earlier fixture away from home and Spurs are just going through the motions.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Brentford Vs Sunderland - **Brentford ML @ 1.82 (Melbet)**

**Write Up:** Brentford return home in good form after a strong run during the festive period. They are playing with growing confidence, especially in attack, scoring 10 goals in their last four league games. This includes an impressive 4–1 win at home against Bournemouth and a lively 4–2 away victory over Everton. Even in tougher matches, Brentford have looked solid and organised, as shown by their controlled 0–0 draw with Tottenham. Sunderland, on the other hand, arrive with resilience rather than rhythm. They have gone through a long run of draws, showing they are hard to beat but sometimes lack fluency going forward.

At home, Brentford tend to start fast and put teams under pressure early, as seen in their win over Bournemouth where attacks came one after another. While they have still shown some defensive weaknesses, conceding goals in three of their last five matches, they usually respond quickly. With a place in the top five within reach with a win in this upcoming game, Brentford will be confident going into the game, backed by a strong home record of four wins and two draws from their last six matches, and just one home defeat so far in the 2025–26 season.

Sunderland come into this match with a very different style. Four draws in their last five games show how hard they are to beat, but also highlight their lack of attacking threat. They have scored only three goals in that run, with several low-scoring results like 0–0 and 1–1 reflecting their cautious approach. Away from home, Sunderland focus on staying compact and waiting for counter-attacking chances. This was clear in their draws against Brighton and Tottenham. While this makes them competitive, it leaves little room for mistakes, especially against a team like Brentford that can apply pressure for long periods.

Brentford’s recent attacking form stands out when compared to Sunderland’s struggles in front of goal, and playing at home only strengthens their case. Brentford have shown they can control games and turn that control into goals, while Sunderland’s run of draws could be exposed by a team that presses consistently. Brentford’s strong home record suggests they will be tough to beat.

Sunderland arrive unbeaten in five matches, but their lack of attacking threat could be an issue against a confident Brentford side. This looks like a close game, but with home advantage and better recent form, Brentford seem to have the edge. Sunderland are a solid team, yet they can look flat away from home. With Igor Thiago in good form, Brentford should have enough to edge a narrow win.

**Write Up:** It&#x27;s not often we get +240 straight picks to cash within 10 minutes of a footy match. But Neco came through for us and had a fantastic game. Nothing more needs saying, it feels great when a good read works out as expected! 

Guys I know I play Enzo a lot but listen, he&#x27;s at plus money again and I can&#x27;t help myself. We&#x27;ve cashed him 5 times now and I&#x27;m going to keep riding it. After the thrilling ending and cash a few days ago, we&#x27;re backing Enzo again. For all the same reasons and a few more. 

The 2nd half under their new interim coach last week was night and day to the first. The tactic changed and Enzo was back to his box crashing self. I expect Chelsea to start the game this way against Fulham, as they&#x27;re not a team you park the bus against. The second reason is that their new manager, Liam Rosenior, will be in the stands watching. The players will want to impress their new coach, so I see Chelsea coming out strong. 

**Please wait for lineups if your book does not void for players who don&#x27;t start.** I warn this a lot, and while I fully expect Enzo to start, we&#x27;ve been burned by stranger coaching subs. These guys are playing a game every 3 days, and so eventually coaches will rotate players. With FA Cup over the weekend and a likely break for many starters, I expect Chelsea to go all out to win this one.

BOL if tailing and happy Wednesday!</td></tr>

Inter u19 vs Sampdoria u19, over 2.5 goals + Inter u19 or draw, @ 1.82

Inter U19 vs Sampdoria U19 looks ideal for over 2.5 goals. Inter’s youth side plays aggressive, high-tempo football and creates plenty of chances, especially at home. Sampdoria U19 may struggle defensively but usually contributes going forward, leaving space at the back. Youth matches are often open and unpredictable, and with both teams preferring attack over control, goals should come early and continue throughout the game. It seems that over 3.5 goals is not available for this match so i just added inter or draw. </td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Maria Sakkari 🇬🇷 O2.5 double faults vs Coco Gauff 🇺🇸 3 units to win 2.2U @1.73 (FanDuel)

Write-up: Turns out it was St. Nicolas that swung by on Christmas eve. I said that I was slightly worried about Liaoning’s form heading into this one and they ended up losing 25-12, 25-19, 25-12 to miss by 6 points. Regardless I still find the line was way too low so I can’t beat myself up for it and it did in fact end up moving to 126.5.

You know what my New Year’s resolution is? To go 365-0 on this thread. Well actually 358-0 because I’ve been testing my models. <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> is day one of that. To recap the year it was alright with some ups (getting 10 wins in a row) and downs (towards the end was abysmal, sorry tailers). I do want to highlight I did win a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> that u/sigmabale tailed on 12/17/25 which is by far my biggest achievement in life. Really stop-start recently, the trends analyses weren’t working unfortunately. Variance? Maybe, but I’ll be focusing on my double faults plays now that the tennis season is back that brought me so much success + maybe the occasional prop I like. Tried something new in the off-season and it didn’t pay off, so be it that’s what betting is all about.

I missed the thread being posted (sorry) but there’s about 2 hours to tail this so I’ll make it very quick. Sakkari has averaged a 5.3% double fault rate over the past year on hard courts. Using both players’ serving/returning stats + ELO differences I get an estimated 3.9 double faults for Maria across 21 games, anchoring it to the market line. That gives this play an estimated 72% chance of winning. She’s covered the line in 6/8 HC matches against the American though I will say that she didn’t DF the last time both played which I’m not worried about considering she’d committed 6 the week before that against Gauff last year. I actually think it’ll be a longer match than that which is good for the play because the Greek has looked very good in her opening two United Cup matches over strong opposition whilst Gauff was terrible against JBM.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:**

**Tennis - ATP Brisbane - Lehecka ML** \[2U to win 1.4u (-143)\]

Time: 11:10PM EST

Reasoning: Lehecka just beat Machac showing he&#x27;s in decent form at least. He hits with a lot of power and was improving his game a lot towards the end of last season. I think he&#x27;s undervalued here against Korda who&#x27;s prone to choking, and think his game doesn&#x27;t up well against Lehecka&#x27;s hard hitting. Korda beat Vacherot 2-0 but I think Vacherot is very overvalued due to his miracle masters win last season so the odds are overvaluing Korda&#x27;s win. 



Lehecka also leads the H2H 2-0.</td></tr>

**Last Five:** ❌❌❌✅❌

**Event:** Spanish Super Cup, FC Barcelona v Athletic Bilbao, 2:00 pm EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Athletic Bilbao +1.0 Asian Handicap +105, 3 units

**Write Up:** Yes, I am once again fading Barcelona, but I truly believe <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> is going to be the day they slip up. Their high line has been getting away with too much, but in a match of this caliber, everything is going to look different and Athletic Bilbao aren&#x27;t letting their mistakes go unpunished. Hear me out.

Barcelona’s current *eight game winning streak and domestic superiority* sure sound impressive, but most of those victories have been **anything but smooth sailing.** Even in their latest game (against Espanyol) they were under heavy fire for the majority of the match and only a generational performance by Joan Garcia saved them from a potential embarrassment. We&#x27;ve seen this time and time again, and I just don&#x27;t think Barcelona can survive playing like this for much longer. On the other side we have Athletic, on a very mixed run of form, but a team that is **more than solid in cup competitions.** They have **more Copa del Rey titles than Real Madrid,** for example, and have **won the Super Cup three times,** with the most recent win coming in 2021 (against Barca as well), but they&#x27;ve also reached the final the following year. In fact, they&#x27;ve **beaten Barcelona 3 times in the last 8** matches, suggesting that making life harder for the Catalan giant isn&#x27;t a one-off occurence and that the play absolutely holds value at these scrumptious odds of +105.

Athletic Bilbao are set up for a season of mediocrity, being somewhat disappointing in LaLiga and the Copa del Rey *(getting a narrow win against Ourense)* so far, as well as having an abysmal time in the Champions League, and that&#x27;s why they&#x27;re going to put **all their focus towards this competition** as it&#x27;s realistically the only way they could collect some silverware come the end of the season.

I also like the fact **Raphinha seemed completely ineffective** in the most recent game, showing that he hasn&#x27;t quite shaken off his knock, while **Rashford seems to be on a crazy downtrend,** looking more and more of a ghost with each passing game *(bro thinks he&#x27;s secured that contract).* **Yamal is also operating at about 80%,** trying to adapt to a new playing style. Meanwhile, in the midfield, **Frenkie de Jong often fails to control the game&#x27;s tempo,** needlessly holding on to the ball and always making the most uncreative decision. **Pedri is also questionable because of the recent injury** (and ONLY because of that, as he&#x27;s otherwise absolutely brilliant; without a doubt one of the best midfielders in the world). I don&#x27;t think their **defence** needs much of an introduction, they&#x27;re **all shakey** and only have Joan Garcia to thank for keeping the scorelines respectable. The team as a whole **keeps relying on Lewandowski&#x27;s magic** off the bench, as well as **random moments of brilliance** from Yamal, Ferran Torres, Fermin and Olmo, but that&#x27;s just not going to reliably happen. Joan was extra hyped up to deliver a cracking performance against Espanyol as that was his former club that now hates him for switching to their rivals, I can&#x27;t see him have a performance at the same level again.

Overall, everything is setting itself up nicely for a game, which Athletic Bilbao can definitely get something out of. They&#x27;re a solid team that can always cause troubles to even the most elite clubs, as they&#x27;re **hard to break down** and have the amazingly talented **Nico Williams** always ready to blow past the opposing defenders. *They do have a few absences of their own, but I don&#x27;t think they matter as much in the grand scheme of things.*

Bear in mind, this is a knockout where tactics tend to be more cautious and even **small mistakes are punished,** that&#x27;s why I can absolutely see Athletic Bilbao nab a cheeky win *(feeling a 2-1 here honestly)* or a draw *(which still wouldn&#x27;t be disastrous all things considered).* I love the look of this matchup, been excited for it since the start of the year, so I&#x27;m going in with 3 whole units. If Flick fields Ferran in the starting XI, I&#x27;m loving these odds even more. I also like the BTTS Yes and the Under 3.5 goals angle, if you want to take those instead. Either way, BOL y&#x27;all and let&#x27;s enjoy some Spanish Super Cup madness, the Espanyol match certainly did not disappoint and this one has all the signs of a classic ☘️🫡</td></tr>

Last Pick: Jan-Lennard Struff to win 2-0 vs Botic van de Zandschulp (+175, 1 unit): Loss

Tennis | Canberra Challenger | 12:30 AM EST (estimated)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Rafael Jódar vs Jaime Faria | **Jódar -3.5 games at -138 (BET365). 1 unit.**

Write-up: Tough loss. Struff wasn&#x27;t able to get the break back in the first set from 15-40, and ended up losing the match in three sets. While that <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> wasn&#x27;t the best, I&#x27;m still happy with my overall form (17-3 L20), and am looking forward to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>&#x27;s play. 

Rafa Jodar has seen an incredible rise over the past few years, to the point where he has now viewed as the top young prospect in a highly talented Spanish crop. He recently chose to forgo his remaining three years of college tennis eligibility, which wasn&#x27;t a huge surprise after he earned a spot in Australian Open qualifying and defeated ATP #26 Learner Tien at the Next Gen Finals in Jeddah. This should allow him to focus his energy on breaking onto the main tour in 2026, and this isn&#x27;t the first time a player has used the Canberra Challenger as a starting point. Last year, we saw Brazilian sensation Joao Fonseca capture the title; the year before, Jakub Mensik made a run to the final to start an excellent 2024 campaign. Jodar has already won two qualifying matches (including one on center court, where he&#x27;ll be playing <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>), and one main draw match (defeated big server Nicolas Jarry 3 &amp; 4). Last year, Jodar played primarily on hard courts, which allowed him to develop an aggressive game that perfectly suits the surface.

There&#x27;s no doubt that Jaime Faria is a nice talent in his own right. Faria rose to prominence at last year&#x27;s Australian Open, where he took a set off Djokovic, but injuries ended up significantly disrupting his 2025 campaign. He was able to defeat Elmer Moller easily in the first round, but Moller is pretty much a clay specialist right now, and Faria was only priced at even money. This should be a much bigger test of whether he&#x27;s back to his old form, and I don&#x27;t see him on the same level as Jodar regardless. Faria does have a big serve and forehand, but Jodar isn&#x27;t a serve-dominant player, and I don&#x27;t expect this to turn into a servebotting fest. These are some really nice odds for this play, but I would take this up to around -150.</td></tr>

Football - Premier League 
Everton vs Wolverhamton 

Wolves may be riding high after claiming their first win of the Premier League season, but they have lost eight of their 10 Premier League away games this season, and I think they will experience another fruitless away trip against an Everton side that will be determined to bounce back from Sunday&#x27;s loss to Brentford.

<tr><td class='post'>Manchester United @ 1.73 (Unibet) - €300.00

Last 5 &gt; WLWWW // Profit: €2,179.00

United have just fired their main coach, which in my books was an awful decision, since Amorim was really rebuilding United. Anyway, the new manager bounce effect is real even with the current one just being an interim.

This could also not have been against a better suiting side since Burnley are currently on the worst run in the prem with an 11 game winless streak which they have drawn just 2 of. In my books United have improved A LOT and Amorim fixed a lot of things like the xG and discipline of the squad, they have been way more cohesive since his appointment. The interim manager who is the manager of United U18s have managed that youth team to a 2nd place this season, let’s see if he can carry his tactics to the men’s team.

On the H2H side United are 7-2-1 in their last 10 recent meetings with Burnley and when playing at Burnley they are an overall 6-2-1 against them where they are on a streak of 8 games unbeaten at Burnley. Of course lots of things have changed and this United squad is very different, but it is still worth mentioning.</td></tr>

Stake: 2.5 units

Write Up:

Coming off a winning <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, so sticking with what’s working.

I’m backing Aston Villa away at Crystal Palace. Villa are absolutely flying right now with 12 wins in their last 13 games. Confidence is sky high and they look comfortable controlling games regardless of venue.

Crystal Palace are going the opposite direction. They’re on a seven-game winless streak and have lost four of their last five league matches. Performances look flat and momentum is clearly missing.

There’s also a lot of uncertainty around Palace at the moment. Their coach is being linked with the Manchester United job after Amorim was sacked this week, and situations like that rarely help a struggling squad. It’s a big contrast to this Villa side that looks settled, confident, and fully focused.

At +125, I’m happy to side with the team in form against one that’s struggling.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Iatcenko ML @ 2,14



*First things first. There have been some comments under my last pick that I didn&#x27;t post Sakkari <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> which I answered to, but can only be seen from my profile. Then I figured it&#x27;s the same with Sakkari <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> itself. I&#x27;ll post couple of links (images) from my profile to prove I did send it. Think it&#x27;s the issue with this profile being new. I checked this sub for a while, but decided to post from New Year and made a new profile for that. Hope this and all the following picks get published on time.*

[*https://ibb.co/TqLs3ymz*](https://ibb.co/TqLs3ymz)





Odds opened at evens for Iatcenko and are going up. The reason I guess is her left quadriceps/thigh was heavily taped in yesterday match against Aiava. She asked for a MTO at 6-7 2-1 for leg problems, but it didn&#x27;t seem to bother her too much later as she went on to turn the match around and win 6-7 6-3 6-3. It was her R1 match after two impressive wins in Q against Wei and Shibahara. She is a young Russian with a complete game who had a breakthrough 2025. and will try to establish herself on Tour in 2026. I really like her in a matchup against Garland who is one of my favorite fades in WTA. Classic brainless ballbasher who reaches highest highs and lowest lows in same match. Iatcenko has a pretty consistent gamestyle, placing heavy balls deep into court, moving opponents and will make Garland hit on the run. It&#x27;s a gamble since Iatcenko condition is not fully known, but given I consider her a favorite here I just can&#x27;t miss her at these odds. H2H is 1-0 for Garland, 6-2 6-1 in 2024., but a lot changed since.

**Game: Man City VS Brighton - 2:30 PM EST**

City are going to look to try and shut this game down as early as they can after back-to-back dropped points in a title race, they need to find a way to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> up the pace. They conceded a last-minute equalizer on the weekend and have now lost 2 of their starting CBs which mean the best way they&#x27;re going to keep the ball out of the net is by keeping it in Brighton&#x27;s half.

*Before the write-up, I would like to address this topic again. I want to reiterate that if you are unable to handle a loss, you should not be betting - it&#x27;s not fun, and it&#x27;s not healthy - losses are a part of the game, and nothing is ever a &quot;lock&quot;.

Write up: A Mid-Major shootout in coming - Model has this as the highest confident Edge % and EV % for the day. Will add some personal information in this write-up as well.

• ⁠Model has this game going 185+ total points

• Model projects that both team totals go above the over, and a potential for overtime

• EV better betting 100$ = 11-12$ for this play

• This game is going to be GREAT - if you are a basketball fan, and don&#x27;t keep up with mid-majors often, this is a must see game - Both teams are very athletic and both teams love to move at fast pace, especially SLU - VCU is averaging around 80 some PPG, while SLU is averaging around 90 PPG - However SLU does indeed have a good defense, but VCU at home, is VCU at home, they should come out firing - SLU overs have been a hit all season, with VCU overs are hitting at 80%+ - I expect Djokovic to slow down just a bit tomorrow due to Avila on the other side, which I actually think that helps the over because it should lead to more shots from outside the arc - Hill for VCU has been on a tear and I expect him to keep that up tomorrow - Do not feel like I need to talk much about SLU&#x27;s offense, boy have they been on FIRE all year - ranking top 5 in the NCAA in PPG - Two of the A10&#x27;s best battling it out for bragging rights - One of these two teams will get an automatic bid to the tournament, the other will have to perform really well in the A10 tournament - They know this, they know how important this matchup is - I expect a shootout here, so give me the Over 169.5 for a unit.

Arsenal vs Kairat, Over 4.5 goals @ 2.05

Arsenal vs Kairat looks ideal for an over 4.5 goals angle. Arsenal’s attacking depth and high tempo should overwhelm Kairat early, creating constant pressure and chances. Kairat’s defense is likely to struggle with pace, movement, and transitions. If Arsenal score quickly, the match could open up completely, leading to a one-sided goal fest with five or more goals.</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>**POTD Record:** 11-35-5 *Barcelona looked completely out of it in the first half, but then they remembered they have a sigmabale <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> to kill and started spamming goals. Oviedo kindly gifted them two and then Yamal scored a crazy bicycle kick from the edge of the box (because of course he did) to slam another L on the board. I took a couple days off because I didn&#x27;t like the look of any games out there, but the Champions League is back, and so am I*

**Last Five:** ❌❌✅❌❌

**Event:** Champions League, FC Barcelona v FC Copenhagen, 3:00 pm EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** FC Copenhagen +2.0, +2.5 Asian Handicap, +110, 4 units

**Write Up:** This bet does ring a bell, but we lost the last one because of some 1/100 type goals and I doubt Barcelona are pulling off more black magic this time. Copenhagen are a very respectable team and they have everything to play for as they chase a qualification spot. Barcelona need a win, preferrably by at least 2 goals to stand a chance of finishing in the top 8 spots and securing an automatic pass to the round of 16. I don&#x27;t back them to win by a big margin though. They&#x27;re going to be vulnerable on the counters and they&#x27;ve already proven **their defence in the Champions league is more than shakey.** They **conceded twice to a team from the Czech Republic that hadn&#x27;t played a competitive match in over a month** and let&#x27;s not even bring up what happened when they **visited the Stamford Bridge.**

Make no mistake, *Barcelona are clearly the favorites for this clash,* but it&#x27;s not going to be straightforward. **Copenhagen are in some pretty good form** themselves, remaining **undefeated in the last three CL games,** with two wins and a draw, and they&#x27;re **undefeated in the last five games in all competitions,** which is nothing to scoff at.

**Barcelona also miss many key players,** for example, their whole midfield is out. Yes, **Pedri, de Jong, and Gavi** are all set to miss <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>&#x27;s fixture, and the team always plays worse without them. Meanwhile, **Raphinha still doesn&#x27;t seem to be at 100% fitness.** His intensity and pressing are crucial for Barcelona&#x27;s gameplay and he might not be able to provide that to the usual full extent.

Overall, I have a faint suspicion Barcelona are taking the three points <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, but it&#x27;s going to be a narrow one and I could even see them being stunned by the talented Copenhagen team. All in all, Barcelona are definitely there for the taking, so I&#x27;m going in with 4 whole units for this one. BOL and let&#x27;s enjoy another Flick masterclass ☘️🫡</td></tr>

Last 10 (most recent on right):  ❌✅✅❌✅❌✅❌✅✅

Last Pick: Carlos Alcaraz 🇪🇸 3-0 vs Alex De Minaur 🇦🇺 ✅

Event: Australian Open QF 🎾

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Jannik Sinner 🇮🇹 3-0 vs Ben Shelton 🇺🇸 5 units to win 4.2U @2.25 (Bet365)

The fact I’m going with back to back straight set victories in grand slam quarters tells you all about the dynamics of tennis. It’s quite literally Sincaraz vs the field at the moment. Out of the up-and-comers the only two players I could see challenge them and win one for even just one slam in the next few years would be Draper and Fils (+ Djokovic on a good day currently). Surprising selections to some maybe but despite their fitness issues are the only players that imo can consistently take the game to their opponents. 

Anyways this is proving to be a very difficult match-up for Shelton having lost his last his last 19 sets against the Italian (8 consecutive straight set losses, 3 in slams). Ben can count himself lucky to have won their first encounter in 2023 as I would fear a De Minaur-Sinner lopsided H2H remake between these two. Jannik has shown some weakness at a tournament for once to prove he’s in fact human when he was very close to retiring down a break in the third set against wild card Spizzirri in round 3. That was down to cramps though as a result of the insane heat in Melbourne and there won’t be such issues for this match. Other than that it’s pretty much been business as usual having benefitted of Gaston’s retirement in round 1, a beatdown of Duckworth in round 2 and a comfortable victory over Darderi last round, who despite playing out of his mind towards the end of the third set still lost in straight sets. 

Shelton meanwhile has been playing very well having only dropped a set thus far against Ruud in the fourth round. He’s one of the best servers in the world and has a very explosive forehand. Unfortunately that’s just not enough to truly trouble Sinner which is kind of nuts. Ben’s return game is simply not good enough to be competitive on Sinner’s service game and Jannik’s return game (being the best) is too good to make the American’s serve a deadly weapon. The problem with that is that Shelton therefore can’t get enough free points from his biggest strength and causes rallies to be installed. At that point Sinner largely has the upper hand being the perfect blend of power and consistency from the baseline we have ever seen. On the other side you have a Shelton whose rally tolerance is miles worse than Sinner’s and you have a recipe for the No. 2 coming on top of the majority points if the serve is returned. A really bad match-up for Shelton, whose lefty game catches Sinner’s incredible backhand, and was broken 6 times in their match-up last year in their semi final match in Australia. I would say fair odds should be closer to 1.66 as Shelton’s serve could catch fire for a set and scam a tiebreak but even then has easily lost his last 7 TB’s against the Italian and I strongly suspect we will see another routine win for Sinner.

**Confidence: 85%**

**---**

We’re going for full value here considering the state of the Champions League tomorrow. We’ve got a whopping **18 Champions League games kicking off at the same time**, and what’s important is just how congested the table is right now — it’s insane. Only **3 points separate 6th from 12th**. A side can go into halftime in the green and be staring at a playoff spot by half. These are our ideal circumstances

Copenhagen sit **26th in the table**, with hope dwindling. If they want any chance at all, they’ll either look to grab an early goal and sit back, or simply sit deep and hope to steal something late. Regardless they&#x27;ll have to sit and stay compact and ride the wave till an opening presents itself. Either way, the first-half pressure from this Barcelona side is going to print corners. Expecting heavy field-tilt from Barca.

Copenhagen are coming off a first half at home against Napoli where they managed **0 shots on target** while conceding **6 corners**, and I see Barcelona replicating that type of half here again at the Camp Nou.</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>**Record:** 42-20-1 (+23.52u)

**Last:** (CBB) Michigan State -13.5 (1.5u) - Pending

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** (CBB) No. 10 Houston (-5.5) at TCU

**Start Time:** 9:00 PM ET (ESPN2)

**Odds:** -110 (DraftKings)

**Units:** 1.5U

**Reasoning:** The Schollmaier Arena: where ranked foes go to perish.

That appears to be the mantra as of late, as TCU is 10-9 against AP Top 25 teams at home since 2021-22. Those numbers only get more impressive against Top 10 visitors, as the team has won six of the last nine. That includes then-No. 2 Houston in a 68-67 thriller back in 2024. In fact, the Horned Frogs (13-7) have won four of the last five meetings at home against the Cougars (17-2). And although Houston has not lost back-to-back games since the 2023-24 season, the last time the team did so was against Iowa State and…yep, you guessed it… at TCU. 

I can hear you all now: Sooooo why exactly are we waging our hard-earned coin on this?

There certainly is some cause for alarm, but hear me out. Following a lackluster defensive effort against Arizona State, the Cougars defense was almost non-existent in a 90-86 loss at No. 12 Texas Tech on Saturday. And with the 90 points allowed being the most conceded by Houston since February of 2018, you can bet head coach Kelvin Sampson will have his squad locked in for this one—especially given the recent history at TCU. Not to mention, since the start of the 2024 season, his team is 8-1 straight up following a loss, including seven double-digit victories while only allowing opponents to average 55.6 points. 

If the Cougars expect to right the ship, they will need to rely on its elite defense to return to form. 

Through 19 games, the unit ranks 1st in scoring defense (61.6 PPGA), 4th in defensive efficiency (0.904), 17th in opponent field-goal percentage (39.4%) and 66th in opponent three-point shooting (31.2%). That should lead to tough sledding for a Horned Frogs offense that finds itself among the middle of the pack, ranking 85th in scoring (80.0 PPG), 102nd in field-goal percentage (46.2%), 105th in offensive efficiency (1.096) and 165th in three-point shooting (34.2%). It’s a unit that thrives in transition, ranking 17th in fast break points (15.8 PPG; 96th percentile). Unfortunately for TCU, Houston just so happens to be stellar in defending just that, ranking 8th in opponent fast break points (5.5 PPG; 98th percentile). 

On the other end of the floor, a resurgent Cougars offense should make a difference. 

Although the unit has been solid overall—38th in offensive efficiency (1.160), 96th in scoring (79.1 PPG), 148th in field-goal percentage (45.1%) and 152nd in three-point shooting (34.4%)—it has certainly raised its level of play as of late. Over the team’s last three outings, Houston has averaged 88.7 points on 49.7% shooting from the field (38.6% from beyond the arc). In fact, since the turn of the calendar year, the team actually ranks 3rd in adjusted offensive efficiency (129.8), per Torvik. Coming off a stellar 42-point showing on Saturday, look for freshman guard Kingston Flemings (17.0 PPG) to lead the effort to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> apart a stingy TCU defense that enters ranked 31st in defensive efficiency (0.964), 79th in scoring defense (70.4 PPGA), 107th in opponent field-goal percentage (43.0%) and 146th in opponent three-point shooting (33.3%). Second-chance opportunities will go a long way in this one, as the Cougars rank 24th in second-chance points (14.5 PPG; 93rd percentile) while the Horned Frogs rank just 134th in opponent second-chance points (10.6 PPGA; 63rd percentile). 

Finally, the turnover battle should be the X factor on Wednesday night. 

Forcing opponent miscues has been somewhat of staple for this Houston defense, as the unit ranks 5th in turnovers forced per possession (22.4%), 8th in turnovers forced (15.3 per game) and 34th in steals (8.7). But what makes the team even more dangerous is how it converts those opportunities into points, ranking 7th in points off turnovers (20.2 PPG; 98th percentile). That could be an issue for a TCU offense that has been careless as times with the basketball, ranking 95th in turnovers per possession (15.4%), 127th in turnovers (11.3) and 129th in opponent steals (6.3). And while the Horned Frogs do a good job forcing turnovers themselves—33rd in turnovers forced (14.5), 35th in turnovers forced per possession (19.8%) and 87th in steals (7.7)—the Cougars are among the nation’s best in limiting such mistakes, ranking 1st in opponent steals (4.6), 2nd in turnovers (8.5) and 6th in turnovers per possession (12.5%).

Look for Houston to get back in the win column with a convincing effort.

Bilbao are 7-2-1 at home in European competitions. Sporting have been winless in 14 away games against Spanish teams, which they have lost 10 of. In the CL this season Sporting were excellent at home (4-0-0) but on the road they are winless with a 0-1-2 record.

I&#x27;ve read that Sporting have been sanctioned with a no fans ban, which makes it a huge advantage for Bilbao. Sporting don&#x27;t need this game, Bilbao do.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Rekonix ML vs. YB &amp; Nemesis +1.5 Map vs. Vici Gaming @ 2.03 (5u)


Write Up:

Look, I know this is the main YB roster not the academy squad we faded yesterday but they haven&#x27;t exactly looked scary. They just dropped a series to Nemesis and struggled big time against Kukuys. This YB squad has veteran star power like BoBoKa, flyfly, but their coordination has been hit-or-miss. Rekonix, led by inYourdreaM and Fbz, has been a far more cohesive unit. Even with the loss to Vici Gaming who are arguably the tournament favorites, Rekonix plays cleaner, more disciplined Dota, and their overall macro play has been sharper than YB&#x27;s current brawl-heavy style. I&#x27;d rather trust Rekonix&#x27;s system than flip a coin on YB figuring it out <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.

On the other side, Vici Gaming is the favorite on paper, but they haven&#x27;t been invincible they dropped a map in their recent 2-1 series against Rekonix. Team Nemesis, on the other hand is coming off a massive confidence boosting 2-0 win over Execration. Their roster is stacked with individual talent, specifically 23savage and Mac, who have the carry potential to take over a game single handedly. Nemesis might not win the series, but they have enough firepower to punish Vici’s drafts and secure at least one game. Taking the +1.5 handicap gives us a safety net in what should be a contested series.

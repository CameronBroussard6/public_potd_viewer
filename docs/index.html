<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>:

NBA | 10:00pm EST | Mavs @ Lakers

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Luka Doncic o41.5 PR (-125) 1u

Write Up: I am fully buying in to the revenge narrative here. Luka has been on a tear to start the season and can hit this line on points alone. 

It’s no secret how he feels about this matchup. He’s going to look to be aggressive. Since LeBron’s return from injury, Luka has averaged 46 PR.

Mavs allow the most rebounds to the PG position so the rebound upside is there for Luka. Plus we all know Luka will be off ball on defense so he’ll be able to roam and grab boards on the weak side. As long as Luka gets the minutes and doesn’t shoot inefficiently he should cash this number for us. 

Good luck to everyone tailing!

### The <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Texas A&amp;M Aggies (Money Line -130) Bet 2 units


**Game:** #3 Texas A&amp;M (11-0) vs. #16 Texas (8-3)
**When:** <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> (Friday) at 4:30 PM PST
**Where:** DKR-Texas Memorial Stadium (Austin, TX)
**TV:** ABC


Here is the breakdown of why the Aggies are the smart play to ruin Texas&#x27;s night in Austin.


### 1. The Mismatch in the Trenches
The biggest reason A&amp;M stays undefeated tonight is their defensive front. The Aggies rank **2nd in the nation in sacks and tackles for loss**. They wreak havoc in the backfield.
* **Texas&#x27;s Weakness:** The Longhorns&#x27; offensive line has been &quot;leaky&quot; and inconsistent all season.
* **The Result:** Texas QB Arch Manning has struggled when pressured, making decision errors and taking sacks. A&amp;M’s pass rush will force him off his spot early and often, killing drives before they start.


### 2. Quarterback Dynamics: Reed vs. Manning
* **Texas A&amp;M (Marcel Reed):** Reed has been a revelation. He is a dynamic dual-threat who extends plays with his legs. In rivalry games where emotions run high and plays break down, a QB who can scramble for a first down is the ultimate equalizer. He adds a rushing dimension that the Texas defense has historically struggled to contain.
* **Texas (Arch Manning):** While talented, Manning is still young and prone to &quot;rookie&quot; mistakes, especially against elite defenses. He has thrown 7 interceptions this year, and A&amp;M’s defense is designed to bait inexperienced QBs into bad throws.


### 3. Momentum and &quot;The Spread&quot;
* **Texas A&amp;M** is a wagon right now. They are **11-0** and playing with the confidence of a team destined for the College Football Playoff. They have learned how to win close games (like the comeback against South Carolina).
* **Texas** is 8-3 and just **3-8 Against The Spread (ATS)** this season. They are consistently overvalued by Vegas because of the brand name &quot;Texas.&quot; They have failed to cover in their last 3 games as underdogs.


### 4. The Stakes
Texas A&amp;M is playing for a guaranteed spot in the SEC Championship and a potential #1 overall seed. Texas is effectively playing for pride. While &quot;spoiler&quot; motivation is real, the Aggies have everything to lose, which usually translates to a sharper, more disciplined performance from a Mike Elko-coached team.


**Bottom Line:** You are getting an **11-0** team at nearly even money against an **8-3** team just because the game is on the road. Don&#x27;t overthink it. Back the better defense and the better record.


**Prediction:** Texas A&amp;M 31, Texas 24.</td></tr>

[Here is the new document which started tracking 09/01/25](https://www.<mark style='background:#fff59d'>potd</mark>.lol/<mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>?utm_source=redditpost).*

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>:** Jonas Valanciunas o7.5 points (Spurs vs Nuggets)

**Odds:** -110

**Units:** 2.4u

Tip off is 6:10pm PST. I am staying with my Valanciunas points system <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> as planned. The line for this match is 237.5 with Spurs center Victor Wembanyama sidelined due to injury (calf). Its the forth match for these teams in the NBA Cup and both the Nuggets and Spurs are sitting at 2-1 in the same group, with the Nuggets at a +3 point differential. So a lot of parity if the Spurs had a healthy Wemby. 

Even without Wemby this should be a night with a lot of buckets. Valanciunas has hit this line 2 out of the 3 NBA Cup matches this season. Should this game become lopsided in favour of the Nuggets I could see Jokic&#x27;s minutes reduced like it happened NBA Cup match on 11/07. A match where Warriors star Steph Curry was inactive. The spread is currently -8.5 and in that 11/07 match the spread was -9.5.

# ✅ Why I favor Eternal Fire

* Historically when EF and SPARTA met in recent months, EF has had the edge: in earlier 2025 encounters (e.g. in Series #7), EF beat SPARTA 2-0. [Strafe Esports+2Tips.gg+2](https://www.strafe.com/match/sparta-esports-vs-eternal-fire-swiss-2025-cct-season-3-european-series-7-9736f4/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* According to pre-match analytics, EF has strong statistics on certain maps — e.g. “Mirage specialty: 61% win-rate across 31 maps,” which suggests if the veto and map picks fall their way they can leverage that strength. [Bo3.gg+1](https://bo3.gg/matches/eternal-fire-vs-sparta-28-11-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* The general prediction sentiment (e.g. some community polls/odds) still heavily favor EF. [Strafe Esports+2GosuGamers+2](https://www.strafe.com/match/eternal-fire-vs-sparta-esports-group-d-2025-cct-season-3-european-series-12-250ab5/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* In their most recent head-to-head (Nov 9, 2025), SPARTA defeated EF 2-0 in the last meeting — showing they know how to handle EF’s strategies. [Strafe Esports+1](https://www.strafe.com/match/eternal-fire-vs-sparta-esports-group-d-2025-cct-season-3-european-series-11-5779b8/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* SPARTA also have map-specific strengths: e.g. a decent win-rate on Nuke, which could be a deciding factor depending on map veto. [Bo3.gg+1](https://bo3.gg/matches/eternal-fire-vs-sparta-28-11-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Vegas Golden Knights vs Montreal Canadiens (Hockey/NHL) at 4pm EST

Over 5.5 goals (-135)

Write-up:

Canadiens average 3.43 goals per game this season

Golden Knights average 3.09 goals per game this season


Canadiens have hit that line 10 times in their last 10 games. The team either score a lot or give up a lot of goals. Vegas has also hit that line in their last 3 games and 5 in their last 10 but all their other games finished with 5 goals and never less. Reason why I&#x27;m confident in this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> is because Montembeault is in net for the Canadiens and he&#x27;s been atrocious. Both teams have back to back the next day so I expect Vegas to play their backup goalie. Carl Lindbom should be starting for Vegas with a .872(not good for an NHL goalie) save percentage and he gives up 3.16 goals on average this season. Even if it&#x27;s Akira Schmidt starting I would go for over 5.5 because of Montembeault who gives up a lot of goals. Montembeault is supposed to be Montreal&#x27;s #1 but he&#x27;s been playing pretty bad this season and is quickly losing his spot as #1. He has a .852(very bad for an NHL goalie) save percentage and gives up 3.71 goals on average this season. Mark Stone is also back for Vegas so more firepower for them and he is also a Canadiens killer (23 points in 27 games played vs the Canadiens). Jack Eichel also loves to put up points vs the Habs (24 points in 24 games). Same thing for some of the Canadiens players versus Vegas : Suzuki has 10 points in 10 games versus them and Caufield has 5 points in 5 games. All in all I expect both teams to score a lot!

**Milwaukee Bucks @ New York Knicks**  
**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: New York Knicks -7.5 @ 1.83**.(-120) 1 Unit

The trajectories of these two teams are heading in opposite directions. The Bucks are on a downward spiral and simply haven&#x27;t looked good, while the Knicks are building positive momentum and are just playing a better, more cohesive brand of basketball right now.

I&#x27;m backing the Knicks to cover at home in a spot I love. This is a quick revenge game after the Knicks lost in Milwaukee 121-111 earlier in the season, and now they get to host at Madison Square Garden. Beyond the revenge narrative, this game is critical for the NBA Cup standings, and point differential is a key tiebreaker. I expect the Knicks to be fully motivated not just to win, but to win by a margin.

And I like this play regardless of Giannis Antetokounmpo&#x27;s status. The Knicks&#x27; current form and the situational spot are strong enough for me to believe they would cover.

I&#x27;ll be honest, I had a hard time deciding between this spread, Jalen Brunson over 29.5 points, and Cade Cunningham over 29.5 points—both of those player props were my other favorite plays of the day. However, the Knicks spread ultimately checks a couple more boxes for me, so that&#x27;s the official <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Viborg vs Sonderjyske - BTTS Yes @ 1.56

Write Up: The odds are not high here, but sometimes it&#x27;s good to just <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> something that looks like an easy winner. Sonderjyske is at 5th in the table with 7W4D5L and 26 goals scored vs 23 conceded. Viborg is at 6th place with 7W1D8L and 26 goals scored vs 24 conceded. Sonderjyske has BTTS in their last 8/10, O2.5 last 5/6 and no clean sheet in last four, while Viborg has BTTS in their last 6/10 and O2.5 in last 8/9. BTTS has hit in their last 8/10 H2H and O2.5 has hit in the last 4/5 H2H.

This seems like a goal fest, so I&#x27;m taking a relatively safe BTTS at 1.56 for my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>. You can add BTTS + O2.5 goals for 1.8 odds if you want. Viborg hasn&#x27;t lost in their last 12 H2H so you can even do Viborg/draw + BTTS + O2.5 for 3.25 if you are a degen. 3.6 if you add O6.5 corners (they average about 8 and 9 corners per game).

Another day of World Cup qualifications, <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> I got stuck on this game, where I&#x27;m siding with the favorite and the home team. 

We have already seen how big basketball is in Baltic countries during Eurobasket, so I expect the home crowd to bring something extra from their players. It is Friday evening at the game time, perfect for a full house.

The players on the list are actually decent, 3-4 played Eurobasket, and others are experienced club players.

Netherlands has a few interesting names, but they lack the height and are going to be too dependent on their threes shooting. Latvia, too, but Latvia has better options under the basket, so they should get plenty of second chances. 

To put spread at 7 is a bit too low, I expect 15+ for Latvia.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Como ML (-155 on FD) to win 1U

Write Up: Feels like a changing of the guard here on this thread recently so as a longtime lurker, I’ve decided to try my hand. Soccer and tennis are the sports I watch the most and am the most knowledgeable about so if this goes well expect my contributions to be made in those sports.

For our first <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> I’ve chosen Como to win at home. Not only are they undefeated in their last 11 they are undefeated at home since May. I’ve been riding this team with some great picks since last season and they have only upped their level under manager (and retired legend) Cesc Fabregas. Most recently, they won away from home against Torino. That game they were priced at +125 and won comfortably in a game that ended 5-1.

Como boasts a solid core with in form defenders Jacobo Ramon and Diego Carlos as well as attacking prowess with Nico Paz and Jayden Addai who’s bagged 3 goals in his last 2 games.

On the opposite side we have Sassuolo who have been pretty consistently middle of the pack for a few seasons now. Their most recently game was a 2-2 draw with 16th place Pisa who have been struggling. Of note is that they are undefeated away from home in their last four but these results have come against similarly middle of the pack teams or struggling sides. 

Overall, Como has conceded only 7 goals in 12 games as compared to Sassuolo’s 14. Expect Como to control the pace of the game and come out on top.</td></tr>

**Write up:**

Friday&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> is always a bit of a tricky one. That being said, there were a few options I was looking at, but we travel to the second level in England for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, specifically: Oxford.

And it isn&#x27;t the home side we are supporting <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, because Oxford&#x27;s season has not been close to what they would have liked: They are caught up in a relegation battle whilst sitting in 21st. Now let&#x27;s look at their most recent form: If we rank the table purely on results in their last 5 they are also sitting 21st, only getting 3 points out of 5 matches. It&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s a big difference in home or away games as they&#x27;ve only picked up 7 points in their 8 home matches this season, scoring only 8 times and conceding 12 times. Cameron Brannagan, one of Oxford&#x27;s topscorers with (only) 4 goals is out of the running with an injury and missed Tuesday&#x27;s matchup against Norwich (23rd) that ended in a 1-1 draw. Oxford got away with a point there because of a 95th minute winner, against a relegation side..

Now let&#x27;s take a look at Ipswich. After being relegated from the Prem last season they are desperately trying to get back up. They are currently sitting in a playoff spot (4th) after a bad start to the season. They haven&#x27;t lost in their last 5 matches and dominantly dealt with Hull on Tuesday. They have 4 players available that sit on 5 or more goal contributions, compared to Oxford who only have 20-year old Will Lankshear.

Anyone can win against anyone is what people always say about the Championship, but I don&#x27;t see Oxford winning against Ipswich <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.

&gt;After a 9-5 semifinal win over Saskatoon&#x27;s Team McEwen at the Scotiabank Centre in Halifax, Team Dunstone advance to the best of 3 final series against Team Jacobs. Dunstone&#x27;s draws were incredibly precise in the semis and it looks like he&#x27;s shaken whatever was holding him back earlier in the week after getting a nearly miraculous berth into the semis. Lott is also looking very strong and this final will be a very tightly fought battle. The line on this matchup is a huge overreaction to recent results. Team Dunstone are ranked ahead of Team Jacobs everywhere you look for this season so to get +1.5 with the number two team in the world is huge. Before this event, Dunstone had beaten Jacobs in four straight matchups. I think Dunstone has the better lineup in front of him and each of these final matches should remain very close, regardless of who wins.</td></tr>

Write-up: Good win for Kozlov, as he never looked to be in too much trouble. That brought me to **9 wins in a row**, and I&#x27;m looking to make it 10 with <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>! 

I don&#x27;t have a super long write-up for this play, as I had limited time and odds are dropping fast. However, I don&#x27;t believe that Mejia should be this big an underdog in these conditions. He loves playing on altitude clay (look at my Mejia <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> from earlier in the week for more details about that), and has breezed through his opening two matches in straight sets. Juan Pablo Varillas has been slowly building up some momentum after coming back from injury, but he might be low on stamina after making it all the way to the final in Guayaquil last week. Both players have earned similar performance ratings in their opening two matches, and I believe that Mejia&#x27;s backhand and serve are stable enough to keep up with Varillas&#x27;s firepower. There isn&#x27;t quite enough value for this to be a 2-unit play considering the risk involved, but I believe that a fair price for Mejia would be around +110.

Write Up: Its a do or die match for the Thunder, needing a win for them to stay alive. But, their team has been over reliant on their top order, as seen in their previous loss. On the other hand, I would still rate the Strikers a pretty decent team &amp; they need to win this to cement their run to the playoffs. Will be close game, but i still favor the Strikers, if their bowlers turn up.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>⭐️:🏈Texas A&amp;M ML (-130) \[BetMGM\]

Start Time &amp; TV: 7:30pm EST (ABC)

Units: 3 Units

Reasoning: Collaborating with my brother u/amphetaphene for this play <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>!! For some Black Friday football action well be going with a SEC rivalry showdown between the Texas A&amp;M Aggies (11-0) and the Texas Longhorns (8-3). The Aggies come into this one with a perfect record so far and they have played well on the road this year with road wins over Missouri, LSU, Arkansas and a very impressive road win in South Bend against Notre Dame. Although having an 11-0 record the Aggies have not clinched a spot in the SEC Championship game yet so they wont be letting off the gas at all in this one. Texas comes into this one with 8 wins and three losses against Ohio State, Georgia, and an embarrassing loss to a poor Florida team. In the Longhorns last game against Arkansas despite winning that game they showed their fatal flaw that has been a problem for them all year which is struggling to stop the quarterback run as Arkansas quarterback Taylen Green averaged over 9 yards a rush before exiting the game with injury so I think the Aggies and Marcel Reed will exploit this weakness as he is an explosive dual threat quarterback and averages over 5 yards a rush and has 6 rushing touchdowns on the year so I see him using his legs against the Longhorns in this one. This Aggies offense is a balanced offense having success in the run and the pass this year, averaging 270 passing yards per game and almost 200 rushing yards per game. They are 10th out of 136 FBS schools in points scored per game with over 38 points scored per game and they face a Texas defense that also has weaknesses in their secondary allowing over 240 passing yards per game but they are good at forcing turnovers. If the Aggies can limit turnovers in this one I see them coming out of Texas Memorial Stadium with a win to solidify a perfect 12-0 regular season. Texas A&amp;M Defense:

* 3,321 total opponent yards (301.9 YPG)
* 236 points allowed (21.5 PPG),
* 39 sacks (3.5 per game)
* 3 INTs (0.3 per game).
* A&amp;M’s pass rush is elite (top-5 in sack rate at 11.9%), forcing negative plays on 12% of rushes and collapsing pockets quickly.
* They’ve limited opponents to 183 passing YPG (best in SEC). Weakness: Secondary struggles in coverage without pressure (allowing 6.1 YPA when sacks are missed), leading to just 3 picks despite 56.5% opponent completion rate allowed. Texas Defense:
* 3,691 total opponent yards (335.6 YPG)
* 220 points allowed (20.0 PPG)
* 37 sacks (3.4 per game)
* 11 INTs (1.0 per game).
* Texas leads the nation in turnover margin (+8 from INTs alone),
* They’ve held 7 of 11 opponents under 300 total yards, excelling vs. the run (allowing 3.9 YPC). Weakness: Vulnerable to mobile QBs. Opponents average 85 rushing YPG). Marcel Reed is an elite mobile QB.

Prediction: 30-24 Aggies

Last pick:🏈Chiefs -3💩Whenever the Cheifs needed a stop they just couldnt get one.

Best of luck to everyone tailing and remember to bet responsibly! Super stoked with my first collab play with the college football king u/amphetaphene in this one, hope everyone has a great Black Friday!!🍀💜🐉

<tr><td class='post'>POTD Record: 2-0-0

Last POTD: **Midtjylland Over 3.5 team corners @ 2.00 1.5U (Bet365)** ✅️

Well, they end up getting 6 corners. I knew all they needed was a first-half goal push.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **Josh Hart RA Over 12.5 @ 1.74 2U** (Bet365)

**NBA | Bucks @ Knicks** 

J Hart has been quite consistent with playmaking and rebounding when he is given 30+ minutes. And this game will be quite important for the Knicks to clinch the group stage of the NBA Cup. So there will be a lot of playmaking. Knicks also have a good FG% in their last 10 games, with almost 50% of the attempts being on the basket(good for assists). Now analysing Hart stats without OG Anunoby (Should increase his usage and rebound):  
vs MIA: 5R+9A (14 RA)  
vs DAL: 10R + 5A (15RA)  
vs ORL: 5R + 2A (7RA)  
vs BKN: 12R + 7A (19RA)  
vs CHA: 8R + 7A (15RA)  
Hit 4/5 of the O12.5 RA

I was originally planning on taking KAT&#x27;s rebound over, but it is too inflated. Hart has the second-best defensive rebounding record in the Knicks.  Bucks are among the top teams to allow rebounds, so that&#x27;s an extra information to make the probability of this bet more hittable. GL 🍀.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: ADO Den Haag -1 Asian Handicap
+105 @bet365
 2 units 

Write Up:

ADO Den Haag is on fire and are on their way to promote back to the Eredivisie where they belong. In their last 4 games they average 2.8 goals. They have only lost once this season, drew once and won the 14 other games and top the league with 43 points.

They visit VVV Venlo, who have only won 1 game in their last 5 and lost the other 4. Over their last 5 games they average 0.6 goals, but concede 2.0. They have a lot of issues scoring and concede a lot against mid tier teams with more than 1 goal, that happened 3/5 last games. Now they are playing the best team in the league which are relentless.

Last season in May ADO Den Haag won 1-7 in Venlo.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:  **Georgia -13.5 (-120) 1.2U**

Write-Up:

I know that the initial reaction to this line is that the Yellow Jackets should be able to cover 14 points, they are ranked as the 23rd best team in college football. However, they have not had to play a team quite like Georgia yet. 

The Yellow Jackets just had a home game in Georgia against a Pittsburgh team and quickly showed up that when it matters most and the CFP is on the line, they are not up to the challenge. They ended up **losing that game by 14 to a Pitt team** that just got smacked by Notre Dame. Now they go up against this Georgia team that has finally hit their full stride with a **35-3 win over Charlotte** and an impressive **35-10 win over #10 Texas** at the time.

I expect this Georgia team, who might as well have home field advantage in the state of Georgia, to lay 21+ point win against the Yellow Jackets. 

Let&#x27;s continue this streak, huh!

Game: Lakers - Mavericks 🏀

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Max christie Over 10.5 points (-132 fanduel)

Reasoning: He’s facing his former team, which ranks 28th in the league at defending spot-up shooters, exactly where Max Christie gets most of his scoring opportunities. He also performs significantly better on the road, averaging 15 points away from home if you exclude the Minnesota game, where he struggled in limited minutes. 

Last season, he scored 10 and 11 points in his two matchups against the Lakers, so if you prefer a safer option, you can take his line at 10+ points for a smaller payout.

To sum it up: he has scored at least 9 points in every game this season except one, he’s in a strong matchup, he tends to play better on the road, and he’s going up against his former team. To me, this looks like an easy over, the books are simply undervaluing Max Christie.</td></tr>

I was thinking about taking Jazz ml, but I like this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> more due to the fact that Lauri never lets me down. He’s been a little cold as of late which I like because he’s due for a good game, the Kings are also very small in size at the moment, Sabonis is injured and the Jazz have a big lineup compared to them. I expect Lauri to dominate no matter who’s guarding him. I’ve had the hot hand since starting my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> journey and I don’t expect it to stop here.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **Nebraska +7.5 -145**

Write Up: Nebraska’s better 3rd down conversion rate and much higher total net yards, and you get a team that moves the ball more consistently and is less likely to fall behind by multiple scores. Iowa just doesn’t score enough to blow teams out, while Nebraska has the firepower to answer back. Put together, the numbers paint a simple picture: Nebraska has the tools to stay well within 7.5. while Iowa’s rushing attack is stronger, Nebraska is more balanced overall — they don’t need to rely on one phase to move the ball. Their ability to generate steady yardage on multiple fronts prevents the long scoring droughts that lead to big margins. I’ll take Nebraska in this one.</td></tr>

Reasoning: Getafe <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> up more cards than almost anyone in the league, averaging noticeably higher bookings than Elche, and their low-block, foul-heavy style under Bordalás always inflates their card count. Elche dominate more possession, which forces Getafe into repeated defensive actions, so the most likely outcome is Getafe finishing with more cards.

Last POTD: 🏈 Chiefs vs Cowboys under 52.5 (-110). ✖️

Writeup: 3rd quarter of the game is what I was expecting for around 3/4 of it, unfortunately too much offense in the first half to try to make this plausible.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: 🏈 Eagles team total under 26.5 (-113).

Game starts at 3pm EST. Bet 3U

Writeup: For the Black Friday game, we have the Philadelphia Eagles hosting the Chicago Bears. In all honestly, I’m all in on the Bears on this one. I think they have a real shot to win this game. I love Bears +7 in this spot, but we are going to deviate slightly with the same thought process as the market is pretty split on the spread, but there is massive support on the total under. 

The Bears offense looks as good as it has all season. They are firing on all cylinders and looks like the have a legitimate game plan and vision, both with the run and the pass. With that being said, the Eagles defense also looks as good as it has all season. This is going to be a huge battle, strength on strength.

The big difference will be the Eagles offense against the Bears defense. The Eagles offense has no vision, no cohesion, no identity. The fact that Saquon Barkley has shown such little explosion this season is insane. With this, the Eagles WRs, who have a top 3 1-2 punch at the position in the league, have been wildly inconsistent to the point that Devonta Smith is taking over as the WR1 in recent weeks. To top it off, Jalen Hurts has not been playing good football. Put all that together and add on the fact that the Bears are getting back their top defender in Jaylon Johnson, and this spells trouble. 

Game script is going to be huge in this one. The Eagles are going to need to find a way to play while having the lead and start running out the clock in the 4th in order to feel even somewhat comfortable. If they start playing from behind, it may start to spiral out of control. In either scenario, I think the Bears defense, who has been top 10 all season, keeps the Eagles in check throughout the game and limit them under 26.5 points. 

Remember to only bet what you can afford to lose, and BOL!</td></tr>

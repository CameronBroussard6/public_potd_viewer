**Record**: 0-0  
**Profit:** 

I will mostly focus on football bets, each bet being 1u and <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> I have a double in mind of 2 league leaders playing inferior opposition.

**Bet: ADO Den Haag to win + FC Porto to win**  
**Odds: 2.14**

**Reasoning:**

Both these teams are #1 in their leagues respectively. Porto in Portugal and ADO Den Haag in the KK Divisie, the second Dutch league.  
  
**Porto** won 17 of their last 18 matches including their last 10, only conceding 4 goals so far in their national league. Whilst Gil Vicente is also in good form they are simply worse than Porto on every single position on the pitch. They also won the away game againts Gil Vicente with a 2-0 scoreline. 

**ADO** are playing Vitesse, a team that was on the edge (and over) of bankruptcy and got leniency from the KNVB (Dutch Football Association). ADO have been dominating the league so far just hitting a relatively rougher patch recently losing their last 3. I believe that is the only reason we get these slightly acceptable odds to bet on as well having won 17 out of 22 in total. They actually had this mirrored matchup last week where they lost 2-1 even though dominating the bigger part of the game. I am confident they will end up with the win <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> also considering Vitesse conceded 2 or more goals in their last 3 away games playing worse teams than ADO.

Write Up: The Bulls host a Laker team that  is 25th in defensive ranking, allowing 117.8 PPG . Josh Giddey recently returned from injury last week, scored 21 in his first games back against the wolves and recorded 10 assists in his next game against Boston. The Bulls backcourt is banged up with  PG Tre Jones expected to be out for 2 weeks. So far Coby White has benefited from a scoring perspective, but I think Giddey’s size will benefit him against the Lakers. The only way this misses is if Giddey has both a minutes restriction and an inefficient shooting night. I think the backcourt depth and being a better matchup than Coby White neutralizes that risk. The market tends to agree with me as this jumped from 20.5 last night.

Write Up:

**Why the stats lean Under (233.5):** Indiana is a bottom-tier offense (**108.9 ORtg**, **.512 eFG%**) and already plays at only **100.6 pace**—that’s not the profile of a team that reliably pushes games into the mid-230s without help. The injury context further tilts that way: **Haliburton OUT** is a direct hit to Indiana’s creation/transition efficiency, and **Mathurin Q** adds downside risk to their scoring ceiling. Atlanta’s overall pace is high, but the market total needs both teams to get there; with IND’s scoring base weakened, you’re implicitly betting on ATL “dragging” them up, which is harder when Indiana’s half-court efficiency is the limiting factor.

**Why the model supports it:** With season-only inputs the sim lands around **ATL 117.8 – IND 112.6 (Total 230.4)**, with a median total \~**230** and **Under 233.5 hitting \~57%**. Importantly, ATL’s **lower FT rate profile** reduces the frequency of “easy points” that often push totals over.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Coby White o19.5 pts (-135) DraftKings 2u

**Write-up:** White has covered in 16 out of 21 games this season. Giddey is back in the lineup, and he has covered in 13 out of 16 with him. <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>, Zach Collins and Tre Jones are out. When Zach Collins is out, White has covered in 10 out of 12 (7/7 with Giddey). When Tre Jones is out, he is 4 out of 4 (4/4 with Giddey). Altogether, he is 3 out of 3. On games where he has had one day of rest, he is 8 out of 10.

The Lakers rank (25th all season / 8th last 7) in defending the shooting guard position. White tends to get most of his points from Transition scoring, <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> &amp; rolls, and spot-up shooting. This season, the Lakers are ranked 21st in transition defense. When Giddey and White play versus 20th or worse transition defenses, he has grabbed 20 points in 6 out of 6 games. The Lakers do defend spot-up shooters pretty well, ranking 10th. That hasn&#x27;t stopped White, as he has grabbed 20 points in 7 out of 8 games against rank 15 or better teams. The Lakers are also allowing a ton of points from inside the restricted area. They rank 21st in defending it. White takes 35% of his shots there, mostly from pump fake three, then driving. Against 20th or worse, he is 9 out of 10. In the Lakers&#x27; last five games, they are defending the three pretty well, but White is still over in about 70% of games against good three-point defenses. He can score in a variety of ways. This season, White has the highest usage share when he plays. He takes the third-most shots on the team, paired with the most three-pointers attempted at 7 per game and 9 in recent games. In his career against the Lakers, he actually has the highest usage share + field goals attempted when the Bulls play the Lakers. That would be 18.5 fga + 9.5 3pa. The volume will be there tonight, will be tough, depending on who Marcus Smart guards. I&#x27;m still pretty confident, considering he just had tough matchups and covered in all of them versus the Clippers (5th), Wolves (4th), and Celtics (2nd), who all defend the SG position very well.

Girona are in great form right now. They’ve won their last three matches and picked up four wins in their last six, showing real consistency and confidence. At home they’ve been playing aggressive football and creating a lot of chances.

Getafe are struggling badly. Over their last five games they average just 0.6 goals scored while conceding 2.2 per match. That pretty much says it all not much going forward and very shaky at the back.</td></tr>

Jolianne Fortin&#x27;s runback ability was on full display yesterday and that  should continue this morning. Their opponent, Team Einarson are coming off a 9-6 win over Team Stevens. Mégane Fortin, the Quebec lead, has been incredibly precise with her guards as well, which should allow them to keep this one close. Team Einarson, particularly Birchard, has been missing the hit and rolls in behind guards which will make those Quebec guards so much more valuable. Team Einarson came into this event 30-16 on the season while Team Fortin were 8-3 (against much lower competition). Team Fortin are one of the top junior teams in the country and this spread is not giving them enough credit.</td></tr>

**Game**: Penn State vs Ohio State | 7:00 PM EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>**: Penn State Nittany Lions +12.5 (-110) (Caesar’s)

**Write Up**: <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> is my birthday and I’m hoping to gift myself a win tonight!! 

My model has identified a profitable market inefficiency in tonight’s Big Ten matchup between Penn State and Ohio State. While the public is heavily weighing Ohio State’s 13-6 record and home court status, the efficiency metrics tell a different story that suggests this line is inflated by over 4 points.

**The &quot;True Line&quot; Inconsistencies**

My model projects this game as Ohio State -8.3, creating a massive 4.2-point edge against the current book line of +12.5. This season, conference home favorites of &gt;10 points are covering at a sub-48% rate when the opponent possesses a tempo variance of &gt;4.0 (this means Penn State plays faster than the Big Ten average). The model calculates an 11.6% Expected Value (EV) on this play; the highest on the entire slate.

**Efficiency Metrics &amp; The &quot;Backdoor&quot; Factor**

Despite Penn State’s 9-10 record, their offensive metrics are deceptively competitive for this specific matchup.

Possession Quality: Penn State ranks in the top tier of the conference in Free Throw Rate (converting 73.9% from the line). In a game projected for ~154 points, the ability to score with the clock stopped is critical for covering double-digit spreads.

Ohio State&#x27;s Defensive Liability: While the Buckeyes score 82.1 PPG (Rank 78), their defense allows 72.3 PPG (Rank 141). They do not possess the elite lockdown defense required to consistently blow out conference opponents by 13+ points.

**Recent Form &amp; Player Data**

Recency bias is suppressing Penn State&#x27;s value after a 98-71 loss to Wisconsin. However, that game was an outlier in shooting variance (Wisconsin shot 73.3% from the line and hit 15 threes).

Key Player: Keep an eye on Josh Reed. He is coming off an efficient 18-point performance (5-of-7 FG) against Wisconsin. His ability to stretch the floor will pull Ohio State&#x27;s bigs away from the rim, opening backdoor cutting lanes that are essential for staying within the number.

**Bottom Line**

We’re fading a public-heavy home favorite that is being asked to cover a number their defensive efficiency simply does not support. My model predicts a final score closer to Ohio State 83, Penn State 75, comfortably covering the +12.5 spread.

- Model Projection: Penn State +8.3
- Market Line: Penn State +12.5
- Edge: 4.2 Points
- Confidence: High (Lock of the Slate)

Event: ABA: Crvena Zvezda - Vienna, 19:00h

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Rasid Mahalbasic to score over 10.5 points, 1.90, 1.5u

Vienna is putting on some nice high-scoring games lately. They lose the games, but get to 90 points or so.

It is always the question of how serious Red Star is going to get into the game. After 3 wins in Euroleague, all eyes are on that competition, and this could be a simple any win will do game. On the other hand, if they lock it in from the start and start hitting, it can be a 40-point win. No way to know.

Hence, I found one player in the Vienna team, with constant numbers, who should get his 11+ points.

He did at least this in his last 6 games, and last 11/12 games. This should be easier if the game becomes garbage time from early on, and there is a good chance for that.</td></tr>

Ever since the venue has been shifted from Mumbai to Vadodara, batting hasn&#x27;t been easy for the teams. Black soil pitches are very tricky and bowlers enjoy playing here. There&#x27;s always help for the bowlers. 

Four matches have been played here and the highest score remains 178 whereas scores in excess of 180+ have been scored in the first venue. The stats have definitely shifted to the bowlers favour now. The line has not been breached in the last four matches played here.

RCB women have one of the best bowling line up with Lauren Bell troubling batters in the powerplay. Shreyanka has been impressive too. Adding to that, Mumbai Indians Women are over reliant on Nat and Harman. Sure they have decent quality but I feel with the added pressure on them, i expect fewer boundaries.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** **NBL - Bullets v Hawks: William Hickey over 18.5 Points and Assists 3U** $1.87 (Sportsbet) 7:35PM AEDT

This should be a very fast paced game. Brisbane and Illawarra are both bottom 3 in the league in PPG allowed per game - the exact type of game that a player like Davo thrives on. He is very aggressive getting to the rim and has become an excellent faciliter this season. With QJ peterson having turnover issues bringing the ball up the court and Tyler Harvey struggling with his 3 point shot the last few games, Davo Hickey remains the reliable point guard here. 

Without guys like JVF and McDaniel, Brisbane lack any sort of defensive presence that will stop this guy getting to the rim. Even with those guys, he went for 18 points and 8 rebounds the last matchup. His minutes may fluctuate between low 20s to 30 minutes a night but its now crunch time for this Hawks team if theyre any chance to make the post-season.

Once Hickey gets by his perimeter defenders, Brisbane dont offer much in interior defense either. They have one of the worst defenses in the league and allow the highest FG % from opponents. Davo takes nearly all of his shots around the rim and with two smart bigs in Javale and Froling who set solid screens, he should see plenty of looks tonight to either lay it up or lay it off to someone down low. 

If you can&#x27;t get PA, consider splitting your units between his points and assists lines.

AZ are surprisingly worse at home (2-0-9) than on the road (5-2-5). Sort of a Tottenham situation. They are currently playing against an Almere side whom are flying high, having won five 1^(st) division games in a row. AZ themselves have failed to string back to back wins, i.e. winning away against MVV but losing at home against Top Oss. Winning away against Roda, losing at home against Utrecht. And now they have won away against Venlo in their most recent game…

On the H2H end both teams are pretty evenly matched with Almere being 4-1-5. They leave it late a lot though and have won by 1 goal margins mostly.

NBA | Bulls vs Lakers | 🏀  

Giddey is working his way back to his normal minutes after returning from his injury, looked phenomenal last game against the Celtics who is a way tougher matchup for RA’s where he ended with 18 RA &amp; 25 RA chances in 24 minutes. Lakers are top 5 in assists allowed this season and have been leaking weakside rebounds where Giddey is active when he’s on the floor.

In his last two games against the Lakers he’s had 25 &amp; 27 RA’s, obviously with normal minutes but a side he finds success against. 

Should be in store for 25-30 minutes here, Tre Jones is also out for this game so definitely upside for Giddey as Bulls are missing a real facilitator when he’s not on the floor, could even be starting imo.

Usage and production is still there despite his minutes and hes shown he is effective in the minutes he’s getting right now, great matchup against the Lakers now who’s been a great spot to take guards for assists especially this season.</td></tr>

H2H this is usually a good game, with the BTTS hitting 5/6 meetings and with the current form both are in they are I expect Coventry (who sit pretty in 1st) to win while Norwich who are in good form to put one between Coventry&#x27;s posts. Historically the corners has gone under in 9/10 last matchups, with Coventry currently seeing 5/6 in their last games. It is played at Norwich&#x27;s home which takes the home team&#x27;s (Norwich) corner total from \~10.4 down to \~9.8, with Coventry seeing around \~10.3-10.5 home and away respectively.

Two units 

Let me preface by saying he is listed as questionable and this would be his first game back since spraining his thumb. I recommend using DraftKings or FanDuel or a sports book that does have an injury protection in case he enters and quickly reaggrevates it. With that said, he’s been out three weeks and should be good to go. Atlanta is in the bottom third in total defense and bottom third defending guards. Both teams like to play with pace, so there should be a high scoring game. He averages 18 points in eight games versus Atlanta. Season average is 17.5 points. With him only needing 14 points, I’m willing to roll the dice. You could also consider taking 12+ points at -170 or 180. I understand wanting to wait to see the injury report before deciding, but with a thumb injury, if he&#x27;s not feeling 100%, I&#x27;d expect he sits and this voids.</td></tr>

**Start Time:** 7:10PM ET

**Odds:** \-110 (fanduel)

**Units:** 5U

**Reasoning:** The **Cavaliers -4.5 spread vs. the Orlando Magic** is a solid bet for several reasons. First, Cleveland won their **last encounter against Orlando**, showing they can control the game and exploit Orlando’s weaknesses. The Cavs have a **balanced offense** led by their key scorers, who are all healthy and in good form, allowing them to consistently put up points. Defensively, Cleveland matches up well against Orlando, who struggles against teams that can shoot efficiently from the perimeter and move the ball quickly. Additionally, Cleveland has a strong track record of **covering similar spreads against lower-ranked teams**, making it likely they’ll win by at least 5 points again. Overall, the matchup, recent head-to-head history, and team form all favor the Cavs covering this spread.

FYI I make the bets that i&#x27;m sharing. I want to get to a point where this becomes profitable.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>: Spain | La Liga | 3pm Eastern | Getafe vs Girona | BTTS NO U2.5 | 2U @ -128

I’m taking Getafe vs Girona BTTS No &amp; Under 2.5 because this matchup consistently points toward a low-scoring, controlled game.
Getafe matches are typically slow and defensive, especially away from home, and they rarely open games up unless they fall behind. Girona, while solid, tend to be more pragmatic against compact sides and are comfortable winning without pushing the tempo. Recent head-to-head meetings and overall scoring trends for both teams show very few high-goal games, with one side often failing to score.
With neither team built to play end-to-end football and both prioritizing structure over risk, this sets up well for a 1-0 or 2-0 type result rather than a shootout. That makes BTTS No combined with Under 2.5 goals the most logical angle for how this game is likely to play out.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Melbourne Victory Vs Sydney FC - **Sydney FC Win or Draw (Double Chance) @ 1.72 (Melbet)**

**Write Up:** Melbourne Victory return home under pressure after two straight league losses slowed their momentum. While their attack still looks capable of creating chances, defensive lapses have started to creep in. Sydney FC arrive with mixed form, showing flashes of control in some matches but falling apart in others. Victory are coming off a 2-1 loss away to Adelaide United, following a narrow 1-0 home defeat to Western Sydney Wanderers. Those results have disrupted what was previously a strong run at AAMI Park, where Victory had been scoring freely and playing with confidence.

Before that setback, Melbourne Victory put together back-to-back home wins against Perth Glory and Wellington Phoenix, scoring eight goals across those two matches. Their attacking threat hasn’t dropped off, but the recent losses exposed moments where control slipped late in games. At AAMI Park, Victory have scored at least two goals in three of their last four league matches. However, they have also conceded in three of those games, which is why matches here often remain open and competitive well into the second half.

Sydney FC come into this after a 2-0 home loss to Wellington Phoenix, a game where they struggled to create chances and looked shaky at the back. That followed a 0-0 draw away at Melbourne City, which showed a more cautious and disciplined side. Away from home, Sydney have been fairly effective, winning two of their last four league matches. A comfortable 3-0 win at Macarthur and a tight 1-0 victory at Perth Glory both came from staying organised and taking their chances, rather than dominating the game throughout.

Sydney’s away performances show better balance and game management, while Victory come into this after back-to-back losses that exposed defensive issues despite their attacking threat. Overall, the teams look quite evenly matched, and this game should be decided by fine margins.

Even though it’s an away fixture, I think Sydney has a slight edge. The head-to-head also leans their way, with Sydney winning two of the last three meetings and keeping clean sheets in both wins, including a convincing 3-0 victory earlier this season.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Ben Shelton 🇺🇸 ML vs Casper Ruud 🇳🇴 5 units to win 3.1U @1.61 (Bet365)

Was waiting for some extra line movement but I still like these odds and find that a fair price would be around 1.5 for the play. Shelton turns into a different animal in grand slams, being 16-4 in the category since last year. His losses have come against Sinner, Alcaraz which are understandable and… Mannarino so it’s clear how dominant he becomes at this level. The No. 7 has built a lot of his ranking on these prestigious tournaments as it’s clear he brings his best tennis to the big stage better than anyone else. He made his proper breakthrough on tour here in Australia in 2023 when he reached the quarters, losing to Tommy Paul. Shelton has built a lifetime 14-3 record at the happy slam with his other two losses coming against Sinner in the semis last year and… Mannarino in 2024. Thank God it’s Ruud and not Mannarino in front of him <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Ben hasn’t dropped a set this tournament despite having a really tough opener against Humbert and as per usual in slams has been excellent on serve with the forehand still firing missiles. When his serve + one combo is in full flow it becomes completely unplayable and so very tough to break him. He only conceded a singular break point in his last two matches to Vacherot and Sweeny. The progression of Shelton has been remarkable over the past two years as his baseline game and patience have drastically improved. Despite them being far from perfect, he will have more chances to break serve than Ruud will on return. 

Ruud has also had a pretty solid run to the fourth round defeating Bellucci, Munar and Cilic. He could leave the tournament to be with his wife at any moment’s notice with a baby on the way. I’m not factoring this into the write-up as it means nothing. The AO historically hasn’t smiled at Ruud with him being 11-6 at the tournament and never gone past the 4th round of it. For a former No. 2 it’s less than ideal. He went very close to going five sets against another big server in Cilic, who was a break up in the fourth and stayed competitive despite a low first serve percentage of 53% and with more flaws at this age than Shelton. Whilst Casper can certainly play on hard courts, it’s clear that clay is his surface with two French Open finals and a masters 1000 on the surface. He likes having time and use his excellent topspin forehand to push the opponent back and create angles, a strategy that is extremely effective on clay courts but not as good on faster courts. However when he’s rushed the errors start to undo his game and loses grip in rallies which is exactly what Ben will do to him. Especially since Shelton is left handed and therefore his forehands will often land on Ruud’s inconsistent backhand this could be a problem for the Norwegian as the match continues.  I predict Ben to win 3-1. BOL !</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: 🏀 Duke ML + Arizona ML (+125)

Game 1 starts at 7pm EST. Bet 2.4u

Writeup: Let’s go for win number 40 with a plus money play. In my mind, there are only 3 truly elite teams currently in men’s college hoops. 2 of them are Duke and Arizona. 

Let’s start with Duke vs Louisville. Louisville actually has a really solid offense, I would argue top 10 in the nation. However, their weakness (relatively speaking) is their defense, ranking around the top 35 mark. Duke has a top 5 unit on both sides of the court, which doesn’t help Louisville considering they haven’t really been challenged with an elite offense this season. Louisville’s offense vs Duke’s defense could go either way, but I think Duke has had more experience against better teams and should have their offense rolling with their home crowd supporting them against the Louisville defense.

Now for Arizona vs BYU. Arizona is arguably the top team in the nation, and a similar argument for Duke can be used here as well. Arizona also has a top 5 unit on both sides of the ball, with the biggest standout being their height and size advantage. They go up against a BYU squad with a defense outside the top 25 and Arizona has been lighting up top 50 defenses all season, with many of their wins being double digit victories. BYU’s offense should be able to be relatively effective throughout the game, but even with their home crowd supporting, I expect Arizona’s size to be the difference here and to have a big rebounding advantage.

Last Pick: Oh my god Chet Holmgreen I love you and hate you how the hell do you get board so inconsistently. We cash but jesus not good for the heart lmfao

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Jalen Johnson over 22.5 Points.**

Risky bet I&#x27;m taking a chance that he is back to his old self.

His last 3 games showed that he is most likely back to his old self, 23 points 18 boards 9 assists, 32 points 15 boards 8 assists, 28 points 16 boards and 6 assists. However, the three games before that were shocking: Lakers 13 points 3 boards and 6 assists, Portland 12 points 11 boards and 6 assists and Celtics 12 points 8 boards and 5 assists. 

Indiana is a decent matchup for Johnson and I think he will have more opportunities than Onyeka due to the fact he usually sits on the three point line. I think Johnson being the main ball handler will open more gaps for himself then everyone else.

Players that can get to the rim have a fairly good success rate in scoring, JB 30 points, Zion 27 and 29 points. 

Now these are assumptions that may actually have nothing to do with his performance but this is why I think these stats are starting to increase again. His poor performance began when CJ joined this team, it quite literally started when CJ played his first game with Atlanta, his playstyle is very dominant and plays a similar or identical game to Johnson. This can be seen with CJ taking the game winning shot running the clock against the Bucks which led to the loss.The teams were on the road or against very good defenses for his matchup, for example Celtics, Blazers and the Lakers.</td></tr>

Tennis | Quimper Challenger | 6:20 AM EST (estimated)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Pavel Kotov vs Christoph Negritu | **Negritu ML at +150. 1 unit.**

Write-up: Kind of a frustrating match. Seyboth Wild showed great resilience to get from 3-5 15-40 to 5-5 in the first set, but was promptly broken and lost it. He won the second set, but then started having fitness issues in the third set, which was why I was concerned about taking his ML. In reality, though, I probably should have avoided the match altogether. 

As the Australian Open moves towards its conclusion, the Challenger circuit is also heating up, with a pretty stacked event in Quimper, France beginning on Monday. The market has moved slightly towards Kotov since this match opened, and in some ways I understand why. Kotov is a former Top 50 player who even made an ATP final on this surface in 2023, and while he experienced severe backsliding in terms of his fitness and results in 2024 and 2025, a new season always brings new possibilities. However, I was able to find some footage of a French interclub match that Kotov played a couple months into his offseason, and was not impressed at all by his level. While the result of the match, a third-set loss to Arthur Bouqier, doesn&#x27;t seem terrible, his movement looked slow and lumbering, and it felt as if Bouquier&#x27;s errors were the only thing keeping him in the match. He was also having a ton of trouble getting first serves back in play, and that could mean trouble against Negritu, who does most of his damage with a booming serve. Negritu has played three indoor tournaments to start the season, and while he hasn&#x27;t experienced great results, his opponents have also played quite well, and he did win a doubles title in Glasgow. I think Negritu&#x27;s match sharpness should help him here against a Kotov playing his first match of the new season, and he has enough consistency from the baseline to move Pavel around. On paper, Kotov is a superior player, but it&#x27;s been so long since he&#x27;s shown that level that it&#x27;s hard to justify him being the favorite here.</td></tr>

Event: Pacers at Hawks 


<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Jalen Johnson over 9.5 rebounds 


Write Up: I continue my pattern of losing spectacularly. One thing with my picks lately, there&#x27;s no sweat. Either win or lose, it&#x27;s not close. Henderson barely even saw the field, lowest snap count all year. 


Moving on, the Pacers visit the Hawks. Jalen Johnson is averaging 10.5 rebounds on the season, 10.3 at home. Over his last 10, he&#x27;s averaging 11.3, and he&#x27;s hit this total in 6 of his last 10, but 4 of his last 5. Last time he played the Pacers, he had 13 rebounds. 


The Hawks are also on 3 days rest, and Jalen averages 11.4 rebounds on 3 days rest. Everything looks good on his side to at least make his average. 


Now on the other side, Indiana is the worst in the NBA at rebounds allowed, and they&#x27;re worse on the road. Not much else to say about them. 


All the factors are in place for Jalen to at least hit his average, which is all we need. Very likely on extra rest and against the team who allows the most rebounds in the league, he&#x27;ll go over his average. 


Hoping for the good kind of no sweat game where he clears this easily like 4 of his last 5, not the bad kind where he inexplicably only gets THREE SNAPS THE WHOLE GAME FOR NO REASON or something like that, not that I&#x27;m bitter.

BRYANT strikes and incredibly week race here resuming, and has jumped out quite sharply. Last prep bumped into RAGING FORCE, who went on to win another 3 races and run 2nd in the Gothic, so this race is definitely a step down from that. Finally gets onto a good track and that’s where I think the key lies with this horse, every other run has been on one that’s rain affected. We will be back in the ruck, trusting T Berry to time his run perfectly and get us over the top.    
     
Other half of the multi lies with FAIRWAY TO HEAVEN, a talented horse with only the one start. That start races behind multiple winners when finishing 3rd, and it’s 2 trials in this time have been elite. Was close to tipping FTH as the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> outright, but kinda want the safer option right now. We will sit behind likely leader FARFETCHED, and should just pop out in the straight and run a drum.

Write-Up: 6 In a row!!! This is my last day posting on this account before my account Own_Topic5302 is unbanned, let’s keep this insane momentum going! The Kings are coming to Columbus to play the Blue Jackets. For the Blue Jackets, Jet Greaves is in net, he has been great this season holding a .908 save percentage and a 2.66 goals against average. Last game against the lightning he had 5 goals on him, but this is a good bounce back opportunity playing a low scoring team like the Kings. In net for the Kings is Darcy Kuemper, Darcy has been consistently good every year, having at least a .900 save percentage every season but 2 in his 12 year career. This season, Kuemper has a .902 save percentage and just a 2.45 goals against average. Blue Jackets don’t get a lot of offense, ranking 19th in goals this season. On the other side, the Kings struggle very much offensively ranking 30th in goals this season but they are good at limiting shots against their goalie. This season the kings allow the 11th least shots against their goalie. With the Kings not being good offensively and Jet Greaves being in net. I believe this will be hard for them to score. On the other hand, the Blue Jackets are pretty bad offensively, and Kings are good at limiting shots on goal.

Football / Serie A / Verona vs Udinese

  <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Udinese win or draw (X2) &amp; Under 3.5 goals @1.69 1Xbet (1unit)

 Write-up:
Not the most exciting game on paper, but a very important one for both sides. Verona are bottom of the table and in terrible form with just two wins in their last 23 matches and only four goals scored in their last six games. On top of that they’re dealing with a long injury list and still look very short of ideas going forward.

Udinese aren’t in great form either but they’re clearly the more stable side overall. They have the better squad on paper and usually get results against Verona with many recent H2H meetings ending in draws. Verona are under huge pressure to survive, and that often leads to nervous and cautious football rather than anything positive which is why I’m happy to side with Udinese to at least avoid defeat here.

I’m also expecting a low scoring game. Both teams have serious problems in attack, and even the managers have admitted they’re lacking quality in the final third. The last four meetings between these two finished under 2.5 goals, and given the current form and situation, it’s hard to see this turning into anything open or high scoring.

The main risks are an early goal, especially if Verona score first, which could change the game flow, or a red card that turns a slow match into chaos. There’s also the motivation factor Verona are desperate for points, while Udinese are comfortable in mid-table, so a narrow home win is still possible.

Overall, based on form, quality, and trends, Udinese avoiding defeat in a low-scoring match feels like the most logical and safest angle. Realistic scorelines are 0–0, 0–1, 1–1, or 1–2.

Good luck to anyone riding with me on this one, hope it lands ✌️</td></tr>

**Last:** (CBB) Florida -11.5 (1.5u) - ❌

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** (CBB) No. 1 Arizona (-2.5) at No. 13 BYU

**Start Time:** 9:00 PM ET (ESPN)

**Odds:** -110 (FanDuel)

**Units:** 1.5U

**Reasoning:** No other team in college basketball has a bigger target on its back right now than undefeated Arizona.

Night in and night out, the Wildcats (20-0) are consistently on the receiving end of their opponents’ best shot. But the team doesn’t just absorb the contact, it counters with a knockout blow of its own. And it isn’t just a bunch of slouches that Arizona has been beating up on, as the team has racked up a national best eight Quad 1 victories, including wins over then-No. 3 Florida, No. 3 UConn, No. 12 Alabama, No. 15 UCLA and No. 20 Auburn. It all leaves the Wildcats just one win shy of their best start since 2013-14 and two shy of matching the program-best 22-game win streak set from 1914-17. 

It’s been a multi-pronged attack on offense that has led the way for Arizona.

Only once this season has the same player led the team in scoring in back-to-back games with seven different players topping 20+ points this season. The combined effort has the Wildcats among the nation’s best offensively, ranking 5th in field-goal percentage (51.6%), 7th in offensive efficiency (1.207), 8th in scoring (89.8 PPG) and 54th in three-point shooting (36.4%). The unit will be challenged against a stiff BYU defense that enters ranked 23rd in defensive efficiency (0.955), 37th in opponent field-goal percentage (41.0%), 71st in scoring defense (70.1 PPGA) and 85th in opponent three-point shooting (31.8%). However, the unit has been a little more generous as of late, conceding 78.9 points on 44.5% shooting (38.9% from beyond the arc) over its last four games.

Furthermore, take a look at how Arizona has fared against opponents who rank Top 50 in defensive efficiency: 

* UConn (8): 71 points on 46% shooting (20% from beyond the arc)
* Cincinnati (13): 77 points on 43% shooting (23% from beyond the arc)
* TCU (31): 86 points on 51% shooting (44% from beyond the arc)
* West Virginia (32): 88 points on 53% shooting (43% from beyond the arc)
* Florida (41): 93 points on 49% shooting (40% from beyond the arc)

Not only did the Wildcats still average an impressive 83 points per game, but the team topped 46% shooting in all but once of those games. Not to mention, outside the contests against the Huskies and Gators, the rest of the games were decided by 13 points or more.

Fortunately for the Cougars (17-2), they pack a punch of their own offensively.

Through 19 games, the team ranks 20th in offensive efficiency (1.183), 20th in scoring (86.8 PPG), 25th in field-goal percentage (49.1%) and 99th in three-point shooting (35.4%). Fresh off a 43-point effort on Saturday, star freshman AJ Dybantsa will look to stay hot. Unfortunately, Arizona has just the defense that can fan the flames, ranking 5th in defensive efficiency (0.908), 13th in opponent field-goal percentage (39.2%), 31st in scoring defense (67.6 PPGA) and 71st in opponent three-point shooting (31.4%). Not only is the unit coming off consecutive games of holding opponents below 60 points and 35% shooting, but in seven contests against offenses ranked in the Top 100 in offensive efficiency, the Wildcats have conceded a respectable 73.6 points on just 40.3% shooting (32.2% from deep). Conversely, in six outings against opponents who rank Top 100 in defensive efficiency, BYU has managed just 75.5 points on 43.3% shooting (32.5% from beyond the arc). 

Look for Arizona’s size to prove to be a difference-maker in this one. 

Per KenPom, the Wildcats rank 7th in average height and 30th in effective height. That size has paid dividends especially on the glass, where the team ranks 2nd in total rebounding (43.4 per game), 3rd in defensive rebounding (28.5) and 6th in offensive rebounding (12.4) while ranking 2nd in opponent defensive rebounding (17.8), 9th in opponent total rebounding (29.9) and 70th in opponent offensive rebounding (8.2). That could make life difficult for a Cougars defense that ranks just 116th in opponent points in the paint (30.2 PPG), 130th in opponent offensive rebounding (8.6) and 289th in opponent second-chance points (12.4 PPG). To make matters worse, Arizona just so happens to rank 2nd in points in the paint with 45.9 points per game. 

In what should be a back-and-forth game, look for the battle-tested Wildcats to pull away when it matters.

NORWICH VS COVENTRY

Date: 26 JANUARY 2026 at 21:00

BET ON: Over / Under- Over +2.50

Odd: 1.67



\- Norwich under Philippe Clement are actively shifting toward an aggressive, goal-orientated identity — he has repeatedly emphasised pressing, attacking intent and collective goal threats, saying his side will “press, be aggressive and play to score goals” rather than sit back, especially now they’re fighting out of relegation danger. Despite defensive issues (key defenders like Shane Duffy, Gabriel Forsyth, Jeff Schlupp and Mirko Topic out injured) and limited numbers at the back, Clement has praised the team’s collective attacking output (five different scorers in the 5–0 West Brom win) and wants to continue building confidence through forward momentum. That lifting of the attacking ethos is crucial — a bottom-of-the-table side that historically leaks goals is now encouraged to take risks high up, and that often translates to open games with multiple goals.

\- On the other side, Frank Lampard’s Coventry are chasing a Premier League promotion push and his press comments make the priorities clear — his focus remains on intense attacking football and staying ‘diligent’ in creating chances, even after recent setbacks. Lampard has masterminded a team that scores at will while also continuing to generate momentum and club optimism, with players urged to attack vertically, move the ball forward quickly and pressure opponents constantly — a style that statistically yields high xG and goal involvement. Although Coventry’s recent winless streak has shown some vulnerability, Lampard has described wins like the 2–1 vs Leicester as “massive” and praised his side’s ability to control difficult games and score key goals under pressure.

\- With both coaches publicly committing to proactive attacking approaches, struggling defences (especially Norwich’s injury-hit backline), and Coventry maintaining one of the league’s most potent goal outputs, this fixture is tactically structured to see chances at both ends rather than cautious containment — making Over 2.5 goals a highly plausible and compelling outcome.</td></tr>

Teams/Time: BLG vs. JDG (6:00 AM EST.)

Writeup:

* Error line on Thunderpick, not sure why this got traded to 3.5 but is a huge mistake, as is GALA line at 2.5. ADC&#x27;s have the highest kill share of any role and are currently set way too low in both cases. Earlier on when this line opened, Viper was 5.5/6.5 at + money. 
* Viper is averaging 5 kills per map so far this split. Last split in LCK Viper averaging 5.3 kills in Summer split, both well above this line. BLG are currently between -200/-220 favorites to win this series so they are decent favorites coming into this game
* Viper has a 8/12 hitrate so far this split for BLG with 7/8 cover rate in wins with the only miss being a hook. JDG just beat BLG 2-0 and in this series Viper got the least kills of mid/jungle/adc. This isn&#x27;t a normal trend for this team and expecting them to make the adjustment and focus on getting Viper kills/resources in this series the second time around
* In map wins viper is averaging 6.12 kills per map so far, as said above most adc lines that are favorites is set to 5.5 kills at lowest you will see 4.5, this line is an error, BLG should win this series and are the better team overall. 
* Slamming this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> and also laddering O 4.5 Kills at + money is insane value. As said above Gala line is also currently an error on Thunderpick, would highly recommend playing both lines as their is almost 100% guarantee 1/2 hit their error line and both hitting is very likely with both being 2 kills lower then what they should be.</td></tr>

Ben has been playing excellent tennis so far this tournament. He’s won all 3 matches in straight sets despite having a pretty tough draw so far. He has always done well in this tournament and has a lot of points to make up for his ranking. With Sinner likely waiting in the quarters, he will want to be as fresh as possible for a chance at an upset.

He’s going up against Ruud, who has also been playing well in this tournament. His only lost set so far was to Cilic in the last round. However, he’s never advanced farther than the 4th round here in Australia, and I suspect that to continue here. Ben has more weapons and if he is playing well, I don’t see Ruud being able to do much to stop it.

Good Luck!</td></tr>

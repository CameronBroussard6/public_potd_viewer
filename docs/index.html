🌶️ Overall: 52-32-1 

2026 PDC 🎯 World Championships: 1-0

Previous: 

Madars Razma (-161) v Jamai van den Herik ✅ 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Mervyn King (+120) v Ian White

Razma takes care of business for us on Day 1, winning 3-1, but with all but one set going down to that pivotal 5th leg. Even with a less-than-stellar performance, Madars turned it on down the stretch and advances to the next round. 

Here on Day 2 I am dead set on playing a slight underdog - really like the current world #125 Mervyn “The King” King to defeat current world #51 Ian “Diamond” White.

Do not be fooled by the current world ranking disparity here - King has a plethora of experience at the highest levels of darts, albeit some time ago. King reached the World Championship SF &amp; was Premier League runner up in 2009. More recently, King had his best PDC ranked finish at the 2021 Masters, a darts major, ultimately losing 8-11 in the Finals to Jonny Clayton. 

Since 2021, King took a bit of a hiatus from darts, though he has returned and been grinding hard on the Modus &amp; PDC Tours this year. 

King disclosed this year that a large factor in his hiatus was due to filing bankruptcy, as he owed $500k in unpaid taxes, admitting to reporters he was unaware he needed to pay taxes on his winnings. 

Ian White has been a consistent player on the PDC since 2010, but he has zero televised titles and has not won on the PDC Tour since 2020. White also historically has been solid at scoring, particularly hammering that triple-20, but his finishing has long been his biggest weakness. 

One other point worth noting on the Diamond is that- White has not won a single match on the PDC since October 14 of this year, finishing the tour season with four consecutive first round exits. 

Lastly, since 2021 these two have met three times in ranked matches. In those matches, King is 3-0, winning each 6-0; 6-3; 6-3 respectively. 

I expect more of the same from White in this one, struggling on the outer ring and letting King hang around. Expect King to keep pace on scoring, while punishing White for his finishing mistakes. I believe King still has tremendous talent, and entering with a bit of a chip on his shoulder, will prove it to the darts world <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.</td></tr>

Leonard got completely destroyed and her performance was awful. A bad look on my end as two previous tournament wins probably made her a bit more tired than usual and not so invested in Limoges. Sorry to those who tailed these last two losses.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** **Kalinina vs Parks - Kalinina Handicap -2 Games @ 1.89**

Kalinina appears in this tournament after a long break, and she impressed me quite a lot when she faced Kartal, showing solid groundstrokes from both sides and a gigantic clutch ability when it came to saving break points. While it&#x27;s true that Kartal had the chance to dominate the first set, it was clear that Kalinina stepped up after breaking back, and her typical &quot;warrior&quot; mentality ended up being the main difference. She&#x27;s not the most flashy player you&#x27;ll see, but she plays simple and efficient tennis. 

When it comes to Parks, I was expecting much more from her in Angers, but she had an awful match against Korpatsch, where she lost on her own with unforced errors and a low first serve percentage. While I recognize that Parks can play well on this surface when her serve is on fire, things quickly change when that particular weapon is not on point. I feel like any player who&#x27;s a decent returner can really punish Parks on the second serve and just keep the point alive until she makes an unforced error. 

Kalinina is known for always trying to stay on each rally and produce sharp angles, especially from the forehand. This playstyle is usually a good recipe to beat someone like Parks, who is currently 0-3 against Kalinina, with each loss happening on a different surface (Hard, Clay, and Grass). The American was never able to take a set from Kalinina.

With the momentum and the confidence of beating someone like Kartal just in the 2nd match since her return, I feel like Kalinina will find a much easier path to victory against Parks.

Good luck!</td></tr>

⚽️Bundesliga, Union Berlin vs RB Leipzig, 12/12/25 Fri, 2:30 pm Eastern Time

Explanation: Leipzig is coming in near top of the standings come with 9 wins, 2 draws, 2 losses and a +15 goal difference (28 scored, 13 conceded) through 13 games, while Union is not doing too well in 12th place, with just 4 wins, 3 draws, 6 losses and a negative goal difference. Also Berlin is in bad form losing there last 3 while Leipzig has won 3 of there last 4 with a draw as there non win.

Leipzig is generating about 1.77 expected goals for (xG) per game and allowing only 1.39 xG against, so they consistently create more and better chances than they concede, whereas Union are around 1.3 xG for and 1.5 xG against. 

Also, Leipzig is averaging roughly 16–17 shots per match compared to Union’s 12, which matters because over 90 minutes that shooting volume plus higher xG per shot tends to translate into at least one or two “big” chances created, which is crucial to score the goals necessary to win. 

Leipzig’s high-tempo, vertical attacking style,  pressing and pace in transition are exactly the recipe for them to win this match.</td></tr>

Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Luke Littler u5.5 180’s❌

My theory was correct but maybe my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> was flawed. Littler came out to a slow start, and the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> looked good with only 1 180 in the first set, however, Labansuskas put up way more of a fight than I expected giving Littler more legs with darts in his hands, leading to too many chances for 180’s. Onto the next. 

Event: PDC World Championship (Darts) : Niels Zonneveld v. Haupai Puha 7:30am EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Niels Zonneveld -1.5 (-130), 2u to win 1.5u

Write Up: Puha has not looked good recently, losing his last 6 matches all by a good chunk. Zonneveld is coming off a loss to Nick Kenny in the players championship finals, however he averaged a 92.41 in that match and had 19 100+ throws in 10 legs. Zonneveld was just unable to hit his doubles, which I think will be corrected coming into the World Championship. Zonneveld and Puha have gone H2H twice this year, 6-1 Zonneveld and 5-6 Puha. However I feel Puha’s downtrend and Zonneveld’s consistency could allow Zonneveld to even take this match in straight sets.</td></tr>

Last Five Predictions (Old - New): ✅✅❌✅✅

Net Units: +25.64

Yesterday&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Roma to beat Parma and u3.5 total goals. 3u @ $2.05 ✅

2-1 win to Roma.

Really happy with this one. They definitely made us sweat with the first goal in the 63rd minute. 

However, Roma scored twice and looked set to run out 2-0 winners. However, Parma scored late to get it back to 2-1... Which is basically exactly why we covered the Roma to win and 3.5 line. Just in case Parma scored a jammy goal. 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Bangkok Utd v FC Samut Sakhon. Over 3.5 Goals AND KuPS to win v Gnistan. 3u @ $2.20

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Combining two legs here. If you&#x27;re not one to do that, I like the o3.5 for the Bangkok game, or KuPS -1 handicap. 

First up, we&#x27;re at the Thai FA Cup. One of the best teams in Thailand, Bangkok United, plays away to 3rd division FC Samut Sakhon.

Samut Sakhon are doing well in the third tier and are sitting in second place after four games. 

Bangkok United are second in the top division and in great form in both the league and in the Champions League 2, which is basically the Europa League of Asia. 

Plenty of these early cup games have crazy high scores, so I like the o3.5 and that covers us a fair bit. 

Along with that, we&#x27;re in Finland, where top of the table KuPS host IF Gnistan. 

Gnistan have struggled since the league split into the championship group, going 0-1-6. 

KuPS want to keep winning to maintain their lead at the top. There are only 3 games left, and a loss here could see them drop to second depending on other results. 

KuPS should win this.</td></tr>

WTA HONG KONG 4:30AM MST

RAVENS @ MIAMI 6:15PM MST

Leg 1 - Eala has been in really bad form, losing 4 of her last 5, with the only win being a walkover retirement win in round 1. Mboko has looked sharp in the past few matches, winning 3 of her last 4, with that loss being to the wrecking ball Rybakina. Both young rising stars, but Mboko is better and should win.

Leg 2 - Baltimore gets torched through the air by wide receivers. Washington has cleared 20 yards in 3 straight, 30 in 2 straight, and his overall involvement has been climbing. With Tua looking great last week and Lamar returning, this should be a high scoring, competitive game. Dude will probably cash this on 1 catch vs the Ravens.</td></tr>

**Verona - Milano** 🏐 Italy - Superlega UTC 19:30

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **Verona -1.5 Set Handicap** @ 1.55 Betsson

Verona has made a flawless start to the 2025-2026 season. Winning both of its first two matches, they share the top spot with reigning champions Trentino with 6 points. The team demonstrated its fitness by defeating Piacenza 3-1 in the first week and Grottazzolina 3-0 away in the second. One of the key factors behind this success is the appointment of **Fabio Soli**, the coach who won the championship with Trentino last season. Under Soli&#x27;s leadership, Verona has built a squad that blends experience and youth. The signing of American **Micah Christenson**, considered one of the best passers in the world, has taken the team&#x27;s playing style to a whole new level. At the opposite end, they feature 23-year-old Brazilian talent Darlan Souza, while the remaining outside hitters include Rok Mozic and Noumory Keita. This squad structure clearly demonstrates that Verona is aiming for the top spot this season, not just the playoffs.

Milano, on the other hand, started the season with mixed emotions. They showed &quot;solidity and character&quot; by beating Modena in their opening match, but suffered a hard-fought 3-1 defeat against Piacenza in the second week. After this defeat, they are looking at the away game against Verona as a &quot;redemption&quot; match. Milano&#x27;s biggest asset is undoubtedly their Belgian captain, Ferre Reggers, currently the league&#x27;s top scorer. Reggers has scored a staggering 55 points in two matches, averaging an incredible 6.11 per set. His 27 points in the last match against Piacenza alone demonstrates his vital role for the team. Milano will aim to capitalize on Reggers&#x27; exceptional performance and return from their challenging away game against Verona with a point or points.

While Milano may have a scoring machine like Ferre Reggers, Verona appears to have a more balanced squad. Christenson&#x27;s passing ability and ability to effectively utilize multiple scoring options like Darlan, Mozic, and Keita will make things difficult for Milan&#x27;s defense. My <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> is Verona, given their chemistry with their new coach and world-class passer Christenson. I predict a 3-1 result.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Jaylen Waddle - o4.5 Receptions (-140 on Bet365)

**Writeup:** *With Tyreek Hill out and Darren Waller on IR, Miami’s targets continue to condense to Waddle.*

*He’s gone 5+ catches in 5 of 8 games (63%) this year and 3 of his last 5 (two 6-catch games; one dud vs CLE).*

*The Ravens’ WR table shows they’re stingy on yardage but will concede volume underneath; multiple WRs (Odunze, Zaccheaus, Kirk) hit their reception lines.*

*Waddle leads the team in targets per route and yards per route vs Cover-1 and Cover-3, with a mid-teens aDOT that pairs with Miami’s quick RPO/crosser game.*

*With Tyreek out, Waddle’s career splits jump to \~6.2 catches and \~70 yards per game, clearing 5+ receptions in \~67% of those games.*

*In his last game against the Ravens two year ago, Waddle came down with 11 receptions off of 19 targets. Easily the most on the season by a mile and Tyreek Hill was also on the field during that game.*

*On the defense side, the Ravens are top-tier in Cover-1/3 usage and tilt throws outside more than to the slot (Wide Tgt % &gt; Slot Tgt %), which favors Waddle’s perimeter snaps.*

*Even if Baltimore limits explosives, those looks force Tua to the underneath/out-breaking answers that feed Waddle.*

*With a spread greatly favoring the Ravens (+/-7.5) and the 4th highest game total of the week (+/- 50), expect the Dolphins to throw to their #1 option early and often as they attempt to stay in this game.*</td></tr>

__Event:__ NFL: Ravens @ Dolphins 8:15pm EST

__POTD:__ Jaylen Waddle o62.5 rec yards (-115), 3.75u to win 3.26

__Write Up:__ A pair of struggling AFC squads kick off week 9 of the NFL as the (2-5) Baltimore Ravens travel to South Beach to take on the (2-5) Miami Dolphins on Thursday Night Football. Baltimore snapped a 4 game losing streak as they took down the Bears 30-16 at home on Sunday. This week they get back star QB Lamar Jackson who has been out since Week 5 with a hamstring injury. As for the Dolphins they destroyed my Atlanta Falcons on Sunday 34-10 after losing their 3 previous games. Their offense was rocking, which was much needed as it started to get scary in Miami.

Miami lost star WR Tyreek Hill for the season after his knee exploded in Week 4. WR2 Jaylen Waddle stepped into the WR1 role, &amp; he has absolutely dominated. Waddle had a huge game last week, catching 5 of 6 targets for 99 yards &amp; a TD. He had a 43 yard TD which he had 30+ yards after the catch. He had the 3rd highest air yard share Jaylen Waddle, 73% air yards share in Week 8. __Since Hill’s injury, Waddle has had at least 95 yards in 3 of those 4 games.__ Excluding the game against the Browns (horrible weather), he has been on fire:

24% target share

101 yards/game

4.1 YPRR

31% first read

He has had a huge amount of air yards as of late. __He leads all wide receivers in share of air yards (53%). Waddle has had receptions of 46, 45, &amp; 43 yards in those games. In his last 11 games without Tyreek, Waddle has 70 catches, 919 yards &amp; 7 TDs for an average of 6.4 rec &amp; 84.5 yards. He&#x27;s also averaging 8.4 targets/game &amp; he&#x27;s scored in 7 of those 11 games.__ His Yards After Catch has been insane. __Waddle is averaging 9.9 YAC, most in the NFL.__ He runs 10 yard slants &amp; just takes off at lightning speed. __He was clocked last week at 21.35 mph on his 43 yard TD, 3rd fastest speed in Week 8. He has averaged 16.8 yards per reception (268 yards/16 catches) since Week 4, 6th best of 41 qualified NFL WRs (League Avg: 12.7.)__ Now, Waddle gets his easiest matchup since Tyreek went down.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>** - Malik Washington 25+ receiving yards (-136) + Marshall -2.5 vs Coastal Carolina (-194) | (**+162**) FD | (**3 units**)

**Marshal @ Coastal Carolina 19:30 EST**

**Ravens @ Dolphins 20:15 EST**

All my picks so far have been exactly +200 odds. I’ll continue to share plus odds picks that I’m confident in, as I have the most success with this method, and it’s going well so far on here. This one is a bit lower at +162.

——————————————————

**Malik Washington 25+ receiving yards (-136) write up**

Washington’s role has expanded in recent weeks, clearing 30 receiving yards in each of his last two games while his snap share has surged from 44% three weeks ago to 64% and 62% in the past two.

Last week: 4/5 for 36 yards. Prior: 5/8 for 30. Trend’s clear — more targets, more opportunity.

Baltimore is not good vs the pass and has a problem with slot receivers in particular—which I’ll expand on more.

Marlon Humphrey was once a great cornerback. Just last year he was elite. He was a feisty lockdown corner that could shadow top receivers and hang with the best of them. A Gandalf corner as I like to call them: “THOU SHALT NOT PASS!”

Nowadays, he’s more like Santa, and Malik Washington might be the primary beneficiary of his generosity tomorrow. 

He plays 63% of snaps as the scb. While he is “only” targeted on 17.8% of routes run, which is high, but not egregious, he is at the bottom of the barrel statistically in most of the productivity coverage stats. He gives up a lot of production. The stats don’t lie, this year has been a major regression season.

He’s allowing 52 ypg, 9.8 YPT, and ranks bottom-10 in most coverage stats (PFF grade 45.4, #109/113). 

Washington runs 52% of routes from the slot, so he’ll see plenty of Humphrey.

The rest of the Ravens corners and secondary as a whole are nothing to write home about either. They’re the 2nd worst defense against WRs in terms of fantasy points allowed and they give up the 9th most yards to WRs.

Notable primary slot Wide Receiver lines against the Ravens:

Amon-Ra St. Brown - 7 / 77/ 1 (pre-game O/U 72.5) ✅

Khalil Shakir - 6 / 64 (pre-game O/U 47.5) ✅

Christian Kirk -  4 / 64 yards (pre-game O/U 36.5) ✅

DJ Moore - 4 / 73 (pre-game O/U 42.5) ✅

JuJu Smith-Schuster - 4 / 36 / 1 (pre-game O/U 14.5) ✅

Jordan Whittington - 3 /23 (pre-game O/U 12.5) ✅

That’s a clear rate in 6/7 games. I couldn’t find exactly who the primary was for the Browns so it could be 7/7.

——————————————————

**Marshall -2.5 @ Coastal (-194) write up**

I don’t bet CFB often, but I stumbled across this game while browsing the ESPN app looking for my next victim, and it jumped out. Right off the bat, just looking at the previous games for both teams, Marshall seems to have much more impressive results despite both being 4-3. 

For instance, they beat Old Dominon 48-24 two weeks ago, and Coastal Carolina got absolutely dog walked, 47-7, by Old Dominion the week before that. Maybe the Old Dominion players partied all week, drunk off their victory against CCU, and got smashed by Marshall because of that, but more likely it’s a sign that Marshall is a cut or two above Coastal, I would think.

Looking at the stats of the QB for Marshall: Carlos Del Rio-Wilson, he looks really good. 1,131 yards passing with 12/1 TD/INT and a team high 347 yards rushing with 4 TDs. He’s a transfer and didn’t even start the first game of the season too.

Coastal Carolina has had some major quarterback problems this season. They benched their starter in week 2 after he threw 3 picks and then benched their replacement quarterback last week after he filled in with 447 passing yards and 3/3 TD/INT since then. Their latest quarterback, Samari Collier, will start this game. Maybe the third time’s the charm. 

He had a pretty good debut start in their win last week vs Appalachian state, but this guy’s a senior, 2 year JUCO transfer, who’s mobile but very much unproven.

Marshall’s QB Del Rio-Wilson is elite through the air and elite on the ground. He didn’t have a single interception until last game, and he’s averaging 293 total yards and 3.2 TDs per game since becoming the starter.

Big advantage for the Thundering Herd.

Marshall’s top wide receiver, Demarcus Lacey, has 35 / 484 / 4 on the year. Coastal’s top WR has 19/158. Lacey has more yards receiving than any of Coastal’s quarterbacks have passing.

Pretty primitive analysis, but compelling to me nonetheless. I don’t think home field advantage will make up for the deficit in quality between these two teams. My gut tells me Marshall will win on the road here and maybe stomp them. 

Teased down from -6.5 to -2.5 for extra safety, as Marshall has had 2 of their last 3 games decided by exactly 3 points (both in 2OT). They’ve had 12 days off since their last game though, and will be well rested and ready to lay a beatdown on their enemy.

My <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> is combining these two alts to fit with my high odds strategy, but you can of course <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> to just tail one or the other, and the standard lines for both picks also seem good to me.

Last Pick: Dylan Dietrich ML vs Jay Clarke (+135, 1 unit): Win

Tennis | Charlottesville Challenger | 11:30 AM EST (estimated)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Rinky Hijikata vs Mats Rosenkranz | **Hijikata ML at -153 (DK). 1 unit.**

Write-up: The odds movement before the match was pretty wild, as things even swung in Clarke&#x27;s favor at one point. However, Dietrich closed at around +110 and played a very strong match. 

For <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, I&#x27;m sticking with Charlottesville and going with Rinky Hijikata to defeat Mats Rosenkranz in the second round. Hijikata is one of those guys who never really looks to be dominating his opponent, but always manages to score enough wins throughout the season to stay in the Grand Slam main draw range. He tends to perform fairly well indoors, as a strong net game makes up for a lackluster serve and fairly standard baseline game. His first-round match against clay-courter Matias Soto was tougher than expected, but he actually didn&#x27;t play badly, earning a 7.04 performance rating.

Meanwhile, Mats Rosenkranz has a more traditional indoor game - he&#x27;s a big lefty server that likes to take it to his opponent in rallies. However, he doesn&#x27;t really have the same consistency from the ground as Hijikata, and I feel that his approaches to the net can be a bit too lumbering when facing a speedster like Rinky. He got a decent first-round win over Andres Martin, but I still don&#x27;t feel that he&#x27;s in quite the same weight class as Hijikata. Looking at some common matchups, they both played Patrick Kypson indoors recently; Hijikata closed at around even money, while Rosenkranz was a 3.10 underdog. Rosenkranz was also priced similarly to this match in the first round against Martin, but I don&#x27;t feel that Andres is at the same level as Hijikata, as he&#x27;s more of an outdoor player and hasn&#x27;t scored any big wins recently. Teelo&#x27;s model supports the idea that there&#x27;s a gap in form between these two players, as it gives Rinky a 70.3% chance of winning this one (60.47% implied). 

Overall, I think Hijikata should be a bigger favorite here. This won&#x27;t be pretty, but he&#x27;s the more consistent player by far, and I simply see a bit of a level gap here. Some books have a worse price on this, but I would take it down to around -165.

should&#x27;ve taken it when it was o21.5 yesterday oh well

**Writeup:** Its been a while since Likely and Lamar have both been healthy and playing together. Last time it happened was week 4 for a whole 2.5 quarters until Lamar was taken out of the game. Now Likely did get 0 receptions that game but as mentioned, Lamar was not in the whole time and it was Likely&#x27;s first game back from  a fractured foot from over the summertime.

As Tyler Huntley clearly does not care much for Likely given he has 26 yards from 5 receptions over the 3 games they&#x27;ve played together, we&#x27;ll be looking at 2024 stats. Leaving out playoffs (which would make all these stats better mind you), Likely has been average 3.5 targets with 2.6 receptions, 29.8 receiving yards, and 11.4 Yards Per Reception per game. It&#x27;s clear that he&#x27;s got some good chemistry with Lamar.

Another aspect I want to look at is offensive snap share percentages. Aside from week 4 (where he played 45% of all snaps) and week 7 where I could not find data, Likely has played over 50% of the offensive snaps in each game.

Now let&#x27;s look at the Dolphins. They&#x27;ve given up the most fantasy points to Tight Ends this season. Opposing TEs have an average of just under 11 yards per reception (450 yards from 41 receptions). Dolphins also play zone nearly 70% of the time vs man, which Likely seemed to do better in last year. All these factors add up to what should be an explosive game to get Likely really going this season

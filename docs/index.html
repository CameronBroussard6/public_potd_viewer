<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: PSV vs Feyenoord - PSV ML(-150)

8:30 AM EST, ESPN+

I find this to be quite good value. PSV have been far and away the best team in the Netherlands for the last season and a half, and Feyenoord is a distant second. PSV has a 14 point lead on the table at this point, and a win tomorrow would essentially wrap the league up. Feyenoord have been in very poor form as of late(I&#x27;m a bit surprised their coach, one of my favorite former players Robin Van Persie hasn&#x27;t been fired). PSV are winless in three(though two of which were very difficult UCL fixtures), after a blistering run of form, but Feyenoord have struggled to find any sort of consistent form since late October, since they lost to PSV at home. Since that match, Feyenoord has 5 wins, 2 draws, 10 losses. Very poor for their standards. PSV have also gotten the better of Feyenoord in their last four matches. PSV also has the best home record in the league(though not as good as their away record), a better offense and a better defense than Feyenoord. Feyenoord has struggled against top teams away from home. 

BOL!</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: Illinois Vs Nebraska/ Over 148.5 (-155) 2u

Write up: I can’t get a read on either side of this game in terms of who’s gonna cover. But I do love the value we get with the total. The line opened at 152.5 and now it’s even at 150.5. Buying down 2 points at -155 is tremendous value. Illinois has been rolling with 8 straight victories while Nebraska is looking to bounce back. Illinois is battle tested and poised as we saw last week against Purdue. Nebraska is looking to create a bang in front of their home crowd. I don’t see a reason why either offense can’t explode for 75-80. We’re moving with caution so only sprinkle 2u, but I love this matchup. These two exploded for 163 last game and I don’t see that slowing down too much. Not to mention the potential for overtime and a chance for a plethora of late game free throws. Let’s take these two dawgs to score 149 points. Let me know if you’re riding with! Happy Sunday!

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Total sixes under 14.5 @ 1.85

Units: 2

Reasoning:

Posted this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> for the 1st match and rain effected match did not see many sixes.

I don’t think <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> will be any different (except the rain part).

2016 was the last time that over 14 sixes were hit at Pallekele in t20 internationals.

Since then 11 matches have been played here.

The ball will grip and spin and it will be difficult to hit sixes after power play overs.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the day</mark> - PSV V Feyenoord. PSV over 1.5 goals @ 1.55

1st plays 2nd here. PSV have a nice buffer at the top which they will want to maintain. At home in the Eredivisie they are ruthless averaging over 3 goals per game. Feyenoord also have a growing injury list.

I suspect PSV will win so my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> was going to be PSV &amp; over 2.5 goals for the match but a 2-2 draw wouldn&#x27;t surprise me as I do expect both teams to score.</td></tr>

Sunday’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> - Djokovic o2.5 total breaks for serve +100 (1u to win 1u)

I’m pretty torn on what’s going to happen in this match and I don’t think anyone is going to be able to say with confidence one way or another. Carlos is younger and probably has an easier time recovering from a match like that, but Djokovic has so much experience on tour, a good H2H against Carlos, and has never lost in the final here. 

Here is what I do know. Djokovic is undoubtedly the greatest serve returner of all time and he has had 3 or more breaks of serve in every match so far this tournament. Alcaraz hasn’t gotten broken too many times this tournament, but he has had a good amount of break points saved. Zverev 2/7 on break points. DeMinaur 2/7 on break points. Moutet 2/4. Hangman 1/7.

I like Djokovic’s chances to get 3 or more breaks in this all timer of a match.

Good Luck!</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: 🏀 Memphis -9.5 (-112)

Game starts at 3pm EST. Bet 2.25u

Writeup: This game has teams of similar play styles, and it is typical for the better team to shine in this scenario. This better team would be Memphis, who has a top 50 defense against a Tulane offense outside the top 200. Beyond the defense, Memphis is simply better in every way besides slightly more consistent play from Tulane. Tulane could force some turnovers on defense, but their allowed field goal percentage is below 200th in the nation. On the flip side, Memphis’s allowed field goal percentage is top 30. This is simply the better team, and I expect the home crowd to back Memphis’s defensive play, who has the 18th best home effectiveness in NCAA basketball. Give me Memphis to show out for their fans and win by double digits.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Aurora Map 1 ML (+160)** vs. Falcons 5u

Game/Event/Time: Counterstrike 2 (CS2) | IEM Krakow | 8:00 AM EST.

\-If anyone needs help finding the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> or a place to bet esports can always reach out!

***Aurora:***

* Aurora made one roster change in the off season, replacing jottaaa with soulfly, overall imo it is a downgrade in skill but an upgrade in vibes for a team that probably needs more help with vibes then skill anyway. In their first tournament with soulfly they struggled heavily bombing out to GamerLegion. So far this tournament they have improved a lot, beating GamerLegion in the opener, losing a close 2-1 to PARIVISION who might be the hottest team in the world right now, and beating paiN 2-0 yesterday.

***Falcons:***

* Falcons haven&#x27;t played since BLAST where they went on a super impressive run without star rifler kyousuke which they got 2nd place upsetting Vitality, before losing 3-0 in the finals to PARIVISION. Kyousuke is back and they will be looking to start the year strong and get in title contention

***Head to Head:***

* These roster cores faced off 5 times in 2025, Aurora went 9-3 in overall maps against Falcons core, and beat them in 4/5 of the series overall taking at least a map in all of them
* A lot of these matches are outdated in fairness, Aurora have gotten worse and Falcons got kyousuke. However. Aurora strategically have done well against Zonic and this matchup has been favorable

***Veto:***

* Aurora lower seed so Falcons gets selection, almost every team picked to veto 2nd with higher seed this tournament so far outside of Spirit being the one exception, expecting Falcons to do the same meaning Map 1 will be Aurora <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>
* Aurora ban Ancient, Falcons ban Overpass
* Aurora <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> Anubis

**Anubis Stats:**

* For those that don&#x27;t know, Anubis was readded to the map pool to start 2026, it took the place of Train. There was no one happier about this then Aurora, these guys loved Anubis, they played it the most of any tier one team, they single handedly defined the Anubis meta and were for the entire time the map was out, the most dominant Anubis team in the world.
* Falcons used to permanently ban Anubis, this was their old ban back when it was still in the map pool. Since it came back, it has not been their ban and they have been banning Overpass instead. Falcons for that reason have 0 maps played on Anubis as a core roster
* Falcons played this map once since it was readded, they lost to Vitality 13-4 in brutal fashion looking quite poor throughout the series on the map.
* Aurora as stated above are known for this map, in 2024 + 2025 combined this roster core went 40-13 while mostly playing top teams/tier one/1.5 teams on the map. A nearly 76% win rate on the map, they dominated every team on it and were so strong both tactically and with their rotations on the map
* Aurora picked Anubis in their series against PARIVISION, they dominated on it 13-5 against one of the hottest teams in the world. That is the only time we have seen them play it as most teams are banning it against them</td></tr>

Falkirk has not been bad this season and are currently doing pretty alright for themselves. However, this bet has kept winning for me this season and I will just take it again here.

**Hibernian vs Rangers | 15:00 GMT +2**

* Rangers have not lost any of the last 16 meetings

Rangers has kinda gone little under the radar this season with all the drama around Celtic and how big of a surprise Hearts has been, nobody outside of Scotland is talking about how well Danny Rohl has got them playing. Hibs aren’t doing too badly so far this season with their 5th place, but I don’t see them having what it takes to win this one. </td></tr>

The serve is on fire giving up only nine receiving points to her last opponent and averaging 69.39 and 57.59 win % on first and second serve in her previous four matches. I think her opponents level is declining because she has recently lost two sets to opponents ranked outside the top 100 including a bagel and her first round performance was not very convincing. Kartal looks too strong and consistent here. It&#x27;s morbin time</td></tr>

Two losses in a row unlucky. Honestly Spirit played horribly and overcooked on drafts with cheesy Puck carry for Yatoro and useless Viper picks both maps, that’s why for tomorrow’s game I’m going with Team Yandex ML. These two teams have already played in the grand finals last major two times and both times Yandex won and Spirit took only one map out of the 5 maps they played. After watching Spirit <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> I think Yandex has the edge.

Goodluck

Chira has played 8 maps so far this tournament. He has hit this line in 7 out of 8 maps with average of 7.5 kills per game. He picked mostly Slardar, Earth spirit and Puck. All these heroes are playmaking heroes which increases the chances of hitting this line even more.</td></tr>

**New Event:**  Australian Open Final – Alcaraz vs Djokovic

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:**  Set 1 Over 8.5 Games &amp; Over 3.5 Total Sets @ 1.85 (5 units)

I love to watch quarter finals onwards for tennis slams and they never ever disappoint.  The bets may not always go as planned but the matches tend to be of great quality especially in the semis and finals.  These semis we just witnessed yesterday were perhaps the greatest semifinals I have ever seen, both going the distance to 5 sets with plenty of drama.  Alcaraz with cramps and vomiting, somehow surviving the last 3 sets in a 5+ hour match to beat Zverev, whom once again manages to implode and not close out the match.  In the other match, Djokovic managed to beat Sinner in a stunning 4+ hour upset.  I posted a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> for Djokovic to lose 3-0 and lost bad.  He was a 13 to 1 moneyline longshot to win.  Noone gave him a chance.  Yet he proved once again he is truly the GOAT.

Now these two players go to the final of the Aussie Open but not without concerns.  Alcaraz was suffering from serious leg cramps and nausea and was unable to run for most of the 3^(rd) and 4^(th) sets.  Yes, he is only 22, and chances are he will recover quickly unless there is a more serious injury we do not know about.  While Zverev foolishly did not take advantage of his injured opponent, should this happen again to Alcaraz, Djokovic will be merciless.

Djokovic, at 38 years of age, will be taking the court against the world’s number 1 ranked player less than 48 hours after his marathon victory.  He has been known to dig deep and has the strongest mental stamina ever seen on court.  However, this guy did not get any sleep until well after dawn yesterday and coming into play will not only be fatigue, recurring blisters he has been having and inadequate physical recovery time, but there are also questions whether he will be able to keep up with Alcaraz after long a 5-setter with Sinner. 

Djokovic is chasing his 25^(th) career Grand Slam title which would place him atop of all other tennis greats.  He has had it very easy until the semis of this tournament, and he may never get another chance to come into a final with such little exertion on the court overall.  Last year in the US Open he was toast by the time he got to the final, and had no energy left.  This time it is different, and he wants this one bad.  Beating Sinner and Alcaraz back to back would be a monumental accomplishment.  As far fetched as it sounds, if there is any man on the planet that can pull it off it is Djokovic.  I am definitely not betting against him anymore.

**Leg 1 - Set 1 Over 8.5 Games**

Alcaraz and Djokovic have played 10 previous H2H matches.  The only 2 matches that did not have at least 9 games were played on a Grass surface and Djokovic lost both as that is not his best surface to play.  The other 8 averaged at least 10 games.

**Leg 2 - Over 3.5 Total Sets**

Given what may be perhaps the closest Djokovic may ever get to winning his 25^(th) title, and after the performance he put against the world’s #2 player, I just don’t think he will do down without a fight.  Meaning, even if Alcaraz wins it most likely will not be in straight sets.

On the flip side, if Djokovic manages to win this match, it would be even less likely that Alcaraz goes down in straight sets.  The kid is the #1 ranked player for a reason and up until his last match, he had not dropped a set the entire tournament.</td></tr>

**Write Up:** Tottenham are Guardiola&#x27;s **bogey team** as he&#x27;s **lost more games to Spurs than any other opposition** in his illustrious managerial career. We know **Manchester City are totally out of form** and they were rocked back by some truly embarrassing defeats, for example, the recent schooling by Bodo/Glimt in the Champions League. Their **Premier League form doesn&#x27;t look great** either as they&#x27;ve registered just **one measly win in their last 5 matches.** Nothing seems to work for the Citizens at the minute. Their gameplay is stale and consists of robotic passes back and forth, seemingly without any line breaking. Reijnders has been absolutely atrocious for them, not excelling at a single task (truthfully, he&#x27;s barely average at anything), while Foden looks more like a passenger with each passing game. There&#x27;s no sense of urgency and the team sits back and relaxes way too quickly when they&#x27;re in front. Even the Norwegian robot, **Haaland is on a bit of a goal drought.** To make matters even worse, one of their few penetrative players, **Doku, is out** for this clash. On the other hand, *Spurs are on a bit of a roller coaster themselves with 0 wins in their last 5 Premier League outings,* but they did <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> 3 hard fought draws in that time. And we all know, a draw is more than enough for us here.

Based on the bogey team situation, the Doku absence, and general poor overall quality of City&#x27;s gameplay, I&#x27;m backing the Spurs to get something out of <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>&#x27;s game.

‎**Units** : 1.5U to win 1.6U

‎**Writeup** :



‎Dortmund are straight-up flying in the Bundesliga right now. They&#x27;re sitting 2nd in the table with **42 points from 19 games**, only one loss all season, and that +21 goal difference shows how solid they are at both ends. At home? Unbeaten ***7 wins, 2 draws from 9 matches***. The Yellow Wall is gonna be rocking, and that&#x27;s not just hype; teams crumble there when BVB get on top early.


‎BVB had a rough midweek in Europe (lost to Inter or whatever), but they always bounce back strong in the league. Their attack is clicking Guirassy and the boys are scoring for fun and Heidenheim&#x27;s defense is basically an open door.

‎**Ajax** are in decent nick this season, sitting 3rd with around **37 points from 20 games**, and their attack is firing on all cylinders ***39 goals scored so far***, averaging close to 2 per game overall. Away from home they&#x27;ve been leaky at the back sometimes (conceding 17 in 9), but up front? They&#x27;ve dropped 20 goals in those away matches alone, which is nuts , econd-most in the league for away scoring. Guys like Godts and the rest are clinical, and even if they&#x27;re rotating after Europe or whatever, they still create chances like crazy against weaker sides.


‎Excelsior?, their defense is a mess. They&#x27;re down near the bottom, ***conceded 35 goals in 20 games (that&#x27;s 1.75+ per match)*** , and it&#x27;s worse away but home isn&#x27;t much better they&#x27;ve shipped plenty at Woudestein too. They&#x27;re struggling to keep clean sheets, only a handful all season, and against top teams they get opened up quick. Last time these two met earlier this year, Ajax won 2-1 (wait, no,actually Excelsior nicked a shock away win back then, but that was an outlier, historically Ajax smash them).

**Last:** (CBB) Kansas -4 (1.5u) - ✅

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** (CBB) No. 9 Illinois (+2.5) at No. 5 Nebraska

**Start Time:** 4:00 PM ET (FS1)

**Odds:** \-110 (FanDuel)

**Units (to win):** 1.5U

**Reasoning:** Nebraska broke the hearts of Illinois on Dec. 13, knocking home a three at the buzzer to secure a dramatic 83-80 victory in Champaign.

But instead of dwelling in their feelings, the Fighting Illini (18-3) have used that loss as a springboard, winning 10 straight. That includes six victories by double-digits and all but two by eight or more points. To earn a 11th consecutive win on the road against a Top 10 foe will be no easy task, however, under head coach Brad Underwood, Illinois has earned six such victories over the last seven seasons—tied with Alabama for the most in the nation.

As for the Cornhuskers (20-1), they will rely on their stingy defense to bounce back after picking up their first loss of the season.

Through 21 games, Nebraska ranks 14th in the country in defensive efficiency (0.936). However, when the team has faced top offensive units—Illinois enters ranked first in the category (1.244)—the defense has struggled. In five contests against opponents that rank Top 40 in offensive efficiency, the Cornhuskers have conceded an average of 80.0 points on 47.8% shooting from the field (33.4% from beyond the arc). Furthermore, each opponent managed to shoot above 46% from the field and all but one topped 34% from long-range. That includes the Illini, who poured in 80 points on 48% shooting (34% from deep) in the previous meeting.

The X factor in this one is plain and simple: Keaton Wagler.

The freshman was pivotal in Illinois upset of then-No. 4 Purdue last week—46 points on 13-of-17 shooting—and he was equally as effective in the team’s 75-66 victory against Washington on Thursday, pouring in 22 points to go along with eight assists. The Illini will need hip to be on top of his game and get the rest of his teammates involved on Sunday.

Trust Illinois to get revenge on the road.

**January Record: 21 Wins ✅ 5 Loses ❌ 21-5 L26 to close out January**

Write up: Well, we opened January with open arms - what a crazy month that was - printing wins to say the least - Let’s kick off February with a 0.50U play - I don’t really like the odds in those one, I know I always preach about getting odds lower than -130, but here we are, I like this parlay - Model has this as the highest confident Edge % and EV % for the day. Will add some personal information in this write-up as well.

• ⁠Model has Alcarez ML at 64% 

• Model has Florida ML at 59% 

• Rolling with 0.50U on this one because of Djokovic is the GOAT #1 but #2 because of injuries 

•I was stuck all day between Djokovic to win 1 set or Alcarez ML - rolling with his ML - Alcarez has the tools to beat Djokovic in this one, as he has showed us in their previous matches against one another - he’s faster, has more endurance, and a little more aggressive - Part of me is sitting here thinking the obvious, how much does Novak have left in the tank after the other day - On the flip side, I don’t think that applies much to him because he’s shown for years, he’s the top dog, and get through anything, like the match against Sinner - it’s going to be another strength vs experience in this one and I’m rolling with Alcarez on this one, hoping he doesn’t <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> up an injury during the match - also stinks that it’s at 3:30am EST.. so I unfortunately won’t be able to watch 

•If Alcarez wins, and we get to the 2nd leg of the parlay, and Florida lets me down AGAIN, they will be headed towards the no bet list - I was wary about Florida after that Auburn game, but man, they answered questions on the road against South Carolina the other night - The first thing that sticks out to me in this matchup between Alabama and Florida is the rebounding edge that Florida brings - They are 1st in the country in RPG &amp; ORPG - They are a top 50 team in the country in terms of defense efficiency, which should slow Alabamas high scoring offense down - On the flip side, Alabama’s defense is subpar at best - With a defensive rating not even in the top 200 in the country……..

**Last Pick**: Leeds United vs. Arsenal BTTS-YES 4u ❎

Tough luck here. I think the line was good given this is Leeds second game all season not scoring at home so not overly upset about it. 

**Event**: English Premier League: Tottenham vs. Manchester City 8:30am PST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>**: Manchester City ML (-143) 2u

**Write up**:

Manchester city have had a rocky season so far, but since the additions of Guehi and Semenyo they have looked much stronger. Pep has been rotating to squad and it seems like the lineup is getting somewhat finalized currently, plus having Nunes back has made them look much more comfortable in the back. I will preface this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> by saying I am a City fan, so I watch every single game. If this match was a few weeks ago I would never make this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, but these new signings have been incredible. I will also note that the Bodo game didn&#x27;t include either of these players and city were missing a couple good pieces due to injury who are now back. 

With Arsenal dropping points to United last week, City are still in this title race. A win against Spurs puts them only 4 points off the top (not to mention they will still play Arsenal at the Etihad later in the season). This is a must win for city, and I think they can come out on top. With Doku now out, this is a game for Foden and Marmoush to really prove themselves in this squad. Not to mention Haaland only scoring in 1 of their last 5 games. As someone that&#x27;s seen City in this position the last few years, this is where the season turns around. 

Spurs have been extremely bad at home, sitting 19th in home record only winning 2 games all season. Recently losing at home to a squad like West Ham is further proof of how poor they&#x27;ve been. I&#x27;ve seen my team get railed by Spurs away a lot recently, but with the massive changes to their roster the past couple years, and the likes of Van De Ven and Porto out, I see city stealing this match.

**Write Up:** Enzo comes through for us again, this time in heroic fashion with a stoppage time game winning goal for Chelsea. I really enjoy late wins, I know some people dislike sweaty wins, but to me they make the game extra fun when you can win up until the last minute. Whatever side of that fence you&#x27;re on, a big plus money win is a great way to start the weekend!

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> we&#x27;ve got what should be a great matchup betwen 6th place Man United and 7th place Fulham. Two teams in great form - United are unbeaten in 7 matches and Fulham have only lost 1 match in their last 8. I&#x27;m giving United a slightly edge at home, but backing a Fulham player to land an SOT.

Chukwueze is a Nigerian winger on his first season with Fulham, having joined from AC Milan in the fall. He has only had a few matches with Fulham, having joined after the season started and being away at AFCON. That said, he has looked very promising when he has played. He scored 2 goals vs Man City back in December and hit a great equalizing goal as a sub in their last match against Brighton. I&#x27;m expecting him to get a start here and find an SOT against United. Keep in mind, he has only started a handful of games this season, so while I believe he will start based on form, there&#x27;s always a chance he does not. 

BOL and happy Sunday!

Excelsior vs Ajax, Over 3.5 goals @ 2.36

Excelsior face Ajax in a game with strong potential for goals. Ajax play attacking football and consistently create many chances home and away. Excelsior matches are often open with defensive weaknesses regularly exposed. Recent meetings between these teams have produced high scoring results. Ajax need victory and will push forward from the start. With both sides favoring offense over defense, over 3.5 goals at 2.36 offers clear value tonight again.</td></tr>

ASTON VILLA VS BRENTFORD

Date: 01 FEBRUARY 2026 at 15:00

BET ON: Both teams to score- Yes

Odd: 1.67



\- Aston Villa and Brentford profiles — both tactically and statistically — strongly point toward Both Teams to Score. Under Unai Emery, Villa’s wide pressing and forward-passing philosophy has been consistently emphasised in press conferences, with Emery explicitly stating his team must “drive forward, control the ball and create danger” rather than sit back when missing key players like Watkins, Tielemans, Kamara and McGinn. This approach inherently opens up transitional spaces, particularly when Villa are missing midfield shielding. Brentford boss Keith Andrews has also stressed his squad must attack with intent on the road and not just counter-attack, a mindset reflected in recent comments about taking the game to opponents even after narrow losses. Statistically, Villa average around 12.2 shots per game with Brentford averaging 10.1 shots per game in recent fixtures, and both teams often register shots on target figures near 4–5 per match, showing real offensive activity from both sides. Across H2H and recent meetings, combined matches frequently reach 20+ shots with balanced xG profiles, indicating that expected goals from both sides are healthy rather than one-sided. Historical match data also show xG totals often above \~2.3 combined, meaning both teams create chances rather than hitting a single goal and sitting in. With Villa’s forward-driven set-ups and Brentford’s proactive intent — plus injuries that weaken defensive cohesion — the tactical scene, combined with shot and xG volume, makes BTTS Yes a compelling expectation rather than a marginal outcome.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: **Florida Atlantic -11.5 (-112 DraftKings) 1U**

Event: CBB | East Carolina @ Florida Atlantic (2 p.m. EST) | 🏀 

*Recap: Sweat. Free. Wake Forest didn&#x27;t want that smoke. Down 18 at the half, and Williams ate for the Wolfpack. At least they beat the heavy snow accumulation. It&#x27;s about all Wake can beat these days.*

Let&#x27;s start with the elephant in the room. This line is low, yes *low,* for two reasons, and their names are Devin Vanterpool and Kanaan Carlyle. All things being equal, I believe Florida Atlantic should be favored by north of 19 points. But things aren&#x27;t equal. FAU is the vastly superior team, but it may take a vastly superior *team* effort to clear 11.5 points. Reason being: neither Vanterpool nor Carlyle played in the Owls&#x27; previous game - Thursday&#x27;s 92-65 mollystomping at the hands of a .500 Memphis squad. They&#x27;re currently listed as game-time-decisions for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>&#x27;s game against hapless East Carolina (6-15). Both these guys average 30+ minutes for FAU (14-8). Vanterpool leads the team in scoring (16.0) and rebounding (6.7). He also adds 2.6 assists and 1.6 steals per game, and makes 35.8 percent of his threes. To say the offense runs through him is an understatement. And Carlyle is no slouch, either. He&#x27;s second on the team in scoring (14.7) and leads in assists (3.3). Both players have a higher than 56 true shooting percentage. If - and it&#x27;s a big if - they can go <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, this line *will* rise. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m grabbing it now. And if they can&#x27;t play, I think FAU has enough in the tank to take care of an incredibly-poor East Carolina side that refuses to cover anything this season and cannot shoot their way out of a paper bag. Let&#x27;s dive in...

We start with a recent common opponent. I played Rice at +2.5 against ECU on Jan. 28. Rice shot 42 percent from 3, held the Pirates to 4-of-19 shooting from beyond the arc, and finished with a six-point win on the road. This is the same Rice team that has lost six straight against FAU by an average margin of 12.8 points. After FAU&#x27;s embarrassing display at Memphis, East Carolina - *at home* \- presents the *perfect* get-right game as the Owls try to keep pace with Atlantic Athletic Conference-leading Charlotte. FAU is one game back in the standings, and they&#x27;re looking to snap a two-game losing streak. I&#x27;m not saying they want to rush Vanterpool and Carlyle back to take care of bottom-feeding ECU, but there is *some* urgency here. FAU&#x27;s next game is Tulsa, winners of five straight and currently sitting a half-game up on FAU. If Vanterpool and Carlyle can play, I believe they will get close-to-typical minutes to find a rhythm and prepare for Tulsa on Wednesday. The AAC is widely considered a two-bid conference. Right now, Charlotte is one, and third-place FAU might be on the outside looking in. They need to set things right against ECU and keep it going against Tulsa. Like I said, there&#x27;s urgency here. Everyone will feel it. Hence, why 12 points feels low even without FAU&#x27;s big two.

Next, don&#x27;t lose sight of the fact that ECU is bad. Real bad. They&#x27;re 7-13 against the spread this season and 1-6 straight up on the road. They&#x27;ve never won in four games at Boca Raton, and they won&#x27;t <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. They&#x27;re also allowing 90.2 points per game at FAU. Meanwhile, the Owls are 9-1 at home and winning games in friendly confines by an average margin of 20.9 points. Granted, this stat leans heavily on Vanterpool and Carlyle&#x27;s contributions. When those two play, FAU covers 70 percent at home. When each plays and scores at least 15 points, FAU is 8-3 ATS. Basically, we are taking this bet and praying for a good injury report tomorrow. What makes me hopeful is that Carlyle was a late scratch for the Memphis game. However, he&#x27;s dealing with a calf, which are ...tricky injuries for explosive guards. Vanterpool wasn&#x27;t even listed on the injury report for Memphis, so his absence is particularly curious. We&#x27;re going to know a LOT more around noon Sunday. I can see laddering this line up as it increases with good news. The contrarian play would be to take ECU at +12.5, +13.5, +14.5 if we learn that Vanterpool and/or Carlyle are definitely out.

KenPom ranks FAU 106th and ECU 274th. The Owls have offensive and defensive rating in the 110s. Their adjusted tempo is 35th. ECU&#x27;s offense (323), defense (168), and pace (106) simply can&#x27;t hang with a healthy FAU. As of this writing, KenPom puts the spread at 13.5, which seems to incorporate the injuries. Bart Torvik has it as a 20-point win for FAU, which I would welcome, but that&#x27;s all mental gymnastics if Vanterpool and Carlyle both sit.

My thesis (oh hell, call it my hope): Vanterpool and Carlyle are healthy enough to play, and they will as FAU tries to keep up in league play. If they do, this line is an absolute steal. If they don&#x27;t, we&#x27;re counting on ECU to continue to play terrible basketball. The Owls are 13-7 ATS this year, and they crushed the Pirates, 81-53, in their previous meeting last season. ECU is dead last in the NCAA in 3-point shooting percentage, so don&#x27;t expect comeback power or offensive surges. They want a slugfest. They want a grind. FAU wants to run. The Owls are averaging 81.9 points to ECU&#x27;s 68.3. FAU needs this. ECU is just happy to be somewhere that&#x27;s not frozen with snow.

Good luck and Godspeed!

UFC: Volkanovski vs Lopes $1.7 odds

3pm AEDT

Alexander Volkanovski should beat Diego Lopes because he’s the more complete, disciplined fighter with proven five-round cardio, elite fight IQ, and the ability to neutralise Lopes’ biggest weapon — explosive finishing. Volk’s constant pressure, feints, and volume striking force opponents to fight at his pace, while his wrestling defence and clinch control reduce the chaos Lopes relies on to create submissions or big moments. Over time, Volk’s consistency, experience in championship fights, and ability to make mid-fight adjustments should allow Alexander Volkanovski to outwork and outthink Diego Lopes, likely winning rounds through control, output, and composure rather than taking unnecessary risks. Additionally, Volk beat him in the last fight by unanimous decision.</td></tr>

Backing this to be an incredibly exciting and close to even final. Alcaraz is looking to complete the career grand slam and Joker is looking for number 25. I expect this one to be tight and Alcaraz is probably in better form but what we saw from Joker last round was nothing short of incredible. We saw him playing insane defense and controlled aggression. He’s gonna have to do that again and no sense in not backing that. I expect Alcaraz to come out hot and Joker to settle in. IMO the crowd can push Joker to winning atleast 1 set here and who knows maybe even the whole thing. One of these players may 3-1 or 3-2, but I highly doubt a straight sets here

Write Up:

Not sure why the odds are this high - this feels like a 1.7 odds <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> or something. Aston Villa at home have 8 wins, 1 draw and 2 losses (18:9 goal ratio), while Brentford away have 3 wins, 0 draws and 8 losses (12:20 goal ratio). Villa have some injuries but I don’t think they’ll lose or draw.

Villa seems to be in a far superior position here.

Also keep in mind that I try not to overthink my picks. They mainly consists of taking a few minutes to look at stats, form and line ups and if I get that “hmm, looks good” feeling then I post it. It has worked out well so far.

&gt; **Write Up:** This <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> is from my soccer model that I&#x27;ve been using for the past two years. It assigns ELO ratings to players and projects a win chance based on the combined ELO ratings of the players on each team. TeamReddit is projecting a 62% win chance here which creates value here on the ML.</td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>

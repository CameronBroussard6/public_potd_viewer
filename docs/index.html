Event: WPG Jets @ DAL Stars | 8:30 PM EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: Under 5.5 Goals (+100) 2u To Profit 2u

Write-Up: That Kings Vs Hurricanes game was low scoring until the end, it got a little scary but we still got the win! The Winnipeg Jets are coming to Dallas to play the Stars. In net for the Stars is Jake Oettinger, who is great every year and is having another good year this season. On the season, Oettinger has a .900 save percentage and a 2.66 goals against average. Connor Hellebuyck is in net for the Jets and he has been a monster goalie every year, despite not being quite up to his typical standards, he is still great this year. This season, Connor Hellebuyck has a .902 save percentage and a 2.71 goals against average. The Jets are pretty weak offensively this season, ranking 22nd in goals and just 25th in shots on goal. On the other hand, the Stars are decent, but they aren’t exactly a big threat. The Stars rank 11th in goals this season, but are way down at 28th in shots on goal, which is going to be a problem against a goalie like Hellebuyck who has constant high save percentages. The Stars are also good at limiting shots, ranking 9th in least shots on goal allowed, which is going to be key at limiting the Jets scoring. With 2 proven goalies both having yet another good season, and both offences being pretty mediocre, this is a great low scoring matchup.

This is a valuable spot from my league-specific model that tracks goal patterns across lesser-known leagues like Oman. Al Nahda’s last 5 matches have averaged 3.0 goals, and Bahla have seen 3+ goals in 4 of their last 6 away games. H2H history supports this too, with 5 of the last 7 meetings finishing over the 2.5 line. The model strongly favors goals here based on tempo, finishing efficiency, and recent defensive trends from both sides. At +125 odds, this stands out as one of the most confident spots on the slate.</td></tr>

Soccer | Argentina Liga Profesional | 20:30 (GMT)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Gimnasia ML @ 2.15 - 2U

Write Up: Finally caught a break with the cards <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> in the Rosario match. It was as dirty as expected and we got those 6 yellows to get our first win.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> we’re staying in the Argentine league. Gimnasia is playing at home against Aldosivi. Gimnasia is historically a tough team to visit; they are aggressive and usually dominate the pace in La Plata. Aldosivi is basically a professional bottom-dweller at this point—they are always struggling at the end of the table and their away record is consistently poor.

Getting 2.15 for a decent home side against a team that’s a candidate for relegation every season is a steal. Not overthinking it, just playing the odds on the better team at home. 2 units.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s pick</mark> Jay Huff over 10.5 points and rebounds (-130 FanDuel) two units (against Rockets at 7:10)

Aside from two games where he played three minutes or less, he’s over this line in 9/11 (one of those he got 10). He’s averaging 13.6 for the season. He is getting these numbers with Siakam playing. The Rockets tend to play high scoring/fast paced games. Their defense is average against bigs. I think Huff gets his usual 20+ minutes a game no matter what- could be a blow out (even though the spread doesn’t indicate this), but I think Huff gets minutes in a blowout or his usual rotation minutes. Huff has scored ten points alone in 7/10. This line just seems too low for this guy. While I was researching his stats, and before I placed my bet, the 10.5 moved from -120 to -130 and Fanatics had 10+ move from -150 to -165.</td></tr>

Last Pick: Pavel Kotov ML vs Remy Bertola (-154, 2 units): Loss

Tennis | Quimper Challenger | 10:30 AM EST (estimated)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Adrian Mannarino vs Pedro Martinez | **Under 2.5 sets at -150 (DK). 1 unit.**

Write-up: Frustrating loss. Kotov closed at around -206, so I don&#x27;t feel too bad about it, but it still represents a continuation of what has been a rough patch of form for me. 

Adrian Mannarino is an interesting player in that his level seemed to be declining sharply in 2024, but an excellent 2025 campaign essentially revived his career at 37 years old. Mannarino has now gone winless since October of last year, but I feel that this home event could be a bounceback spot for him. Mannarino has always had extremely flat groundstrokes that work best on grass and fast courts. What has changed, however, is that he has lost much of the defensive ability of his younger self and filled the void by nearly perfecting his version of the lefty slider serve. Now, windy conditions tend to take a lot of the bite out of his groundstrokes and serve, and he can no longer compensate by hanging behind the baseline. For this reason, I wasn&#x27;t surprised that he didn&#x27;t do well in Australia; I was a bit surprised about him losing to Remy Bertola indoors in Quimper last week, but his performance rating (6.68) wasn&#x27;t terrible, and Bertola ended up making the final. 

On the other side of the net, Pedro Martinez should represent a good chance for Adrian to get back on track. Martinez is a Spanish grinder who has always preferred clay courts, and doesn&#x27;t seem to have fully recovered from knee and shoulder issues that affected him in 2025. He did capture a Challenger title on outdoor hard courts earlier this month, but he didn&#x27;t beat anyone in the top 200 to do so, and indoor courts tend to be worse for his game. Last week in Quimper, he was pushed down to even odds against Sascha Gueymard Wayenburg, an indoor specialist who relies heavily on the serve, and ended up getting broken 3 times in a straight-sets loss (6.72). Martinez&#x27;s serve is nothing special, and he&#x27;s not going to be able to rush Mannarino off the ground in the same way someone like Bertola can. If Adrian can raise his level here, I expect him to win in two straightforward sets, but this bet also covers the possibility that he just doesn&#x27;t show up or doesn&#x27;t have the energy, which is always a possibility at this age.</td></tr>

**Last:** (CBB) Illinois +2.5 (1.5u) - ✅

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** (CBB) No. 14 Kansas (+4.5) at No. 11 Texas Tech

**Start Time:** 9:00 PM ET (ESPN)

**Odds:** \-102 (Caesars)

**Units:** 1.5U

**Reasoning:** Following an embarrassing 86-75 loss at West Virginia back on Jan. 10, something clicked for the Kansas men’s basketball team.

A visit from then-No. 2 Iowa State just four days later was lining up to be the final nail in the coffin to the team’s Big 12 title aspirations. Instead, the Jayhawks (16-5) responded with a season-revitalizing, 84-63 thrashing of the Cyclones. Four more wins followed and suddenly Kansas is riding a five-game win streak and on the cusp of a Top 10 ranking.

What’s been impressive is that the team has executed on both sides of the ball.

While the Jayhawks offensive number’s won’t jump out of you from the page—39th in field-goal percentage (47.9%), 48th in three-point shooting (36.5%), 72nd in offensive efficiency (1.121) and 101st in scoring (78.8 PPG)—the unit has turned it up a notch as of late. Over the last five games, the team has averaged 83.1 points on 51.6% shooting from the field (39.2% from beyond the arc). That includes hitting at a mark of 51% or more in all but one of those contests while converting from long-range at 42% or better in all but three. The defense has held up more than its bargain, conceding just 67.6 points on 37.6% shooting (33.6% from the perimeter) over its last five games. But that’s hardly unusual for a Kansas defense that through 21 games has ranked 3rd in opponent field-goal percentage (38.3%), 13th in opponent three-point shooting (29.4%), 28th in defensive efficiency (0.967) and 35th in scoring defense (68.0). So not surprisingly, the team is listed as the 3rd best team in the nation (9.829 Barthag), per Torvik, while ranking 4th in adjusted offensive efficiency (131.6) and 7th in adjusted defensive efficiency (92.5) over that span.

Up next? A battle with Texas Tech and JT Toppin.

On the season, Toppin paces the Red Raiders (16-5) with 22.4 points and 10.9 rebounds per game. But over the last five, the star junior’s play—27.6 points on 60.2% shooting (47.1% from three-point range)—has helped the team average 86.8 points on a sizzling 51.4% shooting from the floor (44.4% from beyond the arc). That includes topping 88 or more points in all but three games while shooting 38% or better in all games. Fortunately, the Jayhawks know a thing or two about slowing down stars. Most recently, the team limited BYU’s AJ Dybantasa to just 17 points—his second lowest total of the year. Kansas also downed two birds with one stone against Iowa State’s Milan Momclivoc (18.6 PPG) and Joshua Jefferson (17.2 PPG), holding the duo to just 11 and 12 points on a combined 7-of-23 (30.4%) from the field.

But a reeling Texas Tech defense will be what tips the game in the visitor’s favor.

Through 21 games, the unit ranks just 129th in opponent three-point shooting (32.9%), 156th in defensive efficiency (1.046), 166th in scoring defense (74.4 PPGA) and 174th in opponent field-goal percentage (44.6%). But things have gotten even worse in recent weeks, as the Red Raiders have conceded 78.4 points on a whopping 46.2% shooting from the field (37.4% from beyond the arc). That includes allowing each opponent to top 42% or better from the floor while allowing opponents to hit at a 33% clip or better from the perimeter in all but two. But the biggest achilles heel for the team is its inability to control the paint, ranking 224th in opponent points in the paint (33.0 PPG; 39th percentile). That has been something the Jayhawks have been pretty successful with on the season—80th in points in the paint (35.3 PPG; 78th percentile)—and it should continue Monday night.

Trust the Jayhawks to stay hot on the road and keep us within the number.

Big, big, BIG fan of the Hornets right now and the way they’re playing — especially with a fully fit lineup. They’re at home against a Pelicans side that really isn’t that great, and the last H2H was only a 4-point loss, which came without Ball and Miller available. Full-strength Hornets are a different animal.

They’re also riding a 6-game win streak, with big statement wins against the Spurs and the 76ers. Confidence is high, momentum is real.

As for Brandon Miller — this one feels clean.  
He’s gone 20+ points in his last 10 games (10/10), and this Hornets squad is flat-out dangerous when healthy. His role is locked, usage is there, and 20 points should be very easy in this spot.

The goalie matchup here is most likely Saros vs Hofer. If that’s the case, this will be the 4th time these teams and goalies have matched up this season. In those games, the total goals scores is 9, 7, and 5. 

In the last month, Saros has been averaging 3.35 goals against and under .900 save percentage. The last game he gave up less than 3 goals was against the Blackhawks on 1/10. The o5.5 goals has hit in 7 of the last 9 Predators games.

At this point, the Blues season is over and while Hofer is the better goalie, he doesn’t have a lot to work with. He had a pretty good GAA of 2.69, but in his last 2 games, he gave up 4 goals each. The o5.5 goals has gone 4-0 in the Blues last 4 games.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: 🏀 UNC -5.5 alt spread + Charleston Southern -9.5 alt spread (-135).

Game 1 starts at 6pm EST. Bet 2.5u

Writeup: Waiting for alt lines to come out, but am hoping to get something around -125. 

Let’s go back to what we know with some alt parlays (and hopefully stay there). We’ll start with Charleston Southern vs Gardner-Webb. This one is simple, as Charleston Southern is simply better in every way. Gardner-Webb is literally rated the 3rd worst team in all over men’s college hoops. The only thing that gives me a slight pause is that, while Gardner-Webb has a 3-20 record, they have played far better quality of opponents compared to Charleston Southern. Even still, this Charleston Southern defense should be quite stifling, and with the 14th fastest paced offense in the league, they are bound to get many points in transition. I’ll put some respect on the fact that Garnder-Webb is used to playing far better opponents (considering how bad they are), so we’ll bring the spread down to -9.5.

Now for UNC. The big advantage here will be the Tarheel’s offense against Syracuse’s defense, who have a top 20 offense and a defense below top 60, respectively. UNC should also have a huge offensive rebounding advantage, allowing for multiple second chance opportunities. UNC is also one of the best teams in the country playing at home, and while playing much better ball as of late, I expect a solid showing from them. Syracuse has been a bit more consistent this season, so just to be safe, we’ll drop the spread down to -5.5.

Burnley are fighting for their lives at 11 points from safety, at this point it will take a special run of form to pull themselves out of the bottom 3. 

Brobbey has been on a great run of form at Sunderland&#x27;s first choice striker, scoring a goal in 3 of their last 4 matches. While his shot volume is not huge, he has a great SOT conversion rate on his shots. He&#x27;s a willing runner, chasing everything sent his way and great both with his feet and in the air. He didn&#x27;t take over as Sunderland&#x27;s main striker until midway through the year, so while the numbers aren&#x27;t huge, he has looked great over the last few weeks. 

I also like this play because Burnley concede the most SOTs in the EPL and it&#x27;s not particularly close, at 140 so far this year. They also struggle against center forwards - recent notable matchups were conceding 2 SOTs to Ekitike on 6 shots, 7 SOTs to Sesko on 8 shots (2 goals), and 2 SOTs to Wissa on 4 shots. I think there&#x27;s great value here given the data and current form of Brobbey.

BOL and happy Monday!</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>‎**Record** : 5 - 0 ( +6.75u )

‎***That&#x27;s 5 in a row , Couldn&#x27;t be Happier for my Campaign***

‎**Prev <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>** : Dortmund ML + Ajax Over 1.5 Goals✅

‎**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>** : ( Serie A &amp; Primeria Liga)

‎**Match** : Udinese Vs AS Roma &amp; Casa Pia vs Porto‎

‎**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>** : AS Roma DC + Porto Over 1.5 Goals

‎**Start Time** : 14.45PM &amp; 15.45AM EST

‎**Odds** : -126 (1XBET)

‎**Units** : 1.5U to win 1.19U

‎**Writeup** :

‎First off, **Roma** are straight-up owning this fixture. ***Last 5-6 meetings? All Roma wins***. They beat these boys 2-0 at home back in November, and before that it was the same story , Udinese can&#x27;t buy a result against us. Head-to-head is brutal: **Roma have won like 9 out of the last 12 or something stupid**. Udinese haven&#x27;t beaten us in forever.  No crazy risks here Roma might not blow them out, could be a boring 0-1 or 1-1 if Udinese park the bus, but they don&#x27;t lose this. Their attack might miss a couple guys, but they still have enough to beat them.

‎Now for **Porto ** First, head-to-head is a massacre. Porto&#x27;s unbeaten in like 10 straight against Casa Pia  **won 9, drew 1, and they&#x27;ve smashed them plenty***. Last meetings? **Porto 4-0, 2-0, clean sheets galore**, and Casa Pia barely scores ***(they&#x27;ve got like 3 goals total across 8-10 games vs Porto)***. These boys just can&#x27;t handle the Dragons Porto owns them. Second, Casa Pia are in the mud right now. Sitting 16th, just scraping above relegation, **winless in their last 4, and leaky as hell at the back – conceding 9 in recent games or whatever the stat was**. They&#x27;ve got one of the worst attacks too, **third-fewest goals in the league**, so they park the bus but it doesn&#x27;t hold vs top sides. Porto are league leaders or right up there (18-1-0 form vibes), smashing away games, and their attack is clicking versatile, quality everywhere, they grind or blow teams out when they get space.




‎Lets Make it 6 in a row !!</td></tr>

Last Pick: Aston Villa to win @ 2.14 ❌

Last Pick Write Up: Very frustrating game. Brentford got a red, then immediately scored. Second half, Villa scored… but the goal was disallowed, and that’s it. This ends our streak. I even added 0.5 units at half time because I didn’t believe they would bottle this against Brentford with a red card.

I also had BTTS as a hedge lmao.

Now for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>..

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Sunderland to win @ 1.8

Write Up: Burnley will probably be in a fighting mood. However, Sunderland are undefeated at home with 6 wins, 5 draws and 0 losses, while Burnley are very poor away with 1 win, 2 draws and 8 losses. 

No gigantic injury list here like in the Villa game. Let’s bounce back, boys!</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>AS Roma @ 1.97 - €300.00

Last 5 &gt; WWLWL // Profit: €4,498.04

Roma is the 3rd best away team in Serie A, they are 7-0-4 on the road. Udinese at home are 14th and have a 3-4-4 record. In the H2H Roma hold an 8-1-1 lead in the last 10 games and have an 6 game winning streak ongoing. At the stadium of Udinese they have won 2 straight and in the Serie A Roma are on a 2 game winning streak when playing away. Managerial H2H in favour for us (2-1-0).

Since this is still Serie A though, I would recommend staking wisely... random ahh stuff happens here.</td></tr>

* Event: Ath. Bilbao 1 - 1 Real Sociedad
* <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Real Sociedad to win @ 3.68
* Comment: Real Sociedad was winning until they got a guy sent off with 10 min left to go, and ended up conceding 5 minutes later. Not off to a great start.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>:

* Event: Casa Pia - FC Porto
* <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: FC Porto corners over 7.5 @ 2.5
* Comment: There has been a massive storm in Portugal, which has completely decimated some cities in the center of the country. Casa Pia&#x27;s stadium has been affected by the storm, and the pitch won&#x27;t be in the best condition. In Portugal, teams tend to resort to set pieces when there are no conditions to play &quot;normally&quot;. Additionally, when Casa Pia is forced to defend at home, they often concede a lot of corners. FC Porto has also been very strong in set pieces throughout the season.

Write up: Model has this as the highest confident Edge % and EV % for the day. Will add some personal information in this write-up as well.

• ⁠Model has UNC ML at 62%

• Model has Texas Tech ML at 56%

•The only way I don&#x27;t see UNC winning this one here is because they are overlooking Syracuse and focused on Duke - Carolina is easily the better team here, and playing at home - Since Carolina&#x27;s little 3 game bad skid, losing to SMU, Stanford, and California, they have been playing like the Carolina everyone knows - They rank better than Syracuse in about every category, but the one team stat that stands out to me here is rebounding - UNC is top 30 in the country in rebounding while Syracuse is not even top 200 - I believe Wilson and Veesar will be able to handle Syracuse&#x27;s Freeman - without Freeman, this team is not very good - I don&#x27;t see my Tarheels dropping this one at home - They average 83 PPG while Syracuse averages 75.8 PPG - Wilson and Veesar will be able to put the team on their back and continue winning 

•Kansas is hot, and playing their best ball yet this year - However, Kansas does not perform as well on the road as they do at home - I like this spot for Texas Tech, whom, is coming off a loss just a few days ago to UCF on the road - Looking at both offenses PPG, Texas Tech is at 84 PPG while Kansas is at 78.8 PPG, but that number is slightly higher because of how well they play at home - Look for Texas Tech to win the rebound game, and look for them to stay hot from beyond the arc - Tech is ranked top 15 in the country in 3pt FG % while Kansas is just below top 50 - Kansas is 3-3 on the road this year while Tech is 11-0 at home - Kansas only has one good win on the road this season, which came back in November when they played at Tennessee 

•Smaller writeup for this one unfortunately because of a busier afternoon/night ahead of me, so I apologize for that - I just wanted to make sure I got the play out for you guys and some information behind why I am choosing this

__Event:__ NCAAF: Army vs Navy 3pm EST

__POTD:__ Army Team Total o14.5 (-120), 3.6u to win 3u 

__Write Up:__ One of the biggest &amp; most sacred rivalries in sports goes down this Saturday afternoon, on the only Saturday of the season that is reserved for Army vs Navy. This is the 126th meeting between the Army &amp; Navy &amp; will determine the winner of the Commander-in-Chief’s Trophy. This is bigger than a game for these teams. If you win this one, your entire season is defined by it. It’s their Super Bowl. Both Army &amp; Navy players have to go through the most brutal schedules of any college kids out there, balancing classes, military training, &amp; football 16 hours a day. There will be more future lieutenants &amp; pilots on the field this Saturday than future NFL players. All of that hard work &amp; sacrifice over the past season prepared them for this game. With the insanity of the world, especially in <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>’s College Football, this Army vs Navy game is one of the only things that’s consistent year to year anymore. Just some good old fashioned military hard nose ball. It’s one of the best tradition in sports, so we’re not going to miss out on the action &amp; we’re going to support our troops by gambling our hard earned cash - __’Merica__

Navy is coming off a fantastic season, going 9-2 &amp; just missing out on the AAC Championship Game. Their only 2 losses this year were to #10 Notre Dame &amp; #25 North Texas. This is a huge game for Navy, as if they win they will have hit 10+ wins in back to back years for the first time in program history. They are coming of 2 extremely impressive wins over #24 USF 41-38 two weeks ago &amp; a then (8-3) Memphis team. They have a ton of veterans returning from last year, a team that pulled off a huge 31-13 upset over the #19 ranked (11-1) Army for the most lopsided result since 2019. Navy won big for one reason… QB Blake Horvath. Horvath rushed the ball 25 times for 204 yards &amp; 2 TD’s while throwing for 107 yards &amp; 2 TD’s through the air. In what will be his final game in this rivalry, you can expect another big game from the best service academy QB we’ve seen in years. __Last week Horvath became the first QB in Navy history to throw for 1,000 yards &amp; rush for 1,000 yards. Horvath’s 165.1 career efficiency rating is the best ever for a Service Academy QB &amp; top 28 nationally since 1956. His 90.1 PFSN QBi Impact Grade ranks 6th in the nation.__ Horvath is a true duel threat QB &amp; is the best rushing QB in the nation. __He ranks 1st among QB’s in rushing yards per game with an insane 104 YPG.__ Navy Offensice Coordinator Drew Cronic modified the traditional triple-option to have a variety of different looks for Horvath over the past year &amp; Horvath now has the 2nd highest completion percentage for a Navy QB (61.3%) ever. __Cronin’s Wing-T variation resulted in Navy ranking 7th in offensive success rate this season.__ Horvath also has a ton of talent around him including Alex Tecza, another Navy standout playing in his final game in this rivalry, who has found the end zone 10 times this season. As well as Eli Heidenreich, a wing back that’s a great receiving threat with a 93.8 PFF receiving grade, his 3rd year in a row with a 90+ grade. Both of those guys have known each other since first grade (cool story). __Navy has the best run game in the nation, averaging 281.8 yards per game (1st). They also are efficient on the ground, averaging 5.8 yards per carry (2nd in nation). This has led them to rank 30th in the NCAA in scoring (30.5 points per game).__ Now facing a weak Army defense that has struggled all season. __Army’s defense ranks just 79th in EPA Defense &amp; has a success rate of a low 45.7%, 121st in the NCAA.__ Part of their problem is they have had trouble limiting big runs all season. __Army ranks just 77th in rushing yards per carry allowed (4.5 ypc). They have just a 45.2% success rate stopping the run (91st).__ But the biggest issue has been defending the pass. __They rank 128th in the NCAA in pass defense success rate at just 46.2%.__ This has led to opposing offense to have virtually no issue driving down the field on them. They simply struggle to get stops. __They stop offenses on 3rd/4th down just 46.5% of the time (125th), leading them to allow opponents to have a quality drive on 54.5% of possessions (130th). That’s going to be a problem vs an elite Navy offense that ranks 10th in 3rd/4th down success rate &amp; 5th in early down EPA.__ Why am I talk so much about the opposing offense? Because they are elite led by a a stud at QB in Horvath, facing a weak Army defense, which is going to lead to more scoring opportunities for Army. 

As for Army’s offense…

<tr><td class='post'>POTD Record: 28-13 (+18.1U)

Last Pick: Trail Balzers @ Pelicans Over 238.5 (-115) (1U) ✅

I took <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> off to deal with some personal things but I am back looking to extend our current streak! Let’s get it

Event: Arkansas vs Texas Tech (NCAAB) (11am central)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Arkansas ML (+110) (1U) 


Write up:

Arkansas has been the more efficient team offensively, posting a stronger effective field goal percentage 54% to 52% and averaging 87.6 points per game on 47% shooting, compared to Tech’s 81.4 points on 44% shooting. Arkansas is also holding opponents to 45% eFG (35th nationally) compared to tech’s 48% eFG (81st nationally). That gap in shooting efficiency is meaningful in a neutral-site matchup where every possession counts. The Razorbacks also take exceptional care of the basketball, ranking 17th nationally with just 9 turnovers per game, while Texas Tech averages 11 turnovers per game. That discipline, paired with Arkansas’ ability to generate pressure — 8.2 steals per game compared to Tech’s 7.4 — means the Razorbacks are more likely to control the possession battle and create extra scoring opportunities.

The schedule tells the story of a battle-tested Arkansas squad. They’ve already faced a gauntlet: a tough road loss to a physical Michigan State team, a neutral-site defeat against Duke, and then a dominant win over Louisville where they poured in 89 points. Those experiences have hardened this group and revealed their ceiling when they’re clicking. Texas Tech, meanwhile, is still searching for a signature win, sitting winless against ranked opponents (manhandled by Purdue in the Bahamas by 30 points, and lost @ Illinois by 4) Outside of JT Toppin and Anderson, the Red Raiders lack consistent secondary scoring threats, and John Calipari’s game-planning should be well-prepared to neutralize their stars.

Size is something that I see playing out well for Arkansas, with three players sitting a 6’10 that see significant minutes for Arkansas, Pringle, Brazille, and Ewin. I see them out muscling a tech lineup that starts one player at 6’11 in Bamgboye who is a bit a weak logging just 5 points and 3.7 boards per game shooting 38%

Motivation is another factor that cannot be overlooked. Arkansas still remembers last March’s Sweet 16 heartbreak, when Tech erased a 16-point deficit and stole an overtime win. This year, the Razorbacks return key contributors who lived through that loss: Trevon Brazile, D.J. Wagner, Karter Knox, and Billy Richmond III. These players not only provide continuity but also bring the hunger to exact revenge. They are familiar with Toppin’s tendencies and will be eager to flip the script in Dallas. Add in the fact that Arkansas has momentum — winners of two straight, finally meshing together — and the emotional edge tilts heavily toward the Razorbacks.

Dallas will be split, with both fanbases bringing strong support, but Arkansas’s ability to control possessions, capitalize on their shooting efficiency, and lean on their revenge motivation should carry the day. With superior efficiency metrics, a deeper returning core, and a hardened mentality, Arkansas +110 is not just a value play — it’s the right side. My power ratings have this at Arkansas -1 and I believe they are the right side in this game tomorrow and have more paths to victory than the red raiders. As always, cheers 🍻</td></tr>

Record: 3-3

🏈 Army vs Navy, 12/13/25 Sat, 3 pm Eastern Time

Explanation: Both offenses are extremely run-heavy, which keeps the clock running and shortens the game: Army has 658 rushing attempts and averages 256.9 rushing yards per game while throwing for only 78.3 pass yards per game, and they average a massive 35:16 time of possession (meaning they’re trying to win by long, grinding drives).   Navy plays a similar style with 542 rushing attempts and 298.4 rushing yards per game, and they also hold the ball a lot at 32:20 TOP; even though Navy scores more overall (32.45 PPG), their scoring often comes via sustained option drives rather than quick-strike passing that inflates totals.</td></tr>

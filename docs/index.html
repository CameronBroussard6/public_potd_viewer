CASH the POWER PLAY!!! SWEAT FREE

Edwards scored 40+ while Queen didnt even attempt a 3 even when there was overtime, will definitely look to run the Queen play back if similar odds are given

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Cooper Flag under 1.5 3s made + Dyson Daniels over 4.5 asts (1.97) (Stake)

Bet 3U

Been loving these 2x parlays just feel more confident in them tbh but running it back with a similar <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> to the Derik Queen one so lets  try to get the back to back W here

Cooper Flagg has gone under in 9/10 games with 5 of em not even making 1. He averages around 3 3s attempted per games and shooting at 25%. Seeing this at 1.45x odds is one hell of a steal. Coop has adapted to a more of a finishing sort of playstyle as of recently so we should see him continue to have less oppurtunities to shoot and the only real times I would see coop hit a 3 is from the near the corner in an infrequent catch and shoot. The only worry I have is that they face the #1 pace in the heat but hoping the heat blow them out to prevent more PT for coop.

Dyson Daniels in the last 5 games due to the absence of Kristaps and Trae has averaged around 37 minutes per game and has gone over this line in each of those 5 games. He is also over this line in 8 of the last 9 including the \~20 min games which just gives me more confidence. Clippers also are a bottom 10 in asssists allowed per game so just further strengthens my claim. This <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> is mostly an odds booster to Coops but still really love it.

KPJ - The line hasn’t caught up to KPJ he’s beating this line consistently as he ramps up. There is a chance that he might miss the game due to back spasms but I’m keeping it simple. If he’s out I’m eyeing Ryan Nembhard AnR

<tr><td class='post'>**Yesterday&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>**: Vasco ML (+110 Draftkings) [3u] 🤮

Tough one last night, lads. Vasco really should’ve had that in the bag. They absolutely dominated, 14 shots, 10 corners compared to Mirassol’s 8 shots and just 1 corner. But somehow, the ball just refused to hit the back of the net.

Vasco pressed and pressed all game long, had Mirassol pinned for stretches, but that high line left gaps and Mirassol took full advantage late in the second half with a brutal counterattack. And when Vasco went all-in chasing the equalizer, they got stung again in stoppage time on another counter, sealing the 2–0 loss.

A frustrating defeat, boys. The right side, wrong result. We bounce back. ⚽💪

Alright lads, we move again <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Arsenal welcome Brentford to the Emirates, and this is a spot the league leaders should be licking their lips at. They’re coming off a tough away draw at Chelsea, and you already know a team like Arsenal doesn’t stay quiet for long, especially not at home.

The Gunners have been nothing short of dominant at the Emirates, winning 10 of their last 11 matches with one draw sprinkled in. The chemistry is flowing, the football is sharp, and every man on that pitch knows what’s at stake. Meanwhile, Brentford have been all over the place away from home, losing 5 of their last 8, with their only wins coming against lower-division Grimsby, struggling West Ham, and Bournemouth. That’s not exactly the résumé you want walking into the Emirates.

With Arsenal’s form, depth, rhythm, and the massive talent gap between these two sides, I fully expect the Gunners to draw first blood early. They’ve got the momentum, the crowd, and the firepower, this is the perfect spot for a strong first-half performance from the league leaders.

The 6th man on this team who comes in and attacks the basket and runs the show. He’s scoring consistently and has cleared 15 points in the last 6 games. Gone 7/10, and averages 16.1 ppg this year. Knicks are playing much faster this year under MikeBrown so expect a higher scoring affair here. Also a fan of his assists o3.5 for -118, but l gotta go with his pts over for our 5th in a row.

Why?

It&#x27;s been a while. Never stopped betting but the Danish games have been wild lately. WILD.

This however have to be routine games. FC København is having a very rough time but Esbjerg is playing in 1st division, it should not be a problem. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if Esbjerg scores though - the goalkeeper in FC København is under heavy critique but coach Neestrup believes in him.

Vejle is not showing any good form at all. They lost 5-2 to Viborg just 10 days ago and Viborg is on a roll, 6th in the league and hasn&#x27;t lost in their last 7 games. Let&#x27;s get this one.

A variation of the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> could be BTTS Yes + O2.5 goals @ 3.42. Depends on your temper.

They also play the ABA league, and only got their first win in the last round against Split as guests. They have mostly Slovenian players with 2 Americans, one Croat, and one player from Slovakia, Mario Ihring. He was basically the only one who played for the national team; Smrekar played only 1 minute against Estonia.

So, all rested, all ready for the game, and hopefully a big win here.</td></tr>

Burnley is not good. 4/L5 home games for Burnley have been BTTS NO, and the team has only scored three times in their L5. (With two coming in the same game). On the other side, Palace is really solid defensively, They&#x27;ve received only 1 goal max in 8/L9 games (!!!). These games also came versus solid rivals (Man Utd, Strasbourg, Brighton, Liverpool (twice). 

I believe Burnley is a far worse teams than all those listed above, and Palace should be able to take care of them (or at least don&#x27;t receive a goal)

1U Australia to beat England in 2nd test match @ $1.53 (B365) 

Write-Up: So this match starts Thursday 3pm AEDT which is 8pm Wednesday LA time (and Americans can work it out from there). The key thing for test cricket is that it takes up to 5 days to complete a match, so the result won’t pay out for at least 3 days  but maybe 4-5. The first test did end in 2 days but that is super rare. 

So, why Australia over England? It’s a day-night test, which means half the match will be played during the day &amp; half the match will be played during the night. Test cricket is traditionally a day sport, and this day-night format is new. Australia is really good at cricket, and even better at day-night tests, while England struggle. They use a pink ball and it “swings” more than normal matches, so someone who can bowl fast consistently &amp; swing it is really important. 

Australia is 13 wins 1 loss in day-night test matches, with the worlds best bowler in the format Mitch Starc at the top of his game. Starc is important in that he has extremely good endurance - he’s like a baseball pitcher than can pitch at full accuracy &amp; speed til the 9th inning.

England is 2 wins 5 losses in day-night test matches. They have some potent fast bowlers but they tire easily - they are like a pitcher that is good for 4 innings. Sure, they probably strike you out more often than not, but you wear them down &amp; get going at them late. Archer was 10-15km/hr slower in the 2nd innings of the 1st test match than he was in the 1st innings. Archer took 2 wickets for 11 runs in 9 overs in the first innings (which are great stats), and then took 0 wickets for 45 runs in 8 overs in the 2nd innings (which are terrible stats) - like a pitcher throwing 9 strike-outs in first 3 innings &amp; then conceding 3 homers, 7 hits &amp; 9 runs in the next 3. 

Australia still don’t have their best player (Cummins) and another strike bowler (Hazelwood) but they managed to easily bowl England out all 20 required times in the first match. They struggled with batting but Usman Khawaja goes out, whose back woes disrupted &amp; unsettled the order significantly. Weatherald was shaken on debut but grew in confidence and based on his 2nd innings should only get better, Marnus Labaschagne found some form with a solid 2nd innings, and Travis Head was the match-winner. Meanwhile, England lose one of their main strike bowlers in Mark Wood, putting more pressure on the other 3 fast bowlers, all of whom were beaten up on in the 2nd innings. Basically, England gave it their all early, Australia underperformed, and Australia still won as England tired badly. Now, we enter Australia’s most dominant format.  

Be aware that this bet also includes a draw - which will only happen if the weather is bad. However the forecast is pretty good for the next 4 days and England will not extend the match to a 5th day. 

Finally, Australia have won 13 of the last 15 test matches against England, in Australia. They have won 5 of the last 6 at Brisbane (where the match starting tomorrow will be held). 

There’s no way in my eyes that this bet should have been eligible for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> as the odds should be way under $1.50.</td></tr>

**Reasoning:** Jokic should ideally shoulder the load for the upcoming game given Gordon, Braun are out and Murray is questionable. He is listed as probable due to a minor wrist issue but should hopefully be good to go.  He has averaged 31.7 points, 12.4 rebounds and 10.7 assists in his last 10 games. Last game he played he had posted a score of 55/12/6 - seems to be in form and could be a worthy bet.

**Risk:** Jokic’s wrist injury could limit his minutes or impact his performance if it worsens.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:  Knicks -8.5 @1.8 1u to win 0.8u


Write Up:  
 

Listen, man… I’m looking at this matchup between the New York Knicks and the Charlotte Hornets, and I’m telling you right now this got “Knicks by 10+” written on it like a big warning label. The Knicks defense? That thing is like TSA at the airport when they’re bored they checking EVERYTHING. The Hornets walking in with half a roster missing more pieces than a Dollar Store puzzle, and the Knicks already warming up like, “Hey man, who we blowing out <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>?”

And look if the Hornets offense had any rhythm, any swagger, ANY hope, maybe we’d talk. But no. These boys out here shooting like they’re trying to win a contest for “Most Creative Ways to Miss.” Meanwhile the Knicks got dudes who wake up in the morning choosing violence. They run their sets like they’re mad somebody ate their leftovers. You ever see a team rebound like they’re fighting for child custody? That’s the Knicks. And you want ME to believe the Hornets keeping this close? Maaaan Stahp.

Let me tell you something… if the Knicks don’t cover -8.5, I’ll personally call the team and ask who sabotaged the script. Because this matchup feels like one of those games where the Knicks go up 18 in the second quarter and Mike Brown still got the starters in the fourth yelling at everybody like it’s Game 7. Knicks -8.5? That ain’t a line, that’s a gift. Enjoy it before Vegas realizes they messed up.

🤾Handball Türkiye Superlig | Nilüfer Belediyespor - Giresunspor  ⏱️UTC 12:00

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Giresunspor +11.5 Handicap @ 1.75



Giresun&#x27;s losses and points difference in the Süper Lig this season:

vs. Nilüfer (home): 22–29 → -7

vs. Beşiktaş (home): 37–45 → -8

vs. İstanbul GSK (away): 31–35 → -4

vs. Spor Toto (away): 29–33 → -4

vs. AS Hentbol (home): 20–21 → -1

vs. Güneysu (home, Week 15): 21–24 → -3

Critical point: All of Giresun&#x27;s losses this season have been by a maximum of 8 points (Beşiktaş match). No team has yet managed to outscore Giresun by 12 points or more. Moreover, a significant portion of these losses came against the top 4-5 teams in the league: Beşiktaş, Spor Toto, İstanbul GSK, Nilüfer, AS Hentbol, ​​Güneysu.

On the other hand, consider Giresun&#x27;s dominant wins:

vs. Rize Bld (home, Week 10): 41–24 → +17

vs. Ankara Hentbol (home, Week 12): 50–25 → +25

@ Trabzon BŞB (Week 7): 36–29 → +7

vs. Mihalıççık (Week 8): 33–30 → +3

@ Beykoz (Week 11): 34–28 → +6

These scores indicate two things: Giresun is productive offensively; they possess the quality to quickly overwhelm lower-tier opponents. They manage to stay in the game even against strong opponents; the score never &quot;collapses.&quot;

Statistical summary: Total goal difference: +43 (421–378), +3.3 goals per game.

Heaviest league defeat: -8 (Beşiktaş).

Average loss difference against the top 4 teams:

Total difference between matches against Nilüfer, Spor Toto, Beşiktaş, and İstanbul GSK: 7 + 4 + 8 + 4 = 23 goals

Number of matches: 4 → average -5.75

Let&#x27;s summarize and list them all.

– Nilüfer has a +128 goal difference in 12 league matches, a +10.7 goal difference per game, although most of this difference is against the bottom-placed teams.

– Giresun, on the other hand, is a positive mid-to-upper-level team with a +43 goal difference in 13 matches; their heaviest league defeat this season was only an 8-goal difference (Beşiktaş).

– Nilüfer only won the first match away by 7 goals (29–22). A +11.5 win rate seems excessive from a market perspective for a team with an average margin of -5-6 against league giants like Spor Toto, İstanbul GSK, Nilüfer, and Beşiktaş. In a typical scenario, I&#x27;m betting on Nilüfer to win, but I expect a match where Giresun will maintain their lead for the full 60 minutes and a margin of around 8-9. Therefore, Giresun +11.5 (1.75) is a valuable handicap <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> in my opinion.</td></tr>

Start Time &amp; TV: 7:00 &amp; 7:15pm EST (BTN &amp; ACCN)

Units: 2.5 Units

Reasoning: Heading right back to where we started off on this subreddit with some college basketball. My very first <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> post on here was a college basketball play so I have been eagerly awaiting to find my spot for my first college basketball <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> of the year! Going with a two legger with two very hot teams in the Indiana Hoosiers and the LSU Tigers. Indiana comes into this one with a perfect 7-0 record and they are averaging 90 points per game and shooting with over a 50% field goal percentage while being paired with a very solid defense that is averaging just 62 points allowed per game. They face off against Minnesota who has lost three straight games against Santa Clara, Stanford and San Francisco and they are an abysmal 1-7 against the spread this year with the main contributor being their lack of offensive production even against very poor squads. The Golden Gophers have also left many points off the board this year at the charity stripe as they are one of the worst free throw shooting teams in the nation with just a 66% free throw percentage and this team revolves around Cade Tyson so if the Hoosiers can make it difficult for Tyson I think they easily cruise to victory in this one. The LSU Tigers also come into this one with a perfect 7-0 record and they have one of the nations highest scoring offenses as they are racking up 95 points per game which is 9th out of 365 schools and they are 1st in division one in field goal percentage shooting 55% from the field. They are facing  a Boston College squad who have a very stale offense averaging 70 points per game, a 40% field goal percentage and similarly to Minnesota they have been struggling from the line as well just shooting just under 68% from the charity stripe. This Boston College squad has been handed some brutal losses against non impressive teams like Tulane, Central Connecticut State, Florida Atlantic and Davidson in a game where they only scored 49 points in. I expect both of these teams to win this one by at least more than one possession.

Prediction: 78-69 Indiana, 76-70 LSU

Last pick:🏈Oklahoma ML/Alabama ML💰Two really fun games to watch. Doesnt get much better than that on rivalry week.

Event: Milwaukee Bucks vs Detroit Pistons NBA

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Milwaukee Bucks Moneyline (+135) 5 units

Once again, Vegas is reading too much into recent plays. Yes, I know the Bucks are 9-13 and the Pistons are an eastern-conference leading 17-4. Yes, I know the Bucks have lost 8 of their last 9 with their most recent being a loss to the Wizards. For me, the Bucks still pass the eye test and have had steady leads in a lot of their recent games. It feels more like the Pistons are actually the team that has lost some of their early season momentum in the last week, and I think it can finally catch up to them here. Pistons have lost b2b games against Celtics and Magic before scraping by one possession victories against the heat and the hawks. Now, they have to travel to Milwaukee. Giannis recently removed everything Bucks related off of his social media. This, dare I say, is a season-defining game for the Bucks and I expect them to come out strong and hold a lead throughout this game. Will be going my full 5 units on the Bucks Moneyline and I did float taking them on the spread instead (+3.5), but felt like the value is here on the ML. If you want to play it safer, def take the spread!

Just to reiterate, in conjunction with my model, I use the eye test as well as my gut feeling to play what I believe is the most-valuable <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> on the slate. Cheers to a great game, and please remember to gamble responsibly and to only wager what you can afford to lose.

Last pick: Chet Holmgren OVER 15.5 Points(-120 HR)✅


<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the day</mark> : Josh Giddey “U” 21.5 Points (-105)
Played: HardRock | Bet: 1U

Reason • Hes under this line in 12/18 games this season. Coby White is OUT for this one. Giddey is under this line in 9/13 games this year without him in the lineup.

• Facing the Nets who are a stingy defense for PGs. They allow the 12th FEWEST points to PGs this season and guard the PNR ball handler at one of the highest rates in the league which is one of Giddey top scoring types.

• On top of that they have a 9th ranked ATB3 defense and an 11th ranked ITP defense which is where Giddey scores a combined 51% of his points. He will have to do most of his damage in the restricted area which he should struggle to get to vs the Nets defense who sends bodies at the PNR handler.

• The Nets have held plenty of similar players under their lines recently including: 

Maxey (22) - Ball (12) - Sexton (15) - Rollins (10) - Quickley (13). 

• Expecting the Nets to put pressure on Giddey with White and Huerter out of the lineup and force the surrounding cast to beat them.</td></tr>

* Bucknell...is not a legitimate college basketball team, they usually lose by 30+ points

* Ideally, both team will win by 20+ points, which is pretty close to their spreads straight up
* Since this is a 5 unit bet, wanted to be safer as these alternate spreads are the narrowest margin wins each have had.  Essentially my logic is that the only risk is if UIC only wins by 3 or loses which should be very low based on opponent.

Event: Louisville @ Arkansas (NCAAB) (6:15pm central)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Louisville -2.5 (-130) (1U)

-everything is bet to win unit amount-

Write up:

Louisville -2.5 over Arkansas is a play on depth, discipline, and possession control. The Cardinals enter this matchup averaging 96.7 points per game with a +33.7 scoring margin, ranking among the nation’s top offenses while maintaining efficiency. Their assist-to-turnover ratio of 1.96 and 20.7 assists per game highlight a structured offense that minimizes mistakes, a critical edge against an Arkansas team that thrives on transition opportunities. Louisville also dominates the glass, pulling down 46.0 rebounds per game compared to Arkansas’ 37.9, which directly limits second-chance points and fast-break chances for the Razorbacks. Defensively, Louisville allows just 63.0 points per game, showing they can control pace even against high-scoring opponents. Arkansas, while explosive at 88.1 points per game, is less efficient in the half court with a 1.25 assist-to-turnover ratio and a lower assist rate (57.7% vs. Louisville’s 65.9%). Experience also tilts toward Louisville, whose veteran rotation has already proven it can travel, evidenced by their road win over Cincinnati, one of the nation’s top defensive teams. In a game projected to be fast-paced, the team that secures possessions, avoids turnovers, and controls the boards has the edge — and Louisville checks every box. 

Louisville doesn’t turn the ball over and has more than enough bodies to throw at Arkansas. I just think that while this game could be close, Louisville matches Arkansas strengths and has the better experience here.


Laying -2.5 positions us with the deeper, more disciplined side that can neutralize Arkansas’ preferred style and grind out a cover.

As always. Cheers 🍻</td></tr>

Both of these teams have been scoring a lot of points and playing with pace this season, with LA being involved in a ton of up-tempo games on the road. Zubac has hit the 11+ number in 13 of his last 14 games and Johnson has hit eight rebounds in nine of his last 10. 

I see this being a fast pace game with a lot of rebound opportunities for two guys who tend to dominate the glass. I don’t want to overthink this one. I think both of these guys hit their numbers easily.

All three of these lines hit and man am I glad I took the Stars TT instead of the Stars ML as my Rangers secured a very rare home comeback, tying the game with two minutes left and winning in 3-2 in OT.  To put this in perspective for non-hockey fans, this season they&#x27;ve set an NHL record by becoming the first team to get shut out in their first three homes games and have been blanked five times at home already this season which is absolutely brutal to avid viewers and frequent MSG attendees such as myself.  Even in the games they haven&#x27;t been shut out, they&#x27;ve generally performed like complete ass offensively. All this to say that while taking three -400 lines wasn&#x27;t sexy, wasn&#x27;t turning anyone on or getting on the phone with their girlfriends/sidepieces to get them all hot and bothered, it did yield some results and for that, I am thankful.

Unlike last night when I didn&#x27;t love anything on the NHL calendar, this one popped immediately.  Naturally, this probably means that it&#x27;s going to be a brutal beat but I&#x27;m riding anyways.  These have been two of my favorite teams to target all season: young, fast, fun teams that play up-tempo hockey.  Ducks are 2nd in the NHL in goals while both teams are league average defensively but also full of enough youthful exuberance  that they commit massive coverage gaffes every now and then that lead to odd man rushes against. I&#x27;m listing over 6.0 as the safer official play but 6.5 is playable for better odds or even 7.0 if you really want to get spicy with it.  Should be a fun game.

NBA | Hawks vs Clippers | 🏀  

Jalen Johnson has been an absolute monster this year and has slowly grown to be one of my favourites players this season, this man just does it all and has shown that he’s an All-Star imo. In the absence of Trae Young he’s truly shown the way for this Hawks team and is now facing a Clippers side that just can’t defend, currently with the 4th worst defensive rating in the league and im expecting Jalen to exploit this weak defense.

Without Porzingis and Trae Young, Jalen is over this line in 7/7 games this season avg 51.1 PRA per game. Jalen gets the far majority of his points (26.4%) in transition which is his main play type where Clippers are ranked 23rd (7th worst). On top of the great matchup for points, he’s been absolutely killing with the assists and rebounds avg 20.3 RA’s &amp; a whopping 35.9 potentials in his last 10 games including 32 potentials against the Clippers earlier this season. 

Been a beast so far and im happily backing Jalen in this matchup especially with the numbers he has put up without KP and Trae.

Unit: 1u to win 1.4u

Write up: What an electric cash with William &amp; Mary. That was terrifying yet so much fun to watch. Never a doubt right? I was looking at the board for tomorrow and these two games really jumped out at me. I’m a big Bradley Basketball fan and know the MVC inside and out. This Belmont Bruins team is the cream of the crop this year in The Valley. The way they run their offense, move the ball, get open looks; it’s truly a thing of beauty. Casey Alexander has a good thing going down in Nashville and I don’t see the team from Richmond slowing them down whatsoever. Tyler Lundblade in my opinion is the best shooter in the country and it’s not even close. Remember the name. 

Belmont comes into this game 8-0 on the year and has honestly decimated every team they have faced. Don’t get me wrong this Richmond team is good and they are very well coached. But they lack so much on the defensive end that they simply won’t be able to keep pace with the efficiency of Belmont. 

Belmont effective offensive FG % sits at 4th in the country and their defensive effective FG% is 15th in the country. Meanwhile Richmond is 49th in offensive effective FG% and this is the big difference they are 143rd in defensive effective FG%. 

Richmond won’t be able to stop the Belmont train. I’m a fan of this team and that’s coming from a Bradley fan. I don’t look forward to playing them this year. 

Take Belmont ML.

Now for the Texas Longhorns. I actually really like the build out of this team. They are the 5th oldest team in the country and have two blemishes on their record. A 15 point loss to Duke which nobody has been able to keep close with them and a 1 point heartbreaking loss to Arizona State. That ASU team I’m higher on than a lot of people. Both those losses are going to be great losses come selection time. Coming off a great win against the Will Wade NC State squad this Texas team is going to be coming home looking for another statement win. 

This Virginia team on the other hand hasn’t really beat anyone. Northwestern is an okay win but I don’t see Northwestern getting out of the bottom half of the Big Ten. They also lost to Butler who’s mid at best. The one thing I do like is how they crash the offensive boards. Virginia is big. But they aren’t athletic. At least not as athletic as their opponent. 

I truly think we see the experience and veteran led Texas squad show up and take this game by 5 or more points. Tramon Mark and Jordan Pope have this uncanny ability to make timely shots over and over again and I think we see them show up and show out big time. 

Take Texas ML

I personally handicapped Belmont as -7.5 favorites and Texas as -5.5 favorites. Belmont/Texas +140 is a beaut. 

Let’s make it 3 days in a row why don’t we. 

Good luck and let’s keep it going.

Sport: English Premier League - Chelsea vs. Leeds @ 3:15pm EST  

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Chelsea win + Over 1 total goals = +110 (5 units)

Write Up: I usually like taking the other side when one team (Chelsea) has a much busier and more competitive schedule than the other (Leeds). However, Chelsea seems to be “sharpening their tools,” lately and really finding their confidence and form. It appears to me that Neto and Estevao are really coming into their own in Chelsea uniforms, Enzo is incredible, Palmer is back (apparently). My only hope is that they don’t take their foot off the gas now that they’re against an easier opponent. A draw a man down to Arsenal is a huge result, now they have the opportunity to make a big early step in the title fight. I am concerned about the number of games they’ve played recently and Caicedo being suspended for this game. No team in the prem is a cakewalk (other than Wolves), but Chelsea, for being such a young team, already has quite a bit of experience under their belts competing for the top and they also have little “pressure” from the media to be winning the league, I think that benefits them. Maresca is also a fantastic manager at balancing workload and getting results.

**Leg 1:**  Arsenal ML vs Brentford - Both teams to score NO

Arsenal at home have been quite formidable this year winning 9 out of 10 matches across all competitions, scoring 25 while just conceding 2 at the Emirates Stadium to Man City and Tottenham. 

Meanwhile Brentford have lost 5 of their last 6 away matches conceding 12 goals in the process.

Arsenal’s defensive structure is like a fortress few teams have been able to penetrate.  They have allowed only 7 goals this season across all 13 matches played, by far the stingiest defense in the league.

**Leg 2:**  Athletic Club vs Real Madrid – Draw-no-Bet

This game will mark Real Madrid’s 6^(th) consecutive road game.  They have won 1, drawn 3 and had 1 loss to Liverpool in Champions League.  In the 3 La Liga matches, they were dominant controlling possession, having more shots and shots on target, yet ending in draws. 

Real Madrid have players making their returns including Militao and Rudiger in defense which should allow their midfield to push their lines a bit more forward and help Bellingham, Vinicious and Mbappe to get the job done.

Meanwhile, hosts Athletic Club have a bunch of injuries and this has opened the door for the possibility of potentially starting 18-year old Selton Sanchez.

Given this being the final of 6 road games for Real Madrid, and being 2^(nd) in the table, I expect them to step up the caliber of pressure to get the 3 points they need in their hunt to catch league leaders Barcelona.  If Madrid win they will be just 1 point behind them.

The Ducks are one of the highest scoring teams in the NHL so far this season and are going up against an Utah team that is in poor form and haven’t had good performances from their goalies. Vejmelka played poorly against the Sharks on Monday, so you may see their backup Vanecek.

On the other hand, the Ducks are onto their 3rd string goalie Ville Husso (maybe could argue 2nd string) as they’re out Dostal and Mrazek. Husso had a pretty good game on Monday against STL but STL missed a bunch of golden opportunities to score (like wide open nets bad).

Event: Chelsea at Leeds (EPL) u/3:15pm EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Chelsea to Win (-120)

Read: Chelsea have really been getting themselves together as of late. They are coming off a hard fought draw as they hosted the league leaders Arsenal last time out. In a game including a first half red card which they played through, scored, and salvaged a point. Chelsea have only dropped points in two away games all season. One of which they drew 2-2 with Brentford back in September and then the next prem match that followed they lost 2-1 to Man United with a red card five minutes into the match. (I don&#x27;t see them conceding two goals in this spot) Since then, they have won three away games in a row and have not conceded a single goal in any of them. Their defense has stepped up lately. Caicedo will not be available because of suspension. Cole Palmer is in the mix to play and potentially even start which is very positive.

Leeds have conceded 25 goals and have only scored 13 of their own during this season through thirteen total games. At home they have been noticeably better defensively. Only conceding 7 goals in six games. Compared to conceding 18 goals in seven games away from home. This is my only worry in this game besides the Caicedo absence. Leeds are significantly better at home. They are also due unfortunately. Truth be told though Leeds are 2-1-7 in their last ten matches. They sit 18th in the table fighting to get out of the relegation zone. 

Yes. Leeds have shown signs of life at home but, Chelsea is flying and with their form recently they will not be stopped here. Trust the boys in blue.

Union Berlin vs Bayern Munich

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> : Bayern to Win + Total Over 2.5 Goals @1.64 for 3u

Bayern Munich are first in the Bundesliga with 44 league goals and have won 13 of their last 15 games across all competitions, while they scored in 100 percent of their recent matches with an average of 3.27 goals per game, making over 2.5 extremely likely. Union Berlin did hold Bayern to a 2-2 draw just three weeks ago and have been the only team to take points off Bayern in the Bundesliga, but Bayern have both scored and conceded in their last five consecutive matches, meaning goals are guaranteed in both directions. Bayern lost 3-1 to Arsenal in the Champions League last week but bounced back with a 3-1 win over St. Pauli, proving they respond well to defeats. For Bayern, the pokal match is very important game as they would be aiming to win the whole thing. It&#x27;s no surprise Bayern want to lift the cup since it&#x27;s been lot of years since they last lifted it. Bayern&#x27;s main 11 will play <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> against Union, and therefore Bayern should win this with score line of 2-1, 3-1, or 3-0.

ESBJERG VS COPENHAGEN

Date: 03 DECEMBER 2025 at 18:00

BET ON: Over / Under- Over +2.50

Odd: 1.62

DENMARK CUP

\- Esbjerg enter the cup quarter-final with strong momentum and a highly charged home atmosphere, as more than 13,000 tickets have already been sold — a level of local intensity Danish media highlight as a real factor in pushing the team forward. Their recent 3–1 win and consistent goal-scoring at home suggest an attacking approach from the EfB coaching staff, who know that their best chance lies in using the energy of Blue Water Arena to put pressure on FCK. Copenhagen arrive in a more fragile state, with head coach Jacob Neestrup openly admitting that the team has lacked “power and energy” after several poor away performances, yet he recently chose to highlight the side’s offensive strengths and stated that he wants to build on that rather than tighten defensively. The combination of Esbjerg’s motivation and confidence, FCK’s defensive vulnerability, and a coach who publicly prioritises attacking play despite setbacks creates the conditions for an open match with tempo, space, and chances at both ends — strongly supporting a bet on Over 2.5 goals.</td></tr>

Contrary to what the table shows, Wolves are not that bad, as they&#x27;ve generated great chances in all home games they&#x27;ve played. They have underperformed quite a bit with 7 scored in total, while accumulating almost 12 xG total, but at home they do way better. Nottingham have failed to keep clean sheets in almost all PL games. This season in the PL in 13 games Nottingham have 1 clean sheet vs Liverpool, where clearly Liverpool should have scored. At home this season, Wolves hit a btts in 4/6 PL games, failing to score only on Palace and City, while hitting btts vs some decent teams. They also played 3 EFL Cup games at home where they had a 3-4 loss to Chelsea, 2-0 win vs Everton and a 3-2 win over West Ham.</td></tr>

Last Pick: Sonmez vs Jimenez Kasintseva - Sonmez ML @ 1.57 ✅️

This was a classic WTA style match, with both players breaking each other constantly but Sonmez won the 2nd set tiebreak and carried the momentum to finish off with a win.

**Plays will always be shared as 1 unit for fair record purposes**

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** **Monnot vs Sonmez - Sonmez to win 2-0 @ 1.81**

Sonmez had a sweaty battle against Kasintseva, an opponent who was able to keep the match close due to her size advantage on this indoor surface in Angers, by saving 8 break points. This was still a quality win for Sonmez, especially after surviving a second-set tiebreak against a taller opponent. 

This time, things should become a lot easier against Monnot, a player who has never been able to break into the top 400, as she will need to beat Sonmez from the baseline, since she only has 1.64 metres, so she shouldn&#x27;t be able to serve at a high level to avoid rallies against a stronger opponent. 

Sonmez was able to reach a career-high top-70 in October, after some strong performances in Beijing and Ningbo. Most recently, she was able to beat Eva Lys, a top-40 player, on this surface (Indoor Hard).

With this, the skill gap should be huge, and I&#x27;m expecting Sonmez to win in straight sets.</td></tr>

**Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Harry Wilson 1+ SOT (+105) ❌️

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s Event:** English Premier League | Arsenal vs. Brentford (11:30AM PST)

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Thiago 1+ SOT (+100) 1 unit to win 1 unit

**Write Up:** All I can say is wow. What a match that was, we were treated to a real spectacle. Bummer that Wilson didn&#x27;t look to shoot much of the game and his teammates didnt <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> out his runs in the box. 9 goals were scored and our guy wound up with one assist and no shots. We move on, sorry we lost, but thankful for a great game. I&#x27;ve mentioned this before, but my plays are intended to boost the enjoyment of watching some great matches. Giving us something to root for. We won&#x27;t hit them all, but we try to hit as many as possible. 

We stay in London <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> where 1st Place Arsenal hosts 11th place Brentford. These mid-week matches are always tricky, as coaches will want to rotate without losing synergy and giving up points. I think Arsenal will be looking towards the weekend where they play at Villa and try to rotate as much as possible. Brentford on the other hand will want to play spoiler as they are not playing in Europe this season and I expect most of their 1st team. 

I was shocked to see this line at even money and wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this moves quickly. Thiago has had a fantastic start to the season, filling the void for Brentford left by the parting of Mbuemo and Wissa. He&#x27;s got 11 goals and is a striker in form. He&#x27;s averaging over 2 SOTs per match, and has only failed a SOT in 3 matches making him 10/13. 

Arsenal has a great defense, but we also bet against it over the weekend with success. I expect Arsenal to rotate their already injured backline even more here. I love this play because Thiago has hit SOTs against the big teams all season, landing 3 SOTs on Liverpool and 1 on Man City. He&#x27;s also hit 3-2-2 SOTs in his last 3 matches. Arsenal should win this match, but I&#x27;ll gladly take Thiago to get 1 SOT at even money!

BOL!</td></tr>

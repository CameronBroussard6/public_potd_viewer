__Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:__ [*Pending: Rashee Rice o6.5 rec (+125), 3u*](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/s/FlQygVzdkm)

__Event:__ NCAAF: UTEP @ Kennesaw St 8pm EST

__POTD:__ Kennesaw St -9.5 (-120 FD), 3.6u to win 3u

__Write Up:__ Starting off by saying I went back &amp; watched every game for both teams. I will be at this game as Kennesaw St is my Alma Mater &amp; I live closeby, although I‚Äôve been a lifelong Georgia Tech fan. This is the last week we get Tuesday &amp; Wednesday football action so I figured I‚Äôd fire up a post. Tuesday we have UTEP (2-5, 1-2 CUSA) traveling to Kennesaw to take on the Owls (5-2, 3-0 CUSA). __KSU is coming off a 45-26 road win over FIU, extending their 5 game win streak.__ They are 1st in the conference right now &amp; are coming in hot. Let‚Äôs take a look at their last 5 games including each teams Sagarin rating (my most trusted analytical CFB &amp; CBB rankings I‚Äôve used for years). Starting with the most recent game: 

KSU Sag rating #107:

W21 @ FIU - #149

W28 vs LA Tech - #103

W8 vs MTSU - #171

W7 vs Ark St - #108

W14 vs Merrimack - #225

KSU had dominant 20+ point wins in their last 2 games. LA Tech is a good team who is Sag ranked 45 spots better than UTEP at #103. FIU is ranked #149 which is right next to UTEP who is ranked #148. __Let‚Äôs take a look at UTEP‚Äôs schedule, who has lost 4 of their last 5 games:__

UTEP: #148

W18 @ Sam Houston - #207

L11 vs Liberty - #120

L19 vs LA Tech - #103

L6 LA Monroe - #160 

L17 Texas - #9

UTEP‚Äôs only win came against an 0-7 Sam Houston. __But the biggest takeaway is UTEP lost by 19 to LA Tech. Kennesaw State beat that same LA Tech team by 28 the very next week. Sagarin‚Äôs analytical predictions has KSU winning this one 33-16.__ Having said all that, rankings aren‚Äôt everything. I just wanted to give background on these 2 basically unknown teams. Let‚Äôs get into it.

*More writeup incoming*

__Kennesaw State -9.5__

Last Five Predictions (Old - New): ‚úÖ‚ùå‚úÖ‚úÖ‚ùå

Net Units: +19.88

Yesterday&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Moreirense v Porto. Porto (-1.0 &amp;-1.5) Asian Handicap. 3u @ $1.54 ‚ùå /‚úÖ¬†

Lost half the initial stake as the first bet (-1) pushed, and the other (-1.5) lost. Unsure exactly how to write that on the ledger, but counting it as a loss because I walked away with less money than I put in.¬†

Porto dominated possession but didn&#x27;t create that many chances from it. Moreirense scored within 20 minutes, which wasn&#x27;t ideal. Porto equalised just before halftime.¬†

In the second half, Porto dominated again, but didn&#x27;t get the winner until the 88th minute. From there, it was unlikely they&#x27;d push the issue for a third.¬†

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Thun v Winterthur. Thun (-1.0 &amp;-1.5) Asian Handicap. 3u @ $1.87

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Going with the Asian Hanidap again on Thun.¬†

Newly promoted, but currently in first place, Thun hosts last-place Winterthur in the Swiss Super League.¬†

The Swiss Super League has started tight, with every team losing at least two of their opening ten games. Thun&#x27;s two losses so far have been to Young Boys and Basel, who are two of the best teams in the league.¬†

Thun&#x27;s two goals a game is the second-best in the league, and their 1.3 goals against are the third-best in the league.¬†

While I don&#x27;t expect them to win the league in their first season back in the top flight, they&#x27;ve looked good so far.¬†

Meanwhile, Winterthur are 0-1-4 in their five away games in the league, copping seventeen goals in those games. In fact, in Winterthur&#x27;s ten league games, they&#x27;ve conceded 30 goals, which is the worst in the league by 11 goals.

I like Thun at home in this match.¬†</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Iowa +6.5 (-110 FanDuel)

Event: Oregon @ Iowa 1:30MST

Write up: <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s matchup is a defensive clash between the #4th (Iowa) and the #6th (Oregon) ranked defenses currently in the nation, and I predict this matchup to be a close one. I believe Iowa’s ability to keep games close at home this year gives this team the legitimacy to keep this matchup within a single possession with a sneaky chance at taking this game outright. Oregon has allowed an average of 114 rushing yards per game, and although they have been effective at keeping teams out of the redzone, they have allowed touchdowns in 10/13 trips into the redzone to teams this year, and all 13 trips have resulted in a field goal or a touchdown. On the other side, the Hawks have been extremely productive at running the ball, rushing for an average of 185 yards per game and making the most out of their redzone trips this season in scoring on 32/34 attempts while scoring a touchdown at a 67% clip. The Hawkeyes&#x27; suffocating defense and ability to give their offense incredible field position will allow them to run the ball effectively, control the overall tempo of the game, and expose Oregon’s biggest weakness in stopping the run and their ability to stop teams once they enter the red zone.

Tail or fade BOL to everyone and cheers! 🍻</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s Event:** English Premier League | Chelsea vs Wolves (12:00pm PST)

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Enzo Fernandez 1+ SOT (-110)

**Write Up:** Hi friends! I have lurked for a while and thought I&#x27;d share some insights here and in the Soccer thread. I watch a ton of EPL so I figured this would be a great fixture to start on. 
I see great value in this line. Chelsea, sitting 7th in the PL table, has been inconsistent this year and ravaged with injuries. Enzo has had at least one SOT in 6 of 7 matches in all comps (4 of 4 PL) since Cole Palmer has been out injured. He is also their main penalty taker and team captain. In his last 4 PL matches, Enzo has averaged 3 shots, 1.75 of those being on target. Chelsea is facing off against a last place Wolves team who just sacked their manager. I fully expect Chelsea will control the ball and fire off 15+ shots, we just need one from Enzo to be on target for this to hit. 

BOL to everyone, have a great Saturday!</td></tr>

Sport: Bundesliga/EPL

Time: 15:30 CET/GMT+2

Dont have time for a long writeup, but Bayern are the best team in the world and have started their season with 16/16 wins and 16/16 matches hitting O2.5. Keep riding until the wheels fall off. Same story with Arsenal. They have only conceeded 3 goals the entire season and have kept a clean sheet for 8 concecutive matches, and while the odds are not good, i dont think there is a world where they conceed 2 from Sunderland. They even have conceeded only 2 shots on target in their last 5 matches, absolutely insane.

Formula One | Sao Paulo GP Sprint Race | 9AM ET

Lando Norris to win Sprint Race (-163) 1.5u

**Write Up:** McLaren has been the fastest throughout FP1 and SQ, and Norris has been on a tear lately. It most likely will rain later <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, and the conditions are a bit questionable, but as long as Lando can keep it on the road, I am confident with this one. The spray from the cars will also make it harder to overtake from behind, as Lando will have a clear view of the track in front of him. Also with the weather, for the sprint, at least half of the 24 lap race must be completed, with at least two laps not being behind the Safety Car to award points. If this criteria isn&#x27;t met, this bet will be a push.

This <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> is the same as just total cards over 3.5


Although Bayern are probably the best in Europe and free scoring, they average around 2.30 cards just for themselves per game and a 3.80 total, in away games those numbers increase. Union Berlin have averaged 2.70 for themselves and a 4.90 total, with the number increasing at home. Both sides have covered this line in majority of their games this season. The ref for this game gives out big amounts - This season he has given 11, 8, 2, 3, 6, 5, 6, 8, 5, 11, 0. He has also reffed a Bayern game already this season vs Augsburg where there were 6 total cards.</td></tr>

Union Berlin vs Bayern Munich

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> : Bayern Over 2.5 Goals @1.8 for 5u

Bayern have been scoring goals for fun this entire season and have an incredible record of hitting over 2.5 goals in almost every match they play. Bayern have scored 56 goals in just 16 games this season, which averages out to 3.5 goals per game, and they have hit over 2.5 goals in last 10 matches. Harry Kane is on fire with 22 goals so far this season, and he is supported by Luis Díaz with 10 goals and Michael Olise with 7 goals, meaning Bayern have multiple players who score regularly. Even though Union Berlin has been playing good at home this season, it would be difficult for them to stop Bayern especially since how they have been playing this season. Bayern won 16 games in a row and this is first time a team had a start like this in Top 5 leagues. This is the last game before the coming international break and Bayern would be looking to enter the break with 17/17 record.

<tr><td class='post'>Record: 46-34. 

Last Pick: Crystal Palace vs AZ. Under 3.5 goals.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: Martin Schindler ML vs Luke Woodhouse

Sport: Darts, Grand Slam

Reasoning: Schindler’s season average sits around 94.3 alongside a recent checkout rate of 57 %.  ￼ Woodhouse’s finishing has been weaker (checkout 35 %) and his average hovers slightly lower, making Schindler the more consistent option in a short-race format.

Yesterday&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: HIK to win vs FC Helsingor. 3u @ $1.91 ✅

Nice win to get us started. Ended 3-2, there was a few shaky moments, but happy with that. 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:  South Shields HT/FT v Kings Lynn 4u @ $2.30

South Shields are the best team in the league, with and 11-2-1 record. Kings Lynn sit 15th with a 4-6-6 record. 

South Shields are one of the best performing defensive units in the country, conceding only 8 goals in 14 games... And 2 of those were last week away to the second place side. 

In their 14 league games this season, South have won the first half 9 times, been drawing three times, and down twice. That record at home is even better.... Being in front 6 out of their 7 home games. They&#x27;ve only conceded two first half goals at home this season, scoring seven of their own. 

To their credit, Kings Lynn have also been good in first halves this season - however South Shields are proving to be a class above this season and this bet is to echo that instead.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s pick</mark>: Hyder Amil ML -140
Event: UFC Vegas 111

I have a couple big bets I love on this card and multiple smaller bets, but I think my favorite is Hyder Amil to beat Jamall Emmers. 

All things equal I think Hyder is the better fighter, but Jamall is also older and has suffered much more damage over his career so I expect it to be even more one sided. The line is what it is because Amil was brutally KOed in 30s his last fight, but there are not many Delgados out there capable of doing that to Amil and I don’t think Emmers is one of them.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s Fixture: England v Fiji (Rugby Union 17:40pm UK / 12:40pm EST)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: England -23.5 @ 2.01 (2U)

Write up: 

Going against the grain with this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. If you read any analysis of the game most people expect England to win but by a small margin. 

I disagree. England have won 8 in a row , beat Australia extremely comfortably at home last week and are playing a side in Fiji who have endless attacking flair but will concede points for fun. 

Really liking the England lineup and think we are in for an exciting game. 

Prediction: England 48-12 Fiji

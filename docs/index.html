Last Pick: Hernan Casanova ML vs Alex Hernández (-138, 1 unit): Win

Tennis | Guayaquil Challenger | 12:00 PM EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Juan Pablo Varillas vs Murkel Dellien | **Varillas ML at -147 (DK). 1 unit.**

Write-up: In terms of CLV, that was one of my best picks ever, as Casanova closed at around -330. He did end up dropping the second set after dominating the first, but came back strong in the third. 

Juan Pablo Varillas is a talented Pervian clay-courter who has in recent years suffered from injuries and inconsistent form. That trend has continued this season, as a solid start to the year that saw him win a pretty stacked Buenos Aires Challenger was disrupted by a three-month injury break from May to September. However, Varillas seems to be rounding into form again, with some nice wins over guys like Guillen Meza and Gomez and no terrible losses. The market has been giving him a decent amount of respect lately, as he was only priced at +229 against a pretty strong clay-courter in Roman Burruchaga. 

Murkel Dellien, meanwhile, is another player with years of experience on this surface and a game that suits it quite well. However, he&#x27;s been playing practically nonstop this year, and I feel that it&#x27;s started to affect his results. Sure, he threw in a splashy upset over Mariano Navone earlier this month, but he was priced at nearly +475 in that match, and Navone wasn&#x27;t a huge favorite over Burruchaga in a recent match (around -227, and lost in straight sets). Other than that one win, Dellien&#x27;s form has been pretty dismal, with losses to mid-tier ITF guys like Cundom and Gimenez as well as a recent drubbing at the hands of Guido Ivan Justo (6.35 performance rating). 

While the odds analysis showed a small edge for Varillas, it didn&#x27;t totally convince me that there was enough value to post this. However, watching both players&#x27; first-round matches here in full pushed this play over the edge. Varillas faced Juan Carlos Aguilar, who lacks a bit in size and power but makes up for it with strong net skills and touch. I felt that there was a clear gap in quality, as Varillas&#x27;s heavy forehand and flat, powerful backhand gave him the edge in most rallies. There were points in the match were he was missing first serves or maybe taking a few too many risks, but he never really let it affect his strategy or looked vulnerable. 

Meanwhile, Dellien won his match by a lopsided 6-1, 6-1 scoreline, but I don&#x27;t feel that that scoreline tells the full story of his match. His opponent, American Ryan Dickerson, didn&#x27;t seem especially comfortable in these conditions and had trouble working around a weak backhand wing. However, there were still moments where Dickerson looked to be troubling Murkel with his serve and forehand, and he missed several opportunities to make the match much more competitive. Dellien hits with big windups and lots of margin, and his forehand grip seems to be pretty close to a full western. What that means in practice is that he can struggle against someone like Varillas, who is going to be ripping the ball and forcing you to find a way out of defensive positions. 

In terms of the head-to-head, Dellien holds a 1-0 lead, having defeated Varillas in straight sets last year. However, I&#x27;ve found some recent success going against the head-to-head; the match was also close in terms of points, and Varillas was a -250 favorite. Varillas certainly comes into this match with less form and rhythm than last year, but so does Dellien. This isn&#x27;t a smash spot, but I think Varillas should be a bigger favorite than the 59.51% implied here.

Last pick: Kentucky ML + Duke ML ❌

NCAAB // Alabama Crimson Tide @ Illinois Fighting Illini

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Illinois -3.5 (-106 FD) 1u**

Heading to the house that Michael Jordan built for a &quot;neutral site game&quot; between two ranked teams. Alabama comes in ranked #11 at 2-1 and Illinois is ranked #8 sitting at 4-0. This game figures to be a high scoring affair with two of the nation&#x27;s best offenses. One key difference in this game however is Illinois actually plays strong defense as well, limiting their opponents to an average of just 66.8ppg while Alabama prefers the race to 100 approach allowing 81.7ppg.

Both have had early challenges so far this year with Alabama splitting their big games against St. Johns and Purdue and Illinois winning their game against Texas Tech.

The most troubling thing about Alabama&#x27;s loss to Purdue was the rebounding discrepancy. They got absolutely embarrassed on the glass by the Boilermakers to the tune of 28-52, yikes. Ok, well that could be expected as Purdue sits at a respectable #54 in the country with a rebounding margin of +10.2. Uh oh....Illinois is ranked #2 in the country in rebounding margin at a gaudy +21.8.

Illinois +21.8 rebounding margin, Alabama rebounding margin -1. This is going to be a problem for the Crimson Tide.

Now, if you are unfamiliar with Nate Oats&#x27;s team they will be shooting the 3, like a lot. They are #7 in the country in three-point attempts at 35 a game. Throw this whole write up in the trash if they catch fire from 3, there isn&#x27;t a team in the country that wouldn&#x27;t get blown out if that is the case. So, they are shooting from range it must be their specialty, right? Let&#x27;s see where they sit...scrolling down a long ways....there&#x27;s two other Alabama teams, Alabama A&amp;M and South Alabama....oh there&#x27;s the Crimson Tide down at #175 in the country, 33.33%. If they throw up 35 3s an only make 12 of them against Illinois, they are in for a rough evening. Maybe Illinois isn&#x27;t so hot at defending the three...uh oh, Illinois is tops in the Big Ten allowing a measly 25.8%. Illinois likes to shoot the three ball as well and they will be putting their fair share up from range, Alabama ranks #250 at defending the three.

So, we have a team that is below average at rebounding against one the best rebounding teams in the country, a team that is going to shoot a ton of threes, hasn&#x27;t really been making a bunch of them, against a great three-point defensive team. These seem like two huge problems for Alabama. Add on top of this that Illinois is an elite scoring team so far at 97.8ppg and I see them covering the -3.5 spread fairly easily. Again, this all goes out the window if Alabama shoots the lights out of the United Center, but they haven&#x27;t proven the ability to do that yet this year with their best outing being 37% in their loss to Purdue.

Illinois #6 in KenPom

Alabama #20 in KenPom

Illinois 3-1 ATS (3-1 at home) with a margin of +8.1 ppg.

Alabama 1-2 ATS (1-0 on the road) with a margin of -8.3 ppg.

Either way this is must watch TV and should be one of the most entertaining games of the season. Go Illini! (Threw up in my mouth a little bit as an Iowa fan...)</td></tr>

Next <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **Toronto Raptors +2.5 vs Philadelphia 76ers @ 1.91**. 4U play.

I’m higher on the Raptors than most people and will be happy to bet on them against the 6ers who will be missing Embiid and PG13, as well as Oubre and Bona. For Philly, once again it will be the Maxey show with VJ as an inconsistent secondary. This Raptors team has its best team available, and they continue to play well together, with all starters contributing each game. They are 7-2 ATS ad 8-1 SU in the L9 games. The 6ers have lost 4 ATS in a row. Add in that the Raptors have much better depth and rotations, and I’ll happily bet on the underdog.

Event: NBA | Hornets @ Pacers


<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:  Miles Bridges Over 21.5P @1.79 3u to win 2.3u


Write Up:  
 


Bridges has pretty much been the Hornets’ go-to guy whenever they need someone to actually get a bucket. With all the injuries and the up-and-down play from the rest of the roster, he usually ends up with a solid chunk of the offense, and that usage jumps even more when Tre Mann or Brandon Miller aren’t fully out there. He’s the one they trust late in the shot clock or when they need someone to create something on their own.


The matchup helps a ton too. Indiana’s defense just isn’t the same without Hali and the other guys they’re missing. They don’t really have that big, physical wing who can stay in front of Bridges, so forwards like him usually get good looks specially in the mid-range .


And the nice part is Bridges isn’t one-dimensional. He gets points in transition, he can pull up in the mid-range, and he’ll hit spot-ups or pops from 3s. Because he scores in so many different ways, he doesn’t need a perfect shooting night to get past 21.5.


In games like this, he usually ends up taking around 15–20 FGs, and if that happens again, he’s basically sitting right in the 22+ range without needing anything crazy. It’s just a good spot for him.

__Event:__ NCAAB: Alabama vs Illinois 9pm EST

__POTD:__ Illinois -3.5 (-110), 2.2u to win 2u

__Write Up:__ First basketball writeup of the year for one of the biggest games of the early season. Was much easier watching film on these teams opposed to football as they both have only played 7 games combined. This game is taking place in Chicago, Illinois at the United Center, home of the Chicago Bulls &amp; Blackhawks. This is technically a “neutral site” game but it takes place just 2 hours north of the University of Illinois, the arena will be packed with Illinois fans. #8 Illinois is coming into the game undefeated at 4-0, with a huge 81-77 win vs #11 Texas Tech (rank last week) who have an elite team that KenPom has ranked #15 in the nation. They’ll be facing #11 Alabama who are 2-1, with a with one of the toughest non conference schedules in the nation. They scheduled 4 games against teams in the top 15 in a row: #14 St Johns, #1 Purdue, #8 Illinois, &amp; #13 Gonzaga. Then in a few weeks they play #4 Arizona. They beat #14 St Johns on the road 10 days ago 103-96, but lost their last game at home vs #1 Purdue 87-80. There was one huge reason they lost this game &amp; Bama’s coach roasted them for it.

In the postgame interview after last week’s loss to Purdue, Alabama head coach Nate Oats said “They out rebounded us by 24, that’s embarrassing… We&#x27;ve got issues on the glass. We knew it in our exhibition games. We knew it in our intrasquad scrimmages. We knew it up at St. John&#x27;s.” He also added, “They’re 5’10 PG had 7 rebounds &amp; our starting frontcourt had 6 combined.” Alabama has a horrible rebounding problem &amp; it will not get easier this week vs a large athletic Illinois team. Illinois head coach Brad Underwood preaches crashing the boards to his team as evident in year’s past. __In 2023 Illinois ranked 5th in rebounds in the NCAA (40.9). Last year Illinois ranked #1 in the nation in rebounds (42.6). This season through 4 games, Illinois is currently ranked 3rd in the nation in rebounds with 48.8 boards.__ Bama was 2nd in rebounds last year, with a great rebounding frontcourt trio of Grant Nelson, Clifford Omoruyi, &amp; Mouhamed Dioubate who combined for an average of 20 of Bama’s 43 rebounds per game last season. All 3 of which are not on the team this year. Bama has a skinny, fast frontcourt this season. Coach Oats elected to go with this squad because of his offensive style. His strategy is to push the ball up the court quick in a fast paced, analytical offense that bombs 3’s &amp; gets in the paint, eliminating mid range jumpers. Every player in their rotation can shoot the ball from deep. They have led the country in scoring each of the past two years, 2 of the only 3 teams in NCAA history to avg 90+ ppg. Last week vs Purdue they put up 43 threes, 15 shots in the paint, &amp; shot just 8 mid range jumpers.

Annoying one last time out with Romania winning 7-1 but Austria being held to a 1–1 draw in a game they dominated. Can’t win them all.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Todays pick</mark> is the definitely rogue to what people expect on this thread lol. Women’s cricket isn’t exactly top of the agenda for most people including me. 

First and foremost from the outside looking in this seems a weird <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> as Sydney thunder a 0-3 facing the Scorchers who are 2-2. However, The thunder are punching way below their weight and should find their form and get rolling at home - a ground which favours the bowling attack, of which they have the better!

**Last POTD:** MNF **Panthers at 49ers - Each team to score 1+ TD in each half (+125) 2u to win 2.5u - loss**

Panthers had multiple first half opps in redzone following three purdy interceptions but couldnt punch it in. our first loss :(

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** NFL Bengals at Ravens 8pm EST **Each team to score 1+ TD in each half (+100) 3 Units**

**Write-up:** Thanksgiving Football is Back! And so is Joe Burrow (from injury) and Ja&#x27;marr Chase (from spitting on Ramsey&#x27;s face). And so are we - going back to the same bet that is - since I love this one. Divisional rivalries tend to be a lower scoring than other games as teams know each other much better. The Bengals-Ravens rivalry is not one of those. Since 2021 they have played each other 8 times - with these scores:

https://preview.redd.it/ftstthltlp3g1.jpeg?width=150&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1e2ad813565d67fdde1f1686751d872ca8f6714

6/8 have gone over 50pts, and only twice has the losing team scored less than 20. More importantly for our purposes, 7/8 (87.5%) have hit our bet. More recently - in their last 5 games the Bengals have scored 30+ points in 3/5 while giving up 30+ in 4/5. The Ravens, over their 5 game win streak have avg 27pts/game. Their defense has improved to be sure - limiting scoring but they are still giving up a ton of yards and have faced pretty lackluster offenses in that span (jets, dolphins, vikings, browns, and bears before they got good). Bengals give up 3rd most passing yards, Ravens 10th most. Neither side has a potent pass rush (CIN 31st, BAL 23rd worst in PRWR). Both sides will drive the ball down the field. Honestly I cant see Zac Taylor settling for field goals knowing his D - especially if the Ravens go up early. O and did i mention Burrow is back?

~~The Penguins are currently up 1-0 at the time of typing this! We need them to hold on to this lead for one more period.~~

This game wasn&#x27;t as &#x27;no sweat&#x27; as I would&#x27;ve like, but they got the job done at home! Bryan Rust even made his presence felt tallying a goal, like I mentioned yesterday. Let&#x27;s keep this streak going!

Event:  **NFL - Green Bay Packers @ Detroit Lions, 1PM ET**

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:  **Christian Watson Longest Reception o25.5 yards (-120) 1.2U**

Write-Up:

Watson has been back for 4 games now, clearing this line in **2 of the 4**. Even in 1 of the games he didn&#x27;t reach this mark, **he did have a 25 yard catch**. Now he gets a great match up against the Detroit Lions in prime time on Thanksgiving.

The Lions are running man coverage at the **2nd highest rate in the league**. This just happens to be where Christian Watson excels. **He leads the team in targets per route run and yards per route run against Man coverage**. When this Lions team isn&#x27;t playing man, they are playing **middle-field-closed zone** primarily. This will leave the outside more open, which is exactly where Watson thrives. This outside of the field, big play potential was noticed last week as well. When the Lions faced off against the Giants, they **allowed 5 players to tally a reception of over 30 yards**, including Jameis Winston himself.

Lastly, the Lions are favored in this match up, and if this holds like I&#x27;m expecting it to, there should be a positive game script for Watson to clear this line tomorrow. **Remember, it only takes one play!**

*As always, BOL!*</td></tr>

This is Mahomes first appearance on thanksgiving, as well as another must win game like last week where he threw for 350 against the Colts. He’s gonna cut this Dallas defense wide open. The Cowboys do not have a good defense and I expect Mahomes to have a good day at the office. He has missed this line only twice this season, He is a generational player and shows up when you need him too, need I say more?</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>**POTD Record:** 8-5 (Avg Odds +123)

**Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Virgil van Dijk 1+ SOT (+255) ❌️

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s Event:** UEFA Europa League | Aston Villa vs Young Boys (9:45 AM PST)

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:**  Donyell Malen 2+ SOT (+120) 1 unit to win 1.2 units

**Write Up:** One word sums up our last pick: pain. I still stand by the read, everything went as expected, but we were majorly unlucky with the end result. 5 shots for van Dijk, all blocked or missed. That was tied for the most shots he&#x27;s ever taken for Liverpool, in the other match he had 2 on target. We move on.

Back south we head to Birmingham <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> as Aston Villa host Young Boys who, in case you didnt know, are currently 3rd place in Swiss Super League. Villa is a heavy favorite here as EPL sides tend to dominate this competition, and the home crowd has something to do with it as well. 

Donyell Malen tends to split time up top with Ollie Watkins. He has shifted to become the top <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> for Europa matches, partly due to his positive form, partly due to Ollie&#x27;s suboptimal form, and partly due to an injury Ollie picked up a few weeks back. **It is not 100% guaranteed that our guy Malen starts**, but it appears Watkins is still struggling with fitness and I believe coach will want to rotate the squad a bit here with the heavy schedule over the next few weeks. All that said, he is very likely to start and likely to play the entire match. Coming off a 6 shot, 4 SOT performance in the last Europa match and an impressive stint with Netherlands, I really like Malen to play well here <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. 

We have an admittedly small sample pool of data to pull from for Malen, which is partly why we&#x27;re getting such nice odds here. He has only started 3 EPL games this season and two Europa matches. I am banking on form and his trending upwards in all competitions. If he starts, he should smash this line. 

Young Boys on the other side give up a lot of shots (and goals). In their 4 Europa matches, the opposing team has taken the following shots oldest to most current: 18(6 SOT)-17(3)-15(4)-23(10). And none of these teams have the quality of Villa. 

If you want to be safe **wait for the starting lineups to confirm Malen starts**. The odds may go down once he is confirmed a starter, but there&#x27;s less risk. Either way, BOL and have a great Thanksgiving!</td></tr>

Writeup: Had a 1-0 start to the game by halftime but we had a surge of goals in the second half to finish 4-2!

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: 🏈 Chiefs vs Cowboys under 52.5 (-110).

Game starts at 4:30pm EST. Bet 2.5u

Writeup: Happy Thanksgiving to all my fellow Americans out there, and to anyone else who has things to be thankful for. For this batch of Thanksgiving games, we are going to go with the under in the Chiefs vs Cowboys game. Market support is currently on the under, with many sites dropping to 51.5 and may drop again before gametime. 

On paper, this total makes sense - both offenses are incredibly explosive with defenses that can get scored on quite easily. However, I think both defenses are being slightly undervalued in this one. With the addition of Quinnen Williams for the Cowboys, their run defense has stepped up in a big way. Their pass defense is still a little suspect, but they are now able to give their defenses some more help in the backfield while the front 7 do a better job of stopping the run. The Chiefs defense have also looked better in recent weeks along with the Chiefs offense finally looking more cohesive and spending more time out on the field.

We also have 2 potential injury concerns to 2 star players, those players being Rashee Rice and George Pickens. Rice has already been cleared to play and I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;ll be playing close to 100%, but there is always a chance of reinjury or limited snaps. This point is a much larger focus on the latter player. Last week, in the final moments of the Cowboys game, WR George Pickens suffered some sort of a knee injury, but there is very little clarity on what is going on with said injury. He has also been cleared to play after a full walkthrough, but again, this lack of clarity only supports the argument of the under. With both teams playing on a short week, I would not be surprised if both of these players see slightly less reps.

There is also the possibility that the Chiefs wipe the floor with the Cowboys, in which they can continuously run out the clock and not have to score towards the end of the game.

I think this game will be a bit of a defensive duel for teams with weaker defenses starting to emerge. I still expect a solid amount of scoring, but will not get over 52.5 points. I am guessing the final total will end up around 45 points.

Sport: Europa League - Real Betis vs. FC Utrecht @ 3:00pm EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Real Betis W + Over 2 total goals = -105 (5 units)

Write Up: Real Betis form has slightly dipped as of late with low scoring draws to Valencia and Girona. However, they’re still 5th in La Liga, a league I consider more competitive and tougher than Eredivisie. FC Utrecht is currently 5th as well in Eredivisie. I think this bet is slightly higher risk due to a recent lack of scoring by both clubs but FC Utrecht will be desperate based on their Europa standing which will lead to more risky plays and opportunities for Real Betis. I believe Antony and co have the quality to win this game quite handedly, and they also have the international experience from last year.

Crvena Zvezda are not a team that usually keeps clean sheets, despite being pretty good in attack. In the league phase so far, they hit btts in 2/4 games, lost 0-2 to Braga away, and beat Lille 1-0 at home, plenty chances for Lille and a btts should have hit there. FCSB are exactly the same with 2 btts hits, a 0-2 loss and a 1-0 win, again in a game where a BTTS should have hit. In qualifiers leading up to this tournament, Zvezda hit a btts in 5/6 games, FCSB in 6/8. In away games especially, FCSB hit btts very often with 7/9 league games hitting for them, Zvezda at home hitting in 5/7 league games.</td></tr>

Event: Bengals @ Ravens 6:20MST

Write Up: Quick write up here with nothing much to say here that doesn&#x27;t go without already being said. Joe Burrow is making his comeback from his toe injury this Thanksgiving weekend and Ja&#x27;Marr is making his comeback from his 1 week suspension. These two returns combined with the Ravens poor pass defense has all the makings of a fun and entertaining Bengals offensive classic. 

The Bengals and Ravens have yet to see each other this year but last season Chase BURNED the Ravens in both matchups. Game 1 he finished with 10 receptions and 193 yards, in game 2 he went ballistic @Baltimore with 11 receptions and 264 yards.

Even though 91.5 yards on an over doesn&#x27;t always feel desirable, but I believe this is more than achievable against this current Ravens defense and what is on the line for this division.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s match: Alabama vs Maryland (CBB)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Alabama -12.5 (-114, Fanduel)

Alabama (4-2) will take on Maryland (5-2) in a consolation game for the Players Era Tournament. Alabama&#x27;s record may be deceiving because they have played the toughest schedule so far with a recent brutal stretch of having to play Purdue, Illinois, Gonzaga, and St. Johns which are all teams in the top 25. They managed to get out of these games with a 2-2 record losing only to Purdue and Gonzaga who are ranked 1 and 2 on kenpom and they played fairly well in these games managing to play it close for the majority of the games.

Due to the tournament style we have seen how both these two teams faired vs similar opponents recently and Alabama just looks like the way better team beating UNLV by 39 who Maryland struggled against for most of the game and playing Gonzaga close who just so happened to also beat Maryland by 39. Alabama is one of the top offenses in the country and they take the 3rd most threes in college basketball with 34 a game and Maryland ranks 267th out of 365 for opponents 3 point percentage letting opposing teams shoot nearly 36% from 3 against them. Trusting the better team <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> who have been tested against top competition to cover the spread. BOL and bet responsibly.

Great to be back with a win, would have been so underwhelming to come back to anything less


This actually drifted out to just over double money odds by kick off I couldn&#x27;t understand why.

A bizarre game with Tottenham going ahead twice, and actually scoring 3 goals from only 7 shots, both sides very clinical but PSG were the dominant team and good value for the win 5-3 in the end a bit sweaty at times but all my picks usually are 😅

Uefa Europa League 

Feyenoord Vs Celtic 

Feyenoord win and over 1.5 goals 

(1.90) 2.5 units

Celtic are a club in a very bad state at the moment, they&#x27;ve had a poor season for their standards performing very poorly, there are a number of factors for this but for me it&#x27;s mostly been the board and owners.

They have let some key players leave and have brought in some underwhelming players mostly on free transfers. Not helped also by arguably their best attacker Jota being injured also

Yes you may look and see they&#x27;ve won their last 2 games and Feyenoord have lost their last 3, for me you can&#x27;t just go off recent wins and loses, and performances and stats are much more important in the long term.


At home Celtic have an incredible atmosphere and the fans have carried them but away from home they have played some terrible performances, very lucky to recently beat minnows St Mirren 1-0 . St Mirren managed to accumulate 1.6 XG to Celtics 0.8xg

They got destroyed 3-1 away to Danish side Midtjylland lost also 3-1 to Hearts and lost embarrassingly 2-0 away to Dundee **just 1 win in their last 4 away games**

Feyenoord played in the champions League last season, they are having a blip in short term form themselves, losing their last 3 but still performing well in attack, no shame in losing to top German side Stuttgart, but should be doing better defensively.

**They still boost a strong home record of 7 wins from 10 home matches this season**

Feyenoord have much stronger pedigree in Europe in recent history, they have a much stronger squad on paper particularly in attack, with no significant injuries unlike Celtic I just can&#x27;t pass up on this play. Feyenoord should have far too much fire power for Celtic to handle.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>⭐️:🏈Chiefs -3 (-115) \[Bet365\]

Start Time &amp; TV: 4:30pm EST (CBS)

Units: 2.5 Units

Reasoning: Going with the Kansas City Chiefs over the Dallas Cowboys for some turkey day football. Both of these teams are coming off of game winning field goals and the two of these teams are fighting to keep their playoff hopes alive in this one. The main reason I like the Cheifs in this one is because of how bad the Cowboys defense is this year, especially in pass coverage and they are facing a Chiefs offense that is very pass heavy. The Cowboys defense is one of the worst in the NFL this year with over 270 passing yards allowed per game which is second to last in the league and also second to last in scoring defense allowing over 28 points per game to opponents. I think Rashee Rice, Xavier Worthy and Travis Kelce cook this Cowboys secondary and I wouldnt even be suprised to see Marquise Brown to make an impact in this one. The Chiefs run game has been stale recently but I am expecting that to change in this one as they are getting Isiah Pacheco back so I think this will greatly help the Chiefs offense out. The Chiefs have also been playing solid defense this year, they having been allowing less than 100 rushing yards per game as well as having a top 7 pass defense in the league. They are also doing a good job of keeping teams out of the endzone as they rank 4th in the NFL in points allowed per game with only an average of 18 points let up per game. With a pass offense that I think will exploit this Cowboys secondary and a solid defense, I think the Chiefs take this one by more than a field goal.

Prediction: 27-21 Chiefs

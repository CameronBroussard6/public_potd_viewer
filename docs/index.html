Formula One | Sao Paulo GP Sprint Race | 9AM ET

Lando Norris to win Sprint Race (-163) 1.5u

**Write Up:** McLaren has been the fastest throughout FP1 and SQ, and Norris has been on a tear lately. It most likely will rain later <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, and the conditions are a bit questionable, but as long as Lando can keep it on the road, I am confident with this one. The spray from the cars will also make it harder to overtake from behind, as Lando will have a clear view of the track in front of him. Also with the weather, for the sprint, at least half of the 24 lap race must be completed, with at least two laps not being behind the Safety Car to award points. If this criteria isn&#x27;t met, this bet will be a push.

Event: Soccer/Football, [German Bundesliga] Union Berlin vs Bayern Munich


<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Asian total cards over 3.5 @ 1.90 - 1.5 Units.
This <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> is the same as just total cards over 3.5


Although Bayern are probably the best in Europe and free scoring, they average around 2.30 cards just for themselves per game and a 3.80 total, in away games those numbers increase. Union Berlin have averaged 2.70 for themselves and a 4.90 total, with the number increasing at home. Both sides have covered this line in majority of their games this season. The ref for this game gives out big amounts - This season he has given 11, 8, 2, 3, 6, 5, 6, 8, 5, 11, 0. He has also reffed a Bayern game already this season vs Augsburg where there were 6 total cards.</td></tr>

Union Berlin vs Bayern Munich

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> : Bayern Over 2.5 Goals @1.8 for 5u

Bayern have been scoring goals for fun this entire season and have an incredible record of hitting over 2.5 goals in almost every match they play. Bayern have scored 56 goals in just 16 games this season, which averages out to 3.5 goals per game, and they have hit over 2.5 goals in last 10 matches. Harry Kane is on fire with 22 goals so far this season, and he is supported by Luis Díaz with 10 goals and Michael Olise with 7 goals, meaning Bayern have multiple players who score regularly. Even though Union Berlin has been playing good at home this season, it would be difficult for them to stop Bayern especially since how they have been playing this season. Bayern won 16 games in a row and this is first time a team had a start like this in Top 5 leagues. This is the last game before the coming international break and Bayern would be looking to enter the break with 17/17 record.

<tr><td class='post'>Record: 46-34. 

Last Pick: Crystal Palace vs AZ. Under 3.5 goals.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: Martin Schindler ML vs Luke Woodhouse

Sport: Darts, Grand Slam

Reasoning: Schindler’s season average sits around 94.3 alongside a recent checkout rate of 57 %.  ￼ Woodhouse’s finishing has been weaker (checkout 35 %) and his average hovers slightly lower, making Schindler the more consistent option in a short-race format.

Last Five Predictions (Old - New): ❌❌❌✅ ✅

Net Units: +20.61

Yesterday&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: HIK to win vs FC Helsingor. 3u @ $1.91 ✅

Nice win to get us started. Ended 3-2, there was a few shaky moments, but happy with that. 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:  South Shields HT/FT v Kings Lynn 4u @ $2.30

South Shields are the best team in the league, with and 11-2-1 record. Kings Lynn sit 15th with a 4-6-6 record. 

South Shields are one of the best performing defensive units in the country, conceding only 8 goals in 14 games... And 2 of those were last week away to the second place side. 

In their 14 league games this season, South have won the first half 9 times, been drawing three times, and down twice. That record at home is even better.... Being in front 6 out of their 7 home games. They&#x27;ve only conceded two first half goals at home this season, scoring seven of their own. 

To their credit, Kings Lynn have also been good in first halves this season - however South Shields are proving to be a class above this season and this bet is to echo that instead.</td></tr>

Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>: geno smith under 11.5 rush yards ✅
<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s pick</mark>: Hyder Amil ML -140
Event: UFC Vegas 111

I have a couple big bets I love on this card and multiple smaller bets, but I think my favorite is Hyder Amil to beat Jamall Emmers. 

All things equal I think Hyder is the better fighter, but Jamall is also older and has suffered much more damage over his career so I expect it to be even more one sided. The line is what it is because Amil was brutally KOed in 30s his last fight, but there are not many Delgados out there capable of doing that to Amil and I don’t think Emmers is one of them.</td></tr>

POTD RECORD 24-6

Last pick: Man City -1.5 v Dortmund @ 2.06 (2.5U)✅

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s Fixture: England v Fiji (Rugby Union 17:40pm UK / 12:40pm EST)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: England -23.5 @ 2.01 (2U)

Write up: 

Going against the grain with this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. If you read any analysis of the game most people expect England to win but by a small margin. 

I disagree. England have won 8 in a row , beat Australia extremely comfortably at home last week and are playing a side in Fiji who have endless attacking flair but will concede points for fun. 

Really liking the England lineup and think we are in for an exciting game. 

Prediction: England 48-12 Fiji

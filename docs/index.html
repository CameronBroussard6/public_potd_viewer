*Last POTD: Alabama ML + Capitals/Devils U8.5 X*

***<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Kareem Hunt 40+ Rushing Yards***

*Write up: Hunt will see a majority of the touches <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Denver has a very big pass rush which will force KC to run the ball to help with the pass rush. In order for the Chiefs to win this game on the road, they will have to pass, so I expect them to establish a run game to open up with game for Mahomes.* 

* *Chiefs need a win <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>; Hunt is averaging about 4.0 YPC*
* *Against the Bills, which was a close game for a majority of the game, he touched the ball 11 times for 49 yards - I believe the game script will be the same here, will be a close game throughout, and I think he gets 10-15 touches this afternoon*
* *He is the clear number 1 back in early-downs*
* *Broncos are top 10 in quarterback sacks, that being said, run the ball to stop the pass rush, more carries for Hunt*
* *Denver games have gone under in almost 70% of their games this season, low scoring games, more sustained drives for both teams* 
* *Opponents RB&#x27;s when facing off against the Broncos are averaging 15 rushing attempts per game* 

*Let&#x27;s try and get back on track after the Alabama L yesterday. Enjoy the Sunday, eat some good finger foods, have a beer, and enjoy some football. GL everyone. Profit this week no matter win or lose on the Hunt play!*

NFL




Bengals vs Steelers 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> Under 48.5 

Bet 2 units

Based on the report, the Under 48.5 in the Bengals vs. Steelers game is a Tier-1 selection due to a severe mismatch between the market line and the game&#x27;s powerful variables.1

There are three primary factors driving this conclusion:

Key Personnel: The Bengals are without their starting quarterback, Joe Burrow, which is a major downgrade for their offense.4

Severe Weather: The forecast in Pittsburgh calls for 15 mph sustained winds with gusts up to 30 mph.1 These 30 mph gusts are a &quot;major limiting factor&quot; that severely degrades passing offenses and makes the kicking game highly unreliable.

Offensive Inefficiency: The Steelers&#x27; offense is already one of the league&#x27;s worst, ranking 4th-worst in the NFL with just 280.7 yards per game.2

The report&#x27;s model concludes that the combination of a backup quarterback (Cincinnati) facing a bottom-5 offense (Pittsburgh) in the middle of a 30 mph wind storm makes a 48.5-point total &quot;mathematically indefensible&quot;.2 The expected game script is run-heavy, slow-paced, and filled with punts, pointing to a low-scoring game.</td></tr>

**Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Nico Collins o64.5 receiving yards ✅️

**Game:** NFL: Chargers @ Jaguars, 12pm CDT

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Jakobi Meyers o7.5 1Q receiving yards (-114 on FD) ✅️ 

**Rationale:**

Not really much of a write-up on this one.

The Jaguars will be without BTJ, Brenton Strange, and Hunter Long this week, and Parker Washington left the game last week with a hamstring injury that prevented him from practicing in full this week.

Jakobi Meyers, after only a few days of practice and time with the play book, made an immediate impact last week, catching 3 passes for 41 yards. He would have had 4 receptions for 45 yards and a TD if not for a procedural penalty. When you consider that the Jaguars essentially did not throw the ball at all in the second half, these numbers look even better. With a full week of practice and more time to gel with Lawrence, I believe that Jakobi&#x27;s role is going to grow significantly.

I also believe that the Jaguars, after the humiliation ritual that was last week&#x27;s loss, will come out throwing. Liam Coen said this week that he told TLaw to &quot;just let it rip&quot;.

Given the routes that Jakobi has been running, the 7.5 line is essentially a single reception. I think he gets it early <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.</td></tr>

Reasoning: <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>, I’m going with a couple of WR’s, arguably the best two WR’s in the game. Ja’Marr Chase is facing the 4th worst defense vs WR’s (Pittsburgh Steelers). Chase has cleared this line in 67% of his games this season and 100% H2H vs the Pittsburgh Steelers. For the other leg, Justin Jefferson is almost guaranteed to hit this line. JJetta has cleared this line in 89% of his games this season and is facing the 2nd worst defense vs WR’s (Chicago Bears). Nice win yesterday on a couple of unders making it 6 straight wins now. Lucky number 7 up next! 😤

Why: Green Bay is walking into a matchup where the opponent is battered all over the roster and switching coaches mid-week, and that usually kills any momentum an already struggling team might have. Even with Green Bay’s recent issues on offense, they’re still the more complete group and should control the game just by avoiding mistakes. Baltimore feels even safer — they’ve finally settled back into their identity, and the opponent just hasn’t shown they can keep up for four quarters, especially with an offense that stalls whenever it faces a real defense. Add in the weather likely forcing a slow, grind-heavy game, and it plays directly into Baltimore’s strengths.</td></tr>

Orlando, for example, has a limit set at 13.5, and they are 29th team with 10.9 threes scored per game.

**Write Up:** Power was out until early this Am so this will be a late post and short write up.

The Bengals have the worst run defense in the league and will be away this time against the Steelers. I see them taking advantage of the weak line and letting Warren get 13-16 touches. 

The Bills have to win this after another embarrassing loss to a bottom team in the NFL. They will be at home and although Shakir has not been putting up crazy yardage he is averaging over 7 targets a game and is averaging 5 catches per game. I see him hitting 6 for 55 <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> easily in a must win game against the Buccaneers who also just came off a divisional loss.

Bet 3U

Another NFL <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> here and I always feel more confident with going with under on passing yds compared to overs I just don&#x27;t know why but nonetheless great spot here as the main factor will be the winds as it is forecasted to have around 30mph in the arena which means a rush fest for jackson and henry.

Lamar did go over this line the last time they faced with 223 pass yds but after that domination and him only barely going over the line, yeh I&#x27;m confident Lamar won&#x27;t hit this. Even if the winds don&#x27;t arrive, ravens should take a very cautious approach as they can&#x27;t afford to drop a game (even if its the cleveland &quot;WE&#x27;RE THE CLEVELAND BROWNS&quot; browns)

In all honesty I haven&#x27;t really found a confident enough nba <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> to share <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> and I didn&#x27;t have time to post yesterday so I decided to crack into NFL once again

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: NBA Spurs v Kings 

1U Wembanyama O5.5 1Q P @ $1.90, B365 

Write-Up: Taking this even though Wemby can be a streaky on his FG’s just because I love his match-up v Sabonis. If anything I probably preferred Castle assists again initially - but it ended up as much a Sabonis fade as it is a Wemby <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. 

He has only hit this line 4 times this year but is averaging around 8 minutes in 1st quarters. Averaging 3.7 field goal attempts. The usage is there - he just needs to get to the paint early and not just take 3’s. 

Had 34 in both games v Sabonis last year, with 8 &amp; 5 in 1st quarters, but I prefer the 1Q line as I think the Kings are a blow-out risk -  the Spurs are a bit inconsistent within games but the Kings likely won’t have a Curry type performance to keep them in it (and ultimately win) unless LaVine has one of his random 40 piece games. 

In terms of the Kings - 2nd worse for 2 points FG defence % at 61%. Wemby takes 13.6 2 pt FG’s a game this season, @ 55.9%, so thinking he can push this number higher tomorrow against a weak defensive side. Equal 4th worst for points conceded in the paint per game (55.2). 4th highest opponent points conceded in 1st quarters (averaging 32.5). Sabonis averages 4.2 fouls a game, had 5 in both match-ups last year v Wemby; so a good chance of FT’s. Combined I think Wemby darts to the rim early and should get an easy baskets with a solid chance of an and-1 or just free throws.</td></tr>

Another routine winner yesterday. Ireland led from the first whistle pretty much and pulled away towards the back end winning by 20+ and scoring their most points against Australia in history.


<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s pick</mark> looks good value to me. Argentina are a strong side and can definitely run Scotland close, but I didn’t think they would have the line set at 3.5 points. 

Scotland are arguably the up and coming force in European rugby and if not for an awful start against NZ last week would have won.

I believe they get the job done at home and probably win the game by around 10 points.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Unia Skierniewice to win at home against KKS Kalisz + Under 3,5 goals: 3u 2.45 odds

Write-Up: First time posting, my bookmaker had the ML a couple of hours ago at 1.67 but now I already see it’s been dropping. It’s essentially the leaders of the III polish division against the 16th team that is struggling. Unia has been winning a lot over the last few weeks building up momentum up to this game which they should win. They also have been dominant at home and have pulled off many 1/1’s meaning when they take the lead early they are likely to keep it till the end. KKS Kalisz are struggling with taking points but they are putting up a fight in most games, thats evident from the many unders in their last games. They have a great defence (22 goals conceded in 16 games) which is by far the best in the lower half of the league and joint 5th best out of all 18 teams.  In comparison, 1st place Unia have conceded 18 in total. Therefore I dont think the game will be a disaster for Kalisz, by any means I think Unia will pull through but I find the value of Under 3,5 goals to be convincing. Im not willing to add Unia to win both halfs but I suggest you look into it if you want (the odds then reach 3.95). If I had to make a correct score guess I would be 2-0.

**Current <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: De’Von Achane o81.5 rushing yards -112 (FanDuel)** 

**Wager:** 3u to win 2.68u

**NFL Football - Washington Commanders @ Miami Dolphins - Time:** 9:31am EST

**Write-Up:** Long hiatus - but I am coming **back with a vengeance**. So here we have another nice international game to wake up hungover to, this time the teams take the gridiron in MADRID, Spain at a wonderful 9:31am start time (EST). 🇪🇸 

And let me tell you something - it might be early in the morning, but this guy Achane will wake up to play. This year **he averages 78 rush yards/game** and is an absolute baller for the Dolphins. 

Why will Achane go over this total you ask? Well I’m quite glad you did. Let’s look at the Commanders last 5 games against running backs: 

* **Week 10 vs. Lions**: Gibbs 15 car 142 yds, Montgomery 15 car 75 yds
* **Week 9 vs. Seahawks**: Walker III 11 car 42 yds, Charbonnet 8 car 22 yds 
* **Week 8 vs. Chiefs**: Pacheco 12 car 58 yds, Hunt 9 car 40 yds
* **Week 7 vs. Cowboys**: Williams 19 car 116 yds, Blue 7 car 29 yds
* **Week 6 vs. Bears**: Swift 14 car 108 yds, Monangai 5 car 19 yds

In short, the Commanders defense is bum hole. A real swiss cheese run defense if you will. For you communications majors out there, that’s 651 total rush yards given up to running backs playing against WAS in the last 5 games. Which averages to about 130.2 rush yds/game (just from RBs). Achane has little to no backup RB competition (unless you count ollie gordon II?) - so I think he will clear this line easily.  

We just saw Jonathan Taylor erupt like a goddamn volcano last week on the international stage (which ass fucked my fantasy team, mind you), and I think Achane rips apart a shotty commanders rush defense this week. They Dolphins will likely be playing from ahead too, Mariota is garbäge.

**🏀 Nic Claxton o1.5 Blocks +108** vs the Washington Wizards

Going for a pure numbers play to make it back with a plus money play.

The Wizards are playing at the third fastest pace in the NBA, and incredibly sloppy with it. They rank 29th in the league in getting blocked and 27th in allowing blocks to centers.

Claxton has owned this matchup. He has cashed in L6/6 vs the Wizards, 4/6 of them in 30 minutes or under. He has also cashed this line in 4 of the last 5 games.

Always some variance with low line props but I&#x27;m 100% trusting the numbers here.

🔒 <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Desmond Bane UNDER 18.5 Points + Houston Rockets Moneyline (Parlay) Bet Sizing: 1.5 Units | Odds: +210

🎯 Leg 1: Desmond Bane UNDER 18.5 Points The market is overvaluing Bane&#x27;s scoring role in Orlando, especially without Paolo Banchero. Houston&#x27;s elite defense is the perfect antidote to his inflated usage.

* The Usage Trap: With Banchero out due to a groin injury, Bane&#x27;s role is expanded, but it&#x27;s leading to inefficient scoring. He may be averaging 15.5 PPG this season (with Banchero), but he has historically proven he can scale up (e.g., 24.6 PPG during Morant&#x27;s 2024 suspension).
* Historical Skew: Bane&#x27;s career average of 20.8 PPG versus Houston is misleading, inflated by high-volume outliers from earlier seasons. His more recent matchups against current Houston schemes are closer to the UNDER (e.g., 17 points in the 10/25/24 contest).
* Houston&#x27;s Wall (Rank 4th vs. SG): The Rockets boast the 4th-ranked defense against Shooting Guards, limiting the position to just 16.8 PPG. Orlando&#x27;s road offense is already stagnant (24th-ranked, 112.3 PPG), forcing Bane into his least efficient areas.
* Amen Thompson Factor: Houston&#x27;s DPOY runner-up, Amen Thompson, is an elite perimeter stopper. The shot chart shows Bane&#x27;s mid-range efficiency craters against HOU&#x27;s scheme (a clear -.194 efficiency in the zone). Expect Thompson to limit Bane to a projected 14-15 FGA and an estimated 15.8 points. 🚀 Leg 2: Houston Rockets Moneyline (ML) high-confidence outcome that offers fantastic value as the parlay&#x27;s anchor.
* Elite Home Advantage: The Rockets are dominating at home with a 7-2 ATS record against a tired, injured opponent.
* Magic on Fumes: Orlando is playing a back-to-back road game as an injured squad (Banchero and Moritz Wagner are out). Their team-wide shooting efficiency ranks 18th league-wide, a poor match for Houston&#x27;s top-6 pace-adjusted defense.
* Prediction: Models project a comfortable 115-105 Rockets win (68% win probability). With their interior defense and efficient offense, they handle business easily. 💥 Final Edge: Injury-Driven Inefficiency Bane’s increase in usage is being absorbed inefficiently by the other Magic players. With Banchero and Wagner both out, the Rockets know exactly where the offensive gravity lies—on Bane and Franz Wagner. Houston&#x27;s focused, elite defensive scheme, led by Thompson, will not allow Bane to shoulder the scoring burden against their 4th-ranked SG defense, making the over/under line of 18.5 a severe overestimation of his scoring potential in this specific matchup.

Damnit Kon, picked a hell of a time to break the rebound pattern. I suck at this. Evened out with some other Knicks bets (thanks Josh Hart!) but still hate to lose my first <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> of the year.

So with that in mind, here&#x27;s one more attempt.

CJ has been playing well for his new team so far this year. Though his scoring average (16.3 ppg) isn&#x27;t spectacular, he has shown an ability to go off against certain opponents, scoring 42 points just a few days ago against Detroit. 

His low-scoring games have largely occurred when minutes were limited due to a blow-out, against very strong defensive teams, on road games, and/or when starting at the 1.

Here we have a spot in which the teams are fairly evenly matched, WAS is playing at home, CJ is starting as SG, and their opponent (Brooklyn) is dead last in terms of overall defensive rating. Their defense against the SG position in particular isn&#x27;t quite as terrible, but still ranked 9th worst.

CJ&#x27;s last game was also crappy scoring-wise, so there is potential for a bounce-back. Plus he and the Wiz will be coming off of 3 days rest.</td></tr>

LA Clippers @ BOS Celtics | 3:30PM EST

Next <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **Ivica Zubac Over 10.5 Reb** (-115) Bet 2u to Win 1.74u

Celtics are one of the worst defensive rebounding teams in the NBA this season, ranking 25th and allowing opponents a high volume of rebounds off the glass.

They often deploy smaller, more perimeter oriented lineups which further escalates their rebounding vulnerabilities.

Zubac is currently averaging right at this line (10.5 reb) per game, with a (reb per 36 mins rate) of about 13.2, showing strong consistency.

**Last season when playing 30+ mins, Zubac went over 10.5 rebs in 78% of games, averaging 13.3 rebounds in those outings.**

With a 4.5 pt spread bookies are suggesting a competitive matchup where we can see Zubac log 30+ mins here again, **his rebounding numbers tend to spike when the game remains close.**

Zubac’s consistent rebounding particularly against this Celtics weak defensive rebounding paired with an expected  30+ min outting makes the over 10.5 reb a decent play here.

Took the over in this one, but brought it down to 44.5 to get a number I’m more comfortable with. Both defenses give up big plays, Miami can score in bunches, and Washington should still move the ball enough to help this total out.

**New Event:**  World Cup Qualification – Hungary vs Ireland

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:**  Ireland Over 2.5 cards @ 1.91 (Usual 3 units)

The disparity in odds between books for the cards market on the Irish is wide enough that the offer at 1.91 is too good to pass up. There is hidden value in this bet for several reasons.

This is the final matchday for Group F, where earlier in the week Ireland hosted Portugal in a must win and highly improbable match. A match where Ireland not only came through for us on our bet but also managed to win 2-0 and Ronaldo got ejected. This win marks the single most important victory in Ireland in over a decade. The stadium was simply nuts! I strongly suggest any of you with Irish blood to see the highlights on youtube as it should bring a source of pride.

Ireland now travel to fight in Hungary against a strong side that sits in 2^(nd) place and one point ahead. The loser of this match is eliminated from World Cup passage, while the winner will move to a playoff phase. While Hungary will be happy with a win or draw due to their 1 point advantage, Ireland not only visit as underdogs, but need a win in order to advance to the playoffs.

As evidenced by the previous match with Portugal, miracles do happen and the Irish will need another miracle to pull this off. I am betting that regardless of the outcome there will be plenty of friction leading to many cards.

Some bullet points:

* Ireland have received over 2.5 cards in 4 of their last 5 matches in this group stage. (1,3,3,4,5)
* In the previous H2H with Hungary in Dublin, there were 8 yellows and a red.
* The assigned ref is Espen Eskas who averages 4.8 cards per match in EUFA World Cup Qualification matches.

NCAAB // University of the Incarnate Word Cardinals @ Indiana Hoosiers

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Indiana -26.5 (+100 ESPNBET) 1u**

  
We head to Bloomington where the Hoosiers host one of the best named universities in DI. This is a tune up game for Indiana and the spread reflects that. Incarnate Word is 2-1 but their 2 wins were against DII opponents. In their one real game against Colorado State, they got blown out by 34 points. While Colorado State is actually a pretty good team, Indiana is significantly better. 

Indiana has been bulldozing teams so far this season, they are 3-0 with an average margin of victory of 34 points. Are we really expecting this trend to not continue against Incarnate Word who has already shown their ability to get blown out? Indiana has the 11th ranked offense according to KenPom against the 290th ranked defense of Incarnate Word. I don&#x27;t see any universe where Indiana doesn&#x27;t score at least 90 points. That means they need to hold Incarnate word to 63. Colorado State held them to 64 and their defense is expected to be atrocious. 

Indiana is in year one of new head coach Darian DeVries, his son Tucker DeVries might just be the Big Ten POTY, and they are on a mission early to invigorate an Indiana fan base that is ready to get back to their blue blood form on the hard wood. You can only take so much from the numbers and data this early in the season, but I see this playing out somewhere around 95-60 with Indiana in complete control the entire game.

For Sunday Night Football, we have the Super Bowl Champion Philadelphia Eagles hosting the Detroit Lions. Since week 7, Devonta Smith has taken over as the WR1 for the Eagles offense with a 40.9% target share. This is second in the NFL only behind Jaxon Smith-Njigba, a top 3 WR in the league. Over the past 3 games, Smith has gone for 69, 84, and 183 receiving yards, along with 7, 9, and 11 targets, respectively. At yet, even with all of this, his receiving prop is still below A.J. Brown&#x27;s. With a total of 46.5 point in this game, and the Lions being a pass-funnel defense, this line honestly blows me away. DeVonta Smith should easily hit this line in a back-and-forth game in prime time against a soft Lions secondary.

Oh, and yesterday was his birthday.

__Event:__ NFL: Bengals @ Steelers 1pm EST

__POTD:__ Jaylen Warren o79.5 rushing yards (-115), 3.45u to win 3u 

__Write Up:__ The Cincinnati Bengals (3-6) are traveling to Pittsburgh to take on the (5-4) Steelers in a battle of 2 division rivals. The Bengals are coming off a bye week, having lost 6 of their last 7 games, with their lone win coming in Week 7 vs the Steelers at home. The Steelers lead the division, but they have lost 3 of their last 4 games. They look to turn it around this week as they get to take on the Bengals horrible defense at home. 

This is a big game for this Steelers team as the 4-5 Ravens are right on their tail in the AFC North. The Steelers Offensive Coordinator Arthur Smith used to be the head coach of my Atlanta Falcons for 3 years &amp; I know all about him. He is a dink &amp; dunk kind of guy. He uses the Golden State Warriors offensive style, where he will either pound it inside/pass short or he will dial up deep bomb to DK Metcalf. But this year he’s focused more on the run &amp; pass with QB Aaron Rodgers. Despite his career of launching it deep, Rodgers has been a lot more conservative this year &amp; hasn’t aired it out nearly as much. __Only 44.2% of Rodgers passes have been 5+ yards downfield, the lowest rate in the NFL (avg league rate is 54.9%). 24.5% of his passes have been 10+ yards downfield, ahead of only poopoo Justin Fields (24.2%). When he has attempted passes 10+ yards, he has only completed 40.3% (27/67), 29th in the league.__ With some key games coming up, Arthur Smith should allow Rodgers a game of a little rest as they will be able to run all over the worst run defense in the nation. __The Bengals are allowing opposing RB’s a league high 141 rushing yards per game, 20 yards more than the 31st ranked defense. The Bengals have allowed 100+ rushing yards to opposing RB’s in every game since Week 2 &amp; are allowing 7.9 yards per carry over their past 3 games (most in the league). In those 3 games they gave up 141 yards, 198 yards, &amp; 213 yards.__ What’s crushed them is star DE Trey Hendrickson being out with a pelvis injury. He’s already been ruled out. But their other DE, rookie 1st round <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> Shemar Stewart, will also miss the Steelers game because of a knee injury he sustained in their last game vs the Bears. __The Bears RB’s Kyle Monangui &amp; Brittain Brown (fun fact I grew up with Brittain &amp; his brother), ran for 213 yards against Cincinatti in their last game.__ This is setting up perfectly for Steelers RB Jaylen Warren, who has taken over this Steelers backfield. __Warren has dominated RB snaps over the last 4 games, being in the backfield for 84%, 73%, 80%, &amp; 88% of rush attempts.__ In their game just a month ago vs Cincinnati he destroyed them. __Warren rushed for a season high 127 yards &amp; 7.9 yards per carry. He had a 56.3% success rate rushing that night with 4 runs of 10+ yards yardage, including a 37 yard run. He gained yards on all 16 of his runs.__ And that was in a game where the Steelers were in a shootout, passing game script. Will be different as home favorites this week. But Warren has looked like one of the better RBs in the NFL this year. __Warren is top 10 in success rate &amp; yards after contact per rush, while also ranking top 5 in missed tackles forced per rush.__ This is one of the worst possible RB’s that could match up vs this Bengals defense. __Cincinatti ranks 31st in EPA/Rush, 30th in YPC allowed, &amp; dead last in rushing success rate allowed. Not only do they allow the 2nd highest yards before contact per attempts, they also allow the 4th most yards after contact.__ As for schemes, OC Arthur Smith has always been heavy on outside runs, which suits Warren well. __The Steelers already ranked top 10 in outside &amp; zone runs, but go even heavier with them with Warren as he runs zone rushes at the 2nd highest rate in the NFL. To outside rushes, Cinci is allowing the 2nd highest yards per carry in the NFL (6.48), as well as the 2nd most explosive yards (414) on the season per @FantasyPtsData. On zone rushes, the Bengals have again been among the worst in the NFL, allowing the single highest yards per carry (5.73) &amp; success rate (56.8%), as well as the 4th highest explosive run rate (6.1%).__ 

In a game where the Steelers are -5.5 favorites at home &amp; have the 2nd highest implied team total on the slate (27.5), Warren should have the chance for plenty of volume &amp; scoring opportunities. Warren is going to eat them alive &amp; could easily have another 100 yard game.

Death, taxes, bet on whatever RB is facing the Bengals.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Standard two leg 6.5 point teaser (Ravens -1/Chargers vs jags over 37) (-120) (1.5U)

-everything is bet to win unit amount-

Write up: 


Ravens -1 vs. Browns

The original line had Baltimore laying 7.5 to 8 points on the road. That’s a lot in a divisional matchup, especially with weather concerns. But by teasing it down to -1, we’ve turned this into almost a straight-up win bet. That’s a massive edge because the Ravens have been dominant ATS in Cleveland, going 13-4 ATS in their last 17 trips. Historically, John Harbaugh’s teams thrive in these spots, and sharp bettors are already backing Baltimore even at -8. Professional money saw value at that number, so at nearly <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>’em, we’re sitting on gold. Baltimore’s defense has been suffocating, allowing just 14.5 points per game over their last four contests. 

Meanwhile, Cleveland’s offense is a disaster, ranking dead last in yards per play (4.1) and the Browns managed just 20 points against the Jets’ suspect defense, with rookie Dillon Gabriel averaging a pathetic 3.9 yards per attempt. The Ravens’ red zone defense is top-10, while Cleveland converts just 47% of their red zone trips into touchdowns. That mismatch alone makes it hard to see how the Browns keep pace. With Lamar Jackson healthy, completing over 70% of his passes and sporting a 15:1 TD-to-INT ratio, Baltimore has the firepower to control this game. At -1, it’s hard to imagine them not walking away with the win. Factor in Cleveland’s home field being essentially worthless (they’re 1-11 straight up in their last 12 games versus AFC opponents), and Baltimore’s 8-4 ATS record in their last 12 games against Cleveland and Harbaugh is 11-4 ATS when his team is coming off three straight wins as road favorites. He gets his guys ready to compete in “let down spots”. we’re taking care of business. Plus, if the weather is piss poor which it might be, this supports the more disciplined team with a legit run game against a lackluster offense in which Gabriel has not faced situations like this yet in the league.


Chargers vs. Jaguars Over 37

The second leg of our teaser is just as strong. The original total sat at 44 points, but teasing it down to 37 gives us a huge cushion. The Chargers have been on fire offensively, averaging 28.4 points per game over their last five contests. Justin Herbert is second in the NFL in passing yards, and he’s facing a Jaguars defense that has been one of the worst against the pass, allowing 252.9 passing yards per game (fifth-worst in the league). Backup QBs like Davis Mills and Geno Smith have shredded this secondary, so Herbert should have no problem lighting them up.


Jacksonville’s defense has been consistently poor. They’ve allowed 24.4 points per game (20th in the NFL) and rank near the bottom in yards allowed per play (27th at 5.8). They’ve also struggled to generate pressure, recording just 6 sacks in their last six games. That means Herbert will have time to carve them up, and with LA scoring 89 points in their last three games, the over looks extremely attainable. Even if the Jaguars chip in modestly, the Chargers alone could push this game past 37. And honestly, I expect the jaguars to come out angry after a disappointing loss to the Texans last week. Not to mention LA has traveled the most miles out of any team this year and they may be a little tired defensively having made 4 trips to the east coast! 

This teaser combines Baltimore’s absolute war path toward the playoffs with LA’s offensive explosion against a weak defense, giving us two angles where the teased lines provide significant value: Ravens to pretty much win outright and Chargers/Jags to clear a modest total.</td></tr>

Event: Bears @ Vikings 11:00 AM MST

Write up: This line feels surprisingly low, considering the matchup J.J. will be facing this week against the ball-hawking Chicago defense. Although there haven’t been a lot of shining spots, the Bears&#x27; defense is the league leader in interceptions through 10 weeks of NFL action and has taken the ball away through the air in 6/9 games this season. 

So far in McCarthy’s short time as the starter, he has thrown a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> in all four games. His current interception rate ranks 2nd in the league at 6%, and the Bears have already picked him off in week 1 of this season. Since then, McCarthy’s pass attempts have increased each week from 20, 21, 25, and then an astounding 42 attempts last week against Baltimore. Although I expect the Vikings to make their best effort to impose the run against Chicago, I don’t see it being sustainable through all 4 quarters, and I’m predicting the weekly improving Caleb Williams and Bears offense to keep it tight and competitive. This gives J.J. McCarthy more opportunities to air the ball out and put it in harm&#x27;s way and into the hands of the Bears defenders.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Dawson Knox Over 2.5 Reception @1.70 3.3u to win 2.3u


Write Up:  
 


With Kincaid out, I think Knox could see 3–6 targets. Some of Kincaid’s volume will likely shift to other receivers, but Knox is the natural TE1. Knox has been with the Bills since 2019 ofc he knows the offense inside-out, while he understands Josh Allen reads and can adjust routes mid-snap, which is crucial when stepping into a larger role.




P.S : Only bet what you can afford , its just gambling after all ( It can go wrong sometimes ).</td></tr>

**Writeup:** Dalton Kincaid has officially been ruled out with a hamstring injury, meaning it&#x27;s Knox&#x27;s time to shine.  Kincaid&#x27;s been hogging much of the spotlight in the TE spot, averaging 3.6 receptions on 4.5 targets, meanwhile Knox has been averaging 1.3 receptions on 2 targets, with him gone these numbers should rise. 

Buccaneers with their 24th ranked passing defense have been decent against tight ends this season yet still have holes, having an average of 7 targets with 5.11 receptions split among opposing tight ends. The Bills third string TE Jackson Hawes has been mainly used for blocking, which should let Knox funnel these numbers up for himself. Bucs also play zone over 70% of the time which tight ends can feast on. They&#x27;ve also been pretty weak in the middle of the field, where Knox should be able to take advantage of.

Now the lines are these games are at -5.5, but the Bills have been looking rustier than they should, losing to the Dolphins in brutal fashion. This game will be close, and have plenty of passes. Our boy Knox will shine this game,

Yesterday&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Grimsby Town to score o1.5 vs Chesterfield. 3u @ 2.02❌

Looked pretty good at the half, even though we hadn&#x27;t scored yet. However a straight red card to the keeper early in the second half killed this completely. 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: England to win and no for BTTS vs Albania. 3u @ 2.10

Was considering Naestved in Denmark <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> (I have bets there) but can&#x27;t go beyond England to win and keep a clean sheet here. Last chance to get on them in qualifiers.

England are on track to become the first ever international team to not concede a goal in group phase of more than 4 teams. 

They&#x27;ve been perfect. 7 games, 7 wins, and no goals conceded. 

The English team are one of the deepest in the world. They&#x27;ve got plenty of players who are getting chances throughout qualifying and these guys will want to make the most of their opportunity. 

And it&#x27;s not like these guys suck. Guys like Bowen (randomly picked a player who doesn&#x27;t play often for England) would start for everyone else in the world besides 3 or 4 sides.

Albania are second in the group and can&#x27;t drop to third. However they&#x27;ve only scored 7 in 7 (conceding 3), so going the u2.5 also looks good and is similar value... Only thing I don&#x27;t like about that is I can see an England 3-0 being more likely than a draw or Albania win.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: BTTS @ 2.00


2-2 in the previous match between the two sides with Ireland then coming from 0-2 behind to draw, now they are in a must win situation here. This year, Hungary have managed 2 clean sheets in 9 games, both those games vs Armenia. Ireland do look significantly better in recent games with currently back to back wins vs Portugal and Armenia. Ireland also struggle for clean sheets very much, despite keeping a CS vs Portugal, they allowed more than enough xG for a btts there. Ireland have 2 clean sheets in 9 games this year, with those 2 clean sheets being vs Armenia and Luxembourg. The game should eventually open up as teams chase goals, preferably an early goal should be great.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:**  Bruno Fernandes ATGS (-120) 1.2 units to win 1 unit ✅️

**Write Up:** Back in the win column yesterday. That was a tough one to root for, with Spain running circles around Georgia. Luckily our guy came through with a SOT in the 75th minute and then nearly had a goal in the 90th with a shot that went just wide of the post. 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> we head to Portugal as our hosts, who sit first place in the qualifying group, welcome last place Armenia. A win here secures Portugal their guaranteed spot in the World Cup, whereas a loss or draw requires some help. Portugal will want to win here with conviction in front of their home crowd to avoid the playoff matches. 

Ronaldo will be out for this match after receiving a red card in the last match, so Portugal will need to get creative to find their goals. Bruno will captain the team <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> and will likely be the team&#x27;s penalty taker in Ronaldo&#x27;s absence. I expect Bruno to have a lot of time on the ball and work his way into dangerous positions to take a lot of shots <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. 

Armenia doesn&#x27;t have much to play for in this one. After their 5-0 thrashing at home in the reverse fixture in September and an overall disappointing performance in the qualifiers, all they have left to play for is pride. Therefore, I don&#x27;t expect them to park the bus and sit back. This could wind up being an end to end game and I don&#x27;t expect Armenia to hesitate to send players forward on attacks. I like Bruno (who hates defending) to also try to exploit counterattacks in these situations as well. 

I tend to try to keep my picks closer to plus money, but I really like this one <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> and still think there&#x27;s value here. 

BOL and happy Sunday!</td></tr>

NFL | Seahawks @ Rams 4:05 ET

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Terrance Ferguson over 12.5 longest reception (-110) 1U

Write-Up: Ever since week 5, the Rams have revolutionized their offense as well as creating notice in the analytics community with their high percentage of 2 and 3 TE sets. Since week 5, they’ve had the highest 2 and 3 TE personnel usage in the league and with this has come the emergence of rookie TE Terrance Ferguson. With so many plays using multiple TEs, Fergusons usage has increased. In the last 3 weeks, he’s run 12, 10, and 13 routes with 3, 3, and 4 targets in those games. In all the games before that he had 14 routes run and 1 target combined. 

This means that he has seen a nice increase in usage and this is accompanied by Coach McVay’s positive coach speak about him. He recently said “how dumb am I to not figure out ways to get this guy involved?” He has done just that as he’s had multiple designed plays for Ferguson downfield, including on the opening play of last week’s game, which just indicates their love and trust in him.

What I like about the longest reception prior to is that he has had plenty of downfield targets. In the last 3 weeks, he’s had 85, 56, and 88 air yards, which is insane for a 12.5 longest reception prop. He has cleared the line of 12.5 in 4/5 last weeks with catches of 21, 31, 36, and 32 yards. So we have had plenty of wiggle room as of late. The Rams are also playing the Seahawks who have been prone to giving up big plays to opposing TEs. Just last week they allowed McBride a reception of 24 yards and backup TE Elijah Higgins a catch of 12 yards. They have allowed 8 catches of 20 or more yards to TEs this year, which again is a lot of wiggle room for this line. They have also given up the 2nd most receptions and receiving yards to TEs this year, so they are just a defense overall that leaks production to the TE position.</td></tr>

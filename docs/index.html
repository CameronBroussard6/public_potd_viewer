Recap: Unlucky, 8-3 overall on our other picks tho.

Team Liquid is currently the hottest team in the world. Fresh off their **BLAST Slam VI** championship victory just two days ago, they are playing a level of Dota that few can match. Historically, Liquid eats tier-2 &quot;spoiler&quot; teams for breakfast. We are backing Liquid to treat this as a &quot;business as usual&quot; series and secure the clean 2-0 sweep.

PARIVISION has a very high floor. Even if they don&#x27;t win the series outright, their current coordination makes a 0-2 loss against this specific Betboom Team roster unlikely. BOL!

Match: Monaco v PSG &amp; Galatasaray v Juventus

Time: 21:00 &amp; 18:45 CET

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: PSG ML + Galatasaray to score (1.92)

Reasoning: 

Barcelona messes it up yet again to hand us a second L in a week just when I thought it was the perfect opportunity to bounce back. Anyway.

PSG is in a similar situation at the moment, got handed a very surprising and disappointing 3-1 loss by Rennes in the Ligue 1 which gave the league lead to Lens. However, in UCL they are a different breed and they proved it last year. Last season they faced another French team in the playoff round and completely battered Brest. This year they face a struggling Monaco which are 8th in Ligue 1 and have been producing very shaky results. I think PSG will capitalize on that even though they play away from home. They’re back in full force and I expect them to push the throttle here. Kvara, Dembele and Barcola will be too much for Monaco to handle in this tie. Expect PSG to deal with it in the first leg. 

Galtasarary awaits Juventus in Istanbul where they have a golden chance to get in the front foot and hope for a R16 qualification. Juventus has conceded 8 goals in the past three matches which shows how shaky their defense is. Osimhen, Sane, Noa Lang, Gundogan, Galatasaray definitely has a lot of quality going forward and being backed by their home supporters I see them putting at least 1 past this Juventus team that is very low on confidence at the moment. Expect Osimhen to showcase the quality he posseses on the biggest stage.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Dortmund DC + o1,5 total goals @1,67

**WriteUp:** It&#x27;s the first leg of the playoff matches and Dortmund playing at home. They only lost at home 2x times since the season begun, one against Leverkusen(cup game) and 1 against Inter in the Cl. 13/16 games went over1,5 goals for them too. Atalanta is in decent form too but they are more prone to make mistakes. They just lost recently to Bilbao and Royale Union which are not very good teams right now.
Dortmund is looking to win this tie at home for sure. They will try to accelerate the match, feeding early runs behind the defensive line and atalanta will try to disrupt the rythm. If the game becomes open then Dortmund&#x27;s attacking efficiency is much better, if it slows down Atalanta should have a chance.
I expect a 3-1 Dortmund win, but playing it safer with double chance.</td></tr>

Bayern has been playing really well under coach Pesic and is turning the season around. It is already too late for the Euroleague, but they showed they can compete there, too. In the BBL 18-2, they started having ridiculous wins like the last two, 61-106 and 66-106.

Frankfurt is about the same quality as Jena and Heidelberg, slightly better. The home court should compensate for that, and these 92 points seem like an undervaluation.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Both teams to score – YES, 1.63, 1 unit


Write up: Real European excitement right in front of us! Typical early knock-out stage match with two teams that try to grind as much as they can to bring joy to their cities. 
Borrusia Dortmund is almost regular participant in the knock-out stage in the UEFA Champions League. They qualified further from the group stage in 10 of the last 13 seasons, scoring in 7 out of 10 of the first knock-out match at home. Also, they have the second-highest scoring rate at Bundesliga this season, scoring in every single game at home with an average of 2.36 goals scored per game at home. In the Champions League almost the same, excluding the game against Inter Milan, they scored at home in the other 3 games with an average of 3.33 goals per game. 
Considering the fact that they are playing the first leg at home, they must attack on the Atalanta’s goal from the first minute.
On the other side, Atalanta this season are playing football like a classic Italian team from the early 2000’s, games under 2.5 goals in 2 out of 3 times in the Serie A.
But beside that, they improved their form, winning in the 7 of the past 11 games in all competitions and scoring 19 goals or 2.71 per game. 
In this Champions League phase, they will play as best as they can to make a good result before the rematch in Bergamo.</td></tr>

This is a gift of a price for an undefeated team. It is a road game and mind you they don’t have a bunch of Quad 1 wins like these other ranked teams BUT they’ve played phenomenal basketball and we’re not going up against some power house. It’s Umass who they’ve played once already this year. It was a close win but since that game they’ve locked in both offensively and defensively, they just steam rolled Ohio Athens. Umass is a middle of the pack MAC team. No advanced analytics or numbers for you but they support the win if we got into them, the close price is because it is AT Umass which does matter in college ball especially and they were able to keep it close last h2h.

Betting 1U to win 0.7U

\---

Expect Borussia Dortmund to go all in from the start; they are in hot form and unbeaten at home in 2026, averaging \~2.3 goals across their last 10 matches. BVB knows they need to build a lead at home against a decent side like Atalanta before traveling to Italy for the second leg.

Atalanta is no joke either; they are one of the most in-form teams in Europe right now, and if Dortmund commits any mistakes, they have the attacking quality to punish them.

Dortmund enters this game without key defensive pieces (Schlotterbeck, Süle, and Emre Can). This is a significant hit, especially considering they play with a back three and already aren&#x27;t a great defensive side (conceded in 7/8 games so far), relying much more on their offensive firepower. Expect Atalanta to exploit Dortmund’s defensive absences.</td></tr>

__Event:__ ATP Doha- Qatar Open: Alcaraz/Rinderknech 11:30am EST - Rublev/De Jong 12:40pm EST

__POTD:__ *Parlay:* Rinderknech +7.5 &amp; Rublev -1.5 sets (+100), 3u to win 3u

__Write Up:__ For the 1st time in 117 writeup’s I’m posting a tennis player, &amp; it just so happens to be against the World #1. Day 2 of the Round of 32 at the 2026 Qatar Open features some big matchups, including the #1 Tennis player in the world, Carlos Alcaraz. This play is less about fading the World #1 &amp; more so about the number. Alcaraz is coming into this one as, well, the World #1, with a perfect 7-0 record in 2026, coming off a historic Australian Open run where he completed the Career Grand Slam. He covered the spread in 5 of those 7 matches &amp; has been nearly untouchable on outdoor hard courts (Doha is hard outdoor). He’s even won 100% of his service games so far this season. Early rounds of ATP 500 events are usually where he makes statements. But -7.5 (alt line) is a huge margin. That would mean he would need to win both sets 6-2, 6-2. Against a server like Arthur Rinderknech, that’s a tough ask. Rinderknech is ranked inside the Top 30 &amp; recently hit a career high around #26, in the midst of having one of his best stretches on tour. He’s 5-2 ATS as an underdog this year. At 6’5 with a heavy first serve, he’s built to protect his service games, which is exactly what you want out of a +7.5 game spread. The over has hit in 75% of Rinderknech’s matches against Top 10 opponents because he holds serve and stretches sets longer than expected. Alcaraz is 4-0 vs Rinderknech, but there hasn’t been any blowouts. 3 of their 4 meetings included a tiebreak. At the 2025 US Open, Alcaraz won 7-6, 6-3, 6-4. Alcaraz will win this one, but Rinderknech is going to make him earn it. __Only one of their 12 sets in their previous matchups against each other ended 6-0, 6-1, or 6-2.__ That’s important when evaluating a spread this large. There’s also the situational angle. This is Alcaraz’s 1st tournament since winning in Melbourne. Even elite players can come out a little flat in their 1st match after a huge win. Doha plays medium speed, quick enough for Rinderknech’s serve to stay effective &amp; steal a tight set, or even least push one to 7-5 or 7-6. But we don’t even need that. All we’re asking for is a 6-3, 6-2 minimum. 

As for Andrey Rublev, he is the defending Qatar Open champion &amp; opens his title defense against Jesper De Jong, this is a clear talent gap. Rublev loves the conditions of these courts, with a whopping 16-5 record here. He has elite power, elite baseline control, &amp; crapload more experience at this level than De Jong. Rublev is a former World #5, 10 time Grand Slam quarterfinalist, Davis Cup champion, Olympic mixed doubles gold medalist, &amp; owns 17 ATP singles titles. The experience and pedigree gap here is significant. __De Jong is ranked #86 &amp; has a terrible 1-4 record to start 2026, with his only win coming against Sumit Nagal, the World #293.__ He’s still chasing his first ATP level singles title &amp; has struggled to find rhythm, including a disappointing Davis Cup stretch. He’s already taken straight set losses this year to players much worse than Rublev. __These 2 have faced each other before with Rublev destroying him 6-1, 6-3.__ The matchup hasn’t changed much since then, De Jong doesn’t have the serve or the firepower to pressure Rublev’s service games, which should allow the Russian to control most baseline exchanges &amp; generate a majority of the break chances. On hard courts, Rublev controls the pace &amp; depth, which historically been a huge problem for De Jong against higher ranked opponents. When Rublev is on, he controls rallies early &amp; forces shorter points on his own terms. But the biggest thing is Rublev is known for locking in during early rounds against lower ranked players, preventing unnecessary 3 set battles early  on in tournaments. If Rublev starts sharp &amp; keeps the unforced errors manageable, this should be a routine straight sets win.

I’ll gladly take a big server at a large spread in one match &amp; back a clear talent gap in the other. Rinderknech doesn’t need to win, just keep it somewhat competitive. Rublev just needs to do what he typically does in Doha, get his easy wins early on.

__Rinderknech +7.5 &amp; Rublev -1.5 sets__

Teams: B8 vs. Aurora

Game: Counterstrike 2 (CS2) | Tournament: PGL Cluj Napoca 2026 | Time: 3:00 AM EST.

**Writeup:**

* Think this line is 2 kills too low maybe 3 which means absolutely tremendous value, NPL had some rough individual maps at the back half of the major which tanked his KPR, but he is still B8&#x27;s star player overall imo
* Aurora have looked extremely shaky at points this tournament, their Mirage looks terrible and as we sadly saw during yesterday&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>, they lost their first Anubis game to NAVI and struggled across the board
* B8 despite making a roster change have really impressed me so far, they look solid as a team, despite two losses, they have played VERY close games (19-17/13-9 to MongolZ) in a 2-1 and 13-11/13-10 vs. FURIA

**Projected Veto:**

* Aurora ban Ancient, B8 ban Anubis/Overpass
* Aurora <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> Overpass/Anubis, **B8 <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> Mirage**

**Mirage Stats:**

* Aurora 33% winrate on 9 maps of Mirage, been their weakest map since around October of last year where they really struggled, they have had struggles on both sides of the map but especially on CT sides recently where aggressive teams like FUT/B8 can really take advantage
* B8 are 38% winrate on 8 maps but some of these numbers are kind of bait (pardon the pun), In 2025 they were arguably the best tier 2/1.5 Mirage team in the world, with a 43-15 record, and multiple strong wins against teams like FaZe/G2/FURIA/FUT and more
* B8 beat Aurora in October on Mirage 13-8

**NPL Mirage Stats:**

* NPL .91 KPR at this tournament so far on Mirage in 2 maps dropping 22 and 18 kills
* NPL .80 KPR on Mirage in 2025 as a whole, his best map in the pool and the main reason B8 are so good at this map, a +0.07 KPR boost from his 2025 overall average
* NPL went O 13.5 kills in 47/56 Mirage maps in 2025 (\~84%)
* NPL averaged 17.5 kills per map on Mirage in 2025, 3.5 kills above what he needs to clear this line</td></tr>

Coming to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>’s match, it’s at the Chennai pitch, which has completely changed recently after the relay work has been done. It used to be a 150–160 type of surface, but now even 180 sometimes isn’t enough. New Zealand needs to win to keep their qualification hopes alive, and Allen has gone past this line in 2 of his last 3 matches. Still, keep your stakes strictly to 1 unit since you never know what’s coming next.

He’s coming off a really strong run in Rosario where he won the title, and he actually beat Burruchaga pretty comfortably in that final (6–2, 6–3). That matchup showed the difference in styles - Ugo is happy to grind, extend rallies, and wait for his moment. He absorbs pace well and is solid when pressure builds.

Burruchaga definitely has weapons, especially if his forehand is firing early. His upside is high. The only worry I have his that Carabelli has played a lot of tennis lately and recently lost to Baez in Argentina. Burruchaga lost in a tough match vs Etcheverry and may be better rested. Gotta take this price though for Ugo.

**Write Up:** Knockout playoffs are here for UCL as Monaco host PSG in the first of 2 legs (one home, one away for each team). It is important to note that typically in these matches the home teams play more aggressively and the away teams just try to survive to make it to the reverse fixture. PSG have been very inconsistent lately, losing over the weekend. They also lost at Monaco 1-0 in Ligue 1 back in November. It is tough to say what PSG team we will get here.

With that said, I like Dembele in this spot because he will be very dangerous on the counter attack and has been in good form. He has hit 2 SOTs in his last 2 matches as well as his last UCL match. PSG will want to take it to Monaco early, and I can see this being a very offense forward game. Monaco will realize their only chance in this playoff is to win here, and that should open up the pitch nicely for Dembele.

Leg 2 - Seifert has been in pretty good form, e&amp; he has hit this total in both the matches he has played in this stadium. While he couldnt hit this against South Africa, they are way better than Canada &amp; the Candanian bowlers shouldnt pose a challenge for him. If there was a concern, if would be him going for a rash shot.

Hope get the W &amp; BoL</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:**  Germany -1.5 + Benfica vs Real Madrid Over 3.5 Cards @ 2.27 (3 units)

Multi sport, crossing boundaries and a plus money 2 leg parlay at that.

**Leg 1:  Winter Olympic Ice Hockey Playoffs – Germany -1.5 Puck line (Includes OT) vs France**

Discussions among Ice Hockey fans abound that Germany has underperformed so far on the ice.  After all they do have an elite top-talent loaded squad with NHL players.  Some speculate that the Germans knew that to qualify in 1^(st) place of their group they had to beat the US team.  Something that was simply not in the cards.  From a strategic viewpoint, saving themselves for these playoffs and later rounds may have been the smart play, assuming this is what they planned.  Germany made it through losing 2 matches but with only a -3 goal differential.

Now the Germans are in the playoffs where they face the worst team from Group A, France.  The French lost all 3 of their opening round games by 8, 4 and 3 goals ending up with a -15 goal differential.  There is no reason the Germans do not pounce on this opportunity and take advantage of a weak disorganized French team that has shown very little promise thus far.  After all these are Germans were talking about.  I’m married to one so I know…no mercy.  Germany should win by more than 1 goal.

**Leg 2:  Champions League – Benfica vs Real Madrid Over 3.5 Total Cards**

If anyone is unaware of what transpired on Jan 26 when these teams met in Lisbon, Portugal in the final match of the group stage, please do yourself a favor and go watch the highlights.  For context alone, Benfica’s coach Mourinho used to be the head coach of Real Madrid many moons ago, and was ousted in 2013 after a poor season.  He savored and relished the recent victory against his former club which suffered humiliation losing to a Benfica that was ill equipped to accomplish such a feat.  At least that is what everyone thought.  Mourinho proved once again he can somehow rearrange the chess pieces to pull off the incredible upset, which he did by winning 4-2 in a most dramatic fashion.  A match that had 38 shots, 18 shots on target, 26 fouls, 8 yellow cards and 2 red cards.  A match that saw the goalkeeper score a last second header to send Benfica into the final spot of the playoffs.  Well enough of that match. (Seriously, watch the highlights)

Less than a month later, fate has chosen these 2 teams to play once again in Lisbon, Portugal, for the knockout stage of the Champions League.  This time Real Madrid should be prepared.  They have the better squad, talent, money, and of course the pressure to win.  However, Real Madrid will also be down 2 starters in Rodrygo and Asencio due to their red cards in the previous match.  They will also be missing Belligham and Militao due to injury.  Also, another loss to Mourinho would almost certainly see some heads roll by management.  There are even rumors going around that Mourinho may return to Real Madrid.

Benfica on the other hand have not much to lose as they were not expected to be in this position in the first place were it not for their miracle performance last month.  But they do have a mastermind in Mourinho and rest assured Benfica will not go down at home in front of their fans with their arms crossed.  I expect fireworks in this match and if last month&#x27;s game was any indication, this one should be testy and could get nasty. 

I don’t think over 3.5 cards is too much to ask here.</td></tr>

Juve have struggled when playing away from home in both Serie A and UCL, winning only one of their L5 matchups away from Turin.

Note: Don&#x27;t use DK or FD. Their odds for the Olympics are terrible.

Girgensons has been a pleasant surprise so far. He&#x27;s sitting at 4 points in 3 games, and he has points against USA, Germany, and Denmark (all ranked in top 9 in the world). Girgensons plays on the top line of both EV and PP, and he routinely plays 20+ minutes as a forward, which is usually only reserved for top players.

Sweden&#x27;s defense is beatable, allowing two goals to a weak Italian team and 9 goals overall in the 3 group stage matches. Latvia&#x27;s team total is set at 1.5, and if Latvia scores twice, it&#x27;d be hard to imagine Girgensons not being involved. I&#x27;m willing to roll the dice at +150.</td></tr>

&gt;Sweden remain at the top of the standings as the only unbeaten team. Their opponent on Tuesday is Canada who now sit in fifth place after a close win over Japan. Sweden has been dominant so far and considering Canada&#x27;s struggles, this line feels like a gift. Hasselborg and Knochenhauer have been the best skip and second, respectively, and I can easily see them outplaying Homan and Miskew. Wilkes has also been awful in the lead position for Canada which has certainly not helped their cause. Sweden came into this event with a 9-7 record this season against elite level teams so they are certainly capable of winning this when they are also the hotter team.</td></tr>

Benfica vs Real Madrid, Over 3.5 goals @ 2.52

At 2.52, I really like the value on over 3.5 goals here. Benfica at home don’t change their style, they attack, press high, and create chances in numbers. Against a team like Real Madrid, that usually leads to an open game. Madrid are deadly when there’s space and can easily score two or three themselves. If this turns into a back-and-forth battle, four goals is very live at this price.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Italy vs Switzerland 6:00 am EST (Olympics/Men&#x27;s Hockey)

Under 6.5 goals (+100)

My first <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> to start this 4 win streak for the Olympics was under 6.5 for Canada vs Switzerland and I had 0 upvotes. Well now i&#x27;m going back with Switzerland with the best odds for under between the four matches tomorrow because this one feels again to me like a low scoring game. Yesterday I was looking at this line and it went from +125 to +100. They&#x27;re starting to understand that this isn&#x27;t the group stage anymore. It&#x27;s win or go home so the amount of goals scored doesn&#x27;t matter. Italy got destroyed by Finland because Finland could get that bye spot by scoring a lot of goals and also because Finland had a **full NHL lineup**. They&#x27;re now facing Switzerland who like I said in another <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> have nine NHL players and the rest are Swiss league level. Do I expect Italy to win? Nope. But I expect it to be a closer game than a beatdown. Italy will have the crowd advantage as host and it&#x27;s now do or die. They&#x27;ll give a good effort and Switzerland knows this. The captain for Switzerland said this
&quot;You&#x27;ve got to win that game before you can think about anything else,&quot; Josi said. &quot;And I think you saw Italy, they played great against Sweden, played really good against Slovakia. There were tight games.&quot;

I&#x27;ve watched the Switzerland games and they tend to play to the level of their opponent. They use their 3 NHL defensemen to create rebounds for the forwards to capitalize and that amounts to a lot of shots from the forwards but with only few NHL forwards (5) on their team the shots are usually not that dangerous. It usually works against European players led team but against team with NHL players who can quickly go from defense to offense like team Canada or Czechia it&#x27;s difficult to keep the defensive assignments especially with their Swiss-level players. Well, as we know Italy has the worst roster in these Olympics by far and I think they won&#x27;t be able to generate much offense even if they get some scoring chances. They might get 1-2 goal but I expect the 3 Switzerland&#x27;s NHL defensemen to get the puck out of the net and their goalie to make the saves (Leonardo Genoni is a Swiss goalie legend because he excels in these kind of games).

I take the model between Switzerland vs France, who are slitghtly better than Italy, as one of the scenarios that could happen tomorrow. France had 27 shots but got shutout while the Swiss NHL players made the difference to win the game 4-0. Italy tomorrow should generate something like 20 shots as the host so something similar to France. The second scenario is the game becomes like Italy vs Slovakia and the Italians make it close by ending the game 3-2 (Slovakia had 7 NHL players on the team as a comparison to Switzerland).

Switzerland went under the 6.5 goals line in 2 of their 3 games in these Olympics with the last one almost also going under but didn&#x27;t happen because of a last minute Czechia comeback. Meanwhile Italy only hit it once but the two other games were against Sweden and Finland who like I said had both full NHL lineups and had way more firepower than what Italy will face tomorrow against the Swiss. I just don&#x27;t see this game become a massacre for Switzerland when it&#x27;s now a win or go home situation and every mistake could be costly.

BOL!

Edit : ✅️ Booommmm went EXACTLY like the France-Switzerland game. Plenty of shots for Switzerland but they don&#x27;t have the firepower of Finland or Sweden to make this a blowout like I predicted! I didn&#x27;t write that damn long write-up for no reason!!! LFG enjoy the money!!</td></tr>

**Write up:** Going to Kembla for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today’s pick</mark> with EASIEST CHOICE. Resumed this prep with a pretty soft 2.5 length win over 1300 meters and steps up to the 1400 <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. After scratching’s we come into barrier 5 and there’s not a single ounce of speed in this race bar us, so we will be finding the front extremely easily. This is one of the main reasons I’m so keen, as we will have complete dominance over the speed of the race, and can make it extremely hard for anything else to make up ground on us.     
      
We sat 2nd last start and ran great closing splits from up on the speed, so I don’t envision the extra 100m being anything besides a positive. We’ve got Jay Ford on top, and he’s fairly good for a country race, so there’s no worries in that department.      
       
In terms of dangers I don’t really see anything that worries me. TSAREVICH was a monster win last start, coming from seemingly 20 lengths behind and monstering them late, however I’ve seen the sectionals and I really think he went right past horses who were paddling, so less impressive than it visually suggested.

**Write Up:** A bit sweaty on the first leg but they come through with two second half goals, Coventry vs Middlesbrough ended 3-1 thanks to a hattrick from Haji Wright. I am updating my net units based on my picks (over 2.5 instead of 1.5) which was +221 instead of the +127 odds posted, the lower gained 5.09 units and the higher line was 8.84 units. Both good cashes for any that tailed, lets get onto todays picks.

Cardiff (1st) are host to Wimbledon (15th), the home team boast an impressive record of 10-1-1 at home this season, unbeaten in 11 league games home and away,  averaging \~2.4 goals at their home ground. In comparison Wimbledon have an away record of 5-3-4 scoring an average of \~1.5 goals per game. Cardiff won the reverse fixture earlier in the year 1-0 and with home advantage, a higher scoring rate and better form I don&#x27;t see Wimbledon being able to keep them from putting a few past them. Keeping it simple with the better team winning at their home ground.

Lincoln (2nd) are unbeaten in 14 league games, owning a home record of 9-2-1. Northampton (17th) are 2-4-6 in away games, although unbeaten in 3 they are fixtures against weaker opponents and the two away games in that ended in draws to Exeter (14th) and Barnsley (16th). Lincoln are in the promotion race which should give them plenty of motivation to perform at home, with Northampton struggling away and struggling to score consistently I see the team with a stronger form, lineup and home advantage taking all 3 points from a poor travelling, bottom-end team.

Short writeup <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, not overthinking it much as the two much stronger teams with good home records should both be looking for 3 points against these matchups.

Appreciate anyone who tailed yesterday, managed to cash all of the lines I had chosen, even whacked them all in a parlay for a nice cash out of +15 units!

Yes, whilst I mostly focused on the &quot;Barca curse&quot;, one team has been consistently killing my picks one after the other, whilst somehow staying relatively under the radar. I&#x27;m talking about Real Madrid. No matter what, whether I backed or faded them, they&#x27;d always find a way to break my heart come the end of the game. But after surviving this Barcelona madness, I think the next logical step is to come for Real Madrid. Character progression and all that.* ***This is it, the final boss battle, if you will. Let&#x27;s get to it!***

**Event:** Champions League, Benfica v Real Madrid, 3:00 pm EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Benfica +0.5 Asian Handicap, -103, 5 units

**Write Up:** I don&#x27;t think I need to explain myself too much here. Real Madrid just haven&#x27;t impressed me enough to back them in a big Champions League game like this one. The **previous meeting between these two sides saw Benfica beat Madrid** in a spectacular fashion after a stunning headed goal from their goalkeeper (yes, you read that right) helped them beat the Spanish giants 4-2 and secure a spot in the play-offs. Benfica thus proved they can absolutely compete against elite teams, and truthfully, 4-2 might have even flattered the guests a bit.

Real Madrid have since managed to find some consistency, but Benfica certainly have more than enough quality to at least snatch a draw here. Keep in mind, this is the **first leg of a knockout tie, and neither team is going to come out swinging,** especially not Madrid. They&#x27;re going to be more than happy to **settle for a draw** here and hunt for a win at the Bernabeu, depending on how the on-field balance looks. As a reminder, we&#x27;re talking about a team that celebrated a narrow first leg defeat to Manchester City, as they anticipated a comeback at their home ground (which they, in fact made happen).

However, I&#x27;ve not even come to my favorite part about this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, which is the **Real Madrid absences.** In case you forgot, the guests collected two red cards in their last match (ironically, against Benfica), meaning **Raul Asencio and Rodrygo** are out of the picture for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>&#x27;s clash. And if these aren&#x27;t some crucial absences, **Jude Bellingham** is also set to miss the match due to a hamstring injury, while **Eder Militao** still doesn&#x27;t look ready. And for that final blow, **Kylian Mbappe is still recovering** and is possibly not going to feature for the whole 90 minutes. That&#x27;s a crazy amount of key first team players missing, and whilst *Benfica are missing Alexander Bah and Fredrik Aursnes* themselves, they just aren&#x27;t on the same level of importance as the aforementioned players.

Unlike the league phase clash, goals aren&#x27;t going to rain in this one, so Under 2.5 goals is a good angle if you want to boost the odds further (or go more conservatively with a 3.5). This is essentially a Benfica double chance, but once again, the odds are tastier if I head over to the AH section of my book (-103 v -111). Another max unit play here because the confidence is absolutely sky high and I just think these odds are too good in this context. BOL and let&#x27;s enjoy this European classic and maybe a cheeky hattrick from the Benfica keeper ☘️🫡</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Brandon Nakashima 🇺🇸 ML vs Marin Cilic 🇭🇷 5 units to win 3.3U @1.66 (Bet365)

Big respect to Cilic for holding his own out there at 37 after years of injury problems. One of the most underrated players ever in my opinion simply due to the fact that no one really speaks of him despite winning a grand slam in the toughest era of tennis, players who have achieved far less get more recognition than Cilic. He’s had a pretty good start to the season, losing in R16 of Hong Kong to Borges, R3 of AO to Ruud having beaten Shapovalov in straights and last week lost to Fritz in the semis of Dallas having defeated Tien in round 1. Nakashima started the season on fire by reaching the finals of Brisbane and beating the likes of Davidovich Fokina in straight sets before falling to Medvedev 2-0. He then suffered an upset to VDZ in Melbourne in four tight sets to put a dent into his strong start to 2026 and last week lost to Fritz in R16 of Dallas.

So both players have had decent season openers but it’s the conditions that are going to heavily favour Nakashima in this match. Unlike Dallas which is one of the fastest tournaments, Delray plays fairly slow so Cilic’s big serve becomes less of a weapon. More neutral balls is going to force more errors from Marin who will be forced to attack to try and end points early. This is going to play exactly into Brandon’s gamestyle who has great rally tolerance and depth to keep rhythm going. Considering Nakashima’s strong serve and Cilic’s relatively poor returning I’m not optimistic on the Croatian’s chances at creating many opportunities on return but on the other side if Cilic’s first serve dips even slightly I expect him to get punished by the American’s depth. Nakashima plays very tactical tennis (his play style is stylistically very similar to Djokovic who Marin struggled against greatly) and if he can be on the front foot with a good return and force backhand-cross exchanges this could be a quick win for him. Not only does Nakashima’s patient game match well against Cilic’s error-proness on these courts but there’s also going to be questions of the Croatian’s fitness. At 37 playing 5 matches in 7 days is going to take its toll and I can see this being a UE fest once the match goes on. I would have fairer odds at around 1.50. Cilic did beat Nakashima in November 24’ on the way to winning Hangzhou but the courts there are also amongst the fastest on tour so I’m not worried by it. BOL !</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Sydney FC Over 4.5 Corners @ 1.66**  **✅**

**Confidence: 87%**

**Games: Australian A League -  Sydney FC VS Auckland FC - 3:00 am EST**

**---**

**Sydney FC played Auckland away 10 days ago and got 7 corners while losing 1-0, now they get a rematch at home and I expect them to be up for it performance wise.**

Sydney have played 6 home games this season and covered this line in **5/6** with an average of **5.83 corners per game. With the one miss ending on 4 corners.**

Sydney have lost 4 of their last 5 games yet a win will have them second and just above Auckland. I expect heavy field tilt from Sydney while Auckland punch on the counter, Auckland are better defensively but should find themselves having to deal with more dead balls than they&#x27;d like.

**Last Pick:** Goztepe ML (vs Kayserispor) ❌

**Football | Champions League | 20:45 UTC+3**

**Match:** Galatasaray vs Juventus

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Galatasaray Over 0.5 Goals

**Write Up:** Juventus have played 4 away matches in the Champions League this season, and apart from the 0-0 draw against Monaco, they conceded at least 1 goal in every single one of them. Galatasaray, on the other hand, managed to score at least 1 goal in 3 out of their 4 home games.

Galatasaray usually have big problems on the road in Europe, but at home they’re different. Especially with the crowd behind them pushing them to score and win. The fans will be roaring again tonight, no doubt, and I’m confident they’ll get at least one goal on the board.</td></tr>

Nothing happening in the first half had me nervous, but they turned it on in the second. 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>: Europe | LEC | 1045am Eastern | Team Heretics vs G2 | G2 -1.5 | 3U @ -125

G2 is the better team here and I see them coming into typical G2 playoff form and taking this 2-0</td></tr>

Ireland v Zimbabwe 

Zimbabwe win @ 1.66

Starts in about 11 Hours ⏳

Units: 5

https://www.buymeacoffee.com/JaySial

Reasoning:

Zimbabwe beat Australia in their last match. Biggest upset of this World Cup.

High in confidence and to make sure they qualify to next stage Zimbabwe will deliver this win.

They are batting very sensibly. Muzarabani’s bowling and Sikandar Raza’s all round performance can cause problems for Irish team.</td></tr>

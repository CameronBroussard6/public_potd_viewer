**ROI: +16.34%**

Last POTD: NCAAMB: UVA +9.5 ALT Spread vs. Louisville + ALT Total Under 162.5 -127 (0.50U TO WIN 0.33U) ✅

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: NBA: Magic vs Grizzlies U230.5 -110 (0.50U TO WIN 0.40U)**

Write up: 0.50U on this play - We are 8-2 in the L10, riding a 6-bet win-streak - unfortunately a smaller slate <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, I hate betting on the NBA, college basketball is slim pickens, so rolling with another 0.50U bet here - Model has this as the highest confident Edge % and EV % for the day. Will add some personal information in this write-up as well.

• ⁠Model has Under 230.5 at 54%

• Model projects Magic covering -4.5 at 52% while it also projects the game&#x27;s total ending at 224

• EV better betting 100$ = 7-8$ for this play

• Rolling with 0.50U here because the NBA is just not fun to bet, always some stupid things happening, but there is not a lot on the board - As always, I try to get a play out for you all each day, whether there are a lot of games or barely anything - First thing that stands out here is that they are playing overseas, so fatigue should play a very small factor, different atmosphere, long flights/travel, and just a weird situation in general playing overseas - Second thing, injuries - Grizzlies are still without Morant and Edy - Magic are without Suggs, with Franz expected to make his return - Low scoring affair here, with the Grizzlies averaging just 114 PPG, which is not even top 20 in the NBA - the last 4 games for them have also gone under, which is something to note - Last time these two teams played, both teams healthy, the final score ended at 209 - The over has only hit 39% in all of the Grizzlies games this year, while the Magic&#x27;s overs have hit 51% of the season - some key injuries on both sides, recent games going under, and the game being across the pond, I like the under 230.5 here

&gt; **Write Up:** This <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> is from my soccer model that I&#x27;ve been using for the past two years. It assigns ELO ratings to players and projects a win chance based on the combined ELO ratings of the players on each team. TeamReddit is projecting a 62% win chance here which creates value here on the ML.</td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>

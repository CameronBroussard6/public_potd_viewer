<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s pick</mark>: Ashton Jeanty over 61.5 rush yds
Event: Cowboys v Raiders.

I’m pretty peeved about this last pick. I think I read the game perfectly and predicted that AJ Brown would have his game. He got more targets and receptions in this game than any other game in the last year…. And he still didn’t hit. I’m pissed.

For this game on MNF, I’d be wary of taking the cowboys or the over, I think how this game goes will surprise a lot of people. 

One thing that I think will happen regardless though, is that Jeanty will tear up the cowboys defence. You could also take over rush/rec yds and I like that almost as much. Best of luck to us.</td></tr>

NBA | Cavs v Bucks | 🏀  

Tripple double for Hart who absolutely feasted on every department, finished with 10 assists and 16 potentials. Would love to run it back against the Heat again but id rather stay away from the bump.

Mobley has taken on a bigger facilitating role in the absence of Garland and has handled it superbly. Without Garland he’s over in 7/L10 games avg 4.3 assists per game &amp; 10 potentials per game and has had 3+ assists in all 10 of those games.

That includes a game against the Bucks earlier this season where he had 6 assists on 12 potentials.

Bucks allow 8th most assists to PF’s this season and has struggled defensively this season, with a high total of 237 I like Mobley to continue his great impact as the secondary ball handler for the Cavs, especially benefits in the non Mitchell minutes.</td></tr>

Last Pick: Manchester City vs Real Madrid ~ Both teams to take 1+ corners in each half (-175) ❌ (04/17/2024)


Fixture: Croatia vs Montenegro (World Cup Qualifiers) 11:45am PST Time 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Will A Goal Be Scored In Both Halves? Yes. (-160) 

Reasoning: 

Croatia has scored a total of 23 goals in its last 7 World Cup Qualifiers. 

5 of Croatia last 7 World Cup Qualifiers have resulted in Croatia scoring in both halves. 

Additionally, I can see  Montenegro giving its all in offensive positions to stay alive in having a chance of qualifying. This will push for both teams to score due to Montenegro pushing higher up the field, in which Croatia can capitalize on with counter attacks and players being out of positions.

Out of 7 games in which Montenegro have faced, 5 games have resulted goals being scored in both halves. 

Montenegros last match up against Croatia on September 8th 2025, resulted in a 0-4 loss. Additionally in this match., both halves included a goal.

PS. If you want to get better odds with some risk involved, you can aim for Croatia to score in both halves. (+110)

Sport: Tennis Tournament: WTA 125k Colina, Chile Time: 5:00 PM EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Oleksandra Oliynykova 2:0 -165 (tipping at this market avg number but b365 is still handing -137((hammer))

Analysis: Oleksandra is having her best year on clay in 2025 so far with 51 wins [30 itf] and just 15 losses. Shes been one of the hottest girls on the South American circuit this last month too racking up 9 wins (coming off her second title of the year 8 days ago) and only two losses. One versus Julie Grabher which was razor close down to the wire. Then she layed an absolute egg against Jasmin Ortenzi (😂) as a -500 favourite. As for her wins through this campaign I’m impressed with: Udvardy, Riera, Sierra (#1 seed &amp; hometown favourite((SPANKED her))), and sherif (great gritty win coming back from a set down to beat a really establish clay courter in Sherif). Oleksandra has been loving the altitude and we’re gonna continue to back her in this absolute mismatch tomorrow against Elizabeth Mandlik. 

Mandlik on the other hand isn’t having a bad year at any means sitting at 18 wins and 10 losses to the surface currently. *Here’s the problem*, all 28 of those matches (*except 4*) were played on the ITF circuit; a significantly lower level of competition in comparison to the challenger circuit Oleksandra has been dominating. She also lost every time she played a step up in comp: Branstine in Vero Beach, Carle in Bellinzona(elevation) and Friedsam @ Troisdorf(elevation). Get this, her last clay match where she lost to Friedsam was *FIVE* months ago! Shes been grinding little bush league hard court ITF circuits and farming prize money while Oleksandra has been developing herself into a top 100 clay courter who’s (just about) ready for clay WTA 250’s and 500’s while Mandlik is just using her ranking for protected appearance fee is. Even if she’s *serious* about this odd clay entry here, she’s going to be rusty and Oleksandra will absolutely show levels in this spot. Don’t overthink this one, ride the hot hand and see why they NVS🌟

1 Reception over 3 targets all in the fourth quarter yeesh, at least it was a fun game to watch

**Todays Event**: 🏈 NFL Monday Night Football Cowboys @ Raiders 7:15 PM CST🏈

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Todays pick</mark>**: Both teams to make a 33 yard or longer field goal (-125 on DK) 1u to win 0.8u

**Writeup:** Dallas heads over to Vegas tonight to face the raiders. Raiders look to get out of their slump while the Cowboys fight to not get embarrassed by another mid team. Cowboys are projected to win with their spread of -3.5, and the line is at a total at 49.5 points, telling us this game could be closer and have plenty of field goal attempts

Lets look at some kicker stats. Daniel Carlson Averages 38 yards for his field goal attempts this season, with his longest averaging 31 yards per game. With 15 attempted this season and 12 made, he sits at an average of 1.3 made per game with 1.7 attempted, a solid 80% percentage. Carlson&#x27;s longest on the season is at 54 yards in week 2 against the chargers.

Brandon Aubrey Average 40 yards/fg made and averaging 41 per longest field goal in a game.. He has attempted 18 and made 17 of those at a 94.4% rate. He averages 1.9 made per game and 2 attempted per game.  Aubreys longest fg was 64 yards, also in week 2 against the giants.

Raiders have a pretty terrible and ugly offense this year, ranking 27th in total offense. However, the cowboys even this out with some equally horrible defense, being ranked 31st. On the flip side, Raiders hold the 15th best defense while the cowboys have the 4th best offense. I can see the Raiders getting into field goal range and not trusting Geno to get it done, and the Cowboys taking some easy points in field goals to start up their early lead.

The ravens legitimately could not have played worse and still won by a touchdown! How many times could they shoot themselves in the foot before I skipped therapy and took it out on my fucking tv man😂😂 fucking love it. Was a great call at the end by the coaching staff as well! Absolutely beautiful! And the jaguars came to play like we expected… the chargers tried their very best to fuck us over but it didn’t matter!

Event: Cowboys @ Raiders (7:15pm central)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Cowboys -3 (-130) (1U)

-everything is bet to win unit amount-

Write up: 

You can call this whatever you want, you can call this bad handicapping, bad judgement, but I’ll tell you what. There’s something amazing about the human spirit when it has something to play and fight for, you see these things all the time, the miracle “33” point comeback with all the flukes pointing towards Demaryius Thomas being with the team when they honored him that specific game, the interception we saw <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> from Nashon wright who had a beautiful interception for the bears right before halftime then got on one knee and broke down in tears honoring his late coach John Beam who was tragically shot last Friday. You see these things a lot and the cowboys have stated that they’re going to honor Marshawn Kneeland with their pads and how they play. The word “relentless” is being described in the locker room. 

The cowboys clear and away have the upper edge in this game offensively…

* Points Per Drive: Dallas 2.41 (rank 4th) vs Las Vegas 1.27 (rank 31st)
* Yards Per Play: Dallas 5.8 vs Las Vegas 4.2
* Success Rate: Dallas 47.2% vs Las Vegas 39.1%
* Drive Success Rate: Dallas 42.1% vs Las Vegas 28.3%
* Explosive Play Rate: Dallas 11.2% vs Las Vegas 7.8%
* Three-and-Out Rate: Dallas 18.7% vs Las Vegas 28.4%

The Cowboys’ superior third-down conversion rate (41.3% vs 32.7%) and red-zone touchdown percentage (64.2% vs 48.1%) compound this edge. The Cowboys’ offensive efficiency advantage is legitimate and measurable. Their 29.2 points per game ranks 4th league-wide, fueled by Dak Prescott’s 69.3% completion rate and 257.8 passing yards per contest.

But yes, ah, the defense is so tragically poor, having allowed 30.8 points per game. But with the addition of Quinnen Williams parlayed with the following stats and the extra motivation I really do believe these boys will be able to get to geno and mitigate some of the explosiveness from Ashton jeanty

 The Cowboys lead the NFL with a 30.7% pressure rate this season. Geno Smith, meanwhile, has been pressured heavily — he’s taken 18 sacks for 141 yards lost and owns a 77.6 passer rating under pressure, with 7 TDs vs 10 INTs. That’s a clear weakness you can exploit if you’re betting against him. If you watch this guy he is very indecisive and hold onto the ball way longer than he should!

Game logs show multiple outings where pressure wrecked him:
* vs Broncos: 6 sacks, 1 INT
* vs Colts: 4 sacks, 2 INT
* vs Chargers: 3 INTs, 3 sacks







He’s prone to mistakes when the pocket collapses, and Dallas’ top-ranked pressure rate is exactly the type of matchup that exposes him. 



This raiders defense is also not world beaters by any means. Ranking below average in many statistics across the board. I do believe the star power in Dallas is still very relevant, dak has never lost 3 games in a row. And if you know anything about cowboys fans is that they are everywhere and love to travel, these fans will be flocking to Vegas to cheer them on and just experience the atmosphere out there. I expect these boys to have a large backing from their fans. Both teams have losing records but I do believe the cowboys have more to play for and I do believe they get the job done. Been a great weekend! As always, cheers🍻</td></tr>

NCAAB // Florida A&amp;M Rattlers @ Georgia Bulldogs

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Georgia -36.5 (-110) 1u**

We are going out to Athens, Georgia where the Bulldogs have a tune up game against truly one of the worst teams in the country. FAMU is one of the worst teams in one of the worst conferences in the sport and the line reflects that.

This is a very big line, no getting around that, but I think it&#x27;s one FAMU is going to struggle staying within. They are 0-3 so far with an average margin of defeat of 31 points all by teams worse than Georgia. Meanwhile Georgia is off to a great start on the year sitting at 4-0 and scoring at will against every team they&#x27;ve faced so far. In their 3 tune up games so far, they&#x27;ve won by an average margin of 50 points!!!

So, we have a team that has been blowing out tune up opponents against a team that&#x27;s been getting blown out by everyone they&#x27;ve played. I think those trends continue tonight and we see something along the lines of 100-55.

Georgia: #34 in KenPom

Game starts at 8:15pm EST. Bet 2.75u

Writeup: For Monday Night Football, we have the Vegas Raiders hosting the Dallas Cowboys. Both of these teams have weak defenses and explosive offenses, and we will use that to our advantage here. This one is pretty simple.

This season, running back Ashton Jeanty has been averaging 19 touches per game. Running backs that have seen 15 touches or more against the Cowboys defense are averaging 130 scrimmage yards this season. Since week 4, nearly every lead running back opposing the Cowboys has gone for over 100 scrimmage yards or just short of it - Josh Jacobs went for 157, Breece Hall went for 155, Rico Dowdle went for 239, J.K. Dobbins went for 121, and Emari Demercado (4th string RB) went for 78. The Raiders by far had their best offensive game 2 weeks ago and nearly beat the Broncos last week, who have a top 3 defense in the league. Now facing this incredibly soft Dallas defense, I expect Jeanty to be a focal point of the Raiders attack and reach 85 or more total yards in this one.

GERMANY VS SLOVAKIA

Date: 17 NOVEMBER 2025 at 20:45

BET ON: Over / Under Corners- Over +8.50

Odd: 1.66



\- Germany and Slovakia enter this match with enormous stakes, and both teams’ tactical profiles point naturally toward a high corner count. Germany, despite sitting top of the group, must avoid defeat to secure automatic qualification, and their injury issues — missing key figures like ter Stegen, Rüdiger, Musiala, and Havertz — weaken central stability and often force Nagelsmann’s side to build wider and rely on lane overloads, increasing wing actions and resulting corners. The expected returns of Kimmich and Schlotterbeck further encourage a more proactive, front-foot approach. Slovakia, meanwhile, needs a win to top the group, pushing them into a more aggressive setup with Strelec leading the line and wide players such as Hancko and Ďuriš expected to attack relentlessly. With both teams motivated, playing offensively, and using the flanks as their primary constructive zones — combined with Germany’s defensive absences creating more broken plays — the match projects sustained pressure at both ends and a strong profile for over 8.5 corners.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Hernan Casanova vs Alex Hernández | **Casanova ML at -138 (DK). 1 unit.**

Write-up: Chan closed at -130, and played a solid match to win in straight sets. He ended up beating Charles Broom in the semifinals as well before Daniil Glinka finally ended his run in the final. 

For <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today’s pick</mark>, I’m going with Hernan Casanova to beat Alex Hernandez (could be listed as Juan Alejandro Hernandez Serrano on some books) in Guayaquil. Casanova is a veteran clay-courter who has quietly been playing some solid tennis recently, including a title at an M15 in Santiago, and has received short prices (+200 or so) against high-CH/low-ATP guys like Burruchaga and Heide as a result. He makes his fourth appearance here in Guayaquil, having played here in 2020, 2021, and 2022. 

Meanwhile, Hernández, who had bounced between SA clay and European hard courts this fall, is in okay form, but it’s not like the market has been valuing him the same as Casanova. In early October, he was priced as a massive underdog (+400) against Barrios Vera, who I don’t believe is significantly better than Burruchaga or Heide, and ended up winning just three games. More recently, he was priced as a bigger underdog than he is here against Schiessl and Gima, neither of whom are quite at Casanova’s level in my opinion. Alex actually tends to play his best tennis on hard courts, where he is best known for a crazy comeback against Taro Daniel as a wildcard in Los Cabos. 

Of course I have to mention the head-to-head, as Hernandez did score a straight-sets win over Casanova in Santa Cruz in June. However, Casanova closed at nearly -500 in that match, and I simply don’t believe that he should be available at such a good price this time around. The logic here is similar to my recent Buse <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, where I was able to successfully fade a negative H2H. 

Both of these guys will be grinding from the baseline, but I expect Casanova’s topspin and clay court skills to eventually wear down Hernandez in hot, muggy conditions. I actually thought about making this a 2-unit play, but the main reason I didn’t is that it’s just hard to get recent footage or advanced stats on guys who mostly play ITFs. Regardless, I would take this to around -150, and it’s already trending in that direction on some books.

Write Up:  
 




With Meyers gone, Tre Tucker finally gets a real shot. He basically steps in as the Raiders WR1 now with more targets, more responsibility, and a legit chance to break out. Meyers was soaking up a lot of targets, so with him gone, those targets should naturally slide toward Tucker.


He’s not just a straight-line deep guy either. Tucker’s pretty versatile as he can return kicks, line up all over the formation, and fits into a bunch of different offensive packages. The speed and agility are obvious, but he’s also shown he can fight through contact and make some tough catches when he needs to.


And for context, he’s averaging around 5.1 targets per game this season, so there’s already a solid baseline for his involvement. With this new role, that number could easily bump up.

Germany vs Slovakia

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> : Germany to Win + Total Under 4.5 Goals @1.65 for 3u

Germany have won 4 straight matches since their opening loss to Slovakia and just beat Luxembourg 2-0, and they are playing at home in Leipzig where they have won 5 consecutive World Cup qualifiers and only lost 1 of their last 34 home qualifiers, which shows how dominant they are. Germany&#x27;s attacking players are in good form especially Nick Woltemade, and the team has only conceded 3 goals in 5 qualifiers, making their defense one of the best in the competition. Slovakia did beat Germany 2-0 in September which gives them belief, but they are terrible away from home having lost 5 of their last 6 away matches and failed to score in 3 of their last 5 away games, so they will struggle to create chances at the Redbull Arena. Both teams are strong defensively, so low-scoring matches are expected, and the last 9 consecutive Slovakia matches had under 3.5 total goals, meaning the under 4.5 requirement is very likely to be met.

**Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Bruno Fernandes ATGS (-120) ✅️

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s Event:** UEFA World Cup Quals | Germany vs Slovakia (11:45AM PST)

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Nick Woltemade ATGS (+110) 1 units to win 1.1 units

**Write Up:** Portugal *really* wanted that win as they thrashed Armenia 9-1. Our guy Bruno came through with the cash before halftime, and ended game with a hattrick and an assist. 

Off we head <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> to Germany for a winner take all game in Group A. Winner goes to the world cup, loser heads to the playoff games in March. Germany is in a similar spot <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> as Portugal was yesterday - at home against a side they should beat with World Cup qualification on the line. 

If any of you have followed my picks in the soccer thread, you know how much I like the Lanky German - Nick Woltemade. He&#x27;s a 6&#x27;6&quot; tall old school striker&#x27;s striker who can do it all. He works hard, chases everything, and can score with his head or his feet. He has cemented himself as the top choice for Germany up front and is coming into this match hot, scoring in each of his last two games for Germany and coming off a 2 goal game at Luxembourg on Friday. I also think our lanky German will take charge of penalty duties, given his current form and that their captain Kimmich is still questionable to play with injury. 

2nd place Slovakia will want to spoil Germany&#x27;s fun here, as they handed Germany their only group stage loss in Slovakia back in September. However, this is a different team on the road, with a 1-0-5 record in away matches over the last year. With their only win and clean sheet being against Luxembourg. 

I&#x27;m backing our guy Woltemade to find the back of the net <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, keep up his great form, and secure Germany&#x27;s spot in the World Cup, BOL!</td></tr>

Last pick: [USC -16.5](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/s/nEIDVeo1tL) ✅ 

Event CBB: NC State vs VCU 7PM Eastern Time

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **NC State -11.5** (-120 FanDuel)

NC State is having a good start to the Will Wade era. They’ve won and covered the spread by a comfortable margin in their first 3 games - winning by 48, 24, and 46. They haven’t scored less than 94pts yet. 

State is currently ranked #1 offense in the country at a crazy 1.4pts per possession.

Per Bart Torvik, with preseason bias removed, NC State is the 21st team in the country, while VCU is at 101.

Their opponent VCU isn’t looking the best to start the season. They scored only 78pts against 296 ranked Saint Peter’s.

Will Wade and NC State brought in some dawgs from the portal also. 

Notable starters for NCSU that were added in the portal: 
-Darrion Williams, who was the #1 player in the portal according to multiple medias. 
-Tre Holloman, started at MSU last season and was a key player. 
-Van Lubin who started at C for UNC and had a great second half of the season.
-Copeland who was a top player on viral McNeese team last season where Wade coached prior. 

Counting on NC State’s high powered offense, the motivation of their first relevant home game of the season, and Will Wade to cover this line.

Take NCSU -11.5</td></tr>

Yesterday&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: England to win and no for BTTS vs Albania. 3u @ 2.10✅

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Netherlands v Lithuania. Netherlands -5 corner line. 3u @ $1.85

Not a great deal on <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, so keep that in mind. 

However, I really like this.

There&#x27;s not a whole lot to say here... The Netherlands should be the dominant team and do all of the attacking at home. There&#x27;s a tiny tiny (and I mean TINY) chance Poland can jump Netherlands here. 

The Netherlands will dominate possession and look to attack frequently in this game... With that in mind, I see them dominating in the corner game. 

On top of that, the Netherlands were pretty shit in their game away to Poland a few days ago, so I expect them not to muck about too much here. 

The Netherlands have a fair few out for this window, and Kluivert has gone back early - but it shouldn&#x27;t matter considering the depth in the squad compared to a side like Lithuania.

Again, not a whole bunch I like <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, but I think they should cover this corner line pretty comfortably.</td></tr>

PICKS: Northern Ireland ML + Germany ML @ 1.79 2U

WRITE UP: 


Right guys, heavy focus on these two games in the same group for Monday as we enter the last couple of days of the international break.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> 1 - Northern Ireland to win. NI come into this one off the back of a last minute defeat to Slovakia. However, as mentioned previously - they are a different side at home! Prior to defeat in their last home game against Germany, Northern Ireland hadn’t lost at home for 8 games and rarely concede. Couple that with the fact that the guests have only won 1 of their last 17 games and sit bottom of the group with a record of 0-0-5 having only scored 1 goal in those 5 games. Football is a funny game , but all of the facts point towards and Irish victory in Belfast.


<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> 2 - Germany to win. The Germans come into this one level on points with their guests knowing that a win will see them top the group. Germany haven’t been in vintage form recently and did lose in the reverse fixture in Slovakia. However, at home in a must win game - there are few countries in world football who prove time and time again they get the job done. Can see this being scrappy but again a 2-0 / 2–1 home win seems the likely outcome.

As always nothing is guaranteed in sport but the facts and history point towards this being  routine win… whether that is true or not only time will tell.

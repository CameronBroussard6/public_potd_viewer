Melbourne Victory vs Western Sydney @ 2.5

Melbourne Victory vs Western Sydney Wanderers should deliver plenty of action. Victory are aggressive going forward at home but often concede chances, while the Wanderers attack with speed and intensity. Neither side is comfortable sitting back, which usually leads to an open game. With both teams capable of scoring multiple goals and defensive mistakes likely, this matchup strongly points toward over 3.5 goals.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Pablo Fornals 1+ tackle vs Real Oviedo + Victor Chust 1+ foul committed vs Valencia 5 units to win 4.2U @1.81 (Bet365)

Write-up: First win of the year as Limassol and Omonia easily clear the under with just 6 corners whilst Kubo got a tackle before half time, ending on 4 (three won).

I’ll probably do these quick write-ups from now on since at the end of the day all that matters for my plays is the stats. 


- Fornals has tackled in 15/17 games this season averaging 1.41 per game including his last 10/10
- A few predicted line-ups have him as a CDM where he’s averaged 1.57 and cleared in 6/7 this season (7/7 with sub roll-on)
- CAM’s against Oviedo averaging 1.3 tackles per game (covered in 5/6). Even better if he’s playing in CDM with 2.7 average vs Oviedo (cleared 6/6)
- Chust committed a foul in all 10 matches this season averaging 1.5 per game
- RCB’s against Valencia averaging 1.6 fouls per game (covered in 10/11)

__Event:__ NFL: Rams @ Panthers 4:30pm EST

__POTD:__ Kyren Williams o65.5 rushing yards (-110), 4.4u to win 4u

__Write Up:__ __*Temporary write up below, official write up incoming*__

Kyren has had 70+ rushing yards in 8 of his last 10 games. He is averaging 78 yards a game in his last 10 games. The last 7 games that he had 13+ carries he rushed for more than 72 yards in every game, averaging 83.3 yards in those games. He hasn’t had fewer than 12 carries all season &amp; has had 13+ in 7 of his last 10. Including 23 in a meaningful game vs the Seahawks in Week 16, showing McVay trusts him. In Week 17 in a crucial game vs the Falcons which they were neck &amp; neck with &amp; ended up losing, Williams outsnapped Corum 13-6. The Rams have the best run blocking Offensive Line in the NFL. They average 2.0 yards before contact best in the NFL, with just a 13.2% run stuff rate (5th). The allowed the 7th most yards before contact this season at 2.36 &amp; have given up 157.3 rushing yards in their last 3 games, 4th most in the NFL. Opposing RB’s are averaging 29.8 carries a game against the Panthers in their last 5 games (minus the Saints who are pass heavy &amp; just not good). Books have his rush attempts line at 14.5. He’s over in 6/6 games this season with at least 14+ carries. The opposing leading back has cleared their rushing yards line in 9 of the last 10 games against Carolina. Carolina has gotten crushed by RB’s all year:
Irving 62.5 -&gt; 85✅, Charbonnet 38.5 -&gt; 110✅, Irving 63.5 -&gt; 71✅, Corum 34.5 -&gt; 81✅, Kyren 64.5 -&gt; 72✅, McCaffrey 68.5 -&gt; 89✅, Bijan 74.5 -&gt; 104✅, Kamara 37.5 -&gt; 83✅

Williams has also been one of the best RBs in football on Zone concept runs. He averages 5.19 yard per carry, with a 63.7% success rate which ranks 1st among RBs with 50+ carries. He ranks #1 in rate of man gap run rate in the NFL, accounting for 48% of his rushing attempts. Against man gap runs Carolina is allowing 5.8 yards per carry (30th) &amp; allowing a 1st down/TD on 35% of those carries. Carolina is also allowing 2.9 yards before contact on those runs, 31st in the NFL. Kyren is the #1 RB in the NFL in Run Success rate at 50.1%. The Panthers rank 27th in Rush EPA (-0.025) &amp; have allowed the 6th most rushing TD’s (20). 

They played just regular season meeting, the Rams had a 76% rushing success rate, averaging 0.53 EPA per rush — a 100th percentile performance.
The Rams averaged 3.05 yards before contact in the first matchup, as their inside run scheme is a nightmare matchup for the Panthers defense.

There’s a 75% chance of rains with 15 mph winds &amp; gusts up to 40 mph. Having had 3 turnovers last game vs the Panthers McVay is going to want to play it safe &amp; run the ball. The Rams are favored by 10 points. Panthers lost 3 of their last 4 games &amp; 4 of their last 6. The Rams rank #1 in offensive efficiency with the lowest offensive variance in the NFL, while having the #2 toughest schedule. 13 of their 17 games came were against teams with 8+ wins. Against non division playoff teams, Carolina is 2-5 with an avg score of 28-14. They scored 16 points or fewer in all but 1 of those games. All 5 losses came by double digits: 11, 16, 17, 29 &amp; 31 - while averaging just 10.2 points per game. Meanwhile, the Rams already have 8 wins by 14+ points. 

The Rams enter the playoffs as the league&#x27;s highest scoring offense &amp; have the 2nd highest point differential (+172). Carolina is 23rd in point differential (-69), &amp; the only team in the postseason this year with a negative scoring margin. The only other teams to ever have a worse point differential and make the postseason were the 2004 Rams (-73), 2011 Broncos (-81), and 2010 Seahawks (-97). Carolina hasn’t won a game by more than 3 points since October &amp; hasn’t won by more than 7 since September. The game will be Bryce Young&#x27;s 1st playoff game &amp; I&#x27;m not convinced he&#x27;ll be able to keep up the Rams&#x27; league best offense. The Rams have scored the most points per game (30.5), are 1st in DVOA, &amp; have the 2nd best Super Bowl odds. Since the Panthers upset vs the Rams they have averaged just 16 points in the final 4 games. The Rams averaged 36.8 points per game in their final 5 games. 

The Rams will run it down their throats with a big lead &amp; McVay is going to feed his RB1.

<tr><td class='post'>Freiburg @ 1.85 - €282.00

Last 5 &gt; WLWLW // Profit: €2,161.00

Hamburg are not bad, they just suck away from home this season. On the road HSV are last in the bundesliga with a 0-2-5 record. They barely score when traveling and concede alot (3:16). Away from home they are now on a 4 game losing streak.

Freiburg on the other hand are 3-3-1 at home and have a 14:9 goal diff. In their last 5 home games they are 2-3-0 in the Bundesliga and even 10 homes unbeaten in all competitions.

On the H2H side Freiburg hold the upper hand, although not recent, they are 5-4-1 in their last 10 meetings.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: NFL: Caleb Williams Over 1.5 Passing TD’s +112 (1U TO WIN 1.12U)**

Write up: NFL PLAYOFF TIME! - Model has this as the highest confident Edge % and EV % for the day. Will add some personal information in this write-up as well.

• ⁠Model has Williams throwing 2+ at 57% 

• Model projects 55% of the over hitting &amp; 57% over his passing yards 

• EV better betting 100$ = 8-11$ for this play

• Caleb Williams, the Bears vs Packers, what a first rounder we got here - In William’s last 5 games, this line has hit - he has over 1.5 TDS - Both matchups against Green Bay this year, he has thrown for 2 TDS on the dot - The last 4 home games of the season, he has also thrown 2+ - Packers have allowed 25 passing TDS this year, and I think this game will involve a lot of passing for either team to have a chance at the W - Packers secondary isn’t the best and I think the Bears will exploit that, giving Williams the opportunity to break out longer passes - With William’s form as of late, getting him a 2+ passing TD’s at + odds, is great value - Caleb Williams O1.5 Passing TDS is the play here

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Chelsea -1.5 (-110) 1.1 units to win 1 unit

**Write Up:** Sorry guys, we got very unlucky with lineups and they threw our guy on in the 88th minute. Going to avoid player props for these cup games for a bit.

Another FA cup match <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> as Premier Lesgue side Chelsea will travel to take on Championship (2nd tier) division Charlton. Charlton are currently 19th place in the Championship, not too far from the relegation zone. Their matches tend to be low scoring as they do not concede a ton of goals. They also dont score many, averaging exactly 1 per game. 

Chelsea will likely trot out a mostly 2nd team here to start, but they run a very deep sqaud. That 2nd team should be plenty to control this game. Many of their 2nd team have been playing in Champion&#x27;s League matches, gotten sub time in the EPL, and played in the EFL cup matches late last year. This will also be their first game under their new manager, and many of these players are fighting for 1st team time. I expect them to show out. If all else fails, Chelsea will sub on their big names at halftime to secure the win. 

BOL and have a great weekend!</td></tr>

Writeup: Thankfully, i trusted the bookies and went for a DNB, giving us a push. 

1st Leg - This match runs totals has hit in both the matches in this ground &amp; comfortably so. Unless there is rain or some great individual piece of bowling, expect this total to be easily met.

2nd leg - This is the first round of the tournament &amp; most favorites have got to good starts, not losing games &amp; also scoring (excluding the Iran SK game). I expect this game to have atleast 3 goals, but Thailand sometimes defends really well, so going a little careful with the over 2 asian, giving us money back for 2 goals.

Hope we get the W &amp; BoL

Al Nssr vs Al Qadsiah, Over 3.5 goals @ 1.9

This matchup strongly favors goals. Al Nassr’s attacking power and high pressing style usually lead to dominant performances, especially against weaker opposition. Al Qadsiah tend to struggle defensively and often allow many chances. Al Nassr are capable of scoring three or more goals on their own, and any contribution from the visitors only increases the value. With the game expected to be open and one-sided, over 3.5 goals looks like a solid and confident <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>.</td></tr>

**Last Five:** ❌❌✅❌❌

**Event:** Spanish Super Cup, Atletico Madrid v Real Madrid, 2:00 pm EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Atletico Madrid DNB +110, 1 unit

**Write Up:** We&#x27;re not leaving the Spanish Super Cup. *Perhaps I still haven&#x27;t learned my lesson but I&#x27;m once again fading an El Clasico team.* This time I&#x27;m betting against Real Madrid in their Madrid derby, simply because of the fact **Atletico are their bogey team.** It doesn&#x27;t matter how bad of a season Atletico are having, they&#x27;ll turn into prime AC Milan from the 90s and obliterate their rivals when the time is right. On the other hand, it doesn&#x27;t matter how good of a season they&#x27;re having, once they face Barcelona, they play like they haven&#x27;t seen a ball before. But they&#x27;re up against Real Madrid <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> so we&#x27;re good.

Real Madrid arrive into this fixure in decent form, but their results don&#x27;t show just how scrappy their wins truly were. Except for the Betis game, they looked pretty poor and struggled to break down defensive opponents, while being manhandled on the other end. They even struggled against 9-men Getafe. Atletico Madrid could cause them a lot of trouble with their compact defence and lots of physicality in the build-up play, as well as the final third (something the current Madrid defence seems to really struggle with). We saw how **they sailed to a 5-2 victory in their first clash this season,** and I really feel a similar showing from the Atleti <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Their **form** isn&#x27;t stellar, but it&#x27;s **good enough** not to give me any headaches ahead of this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. I still fully trust them to get it done.

Here are some fun stats for you: **Real Madrid have beaten Atletico in regulation time only once in their last seven meetings and have not kept a clean sheet against them since 2021.** Alongside **Kylian Mbappe,** Los Blancos will also be **missing** Eder Militao and Brahim Diaz, while Trent Alexander-Arnold and Dean Huijsen face late fitness tests. *Yes, Gonzalo balled out the last time he was trusted to start,* but this Atletico defence is built different and should keep him relatively quiet. Taking everything into consideration, this really gives me even more optimism for the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> at such odds. If you want to go down the BTTS Yes route, I don&#x27;t mind that either, but I&#x27;ve gone for the match outcome <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. I think it&#x27;s going to be a relatively low scoring game in which Atletico just about overcome their opponent, but just in case this goes into extra time, we have the DNB to bail us out. Going in with just the one standard unit to preserve my bankroll for the cup final, as well as the European club competitions once they&#x27;re back. BOL and let&#x27;s get ready for another banger ☘️🫡</td></tr>

**Tennis - ATP Hong Kong - Juncheng Shang ML** \[2U to win 1.33u (-150)\]

Time: 12:30 AM EST

Reasoning: 

Shang is in great form right now and I am high on him, beating Khachanov towards the end of last season. I watched that match and he was hitting lights out, lot of power and great movement. He&#x27;s been held back by injuries but at the start of the season coming out of a 2 month break I think he&#x27;s had enough time to rest up. He beat comesana in straight sets who&#x27;s decent. 

Sonego&#x27;s playstyle I don&#x27;t think matches up well against a heavy hitter and good mover in Shang. He&#x27;s also not as good on hard courts which is Shang&#x27;s strong suit. I got this at -118 when it first came out - lines dropped now but I think its still good value.</td></tr>

Thursday’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> - New York Islanders ML +104 (1u to win 1.04u)

We’re going back to the well here. The Islanders won on Tuesday 9-0 as their star goaltender made his return and shutout the Devils on 44 shots. I expect him to be out there tomorrow night against the Preds who have a sub .500 record at home and a -22 goal differential on the season.

It’s unclear who will be in goal for Nashville. Juuse Saros has played in their last 3 games and gave up 4, 3, and 6 goals in those games. Justus Annunen is their backup and he has managed to win his last 2 starts only giving up 2 goals and 1 goal in those starts. 

That being said, the Islanders will still have the better goalie matchup with Sorokin in goal, they are the better team on the season, and they are underdogs, despite being above .500 on the road 

Good Luck and let’s turn this ship around</td></tr>

Last Pick: Maria Sakkari 🇬🇷 O2.5 double faults vs Coco Gauff 🇺🇸 ❌

Event: WTA Brisbane 🎾

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Paula Badosa 🇪🇸 U6.5 double faults vs Elena Rybakina 🇰🇿 5 units to win 4U @1.80 (FanDuel)

Write-up: Great way to kick-start the year with a loss. That reminded me exactly why I’d stopped with the overs on double faults and I’ll be doing the exact same this year. To put it into context, I’m 6-6 on the overs and 16-5 for the unders on this thread so I should’ve known. Despite it seeming that Sakkari couldn’t miss a first serve all match she was dominated by Gauff who even had her forehand firing all match. As a result it was a shorter match than anticipated which reduced double faults probabilities by quite a bit, ending on one which came in the final game of the match.

Watching Badosa these days is really tough when you know just how good she can be as a player. The former world number 2 definitely has the level to be a top 5 player but her chronic back issues let her down time and time again so plays sporadically and often out of form. When she’s on though the Spaniard is unbelievable and showed it by reaching the AO semis last year. She’s facing the current number 5 Rybakina who is in the form of her life in my opinion, culminating in winning the WTA Finals last year. The former Wimbledon champ just seems unstoppable at the moment with her huge hitting being a real issue for opponents.

Anyways this line is simply priced wrong when you consider the game line is 20.5. It feels like the market has just used the fact she df’d 13 times last round but it was a match that featured 31 games so the raw data by itself doesn’t mean much (and is just one match). Badosa has averaged a 6% double fault rate over the past year on hard courts. Using both players’ serving/returning + ELO stats I get an estimated 4.3 double faults from the Spaniard across the 21 games (67 service points). That gives this play an approximate 84% chance of winning hence the unit size. I am quite worried that Badosa will walkover if things aren’t going her way (especially as she withdrew in doubles) but at the worst it’ll be push. Also will flag that their matches have been competitive, mostly going the distance (4-4 H2H) but this should be routine for Elena considering their polar opposite forms. BOL !

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Arsenal Over 1.5 Goals @ 1.63**

**Game: Arsenal vs Liverpool - Premier League**

**Time: 3:00 PM EST**

**Cannot emphasize how massive this game is tomorrow. Before <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> it was big, but with City dropping points for the third matchweek in a row, you can expect Arsenal to come absolutely guns blazing against Liverpool.**

Arsenal are currently unbeaten at home this season in all competitions, and anyone who has watched this side knows why. Whether it&#x27;s immense pressure off the rip or an eventual set-piece goal that unlocks the floodgates at some point, this Arsenal side will put your Goalkeeper into probably the most stressful 10-15 minute span of their career. When you couple this with the fact that Arsenal lost to Liverpool earlier this season, tomorrow is going to be their biggest get back yet.

These big games are what Arsenal live for, looking at 3-1 Bayern, 4-1 Aston Villa, 4-1 Tottenham, 4-1 Atletico Madrid. I&#x27;m expecting a similar scoreline with the stakes being at the best they&#x27;ve been for this side.

**Arsenal at home this season. 14 Games played**

* **13 wins, 1 draw, 0 losses**
* **Line has hit in 7/8 of their last Home games**
* **Scored 37 goals across those games, with an Average of 2.64 Goals scored per Home game**

**CFP - Ole Miss vs Miami, 7:30 pm EST, ESPN**

***Miami +7.5/Total u56.5 (-119) 1.5u***

The first of 5 football picks I’m firing on this week/weekend brings us to the Fiesta Bowl, as Miami takes on Ole Miss for a berth in the College Football Playoff final.

My combo prediction comes down to a trend I like that I expect to carry throughout the game. *Even though it’s manic to try and equate regular season college football to playoff college football*, finding the edge <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> comes down to finding what stands out the very most - and the **inconsistency in the Ole Miss coaching staff may end up their undoing**.

*It was announced yesterday that Charlie Weis Jr. and running backs coach Kevin Smith will coach against Miami*, **however Tight ends coach Joe Cox and wide receivers coach George McDonald are out** - as much as this may not seem like a big deal, **losing specialty coaches at any point of the season is a deterrent to success**, especially when they’re on the offensive end in college football specifically.

The main characters are pretty balanced - Miami QB Carson Beck **completes passes at a nation leading 75% rate**, and Miami rush the ball at a standard 4.1 YPA. Ole Miss QB Trinidad Chambliss isn’t too bad himself - *he’s only thrown 3 INTs* to Becks 10 this season. Their rush attack is more pronged and slightly better at 4.6 YPA.

Not many SEC teams have been able to stop Ole Miss, but they’ve not been able to keep most teams off the field, either. In fact, **Ole Miss allow opponents more time of possession, add that to the fact Miami average 33:32 of field time per game (5th in the country), in a playoff setting, this is where I lean** - Miami sets the tone: **Miami has hit the 1H Game Total Under in 13 of their last 14 games at 24.5 points**. The full game total we are playing here has **hit the under in all but 1 game** &amp; **Miami have covered +7.5 in every game this season.**

I believe Miami can stranglehold Ole Miss on both sides of the ball… Yes, *Ole Miss possess one of the most elite offensive units in college football*, but if they can’t get/stay on the field, it’ll be hard to show their cards, **especially if they end up in a situation where coaching matters**. Miami are way more comfortable in low scoring games as they’ve proven throughout the season, and especially the last couple of weeks.

**Previous:**  Manchester City ML vs Barcelona ML - LOSS

**Recap:**  Barcelona’s game went as expected, they crushed Athletic Club 5-0.  Meanwhile Manchester City’s game was going as expected up 1-0 at the half.  Then I saw it coming, they got sloppy again, complacent, and boom 1-1 equalizer.  “I will double down on this team (Man City) <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> for many reasons.” – yup I wrote it.  I was dead wrong, and now city may drop to be 8 points behind Arsenal if they win tomorrow.

**New Event:**  NCAAF – Miami Hurricanes vs Ole Miss

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:**  Ole Miss +3.5 @ 1.89 (Usual 3 units)

This is a much anticipated semifinal showdown between two teams that were not expected to be in this position at the beginning of the season, but have shown great resilience by knocking out top opponents and are a single win away from competing for a National Title.  This game is a tossup and should be a very close match, barring turnovers or mistakes.  If each team plays to their strengths, it should be a very close affair. 

Some data:

* Miami will have the best defense on the field, while Ole Miss will have the strongest offense.  This is the main battle that will determine the winner of this matchup.
* Miami was able to pressure Ohio State so well, that the QB did not have time to drop and throw the ball effectively and forced mistakes.  However, Ole Miss&#x27; QB Chambliss is perhaps the most athletic QB that Miami has faced all year and has been able to perform well against other elite defenses.
* If Chambliss can perform at the level he showed against Ohio State and Texas A&amp;M, then the edge will be on Ole Miss’ side in this one. 
* If Miami&#x27;s better defense cannot stop Chambliss from moving the ball downfield, then it will be forced into a shootout, where the over 52.5 comes into play.  I cannot ignore the possibility of that happening, but if this game becomes a high scoring affair then the edge lies with Ole Miss as they have the better offensive unit.

I will take the points with Ole Miss rather than lay them with Miami.  I feel safe with a field goal in my favor and the hook.  Worst case, Miami runs away with it should Chambliss get injured.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: NBL (Australian Basketball): South East Melbourne vs. Illawara Hawks South East -5 vs Illawara Hawks -115 (1.15U To Win 1U)**

 
Write up: A high flying offense returning home after a 3-game road streak, South East Melbourne comes into this game having game totals of 241 (scored 124), 207 (scored 111), 171 (scored 84), 185 (scored 107), and 152 (scored 77). They attempt the most field goals per game at 80.3, and make the most field goals per game at 34.6 which include a league high 12.5 3 pointers.

The recent return of Owen Foxwell to the lineup has also boosted this team&#x27;s offense. He has scored 8 points (on minutes restriction), 17, 17, and 16 points since recovering from his thigh injury.

On the other hand, Illawara has been fairly inconsistent throughout this season, sitting at an 8-13 record. They managed to blow out a bottom of the league Cairns side but are 1-4 in their last away games. Stats wise Illawara are on the complete opposite spectrum as their counterparts ranking 6th in PPG, 10th in 3PA, and 9th in 3FGM. 

Looking at h2h, Illawara did manage to win a thriller at home against Melbourne where they scored 21 more 2-pointers than South East but only squeaked out a 4-point win. Their last away game vs Melbourne was a 116-76 blowout loss. 

All in all, expect this South East wagon to continue rolling, once they get out to an early lead and shots start falling, I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll look back and will cruise to a comfortable win.

**Write Up:** Well, that&#x27;s just how soccer goes sometimes. Unfortunate that Chelsea had an early 22&#x27; red card that changed the game and really spoiled our chances. Enzo was looking promising before that as well. Nothing we can really do about that, we move onward. 

Big match <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> as Arsenal hosts Liverpool. Liverpool are unbeaten for 9 matches, Arsenal unbeaten in 7. There is a lot of drama/bad blood here as people are already crowning Arsenal the EPL champs, while Liverpool are obviously the defending champions. Szoboszlai had an interesting interview earlier in the week, essentially stating that Arsenal haven&#x27;t won&#x27;t anything yet and it&#x27;s only January. Liverpool is going to come to play. 

Szoboszlai is a midfielder for Liverpool who has been shifting around positionally like many Liverpool players have lately. Since Salah left the starting lineup, he has taken penalties, played further forward, and looked really good for Liverpool. This has hit in 7 of his last 11 matches and he has had 9 SOTs in those 11 matches. Arsenal do not give up a lot of SOTs, but with Szoboszlai in his current form and the drama floating around this potential &quot;passing of the torch game&quot; I like him to show up and land an SOT <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. He also scored a goal in the reverse fixture at the start of the season.

They now meet in the Semi’s with the winner facing Indiana/Oregon in the National Championship in Miami. #10 Miami (12-2) faced #6 Texas A&amp;M (11-1) in the 1st rd, winning the game 10-3, after RB Mark Fletcher torched them for 172 rushing yards on 17 carries &amp; their defense was also elite with 3 turnovers, allowing just 4.3 yards per play. They then faced defending champs #2 Ohio State (12-1) next rd &amp; were once again dominant on defense. They intercepted OSU QB Julian Sayin twice, with a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> 6 on the way to a 24-14 win. They made history as the 1st double digit seed to make the semi’s in the expanded playoff &amp; now face a red hot Ole Miss team that is riding into the game on a 7 game win streak with just 1 loss this season. #6 Ole Miss took on #11 Tulane (11-2) at home, destroying them 41-10 despite giving up 421 yards. Next rd was a rematch with their only loss this season vs #3 UGA (12-1). Ole Miss came out on top after a game winning FG with 6 seconds left. Ole Miss has now won 2 games without their head coach Lane Kiffin, who left the school after the regular season for a new job at LSU. On his way to LSU he brought all his assistants. With the transfer portal in full swing they’ve been splitting time between LSU/Ole Miss despite the massive upcoming game vs Miami. It’s been confirmed that their OC Charlie Weiss Jr will be calling plays. But we do know Miami doesn’t have these problems &amp; has a coaching staff fully committed to prepping for Ole Miss. A huge part of the game plan will be running the ball down Ole Miss’s throats. No one ran more times on Ole Miss than UGA did their first game this season, rushing 49 times for 221 yards. But the 2nd time, UGA OC Mike Bobo abandoned the run despite UGA RB Nate Frazier avg 5.7 ypc. It didn&#x27;t work. Miami did the opposite in their 2 games. Miami controlled the clock for over 33 minutes vs OSU. Miami’s offense is built around a dominant beastly OL. They control possessions &amp; pound opposing DL’s. The way to beat Ole Miss is on the ground, Miami spent the last 2 games showing they can do that.

Miami RB Mark Fletcher has been an animal this playoffs. Fletcher has racked up 262 yards on 36 carries in 2 games. After rushing for 172 yards vs A&amp;M in the 1st rd, he followed it up with 90 yards vs OSU, one of the best run defenses in the nation. He became the 1st player to run for 90 yards on OSU since 11/30/2024. OSU&#x27;s defense ranked #4 in opponent adjusted yards after contact, #8 in explosive run defense, &amp; top 5 in rushing yards allowed. Miami became the first team all season to score 16+ points on OSU. Now he faces an Ole Miss D that has given up 80+ rushing yards to 3 straight RB’s &amp; 167 rushing ypg in their last 3. That’s more than DOUBLE what OSU allowed per game all season (84.1 ypg). Ole Miss ranks 132nd in EPA per rush, 130th in rushing success rate allowed, &amp; 117th in explosive run rate allowed. They allow 3+ yards before contact to RB’s on 29% of attempts (ranked 94th). Their run D ranks 116th in yards before contact allowed. Fletcher is one of the hardest RB’s in the NCAA to tackle with a total of 50 missed tackles forced on the season &amp; is coming off a game where he forced 5 missed tackles (2nd most this year) vs OSU who is one of the best tackling teams in the country. A ton of his success should be credited to Miami’s OL. They rank 1st in pass blocking &amp; 16th in run blocking, &amp; also #1 in the country in pressure rate allowed. Miami’s QB Carson Beck runs an offense that utilizes traditional dropbacks (3+ steps). Beck takes a traditional dropback 56% of the time. He gets rid of the football in 2.35 seconds, 3rd fastest in NCAA. Miami leads the nation in pressure rate allowed at just 25% in traditional dropbacks, while Ole Miss defense that ranks 46th by the same metric. Beck limits pressure by making quick passes. 57% of his passes go less than 5 yards (7th highest rate). On those Beck averages 6.7 yards per pass (7th). Ole Miss allows 5.5 yards per pass on throws under 5 yds, ranked 77th. Ole Miss also has a horrible problem tackling receivers. They allow a broken tackle once every 4.5 rec (109th). Miami WR’s rank 18th in missed tackles forced. The key to Miami winning this game will be to keep the ball in their hands &amp; slow the tempo down. Miami ranks 98th in offensive plays per game. While Ole Miss runs the 6th most plays per game. Ole Miss has a high powered offense led by stud QB Trinidad Chambliss. The best way to defend him is to keep him on the sideline &amp; run the ball.

Ole Miss OC Charlie Weis Jr. runs a fast paced, pass heavy offense. He’ll face a Miami D that has given up just 17 points in the playoffs to 2 teams that both ranked top 20 in ppg averaging 32+. Miami allows just 13.8 ppg (4th). Their defense has the best DL in the nation. In 2 Playoff games, they had 12 sacks &amp; 16 tackles for loss, against 2 of the best OL’s. They generated an insane 50% pressure rate against OSU. They rank 2nd in pressure rate generated in the NCAA. Chambliss is an athletic QB suited for pressure. He ran circles around the UGA defense. Miami already faced an athletic playmaker this playoffs in A&amp;M&#x27;s Marcel Reed, sacking him 7 times. Ole Miss uses quick drop backs 56% of the time (6th highest). This is where UGA struggled as they ranked 106th in yards per pass vs quick dropbacks. Miami is much better allowing just 5.7 yards per pass against quick dropbacks (24th). Chambliss takes a traditional dropback on 36% of passes. Against traditionals, Miami is generating a 54% pressure rate (2nd), while Ole Miss allows a 38% pressure rate (30th). One of the ways to force Ole Miss into traditional dropbacks will be to force 3rd &amp; longs as that’s when Chambliss’ traditional dropback rate jumps to 65%. Miami’s defense ranks 14th in the NCAA in forcing 3rd &amp; longs. Only 26% of all drives against the Miami defense this season have gained a 1st down inside the Miami 40 or scored on an explosive play. As for their ground game, Miami is hard to run on which will be tough for Ole Miss star RB Kewan Lacy who is already coming into the game banged up. Miami has allowed just 83.4 rushing yards per game (4th) &amp; just held Ohio State RB’s to 45 yards. Ole Miss has a 57.4 run blocking grade (85th) &amp; they only average 1.6 yards before contact per carry. Miami ranks 13th in the country with only 1.1 rushing yards before contact allowed. Miami holds the advantages on offense &amp; defense.

Miami will run it down their throats &amp; maintain possession. Fletcher will run for 90+ yards.

Sport: Tennis 🎾

Event: ATP Brisbane

Match: Dimitrov vs Collignon

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Dimitrov -2,5 games @ 1,81**





Collignon had really nice indoor season to end 2025., made a breakthrough and continues in the same fashion at the start of 2026. He has won two Q matches and decent Shapovalov in R1 here without losing a set. He played good against Shapovalov, made early breaks in both sets, but Canadian is know for his erratic tennis and is prone to errors. Collignon strong suit is his consistency, and when playing good tennis against, obviously, out of form Shapovalov, there is only one way it can end. However, Dimitrov is a different story. Dimitrov won easily against Carreno-Busta a couple days ago when we had him to cover spread, looked physically ready and playing solid tennis. He is able to cope with Collignons&#x27; depth and long rallies and if we consider pure tennis quality he is still miles ahead. As I said a couple days ago season has just started and if there is time Dimitrov shouldn&#x27;t have too much problems with his body, it is now. Odds obviously take into consideration that Dimitrov didn&#x27;t play a lot of tennis last months and Belgian has been solid in this period, but quality difference is still the main factor for me and it&#x27;s wider than odds suggest.

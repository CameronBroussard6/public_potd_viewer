**Event: NCAAM: UNCW @ Northeastern 7pm EST**

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: UNCW -4.5 @ -1.91 (-110)**

For my first-ever <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>, I am going with a meaningful one-- my Alma Mater.  The Seahawks (14-2) enter this matchup as the clear superior side, and the numbers back it up.  They have been one of the CAA’s most consistent teams this season, rolling through conference play.  Conversely, Northeastern (5-9) has struggled to find rhythm on either end of the floor lately.

UNCW owns the edge in overall record, offensive efficiency, and H2H.  They score more consistently, rebound better, and tend to close games with discipline, while Northeastern has shown issues keeping pace offensively and protecting late possessions.  Even if this game stays close, watch for UNCW to gain momentum in the last minutes and pull away.  Northeastern has lost 4 of their last 5 games, and have given up at least 85 points in each of those losses.  Look for the Seahawks to exploit those defensive inefficiencies and comfortably cover this marginal 4.5-point spread.

BOL and Go Seahawks!!!  🌊🦅</td></tr>

The line has changed from +110 to -140 from the last time I made this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> 2 days ago so Vegas is getting it. Nylander is still out for the Leafs and Auston seems to shoot more with him out of the lineup. Since his absence, Auston has hit that line 5 games in a row and he scored 7 goals. His teammates know that he&#x27;s on fire and will feed him the puck especially against a Flyers team that is pretty good this year. He also hit that line last time they played the Flyers with 5 shots without Nylander in the lineup.

Last POTD: 🏈 Tony Pollard under 67.5 rushing yards (-114) 💰

Writeup: Great call by us, in that many of the bets based on incentives that weren’t practically guaranteed to hit, did not hit. Pollard was one of many and had his usual performance of 48 rushing yards in an absolute blowout.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: 🏈 Miami +7.5 + Under 59.5 total points (-135).

Game starts at 7:30pm EST. Bet 3.25u

Writeup: I like Miami straightup and I like the under straightup, but I think both will be close. So we’ll take 2 different alt spreads and parlay them. 

Let’s start with Miami. The Hurricanes are averaging 31.6 points this season thanks to Carson Beck being one of the most consistent QBs in the league, throwing with 74.4% accuracy. The big story of their offense right now is RB Mark Fletcher, who’s been so dominant this postseason that the Canes offense has barely gone over 100 passing yards in both games this postseason. They don’t even need to pass to take care of teams ranked better than them. He’s rushed for over 250 yards in the past 2 games. Only 90 came from the second game, but this was far more impressive against an incredibly stingy OSU run defense. Ole Miss’s rush defense ranks outside of the top 100 in many different key statistics, so I expect Miami to once again find a lot of success on the ground. With more time on the ground, the clock will continue to run, leading to less chances to score.

On the flip side, Miami’s defense is an absolute unit in its own right, with many thanks going to edge rusher Rueben Bain Jr. They only give up 13.1 points per game and held OSU to just 14 points in their last game. They are facing an Ole Miss offense who have been lighting up the scoreboard this season, averaging 37.6 points per game with a very pass-heavy attack. The big question will be if the Miami front 7 can get pressure on the QB, and I think they can. This Miami defense has gotten 12 sacks and even more tackles for a loss in their past 2 games, with both opponents having very good offensive lines. At worst, I’d call this an even matchup.

I expect this to be a constant run script for the Canes offense, while their defense hopes to get continuous pressure on the quarterback. If Ole Miss is able to find some success, I think Miami’s defense and rushing offense is too good to get blown out in this one. The Canes should win this one, but at worst, I think Miami loses by less than a touchdown with a total under 8 touchdowns plus a field goal.

Remember to only bet what you can afford to lose, and BOL!</td></tr>

Both North Alabama and Eastern Kentucky play at above-average tempos and are comfortable pushing possessions.

With elevated pace, increased shot volume, and neither defense built to consistently control tempo, this number sits below my projected total, creating value on the over.</td></tr>

**🏀 Nikola Jovic o8.5 Points -121** vs the Chicago Bulls

This line has dropped heavily despite his recent minutes and FGA. Herro is getting healthier but I don&#x27;t see that putting him under 25 min or 8 FGA to easily hit this line.

He has cashed in L6/7, scoring 13.8 points over 26 min/game in his L5. In his only game vs the Bulls last season, he scored 20 points (though on 36 min).

Bulls are sporting an awful defense per usual. 25th in Defensive Rating, and more applicably 30th in Points allowed to PFs.

Lastly, always great with Heat props are their pace. Third fastest paced team in the NBA leads to more possessions. Bulls are quite fast at 13th as well, leading to a 237.5 over/under.

Reasoning: AC Milan generate well over 2.0 xG per home game and Genoa average around 1.0–1.3 xG away, so the combined expected-goals baseline sits comfortably above three. Even with conservative game-management assumptions, both sides still create enough chances that two goals doesn’t kill the bet and a third arrives more often than the market price implies which shows a decent edge.

Event: CBB | North Dakota State @ UMKC (8 pm EST) | 🏀

*Recap: I felt great when I saw the Belmont starting point guard not playing. Then Jack Freaking Smiley happened. Dude comes off the bench and scores a career-high 19 points, including a personal 8-0 run in less than two minutes of the first half. Belmont knocked down six 3s in the first half and the under was essentially dead just eight minutes into the game, when the Bruins led 22-10. They got 36 by the half. Belmont was its usual better-in-the-second-half selves and took a big road win against Northern Iowa. Let&#x27;s get back on the good side of the ledger.*

Don&#x27;t look at the records. UMKC (4-12) has played the 66th-toughest non-conference schedule according to KenPom. For comparison, North Dakota State&#x27;s strength of schedule ranks 221st. But that disparity is about the only thing UMKC has going for it. NDSU (12-5) leads the Summit League in rebounding and the Bison rank 27th in the nation in turnover margin (+3.9). These guys protect the ball and clean the glass, which I believe are the key ingredient for pulling away and protecting a double-digit spread. UMKC is 1-10 when they get outrebounded, but the question isn&#x27;t money line. It&#x27;s the spread. So how is NDSU going to jump out in front? Shooting!!

First, opponents are shooting lights out against UMKC. The Roos (cute nickname for a team from Missouri, no?) are allowing 47.8 percent, which ranks 327th in the NCAA. NDSU already makes 45.7 percent from the field. If they hit their season average and then some, I don&#x27;t see how UMKC keeps this game within three possessions. Second, UMKC *can&#x27;t* shoot *or* score. They&#x27;re making just 41.9 percent from the field (316th) and scoring 71.8 per game (295th). Meanwhile, their KenPom offensive rating is 352nd. It doesn&#x27;t get much worse on offense, even if you account for the tough slate they&#x27;ve played. If NDSU jumps out big, don&#x27;t expect UMKC to play catch-up. The Roos are only getting 6.3 3-pointers per game (313th). Nothing about their offense scares me.

NDSU has a five-game winning streak against UMKC. Here are the spreads in those games, starting with the most recent matchup: 6, 7, 4 (OT), 1 (2OT), 11. Even though these teams have been playing tight games - only two of the previous 10 games have gone over a 10-point spread - the continuity chasm from last year this season couldn&#x27;t be bigger. UMKC has zero starters and only two scholarship players back from last season. NDSU returns two starters and six scholarship players. This is fundamentally not the same UMKC squad that has played NDSU tight. Therefore, I can only go with the eyeball test - and so far, it&#x27;s shown that UMKC can&#x27;t keep up with teams.  UMKC is 5-8 against the spread, including 1-2 at home. The only caution here is they&#x27;re 4-1 ATS over the last five games. And when they&#x27;re favorited, NDSU is 5-4 ATS. Therefore, laying the points tonight is partly a bet on NDSU chemistry against a UMKC that at times looks like a pickup squad still trying to learn each other&#x27;s tendencies.

Good luck and Godspeed!</td></tr>

**Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** CBB - Iowa St. -4.5 vs Baylor - CHACHING

**Event:** NCAAB Saint Francis @ Wagner

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Wagner -7.5

**Write Up:** Tonight&#x27;s matchup between Wagner (6-7, 1-1 NEC) and Saint Francis (3-12, 1-1 NEC) at the Spiro Athletic Center leans heavily in favor of the Seahawks. While both teams are currently tied in conference play, the statistical profile suggests Wagner has a clear path to victory.

Here is why Wagner is the favorite to win tonight, based on the 2025-26 season data:

1. Defensive Dominance vs. Offensive Struggles

The biggest mismatch in this game is Wagner’s defense against the Saint Francis offense.

Field Goal Percentage Defense: Wagner ranks 81st nationally, holding opponents to just 41.3% shooting from the floor.

SFU’s Shooting Woes: Saint Francis has struggled significantly to score all season, shooting only 41.1% as a team (ranked 338th). Against a disciplined Wagner defense, the Red Flash will find it difficult to manufacture easy baskets.

Points Allowed: Saint Francis is giving up a staggering 83.7 points per game (348th in D1), while Wagner is much more competitive defensively, holding teams to roughly 75 PPG despite a faster pace of play.

2. The Battle of the Boards

Wagner has a distinct physical advantage in the paint that should allow them to control the tempo.

Rebounding Margin: Wagner is a top-50 rebounding team, averaging 39.9 boards per game. They currently hold a +5.1 rebounding margin over their opponents.

SFU’s Lack of Size: In contrast, Saint Francis is getting out-rebounded by nearly 4 boards per game. Wagner’s Zavier Fitch (6.7 rpg) and Binael Basil (5.3 rpg) are expected to dominate the glass, limiting SFU to &quot;one-and-done&quot; possessions.

3. Home Court &amp; Road Woes

The venue plays a massive role in this handicap:

Wagner at Home: The Seahawks are 4-1 at the Spiro Athletic Center this season. They play with much more efficiency and defensive intensity in front of their home crowd.

SFU on the Road: The Red Flash have yet to win a road game this season, sitting at 0-7 away from home. Historically, they have also struggled at Wagner, having not won at the Spiro Center since the 2022-23 season.</td></tr>

Kacper is on a bit of a run here as he&#x27;s currently facing off against the guy I picked against yesterday (nice win!), but given these guys all play each other its good to get a grip on things. Jusek lost 0-3 multiple times over the last few games, including to the guy that Kacper just beat an hour or so again. 

I really can&#x27;t see Juzek keeping this close as his form has been garbage recently, only getting lucky in a few 3-5 setters where his opponent double faulted while holding serve.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: (NCAAF) Miami Hurricanes ML vs Ole Miss Rebels (-158) (7:30 PM EST)**

Reasoning: There’s a lot of hype behind the 13-1 Ole Miss and Chambliss especially coming off that win against Georgia however I believe 12-2 Miami Hurricanes remains the better team and here’s why: Miami has gone up against better defenses in this CPB in A&amp;M and Ohio State and won 2x as dogs. On the other hand, Ole Miss beat Tulane and Georgia but let’s dive a little deeper into the Georgia victory. Georgia’s defense aren’t as good as they are accustomed to being. In fact, Ole Miss put up 35 points in 3 quarters earlier into the season vs them. But what really makes this play standout for me is sack %. Georgia QB Trinidad Chambliss had his way against Georgia last week but Georgia’s defense ranked 124 out of 136 teams in sack percentage. To put that into perspective, Miami Hurricanes rank 7th. Might not be so easy <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> for Chambliss. Miami’s defense allow only 13.1 points per game and have held their last two playoff opponents (Texas A&amp;M and Ohio State) to 17 points combined. It’s also worth noting that SEC teams have struggled this bowl season. I also see a lot of people downplaying this Miami offense after scoring just 24 and 10 points their two playoff games but keep in mind, they faced great defenses. Looking into advanced stats such as yards PPA, Ole Miss rank 8th, while Miami is 20th so the discrepancy in offense isn’t much. So with noise behind Ole Miss and this high powered offense, I’m leaning Miami to win this game as they have the more experienced coach, coaching staff and a better defense. Line has moved in favored of the Canes as well.

Last pick: NO/Atl u247 (-110)💰

Utah Jazz +7 (-105)

Background: I leveraged the book “Statistical Sports Models in Excel” by Andrew Mack to build a few NBA and NFL models. Each day (or week for NFL), I pull in the latest results to update the models, then make selections mainly based on the delta between my models and the current spread and the % of tickets and money coming in on each side. One thing to note, these models don’t factor in specific players so I also manually consider things like injuries in decisions.

The good: All four of my models have Utah winning, with the average being by 4 points, which equates to a 78% chance the Jazz cover the +7. 

The bad: ~75% of tickets are on this side, as well as 81% of the money which gives me hesitancy (I prefer being on the ‘Vegas’ side of lines rather than the public); additionally Jazz played in an OT game last night against OKC so there will likely be some tired legs.</td></tr>

Explanation: The Saudi league is always high-scoring, especially when Al-Nassr play with star player Ronaldo.

In general, he and João have always been reliable for goals. The bookmakers themselves set the line at 3.5 goals for this match. I personally see it in the same range, around 3–4 goals, with Al-Nassr as the clear favorite.

When it comes to goal distribution, Ronaldo will certainly be involved, but in my opinion his odds are not worth it. After the recent home defeat, I definitely see the edge here with the home team, who are also in good form. With winter in Europe, it definitely makes sense to take a look at the warmer region.

Reasoning: Arsenal come into this match in strong form and at home they’ve been ruthless, especially against top sides where they control the tempo and press high from the first minute. Liverpool have quality going forward, but they’ve shown vulnerability defensively this season, particularly when facing teams that attack with pace and width. I expect Arsenal to dominate large spells of the game, create more clear chances, and put Liverpool under constant pressure. With the current momentum and home advantage, a convincing win is very realistic, which makes the -1 line strong value here.

Good Luck! ✌️</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: PSG win &amp; Arsenal to score @ 1.74 odds

Write Up: PSG sit at 2nd place in Ligue 1 (12W3D2L, 37:15) while Marseille are 3rd (10W2D5L). This is the Trophee des Champions, but Ligue 1 stats are still relevant. Anyways. Last time these two teams mets, Marseille won 1-0. However, then, Marseille was at home (this one is at a neutral venue) and PSG had a lot of missing players, the squad is fuller now. Before that, PSG had won the last 5 H2H. I think PSG will pull this one through. 

Arsenal is the top team in the premier league with 40 goals scored, Liverpool has conceded 28 goals. I just think Arsenal to score is a relatively safe odds booster. You can skip it if you feel better taking just PSG to win at 1.51. BOL!</td></tr>

**Odds:** 1.95 | -105 | 4 units to win 3.8

**Write up**: the sens are  gonna be skating in quicksand tonight. they just got dusted by utah last night, chasing the puck for 60 mins and now they are going to mile high city for a b2b against the best team in the nhl. avs have been resting since tuesday giving nate and the boys time to rest the legs. this is the definition of schedule loss for ottawa. avs barn is a fortress where they are undefeated in regulation (17-0-2) and catching a rested colorado squad on b2b is a nightmare for sens. I expect avs to push hard early, expose the sens heavy legs and lead them before the first intermision.

golie matchup is the biggest reason this spread covers. wedgewood has been standing on his head for the avs with 2.17 gaa and .918 sv%, basically stealing games even when the avs top line take a shift off. meanwhile the sens are forced to roll out sogaard because merilainen got the start in utah. he has holes in his game. big holes. were talking a career 3.64 gaa and a .880 savve%. against the highest volume shooting team in the league (nearly 35 shots on net per night),  soggard is bound to get lit up like a christmas tree. the analytics on high danger save percentage for sogaard suggest that if colorado generates their average xg (expected goals), this is a 5-2 or 6-2 blowout waiting to happen. 

sens pk is absolute trash. dead last in the league at 71.4%. Even if avs PP isn&#x27;t clicking to their max potential right now(its around 16%, 26th in the leaugue), they are gonna score on the worst PK if they have the chance. The 16% for avs team on the PP is an anomaly for that kind of team and its due for progression.  especially when sens PK  killers are slow to close gaps because of the travel fatigue. on the oither hand, avs pk is #1 in the league (85.7%), completely neutralizing the one weapon the sens actually have (their PP). mackinnon is angry and hungry right now. We could seen that in the last game against in tampa, in the last mintues where he was clearly frustrated with the result and his plays. and an angry natedogg is a terrifying thing for a visiting defense ( if anyone is gonna watch tonights game, youll see what i mean. that guy is just an absolute beast when he starts to get frustrated). hes gone two games without a point despite pumping  10 shots on net, which for a guy leading the rocket race means positive regression is coming. hes putting up 4.57 shots per game. plus with toews out, makar is playing massive minutes, basically quarterbacking the entire game from the back end. the sens defense allows way too many controlled entries and against the avs speed through the neutral zone. 

history shows that the avs have absolutely owned the sens, winning the last 9 matchups out of 10 and covering the puck line in 7 of them. Thius game is about favorable matchups across every single metric. we fade tired, traveling team with a third string golie in net against a rested juggernaut looking to bounce back from a loss to tampa.

Another 3U bet and I am in full confidence this will be the turnaround. Not going to lose 5 in a row to start the year 

Al Hilal are up against newly promoted side Al Hazm who have been okay this season but have failed to get any result agsinst the top teams in the league 

Al Hilal is firing on all fronts and want a clean win seeing as they are up against Al Nassr next 

Speaking about Al Nassr, they haven&#x27;t won their last 2 away games but are flawless in their home games. 100% winrate 

They want the same confidence Al Hilal has before they travel for that away game. They can&#x27;t afford a slip up and will be extremely motivated to get the win

Especially considering Al Qadsiah is not convincing at all away from home

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Bam Adebayo over 13.5 Points, $1.72 Odds.**

Bam Adebayo to score Over 13.5 Points is a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> that had me on the fence, however im taking it due to the fact that his previous matchups were actually quite hard. Playing PF against the wolves meaning Gobert and Randle will lock you up. And the match before that being against the Pelicans was actually bait, as Zion was guarding Bam Adebayo, plus Norman Powell was popping off and he played below 30 minutes at 29 as it was somewhat of a blow out. However I think that Bam should get enough looks against the Bulls as their top 5 in Pace, as well as the fact that Matas Buzelis will be playing PF and is nowhere near strong enough to stop Bam Adebayo, due to height and size. Last time they played Bam had 18 Points and went to the charity stripe with 8-10 FTs. Matas only played 19 minutes and Patrick Williams likely went on to guard him and if it was Jalen Smith he was concussed recently and is questionable so even if he does play im not sure if he&#x27;s 100 percent ready due to Zach being out. This was said due to the fact that with all the injuries its likely Matas will be forced to continue to play PF unless he moves to SF which is unlikely with Issac Okoro being healthy. But the Bulls are number 1 with allowing restricted area attempts at 31.3 attempts a game and it jumps to more as if it&#x27;s within less than 8 feet it jumps to 41.3 attempts which is where Bam mainly does damage.

The only issues/con is ball distribution as Tyler Herro is back (most likely off the bench again tho) and potentially a blow out however I think with Bulls being at home and the Pace they play, we should see 30 minutes from Bam hopefully. Kel Ware could also end up being the one scoring.</td></tr>

**Write-up:**  
Backing Arsenal at home here. They’ve been very strong at the Emirates this season and usually rise for big games like this. Their pressing and control in midfield has been a problem for most teams, and they don’t give away many cheap chances at home.

Liverpool are always dangerous going forward, but they’ve been less reliable defensively, especially away from Anfield. If Arsenal can control the tempo early and avoid getting caught in transition, this sets up well for them.

Not expecting an easy 90 minutes, but Arsenal at home at these odds feels like the right side.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>**: Cagliari DNB @2.2

**Write Up**: Stoppable force versus movable object here. Neither are high scoring and neither have great underlying stats. But Cremonese are notable in that they are the biggest xG overperformers in Italy and that by the underlying stats, they should be rock bottom with zero wins. Contrasted with Cagliari who &#x27;deserve&#x27; their 14th position. Creomonese may have hit a wall where the number start catching up with them as they have no goals in their last four while Cagliari have still been scoring and being competitive against bigger sides like Juve, Milan and Atalanta. I think the smart money is for Cagliari here as this match could go any way but the numbers have shown Cagliari to be the better team. Taking them DNB nulls a lot of the risk of this ending as a miserable draw.

Southern Miss&#x27; core duo are both 6&#x27;7 and strong, and against a Texas state team that shoots the closest to the basket in all of NCAAB, they should struggle to get easy efficient layups.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Edmonton Oilers ML @ Winnipeg Jets (-115 on BET365 at time of posting), 1U for 1.87U.**

**Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> recap:** Pretty much exactly as expected, Habs jump out to a 3-0 lead in the 2nd (Early Payout from 365!) and cruise to an easy 4-1 win. Kudos if you followed Bonus picks, as Texier (1st 3pt night), Hutson and Kapanen all scored. Onwards and upwards!

**Write Up:** Sticking with an all-Canadian matchup, I&#x27;m picking the Oilers to defeat the Jets. There are a few obvious reasons this should be a straight-forward win. Edmonton (2nd Pacific) comes in having shelled Nashville with 43 shots in a 6-2 win Tuesday, whereas Winnipeg (last NHL) just lost 4-3 in OT to Vegas, extending their winless streak to 10 games and mustering only 20 shots of their own. Edmonton also has the best power-play in the league at 33.9% to Winnipeg&#x27;s 19th-ranked 18.8%. Furthermore, the Oilers have won the last 3 and 5 of the last 7 H2H.

Ultimately though, it&#x27;s about trajectory. Edmonton is looking to keep pace in a competitive Pacific division going 6-4-0 L10 while Winnipeg is simply trying to figure out how to win a game. I certainly don&#x27;t expect it to be a walk: this rivalry tends to bring a competitive edge and sandpaper that may help Winnipeg, but ultimately, they simply don&#x27;t have the class to keep up with Connor McDavid and Co. The Over at 6.0 is also appealing as neither side has particularly good goaltending, but as with the Habs-Flames game <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, goalies step-up when provincial pride is at stake.

**Injuries**: Edmonton will be without Adam Henrique, placed on injured reserve Wednesday through the Olympics, and Jake Walman hasn&#x27;t yet been cleared, should be back next week. Winnipeg D-man Haydn Fleury was stretchered off the ice Tuesday, but the injuries aren&#x27;t as severe as initially believed, but he&#x27;s out as well.

**Prop Bonus:** McDavid had 3G and 10 SOG last game, and Leon Draisaitl is also hard to keep off the scoresheet. On the other end of the ice, Kyle Connor has 8pts (5G3A) over his last 7 games, only held off the scoresheet twice (though one of those was against these same Oilers). Jets captain Mark Scheifele was also held scoreless in that last Edmonton game, but has at least 1 point in his previous 9 matchups against the Oilers.

Todays <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: **Atl Madrid v Real Madrid: BTTS &amp; o2.5 goals @1.85**

Atlético Madrid vs Real Madrid is a fixture that almost always delivers, and their recent meetings are a big reason why goals feel likely again here. These two know each other inside out, but familiarity has never meant caution. When they meet, games tend to open up rather than tighten.

The last time they faced off, Atlético made a real statement, putting five past Real in a chaotic 5–2 win. It was one of those derbies where the structure disappeared early and both sides just kept attacking. That result alone shows how unpredictable and goal-heavy this matchup can be. Even beyond that game, recent derbies have consistently seen both teams on the scoresheet, with results like 2–1 and 1–1 cropping up regularly.

Real Madrid have actually struggled to fully control this fixture in normal time over the past couple of seasons. Wins have been hard to come by, clean sheets even harder. Atlético always seem to find a way to score against them, whether it is through quick transitions, set pieces, or sheer pressure in big moments. On the other side, Real rarely fail to create chances in games of this magnitude, especially with the attacking quality they bring into finals and semi finals.

With both teams coming in confident and in strong form, it is hard to see either sitting back. A Super Cup semi final encourages risk, not caution, and history suggests this derby usually rewards that approach. Goals at both ends feel likely again, and with the tempo these games normally have, pushing past two and a half goals makes sense.

BTTS and Over 2.5 goals is the way I am playing it.

Best of luck.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Cremonese Vs Cagliari - **Cremonese or Draw (Double Chance)+Under 3.5 Total Goals @ 1.67 (Melbet)**

**Write Up:** Cremonese and Cagliari come into this match in similar situations, with both teams struggling near the bottom of the table. Neither side is in great form, but both are organised enough to suggest this could be another tight and cautious game. Cremonese have been good at keeping matches close, even when results haven’t gone their way. Four of their last five games have seen fewer than two goals, including narrow 1–0 losses to Fiorentina and Torino, and a goalless draw away at Lazio. This shows they are defensively solid, but they continue to struggle to create chances and score goals.

After a promising start together, strike partners Jamie Vardy and Federico Bonazzoli have struggled to find the net, and Cremonese now risk going five straight Serie A matches without scoring for the first time. Results at home haven’t been great either, with three defeats in their last four matches in Cremona. That said, history does offer a small positive. Cremonese have won their last three top-flight home meetings against Cagliari, scoring eight goals along the way. While this comes from a different era and squad, it’s still a detail worth noting. Cagliari come into this match with mixed results, but they have shown slightly more attacking threat than Cremonese. They picked up a 2–1 away win at Torino and followed that with a 2–2 draw at home against Pisa. Those positives are balanced out by narrow losses to AC Milan and Atalanta, where they were beaten 1–0 and 2–1.

Away from home, Cagliari often struggle to control games for long periods. They conceded twice against Atalanta and, even in their win at Torino, allowed the hosts plenty of space. Defensively, they have conceded 25 goals in 18 matches, which is among the weaker records in this part of the table. Still, they remain competitive as four of their last five games were either decided by a single goal or ended in a draw. That keeps them in matches, but it rarely allows them to set the pace.

Both teams are used to playing in low-scoring matches. Cremonese, in particular, have seen four of their last five games finish with very few goals, while Cagliari rarely get involved in open or high-tempo contests when playing away from home. Neither side shows the attacking volume or efficiency needed to turn games into goal-heavy affairs.

The numbers back this up. Over 2.5 goals hasn’t been seen in any of Cremonese’s last five matches, in most of their recent games overall, and in a large number of Cagliari’s matches as well. Everything points toward another tight and cautious contest, with both teams’ playing styles likely to keep chances and goals to a minimum. With home advantage, Cremonese should at least be able to avoid defeat here. This feels like a match that could easily end in a draw, but I’ll side with the home team to either edge a narrow win or, at the very least, come away with a point.

I&#x27;ll keep this short since it starts soon. Always risky betting against a guy in a purple patch but this is a TERRIBLE match up for Deni. He has been abusing his team with his length but Houston are the biggest team in the league and can cover him 1-4. They clog the lane and are one of the best box out teams.

Expect Sharpe and Clingan to step up <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> given the matchups but it will be a tough matchup all around.  
\- Top 10 defense against primary ball handlers  
\- Excellent rebounding team   
\- length at the perimeter with Durant at SG <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> 

Clingan has been stepping up recently and Sharpe has been off. I expect them to fill the void. Deni will get his stats but 41.5 seems way too high for this matchup. He&#x27;ll need to go for 15 rebs or 15 assists to get there I think.

Write-up: Nice to get an easy cash after that Struff loss. Jodar only faced one break point, and never looked to be in much trouble. 

Monday on home soil, playing in his preferred indoor conditions. He battled past Maxted in the first round (7.08 performance rating) before destroying Hussey in the second (8.18). Meanwhile, I&#x27;m expecting Gentzsch to be a bit tired after a combined 5+ hours on court against Brunold (6.81) and Krumich (6.55). Both of these players are strong servers, and these indoor British courts are quite fast, but Monday only really needs one break to cover this. In general, the conditions should suit Monday&#x27;s game better, as Gentzsch&#x27;s best career results have come on clay. Gentzsch can pull off some nice shots off both wings, but I expect Monday&#x27;s lefty forehand to be a huge factor here.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> (1/8/26): Al Nassr ML (-190 DK) 5u to win 2.63u

Write-Up: Sticking to the high bets on -190s as they have worked well for me recently. Al Nassr has won every game at home in the league this season. They had 10 wins in a row before they tied and lost the last 2 games (both away games).

I can’t see them dropping more points here, and wouldn’t be surprised if the line moves to the -200s by the time the game is played. The only down side is that they are missing Mane to AFCON, but they still have Ronaldo, Felix, and Coman for firepower so they shouldn’t have any attacking troubles.

If you want to go on the riskier side, you can add a Ronaldo anytime goalscorer as I think he is pretty likely to get on the scoresheet.

Al Nssr vs Al Qadsiah, Over 3.5 goals @ 1.9

This matchup strongly favors goals. Al Nassr’s attacking power and high pressing style usually lead to dominant performances, especially against weaker opposition. Al Qadsiah tend to struggle defensively and often allow many chances. Al Nassr are capable of scoring three or more goals on their own, and any contribution from the visitors only increases the value.

**Event:** Spanish Super Cup, Atletico Madrid v Real Madrid, 2:00 pm EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Atletico Madrid DNB +110, 1 unit

**Write Up:** We&#x27;re not leaving the Spanish Super Cup. *Perhaps I still haven&#x27;t learned my lesson but I&#x27;m once again fading an El Clasico team.* This time I&#x27;m betting against Real Madrid in their Madrid derby, simply because of the fact **Atletico are their bogey team.** It doesn&#x27;t matter how bad of a season Atletico are having, they&#x27;ll turn into prime AC Milan from the 90s and obliterate their rivals when the time is right. On the other hand, it doesn&#x27;t matter how good of a season they&#x27;re having, once they face Barcelona, they play like they haven&#x27;t seen a ball before. But they&#x27;re up against Real Madrid <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> so we&#x27;re good.

Real Madrid arrive into this fixure in decent form, but their results don&#x27;t show just how scrappy their wins truly were. Except for the Betis game, they looked pretty poor and struggled to break down defensive opponents, while being manhandled on the other end. They even struggled against 9-men Getafe. Atletico Madrid could cause them a lot of trouble with their compact defence and lots of physicality in the build-up play, as well as the final third (something the current Madrid defence seems to really struggle with). We saw how **they sailed to a 5-2 victory in their first clash this season,** and I really feel a similar showing from the Atleti <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Their **form** isn&#x27;t stellar, but it&#x27;s **good enough** not to give me any headaches ahead of this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. I still fully trust them to get it done.

Here are some fun stats for you: **Real Madrid have beaten Atletico in regulation time only once in their last seven meetings and have not kept a clean sheet against them since 2021.** Alongside **Kylian Mbappe,** Los Blancos will also be **missing** Eder Militao and Brahim Diaz, while Trent Alexander-Arnold and Dean Huijsen face late fitness tests. *Yes, Gonzalo balled out the last time he was trusted to start,* but this Atletico defence is built different and should keep him relatively quiet. Taking everything into consideration, this really gives me even more optimism for the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> at such odds. If you want to go down the BTTS Yes route, I don&#x27;t mind that either, but I&#x27;ve gone for the match outcome <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. I think it&#x27;s going to be a relatively low scoring game in which Atletico just about overcome their opps, but just in case this goes into penalties, we have the DNB to bail us out. Going in with just the one standard unit to preserve my bankroll for the cup final, as well as the European club competitions once they&#x27;re back.

Shang is in great form right now and I am high on him, beating Khachanov towards the end of last season. I watched that match and he was hitting lights out, lot of power and great movement. He&#x27;s been held back by injuries but at the start of the season coming out of a 2 month break I think he&#x27;s had enough time to rest up. He beat comesana in straight sets who&#x27;s decent. 

Sonego&#x27;s playstyle I don&#x27;t think matches up well against a heavy hitter and good mover in Shang. He&#x27;s also not as good on hard courts which is Shang&#x27;s strong suit. I got this at -118 when it first came out - lines dropped now but I think its still good value.</td></tr>

We’re going back to the well here. The Islanders won on Tuesday 9-0 as their star goaltender made his return and shutout the Devils on 44 shots. I expect him to be out there tomorrow night against the Preds who have a sub .500 record at home and a -22 goal differential on the season.

It’s unclear who will be in goal for Nashville. Juuse Saros has played in their last 3 games and gave up 4, 3, and 6 goals in those games. Justus Annunen is their backup and he has managed to win his last 2 starts only giving up 2 goals and 1 goal in those starts. 

That being said, the Islanders will still have the better goalie matchup with Sorokin in goal, they are the better team on the season, and they are underdogs, despite being above .500 on the road

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Paula Badosa 🇪🇸 U6.5 double faults vs Elena Rybakina 🇰🇿 5 units to win 4U @1.80 (FanDuel)

Write-up: Great way to kick-start the year with a loss. That reminded me exactly why I’d stopped with the overs on double faults and I’ll be doing the exact same this year. To put it into context, I’m 6-6 on the overs and 16-5 for the unders on this thread so I should’ve known. Despite it seeming that Sakkari couldn’t miss a first serve all match she was dominated by Gauff who even had her forehand firing all match. As a result it was a shorter match than anticipated which reduced double faults probabilities by quite a bit, ending on one which came in the final game of the match.

Watching Badosa these days is really tough when you know just how good she can be as a player. The former world number 2 definitely has the level to be a top 5 player but her chronic back issues let her down time and time again so plays sporadically and often out of form. When she’s on though the Spaniard is unbelievable and showed it by reaching the AO semis last year. She’s facing the current number 5 Rybakina who is in the form of her life in my opinion, culminating in winning the WTA Finals last year. The former Wimbledon champ just seems unstoppable at the moment with her huge hitting being a real issue for opponents.

Anyways this line is simply priced wrong when you consider the game line is 20.5. It feels like the market has just used the fact she df’d 13 times last round but it was a match that featured 31 games so the raw data by itself doesn’t mean much (and is just one match). Badosa has averaged a 6% double fault rate over the past year on hard courts. Using both players’ serving/returning + ELO stats I get an estimated 4.3 double faults from the Spaniard across the 21 games (67 service points). That gives this play an approximate 84% chance of winning hence the unit size. I am quite worried that Badosa will walkover if things aren’t going her way (especially as she withdrew in doubles) but at the worst it’ll be push. Also will flag that their matches have been competitive, mostly going the distance (4-4 H2H) but this should be routine for Elena considering their polar opposite forms. BOL !

**Game: Arsenal vs Liverpool - Premier League**

**Time: 3:00 PM EST**

**Cannot emphasize how massive this game is tomorrow. Before <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> it was big, but with City dropping points for the third matchweek in a row, you can expect Arsenal to come absolutely guns blazing against Liverpool.**

Arsenal are currently unbeaten at home this season in all competitions, and anyone who has watched this side knows why. Whether it&#x27;s immense pressure off the rip or an eventual set-piece goal that unlocks the floodgates at some point, this Arsenal side will put your Goalkeeper into probably the most stressful 10-15 minute span of their career. When you couple this with the fact that Arsenal lost to Liverpool earlier this season, tomorrow is going to be their biggest get back yet.

These big games are what Arsenal live for, looking at 3-1 Bayern, 4-1 Aston Villa, 4-1 Tottenham, 4-1 Atletico Madrid. I&#x27;m expecting a similar scoreline with the stakes being at the best they&#x27;ve been for this side. 

**Arsenal at home this season. 14 Games played**

* **13 wins, 1 draw, 0 losses**
* **Line has hit in 7/8 of their last Home games**

**CFP - Ole Miss vs Miami, 7:30 pm EST, ESPN**

***Miami +7.5/Total u56.5 (-119) 1.5u***

The first of 5 football picks I’m firing on this week/weekend brings us to the Fiesta Bowl, as Miami takes on Ole Miss for a berth in the College Football Playoff final.

My combo prediction comes down to a trend I like that I expect to carry throughout the game. *Even though it’s manic to try and equate regular season college football to playoff college football*, finding the edge <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> comes down to finding what stands out the very most - and the **inconsistency in the Ole Miss coaching staff may end up their undoing**.

*It was announced yesterday that Charlie Weis Jr. and running backs coach Kevin Smith will coach against Miami*, **however Tight ends coach Joe Cox and wide receivers coach George McDonald are out** - as much as this may not seem like a big deal, **losing specialty coaches at any point of the season is a deterrent to success**, especially when they’re on the offensive end in college football specifically.

The main characters are pretty balanced - Miami QB Carson Beck **completes passes at a nation leading 75% rate**, and Miami rush the ball at a standard 4.1 YPA. Ole Miss QB Trinidad Chambliss isn’t too bad himself - *he’s only thrown 3 INTs* to Becks 10 this season. Their rush attack is more pronged and slightly better at 4.6 YPA.

Not many SEC teams have been able to stop Ole Miss, but they’ve not been able to keep most teams off the field, either. In fact, **Ole Miss allow opponents more time of possession, add that to the fact Miami average 33:32 of field time per game (5th in the country), in a playoff setting, this is where I lean** - Miami sets the tone: **Miami has hit the 1H Game Total Under in 13 of their last 14 games at 24.5 points**. The full game total we are playing here has **hit the under in all but 1 game** &amp; **Miami have covered +7.5 in every game this season.**

I believe Miami can stranglehold Ole Miss on both sides of the ball… Yes, *Ole Miss possess one of the most elite offensive units in college football*, but if they can’t get/stay on the field, it’ll be hard to show their cards, **especially if they end up in a situation where coaching matters**. Miami are way more comfortable in low scoring games as they’ve proven throughout the season, and especially the last couple of weeks.

Last play review:

**NHL - San Jose/Los Angeles, o5.5 Total Goals** ✅ 

(We’ve gotten some luck over the last 3 weeks but almost nothing compares to last night… 0-0 after 1, 1-1 after 2… then bam. 4 goals in the 3rd to send it to OT and cash us. I’m on a decent heater, but a lot of my wins are also drenched in a bit of good fortune. I will say - there should have been 6 goals in the first 2 periods alone so I’m glad this cashed)

**New Event:**  NCAAF – Miami Hurricanes vs Ole Miss

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:**  Ole Miss +3.5 @ 1.89 (Usual 3 units)

This is a much anticipated semifinal showdown between two teams that were not expected to be in this position at the beginning of the season, but have shown great resilience by knocking out top opponents and are a single win away from competing for a National Title.  This game is a tossup and should be a very close match, barring turnovers or mistakes.  If each team plays to their strengths, it should be a very close affair. 

Some data:

* Miami will have the best defense on the field, while Ole Miss will have the strongest offense.  This is the main battle that will determine the winner of this matchup.
* Miami was able to pressure Ohio State so well, that the QB did not have time to drop and throw the ball effectively and forced mistakes.  However, Ole Miss&#x27; QB Chambliss is perhaps the most athletic QB that Miami has faced all year and has been able to perform well against other elite defenses.
* If Chambliss can perform at the level he showed against Ohio State and Texas A&amp;M, then the edge will be on Ole Miss’ side in this one. 
* If Miami&#x27;s better defense cannot stop Chambliss from moving the ball downfield, then it will be forced into a shootout, where the over 52.5 comes into play.  I cannot ignore the possibility of that happening, but if this game becomes a high scoring affair then the edge lies with Ole Miss as they have the better offensive unit.

I will take the points with Ole Miss rather than lay them with Miami.  I feel safe with a field goal in my favor and the hook.  Worst case, Miami runs away with it should Chambliss get injured.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: NBL (Australian Basketball): South East Melbourne vs. Illawara Hawks South East -5 vs Illawara Hawks -115 (1.15U To Win 1U)**

 
Write up: A high flying offense returning home after a 3-game road streak, South East Melbourne comes into this game having game totals of 241 (scored 124), 207 (scored 111), 171 (scored 84), 185 (scored 107), and 152 (scored 77). They attempt the most field goals per game at 80.3, and make the most field goals per game at 34.6 which include a league high 12.5 3 pointers.

The recent return of Owen Foxwell to the lineup has also boosted this team&#x27;s offense. He has scored 8 points (on minutes restriction), 17, 17, and 16 points since recovering from his thigh injury.

On the other hand, Illawara has been fairly inconsistent throughout this season, sitting at an 8-13 record. They managed to blow out a bottom of the league Cairns side but are 1-4 in their last away games. Stats wise Illawara are on the complete opposite spectrum as their counterparts ranking 6th in PPG, 10th in 3PA, and 9th in 3FGM. 

Looking at h2h, Illawara did manage to win a thriller at home against Melbourne where they scored 21 more 2-pointers than South East but only squeaked out a 4-point win. Their last away game vs Melbourne was a 116-76 blowout loss. 

All in all, expect this South East wagon to continue rolling, once they get out to an early lead and shots start falling, I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll look back and will cruise to a comfortable win.

**Write Up:** Well, that&#x27;s just how soccer goes sometimes. Unfortunate that Chelsea had an early 22&#x27; red card that changed the game and really spoiled our chances. Enzo was looking promising before that as well. Nothing we can really do about that, we move onward. 

Big match <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> as Arsenal hosts Liverpool. Liverpool are unbeaten for 9 matches, Arsenal unbeaten in 7. There is a lot of drama/bad blood here as people are already crowning Arsenal the EPL champs, while Liverpool are obviously the defending champions. Szoboszlai had an interesting interview earlier in the week, essentially stating that Arsenal haven&#x27;t won&#x27;t anything yet and it&#x27;s only January. Liverpool is going to come to play. 

Szoboszlai is a midfielder for Liverpool who has been shifting around positionally like many Liverpool players have lately. Since Salah left the starting lineup, he has taken penalties, played further forward, and looked really good for Liverpool. This has hit in 7 of his last 11 matches and he has had 9 SOTs in those 11 matches. Arsenal do not give up a lot of SOTs, but with Szoboszlai in his current form and the drama floating around this potential &quot;passing of the torch game&quot; I like him to show up and land an SOT <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.

I will be the first to say, I did not think Miami was THAT good, coming into the playoffs but here we are and boy they are a GREAT team - I think they have to much firepower to lose this game - Ole Miss on the other hand, Chambliss was HIM last game, and he is so fun to watch - that being said, Miami has one of, if not the best DL when it comes to getting pressure on the QB - if they can get some pressure on Chambliss, Miami wins this game by 7+ - On the offensive side of things, Miami’s run game will win them this game - they have such a strong run game, which also helps bleed the clock - keeping our boy Chambliss off the field - Ole Miss has been on fire all year, and they know Chambliss is going to have to sling it to keep it a close game - I think both teams get points on the board, and yes, these CFB Playoff games haven’t been crazy high scoring, I really can’t see how the over 36.5 doesn’t hit here - sit back, relax, and drink a beer - give me the two <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> parlay for the money!

__POTD:__ Mark Fletcher o88.5 rushing yards (-115), 3.53u to win 3.07u

__Write Up:__ There are 4 teams left standing 3 of them didn’t even play in their conference ship, that includes both Ole Miss &amp; Miami. They now meet in the Semi’s with the winner facing Indiana/Oregon in the National Championship in Miami. #10 Miami (12-2) faced #6 Texas A&amp;M (11-1) in the 1st rd, winning the game 10-3, after RB Mark Fletcher torched them for 172 rushing yards on 17 carries &amp; their defense was also elite with 3 turnovers, allowing just 4.3 yards per play. They then faced defending champs #2 Ohio State (12-1) next rd &amp; were once again dominant on defense. They intercepted OSU QB Julian Sayin twice, with a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> 6 on the way to a 24-14 win. They made history as the 1st double digit seed to make the semi’s in the expanded playoff &amp; now face a red hot Ole Miss team that is riding into the game on a 7 game win streak with just 1 loss this season. #6 Ole Miss took on #11 Tulane (11-2) at home, destroying them 41-10 despite giving up 421 yards. Next rd was a rematch with their only loss this season vs #3 UGA (12-1). Ole Miss came out on top after a game winning FG with 6 seconds left. Ole Miss has now won 2 games without their head coach Lane Kiffin, who left the school after the regular season for a new job at LSU. On his way to LSU he brought all his assistants. With the transfer portal in full swing they’ve been splitting time between LSU/Ole Miss despite the massive upcoming game vs Miami. It’s been confirmed that their OC Charlie Weiss Jr will be calling plays. But we do know Miami doesn’t have these problems &amp; has a coaching staff fully committed to prepping for Ole Miss. A huge part of the game plan will be running the ball down Ole Miss’s throats. No one ran more times on Ole Miss than UGA did their first game this season, rushing 49 times for 221 yards. But the 2nd time, UGA OC Mike Bobo abandoned the run despite UGA RB Nate Frazier avg 5.7 ypc. It didn&#x27;t work. Miami did the opposite in their 2 games. Miami controlled the clock for over 33 minutes vs OSU. Miami’s offense is built around a dominant beastly OL. They control possessions &amp; pound opposing DL’s. The way to beat Ole Miss is on the ground, Miami spent the last 2 games showing they can do that.

Miami RB Mark Fletcher has been an animal this playoffs. Fletcher has racked up 262 yards on 36 carries in 2 games. After rushing for 172 yards vs A&amp;M in the 1st rd, he followed it up with 90 yards vs OSU, one of the best run defenses in the nation. He became the 1st player to run for 90 yards on OSU since 11/30/2024. OSU&#x27;s defense ranked #4 in opponent adjusted yards after contact, #8 in explosive run defense, &amp; top 5 in rushing yards allowed. Miami became the first team all season to score 16+ points on OSU. Now he faces an Ole Miss D that has given up 80+ rushing yards to 3 straight RB’s &amp; 167 rushing ypg in their last 3. That’s more than DOUBLE what OSU allowed per game all season (84.1 ypg). Ole Miss ranks 132nd in EPA per rush, 130th in rushing success rate allowed, &amp; 117th in explosive run rate allowed. They allow 3+ yards before contact to RB’s on 29% of attempts (ranked 94th). Their run D ranks 116th in yards before contact allowed. Fletcher is one of the hardest RB’s in the NCAA to tackle with a total of 50 missed tackles forced on the season &amp; is coming off a game where he forced 5 missed tackles (2nd most this year) vs OSU who is one of the best tackling teams in the country. A ton of his success should be credited to Miami’s OL. They rank 1st in pass blocking &amp; 16th in run blocking, &amp; also #1 in the country in pressure rate allowed. Miami’s QB Carson Beck runs an offense that utilizes traditional dropbacks (3+ steps). Beck takes a traditional dropback 56% of the time. He gets rid of the football in 2.35 seconds, 3rd fastest in NCAA. Miami leads the nation in pressure rate allowed at just 25% in traditional dropbacks, while Ole Miss defense that ranks 46th by the same metric. Beck limits pressure by making quick passes. 57% of his passes go less than 5 yards (7th highest rate). On those Beck averages 6.7 yards per pass (7th). Ole Miss allows 5.5 yards per pass on throws under 5 yds, ranked 77th. Ole Miss also has a horrible problem tackling receivers. They allow a broken tackle once every 4.5 rec (109th). Miami WR’s rank 18th in missed tackles forced. The key to Miami winning this game will be to keep the ball in their hands &amp; slow the tempo down. Miami ranks 98th in offensive plays per game. While Ole Miss runs the 6th most plays per game. Ole Miss has a high powered offense led by stud QB Trinidad Chambliss. The best way to defend him is to keep him on the sideline &amp; run the ball.

Ole Miss OC Charlie Weis Jr. runs a fast paced, pass heavy offense. He’ll face a Miami D that has given up just 17 points in the playoffs to 2 teams that both ranked top 20 in ppg averaging 32+. Miami allows just 13.8 ppg (4th). Their defense has the best DL in the nation. In 2 Playoff games, they had 12 sacks &amp; 16 tackles for loss, against 2 of the best OL’s. They generated an insane 50% pressure rate against OSU. They rank 2nd in pressure rate generated in the NCAA. Chambliss is an athletic QB suited for pressure. He ran circles around the UGA defense. Miami already faced an athletic playmaker this playoffs in A&amp;M&#x27;s Marcel Reed, sacking him 7 times. Ole Miss uses quick drop backs 56% of the time (6th highest). This is where UGA struggled as they ranked 106th in yards per pass vs quick dropbacks. Miami is much better allowing just 5.7 yards per pass against quick dropbacks (24th). Chambliss takes a traditional dropback on 36% of passes. Against traditionals, Miami is generating a 54% pressure rate (2nd), while Ole Miss allows a 38% pressure rate (30th). One of the ways to force Ole Miss into traditional dropbacks will be to force 3rd &amp; longs as that’s when Chambliss’ traditional dropback rate jumps to 65%. Miami’s defense ranks 14th in the NCAA in forcing 3rd &amp; longs. Only 26% of all drives against the Miami defense this season have gained a 1st down inside the Miami 40 or scored on an explosive play. As for their ground game, Miami is hard to run on which will be tough for Ole Miss star RB Kewan Lacy who is already coming into the game banged up. Miami has allowed just 83.4 rushing yards per game (4th) &amp; just held Ohio State RB’s to 45 yards. Ole Miss has a 57.4 run blocking grade (85th) &amp; they only average 1.6 yards before contact per carry. Miami ranks 13th in the country with only 1.1 rushing yards before contact allowed. Miami holds the advantages on offense &amp; defense.

Miami will run it down their throats &amp; maintain possession. Fletcher will run for 90+ yards.

Last 6: ✅✅🔵

  


Sport: Tennis 🎾

Event: ATP Brisbane

Match: Dimitrov vs Collignon

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Dimitrov -2,5 games @ 1,81**





Collignon had really nice indoor season to end 2025., made a breakthrough and continues in the same fashion at the start of 2026. He has won two Q matches and decent Shapovalov in R1 here without losing a set. He played good against Shapovalov, made early breaks in both sets, but Canadian is know for his erratic tennis and is prone to errors. Collignon strong suit is his consistency, and when playing good tennis against, obviously, out of form Shapovalov, there is only one way it can end. However, Dimitrov is a different story. Dimitrov won easily against Carreno-Busta a couple days ago when we had him to cover spread, looked physically ready and playing solid tennis. He is able to cope with Collignons&#x27; depth and long rallies and if we consider pure tennis quality he is still miles ahead. As I said a couple days ago season has just started and if there is time Dimitrov shouldn&#x27;t have too much problems with his body, it is now. Odds obviously take into consideration that Dimitrov didn&#x27;t play a lot of tennis last months and Belgian has been solid in this period, but quality difference is still the main factor for me and it&#x27;s wider than odds suggest.

**Net Units: +5.27**

**Last:** Brentford vs Aston Villa **BTTS** | Man Utd vs Fulham **U11 corners** **(3u)** ❌

**Spain Segunda @ 7:30PM GMT**

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Mirandes vs Malaga **BTTS + o2.5 Goals** (5u)

**Odds:** \+163

**Write Up:** What the fuck is the state of VAR in the premier league right now, we get BTTS taken away from us from a Villa goal being disallowed because of a VAR check which was in a different phase of play - separate from the attack (which should mean that VAR cannot go back to a previous phase of play and check a decision btw). Honestly such is the way to lose like that, plus Brentford going down to 10 men early didnt actually help as Villa struggled to break them down once they got 1-0 up, sitting behind the ball and playing well defensively. It is what it is onto the next. Man U vs Fulham saw 10 corners at full time, a bit sweaty but that line cashed nonetheless.

Todays is the first 5 unit play im going with. Offensive trends and defensive gaps lead me to believe that both teams see the back of the net. I almost went with Malaga ML as they are on a 6 game win streak and coming into this fixture in good form, especially at +150 odds. BTTS has happened in 4/5 last meetings with the latest two games they faced off seeing 5 goals IN EACH GAME. For over 2.5 goals, like just mentioned there has been a fair share of the goal scoring between these two. In all fixtures Mirandes are on a 6 game streak seeing over 2.5 goals and Malaga 5/6, with both teams to score being seen in 5/6 and 7/9 respectively. I do think this is once again a high scoring fixture with both teams possessing the quality to get their names on the scoresheet, especially since their defences are both conceding plenty. Lets hope this game sees plenty of attacking output to secure this for us.

Apologies about yesterday, so close once again.

**Reasoning:** Under 165.5 makes sense because the total is simply too high. Both teams usually combine in the mid 150s, not the high/mid 160s, and neither plays at a pace that consistently creates shootouts. You’re buying a 10+ point cushion (in NCAAB) unless both teams catch absolute fire. Fade the inflated number, let normal basketball win🍹</td></tr>

Parlay :  Over 2 Asian in Mirandés vs Málaga + Over 2.5 in Utrecht II vs VVV Venlo @ 2.27 (1.4u)

Writeup: Looks like i like getting screwed by the same division again &amp; again, but data still points towards it, so trying one last time in the dutch league

Leg 1 : Both teams have scored in seven of Malaga’s last nine matches, while the same has landed in five of the hosts’ previous six. The visitors are flying having won six on the bounce, but they’ve shipped 14 goals in 11 away trips this term. So, ideally this would be a BTTS play, but my luck with this has been terrible, so going safe with over 2 asian, which still gives decent odds

Leg 2 : Over 2.5 goals have been scored in all of both teams&#x27; last five games. Lets just hope it doesnt devolve into a slugfest of shots with no goals

Hope we get the W &amp; BoL</td></tr>

**Write Up:** 

* Al-Hilal have 2 clean sheets from their last 11 games

He is just scoring goals for fun at the moment in Saudi Arabia! I mean he has scored in eight games straight, with a total of 13 goals scored! Last round he surpassed Ronaldo thanks to a hat-trick, and with talks about Ronaldo boycotting Al-Nassr’s game <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, he has a good chance putting further ground between them at the topscorer table.  

Al-Hilal hasn’t even been that good lately either with back to back draws. In their last top game they beat Al-Nassr at home 3-1, but it wasn’t easy for them, it could quickly have ended differently if the guests just hadn’t lost their heads completely. 

Ivan Toney scored twice against them at home earlier this season, which was his 5th &amp; 6th goal against them from just four games! He should have a good chance of getting something again <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. He recently also gave an interview where he talked about how well he has settled down there and his ambitions of doing well to get into the England squad for the World Cup. </td></tr>

**Explanation:**

I havent been posting for a while but we are back! Let&#x27;s see if we can get a solid run again, as we did last year!

In this line-up I believe we have a solid <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> in Tibo Colson, as he is playing solid tennis and had a solid run in Thailand losing to Kolar 2-1 which is a top 200 ranked player. Now he is playing against Malige who hasn&#x27;t won a match since November last year.

I am surprised the odds is so high as he is in much better shape right now and has been playing some good tennis this year.

Good luck!

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Toronto Maple Leafs vs Calgary Flames at 10:00 pm EST (NHL/Hockey)

William Nylander over 2.5 shots (+145)

Nylander came back from a 3 week absence Saturday vs Vancouver and had 5 shots. His line was also at 2.5 with a +150 odds. Leafs had no powerplay that game so even better for us that he got those shots without the man advantage. 

Why i&#x27;m confident about this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> however is that Morgan Rielly left last game for the Leafs and will not be available tonight(to be announced this morning so maybe wait for the confirmation just to be sure). Rielly usually is on the first powerplay unit and LOVES to shoot as the quarterback. With his absence, i&#x27;m banking on Nylander, who is also on the first powerplay unit, to receive the puck more and to take the shots that Rielly would usually take on 5v4. Combine this with Calgary being the third most penalized team in the league this season and this should result in at least 1 or 2 additional shots for Nylander tonight. 3 out of his last 5 games vs the Flames he went over that line and in his last game in Calgary he got a hat-trick with 6 shots.

Leafs have won their last 7 vs Calgary so to me this looks like the perfect game on the road for a healthy Nylander to shake off the rust and prepare himself for the Olympics next week.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Mallorca Double Chance (Mallorca or Draw) + Mallorca Over 2.5 Shots on Target - 1.72 (Bet365)

*Recap: Sweat-free bet that cashed in 20 mins to continue the winning streak. Love to see it.*

Write Up:

Most of the best straight picks have already been tipped so I&#x27;ll go for this instead.

Mallorca may be in the relegation zone but they are formidable at home having lost only 2 out of 10 games there in the La Liga this season with one of the losses being to Barca. <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>, I believe they&#x27;ll be playing for a win but might end up with a draw which puts them in the safe zone (for now). Also, they&#x27;ve hit over 2.5 SoT in every home game except the two they lost.

Their opponent is Sevilla who are having a bad run right now with only 2 wins in their last 10 games and 3 wins in their last 10 away games. I believe Sevilla still has some fight left in them which is why I believe the match could end in a draw but I don&#x27;t see an angle in which they win unless Mallorca is **extra** sloppy <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> or get a red card. 

Hopefully, this is a straightforward game with no surprises.

Good luck if you tail! 🍀</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Zion Williamson o30.5 pra (-119) DraftKings 3u

**Write-up:** Zion has been under the radar this season. He has covered this line recently versus the Spurs, Thunder, and twice against the Grizzlies. He did have a bit of a letdown spot last game against the 76ers. This season, he is 21/35 and 12/19 in away games, and also 10/16 with the starting lineup.

Charlotte is ranking 8th in iso matchups defensively and 1st in opponent free throws denied. However, when Zion is going against good iso defenders, he is heavily covering his line at 83% (86% with starters). Versus teams that rank top 10 in denying free throws, he is still getting his way, covering in 62% (86% with starters). He is also torching top transition defenses, where the Hornets rank 8th. Zion has covered 69% (89% with starters). In games where he has had 1 day of rest, he has covered 13/20 and 8/9 with the starters. When it&#x27;s his third game within a 4-day stretch, he is a perfect 6/6. 

Hornets have a rank-16 defensive rating in their last five, and Zion has been consistent against these mediocre teams. Ultimately, it really depends on what Hornets team shows up. During this stretch, they have some lockdown D, then in other games, they fall flat. It&#x27;s hard to take a guy going against the Hornets right now, but a lot of power forwards are hitting their line in: PJ Washington, Flagg, GG Jackson, JJJ, Banchero, Green, LeBron, and Leonard. Zion is also 2/3 against the Hornets, so this is not new to him. In Zion&#x27;s last 10 games, he is shooting 71% from the field, with 9 potential assists / 9 potential rebounds. I feel like Zion is going to dominate inside the paint, hopefully runs over this small Hornets interior, and dominates as Flagg did. If he comes in aggressive and looking to drive and initiate contact for those fouls, we&#x27;re going to cover. Also need him to get the same or more touches, since he doesn&#x27;t get a ton, but he is a bucket getter, especially with his midrange jumper that he has been working on.

Here we go!</td></tr>

NBA: Pelicans @ Hornets 3:00 PM EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **Kon Knueppel u17.5 points** (-103); 2 units to win 1.94 units

Write Up:  
The biggest thing here is the Hornets being healthy. In 16 games with key pieces of the rotation (LaMelo, Brandon Miller, Miles Bridges, Sexton, Kalkbrenner, and Diabate) playing, he has only gone over this line 5 times. Over these 16 games, he averages 11.3 field goal attempts a game. As efficient as Knueppel is, 18 points on 12 FGAs (rounded up the average FGA) is extremely tough to do.  
I can really only see one thing really going wrong here: Knueppel being crazy efficient. In 4/5 of the games he went over these were his splits (in the format) FG/FGA | 3M/3A | FTM/FTA

9/12 | 6/9 | 2/2  
5/10 | 4/7| 6/6  
7/10 | 3/5 | 2/2  
10/16 | 8/12 | 6/6

He can be insanely efficient, and if he is this bet is dead. The one game I didn&#x27;t include was his 21 point game against the Cavs. No one on the Hornets could get anything going; the final score ended up being just 94-87. Knueppel was forced to step up and make plays. He ended up taking 21 shots that game. While he was unusually inefficient (because the Hornets needed him to be), that amount of volume would definitely kill this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. I doubt something like this will happen again. Excluding the 16 FGA game against the Mavericks (which I&#x27;m sure he was extra motivated to get shots up in because he was playing his college teammate), the next highest amount of shots he had in a game was just 12 (and that happened only once).</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: UNC o84.5 points (-110) 2.2U units to win 2U

Write up: UNC (17-4) host Syracuse (13-9) at 7pm in the Dean Center.  Syracuse comes off a win over Notre Dame this weekend that snapped a 4 game losing skid.  UNC comes in with a 3 game win streak in ACC play.  Syracuse have struggled and despite getting right against ND, I expect the UNC with a home crowd advantage to win this game.  UNC has relied on the 3pt ball shooting 25.7 3PA per game while also offensive rebounding well as a team.  UNC can score in transition as well as from half court sets and puts up 83ppg. UNC has several NBA prospects with Caleb Wilson heading that group as an outstanding freshman talent.  Syracuse plays a more balanced offense relying on half court sets moving the ball and getting quality 2pt shots, their offense avgs 76ppg.  The Orange pride themselves on defense and protecting the rim but I expect UNC&#x27;s fire power and home crowd to be too much for them.  I like the tarheels to cover the spread and team points, but I feel the more conservative take is over team points.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Tennis - ATP Montpellier Qualifiers: Andrea Vavassori H2H v Hugo Grenier 3u** $1.61 11:30PM AEDT

* Grenier has been average this year. He scraped home against Blancaneaux despite winning less points overall. He served a higher 1st serve % but only managed to win 70% of them - on an indoor court for a guy that relies on first serve dominance and winning most of this points within 3 rally points of the serve, this is poor. Especially against a Blancaneaux who just lost to Tirante, who we know shouldnt have even been testing Blanca based on how he got blown off the court by Belluci when we bet it.
* Now Grenier has to face Vavassori who just absolutely crunched Carballes Baena without even facing a BP on his serve. He won 90.7% of his first service games - pretty incredible considering Blockx was in the form of his life when he played Baena (albeit outdoors) and only managed 76.5%.
* Vavassori didn&#x27;t get a lot of court last year due to injury and then focusing on doubles on his return, but in one of the few singles tournaments he did play prior to injury, he demolished  Blancaneaux on indoor courts and then Felix (a monster on indoors) before understandably losing to Alcaraz.
* Vavassori is the form player out of the two right now (have a look at his run in Adelaide) and given it&#x27;s now indoors, these odds are too good not to take.

Make sure to bet on a bookie that pays out retirements and voids bets on the retiring player.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: Under 5.5 Goals (+100) 2u To Profit 2u

Write-Up: That Kings Vs Hurricanes game was low scoring until the end, it got a little scary but we still got the win! The Winnipeg Jets are coming to Dallas to play the Stars. In net for the Stars is Jake Oettinger, who is great every year and is having another good year this season. On the season, Oettinger has a .900 save percentage and a 2.66 goals against average. Connor Hellebuyck is in net for the Jets and he has been a monster goalie every year, despite not being quite up to his typical standards, he is still great this year. This season, Connor Hellebuyck has a .902 save percentage and a 2.71 goals against average. The Jets are pretty weak offensively this season, ranking 22nd in goals and just 25th in shots on goal. On the other hand, the Stars are decent, but they aren’t exactly a big threat. The Stars rank 11th in goals this season, but are way down at 28th in shots on goal, which is going to be a problem against a goalie like Hellebuyck who has constant high save percentages. The Stars are also good at limiting shots, ranking 9th in least shots on goal allowed, which is going to be key at limiting the Jets scoring. With 2 proven goalies both having yet another good season, and both offences being pretty mediocre, this is a great low scoring matchup.

This is a valuable spot from my league-specific model that tracks goal patterns across lesser-known leagues like Oman.

H2H history supports this too, with 5 of the last 7 meetings finishing over the 2.5 line.

Write Up: Finally caught a break with the cards <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> in the Rosario match. It was as dirty as expected and we got those 6 yellows to get our first win.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> we’re staying in the Argentine league. Gimnasia is playing at home against Aldosivi. Gimnasia is historically a tough team to visit; they are aggressive and usually dominate the pace in La Plata. Aldosivi is basically a professional bottom-dweller at this point—they are always struggling at the end of the table and their away record is consistently poor.

Getting 2.15 for a decent home side against a team that’s a candidate for relegation every season is a steal. Not overthinking it, just playing the odds on the better team at home. 2 units.

Her opponent is a higher ranked prospect but I like Tegan to win this match at plus money because of the surface and her form. She is more experienced on indoor hard courts whereas her opponents best results have been on clay. Her tour win rate is only 51.61% but she&#x27;s had victories and competitive losses against good opponents and she has started the year in strong form displaying high serve and return numbers in her first three matches</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s pick</mark> Jay Huff over 10.5 points and rebounds (-130 FanDuel) two units (against Rockets at 7:10)

Aside from two games where he played three minutes or less, he’s over this line in 9/11 (one of those he got 10). He’s averaging 13.6 for the season. He is getting these numbers with Siakam playing. The Rockets tend to play high scoring/fast paced games. Their defense is average against bigs. I think Huff gets his usual 20+ minutes a game no matter what- could be a blow out (even though the spread doesn’t indicate this), but I think Huff gets minutes in a blowout or his usual rotation minutes. Huff has scored ten points alone in 7/10. This line just seems too low for this guy. While I was researching his stats, and before I placed my bet, the 10.5 moved from -120 to -130 and Fanatics had 10+ move from -150 to -165.</td></tr>

Last Pick: Pavel Kotov ML vs Remy Bertola (-154, 2 units): Loss

Tennis | Quimper Challenger | 10:30 AM EST (estimated)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Adrian Mannarino vs Pedro Martinez | **Under 2.5 sets at -150 (DK). 1 unit.**

Write-up: Frustrating loss. Kotov closed at around -206, so I don&#x27;t feel too bad about it, but it still represents a continuation of what has been a rough patch of form for me. 

Adrian Mannarino is an interesting player in that his level seemed to be declining sharply in 2024, but an excellent 2025 campaign essentially revived his career at 37 years old. Mannarino has now gone winless since October of last year, but I feel that this home event could be a bounceback spot for him. Mannarino has always had extremely flat groundstrokes that work best on grass and fast courts. What has changed, however, is that he has lost much of the defensive ability of his younger self and filled the void by nearly perfecting his version of the lefty slider serve. Now, windy conditions tend to take a lot of the bite out of his groundstrokes and serve, and he can no longer compensate by hanging behind the baseline. For this reason, I wasn&#x27;t surprised that he didn&#x27;t do well in Australia; I was a bit surprised about him losing to Remy Bertola indoors in Quimper last week, but his performance rating (6.68) wasn&#x27;t terrible, and Bertola ended up making the final. 

On the other side of the net, Pedro Martinez should represent a good chance for Adrian to get back on track. Martinez is a Spanish grinder who has always preferred clay courts, and doesn&#x27;t seem to have fully recovered from knee and shoulder issues that affected him in 2025. He did capture a Challenger title on outdoor hard courts earlier this month, but he didn&#x27;t beat anyone in the top 200 to do so, and indoor courts tend to be worse for his game. Last week in Quimper, he was pushed down to even odds against Sascha Gueymard Wayenburg, an indoor specialist who relies heavily on the serve, and ended up getting broken 3 times in a straight-sets loss (6.72). Martinez&#x27;s serve is nothing special, and he&#x27;s not going to be able to rush Mannarino off the ground in the same way someone like Bertola can. If Adrian can raise his level here, I expect him to win in two straightforward sets, but this bet also covers the possibility that he just doesn&#x27;t show up or doesn&#x27;t have the energy, which is always a possibility at this age.</td></tr>

**Last:** (CBB) Illinois +2.5 (1.5u) - ✅

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** (CBB) No. 14 Kansas (+4.5) at No. 11 Texas Tech

**Start Time:** 9:00 PM ET (ESPN)

**Odds:** \-102 (Caesars)

**Units:** 1.5U

**Reasoning:** Following an embarrassing 86-75 loss at West Virginia back on Jan. 10, something clicked for the Kansas men’s basketball team.

A visit from then-No. 2 Iowa State just four days later was lining up to be the final nail in the coffin to the team’s Big 12 title aspirations. Instead, the Jayhawks (16-5) responded with a season-revitalizing, 84-63 thrashing of the Cyclones. Four more wins followed and suddenly Kansas is riding a five-game win streak and on the cusp of a Top 10 ranking.

What’s been impressive is that the team has executed on both sides of the ball.

While the Jayhawks offensive number’s won’t jump out of you from the page—39th in field-goal percentage (47.9%), 48th in three-point shooting (36.5%), 72nd in offensive efficiency (1.121) and 101st in scoring (78.8 PPG)—the unit has turned it up a notch as of late. Over the last five games, the team has averaged 83.1 points on 51.6% shooting from the field (39.2% from beyond the arc). That includes hitting at a mark of 51% or more in all but one of those contests while converting from long-range at 42% or better in all but three. The defense has held up more than its bargain, conceding just 67.6 points on 37.6% shooting (33.6% from the perimeter) over its last five games. But that’s hardly unusual for a Kansas defense that through 21 games has ranked 3rd in opponent field-goal percentage (38.3%), 13th in opponent three-point shooting (29.4%), 28th in defensive efficiency (0.967) and 35th in scoring defense (68.0). So not surprisingly, the team is listed as the 3rd best team in the nation (9.829 Barthag), per Torvik, while ranking 4th in adjusted offensive efficiency (131.6) and 7th in adjusted defensive efficiency (92.5) over that span.

Up next? A battle with Texas Tech and JT Toppin.

On the season, Toppin paces the Red Raiders (16-5) with 22.4 points and 10.9 rebounds per game. But over the last five, the star junior’s play—27.6 points on 60.2% shooting (47.1% from three-point range)—has helped the team average 86.8 points on a sizzling 51.4% shooting from the floor (44.4% from beyond the arc). That includes topping 88 or more points in all but three games while shooting 38% or better in all games. Fortunately, the Jayhawks know a thing or two about slowing down stars. Most recently, the team limited BYU’s AJ Dybantasa to just 17 points—his second lowest total of the year. Kansas also downed two birds with one stone against Iowa State’s Milan Momclivoc (18.6 PPG) and Joshua Jefferson (17.2 PPG), holding the duo to just 11 and 12 points on a combined 7-of-23 (30.4%) from the field.

But a reeling Texas Tech defense will be what tips the game in the visitor’s favor.

Through 21 games, the unit ranks just 129th in opponent three-point shooting (32.9%), 156th in defensive efficiency (1.046), 166th in scoring defense (74.4 PPGA) and 174th in opponent field-goal percentage (44.6%). But things have gotten even worse in recent weeks, as the Red Raiders have conceded 78.4 points on a whopping 46.2% shooting from the field (37.4% from beyond the arc). That includes allowing each opponent to top 42% or better from the floor while allowing opponents to hit at a 33% clip or better from the perimeter in all but two. But the biggest achilles heel for the team is its inability to control the paint, ranking 224th in opponent points in the paint (33.0 PPG; 39th percentile). That has been something the Jayhawks have been pretty successful with on the season—80th in points in the paint (35.3 PPG; 78th percentile)—and it should continue Monday night.

Trust the Jayhawks to stay hot on the road and keep us within the number.

Big, big, BIG fan of the Hornets right now and the way they’re playing — especially with a fully fit lineup. They’re at home against a Pelicans side that really isn’t that great, and the last H2H was only a 4-point loss, which came without Ball and Miller available. Full-strength Hornets are a different animal.

They’re also riding a 6-game win streak, with big statement wins against the Spurs and the 76ers. Confidence is high, momentum is real.

As for Brandon Miller — this one feels clean.  
He’s gone 20+ points in his last 10 games (10/10), and this Hornets squad is flat-out dangerous when healthy. His role is locked, usage is there, and 20 points should be very easy in this spot.

The goalie matchup here is most likely Saros vs Hofer. If that’s the case, this will be the 4th time these teams and goalies have matched up this season. In those games, the total goals scores is 9, 7, and 5. 

In the last month, Saros has been averaging 3.35 goals against and under .900 save percentage. The last game he gave up less than 3 goals was against the Blackhawks on 1/10. The o5.5 goals has hit in 7 of the last 9 Predators games.

At this point, the Blues season is over and while Hofer is the better goalie, he doesn’t have a lot to work with. He had a pretty good GAA of 2.69, but in his last 2 games, he gave up 4 goals each. The o5.5 goals has gone 4-0 in the Blues last 4 games.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: 🏀 UNC -5.5 alt spread + Charleston Southern -9.5 alt spread (-135).

Game 1 starts at 6pm EST. Bet 2.5u

Writeup: Let’s go back to what we know with some alt parlays (and hopefully stay there). We’ll start with Charleston Southern vs Gardner-Webb. This one is simple, as Charleston Southern is simply better in every way. Gardner-Webb is literally rated the 3rd worst team overall in men’s college hoops. The only thing that gives me a slight pause is that, while Gardner-Webb has a 3-20 record, they have played far better quality of opponents compared to Charleston Southern. Even still, this Charleston Southern defense should be quite stifling, and with the 14th fastest paced offense in the league, they are bound to get many points in transition. I’ll put some respect on the fact that Garnder-Webb is used to playing far better opponents (considering how bad they are), so we’ll bring the spread down to -9.5.

Now for UNC. The big advantage here will be the Tarheel’s offense against Syracuse’s defense, who have a top 20 offense and a defense below top 60, respectively. UNC should also have a huge offensive rebounding advantage, allowing for multiple second chance opportunities. UNC is also one of the best teams in the country playing at home, and while playing much better ball as of late, I expect a solid showing from them. Syracuse has been a bit more consistent this season, so just to be safe, we’ll drop the spread down to -5.5.

**Write Up:** We&#x27;ve got one more Monday match to round out the EPL weekend as 11th place Sunderland host 19th place Burnley at the Stadium of Lights in a battle of teams who were promoted this season. A win here for Sunderland puts them in 8th place and, believe it or not, this newly promoted team is in striking range of European football for next season. Burnley are fighting for their lives at 11 points from safety, at this point it will take a special run of form to pull themselves out of the bottom 3. 

Brobbey has been on a great run of form at Sunderland&#x27;s first choice striker, scoring a goal in 3 of their last 4 matches. While his shot volume is not huge, he has a great SOT conversion rate on his shots. He&#x27;s a willing runner, chasing everything sent his way and great both with his feet and in the air. He didn&#x27;t take over as Sunderland&#x27;s main striker until midway through the year, so while the numbers aren&#x27;t huge, he has looked great over the last few weeks. 

I also like this play because Burnley concede the most SOTs in the EPL and it&#x27;s not particularly close, at 140 so far this year. They also struggle against center forwards - recent notable matchups were conceding 2 SOTs to Ekitike on 6 shots, 7 SOTs to Sesko on 8 shots (2 goals), and 2 SOTs to Wissa on 4 shots. I think there&#x27;s great value here given the data and current form of Brobbey.

•The only way I don&#x27;t see UNC winning this one here is because they are overlooking Syracuse and focused on Duke - Carolina is easily the better team here, and playing at home - Since Carolina&#x27;s little 3 game bad skid, losing to SMU, Stanford, and California, they have been playing like the Carolina everyone knows - They rank better than Syracuse in about every category, but the one team stat that stands out to me here is rebounding - UNC is top 30 in the country in rebounding while Syracuse is not even top 200 - I believe Wilson and Veesar will be able to handle Syracuse&#x27;s Freeman - without Freeman, this team is not very good - I don&#x27;t see my Tarheels dropping this one at home - They average 83 PPG while Syracuse averages 75.8 PPG - Wilson and Veesar will be able to put the team on their back and continue winning 

•Kansas is hot, and playing their best ball yet this year - However, Kansas does not perform as well on the road as they do at home - I like this spot for Texas Tech, whom, is coming off a loss just a few days ago to UCF on the road - Looking at both offenses PPG, Texas Tech is at 84 PPG while Kansas is at 78.8 PPG, but that number is slightly higher because of how well they play at home - Look for Texas Tech to win the rebound game, and look for them to stay hot from beyond the arc - Tech is ranked top 15 in the country in 3pt FG % while Kansas is just below top 50 - Kansas is 3-3 on the road this year while Tech is 11-0 at home - Kansas only has one good win on the road this season, which came back in November when they played at Tennessee 

•Smaller writeup for this one unfortunately because of a busier afternoon/night ahead of me, so I apologize for that - I just wanted to make sure I got the play out for you guys and some information behind why I am choosing this

It assigns ELO ratings to players and projects a win chance based on the combined ELO ratings of the players on each team. TeamReddit is projecting a 62% win chance here which creates value here on the ML.</td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>

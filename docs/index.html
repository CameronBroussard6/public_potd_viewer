Net Units: +0.42

*Prev <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> : United Total over 1.5 goals @ 1.74 (1u) --&gt; Loss \[Still cant believe how united couldn&#x27;t score even after having 1 man extra for a good part of the game. Just disappointed &amp; I apologize for the loss\]*

Cricket | Women&#x27;s Big Bash League | Adelaide Strikers (W) vs Brisbane Heat (W) | in \~6.5hrs

Adelaide Strikers (W) Win @ 1.65 (1u)

Write Up: While both these teams are at the bottom of the table, Adelaide still has a good team &amp; has won a match &amp; been unlucky with rain spoiling their chances in 2 matches +their previous match was a close 1 run loss. Dont expect them to lose to a clearly poor Brisbane team

BoL &amp; lets hope to turn it around</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>**POTD Record:** 7-4 (Avg Odds +113)

**Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Iliman Ndiaye 1+ SOT (+105) ❌️

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s Event:** UEFA Champions League | Chelsea vs Barcelona (12:00 PM PST)

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Enzo Fernandez 1+ SOT (+100) 1 unit to win 1 units

**Write Up:** So I&#x27;ve never seen that before. A 13 minute red card for an Everton player slapping his own teammate. Obviously this really gutted our chances as Ndiaye shifted to a quasi-right back and Everton saw very little of the ball. Bummer too because he had a great chance early and was looking sharp. Fun fact, that was the 3rd time in Premier league history a player has been sent off for hitting a teammate. 3 times in 33 years. Anyways enough harping on that, on to the next. 

In other news...guys...they&#x27;re giving us Enzo 1+ SOT at plus money again. We&#x27;ve cashed this twice already in the last month and all of the same stats/data/feelings apply. 

Off we go back to London where Chelsea hosts Barcelona in the Champions League match of the week. As you all know, Barcelona is a great team. However, they have been leaky defensively over the last few matches, particularly in UCL, notably conceding 3 goals (6 SOT) to Brugge in their last CL match and 7 SOT to an injury ridden PSG. Both teams will want a win here, but I like Chelsea to show up here in front of their home crowd. 

The caveat here is that **there is a non-zero chance that coach rotates some players** around for this mid week match as he has been known to do, but I really can&#x27;t see him leaving out Enzo for a match this big. Even if he does come in as a sub, he will want to make an impact quickly and go for goal. 

In case you want more #s, this has hit in his last 2/2 UCL matches (including the last match where he came on as a sub) and in his last 6/6 EPL matches (averaging 3 shots per game, just under 2 on target). 

**UCL and Europa matches are tough to predict**, squads get rotated, flukes happen, so mind your units. But I like our guy here again in this huge match, and I&#x27;m riding the Enzo train until the wheels fall off. BOL if tailing!</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>**Analking&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick of the day</mark>!!**

**POTD Record:** 0-1

**ROI** -100%

**Last Pick:** Manchester United vs Everton, Man Utd to win ❌

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s Event:** UEFA Champions League | Galatasaray vs Union Saint-Gilloise (17.45 GMT)

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Galatasaray to WIN! 1€ to win 1.69€

**Write Up:** Well my first <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> went wrong. But let&#x27;s not get depressed because of that and I got another one coming here. Here is the reasoning for my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>: 

If we look at the stats, this matchup is in Galatasaray’s favour. Their great attacking, strong defensive team play in past couple of weeks and UNBEATEN home record give them a clear edge. Union SG’s defensive unreliability, combined with their inconsistent away form, increases the difficulty of their mission to win or take points in Istanbul.

Galatasaray are currently one of the hottest home sides across Europe - unbeaten in nine straight matches - and they are well-positioned to extend their Champions League winning streak to FOUR consecutive games.

Few reasons why I expect that Galatasaray Will win:

Galatasaray has three consecutive wins in last 3 rounds of UCL and are still unbeaten on home soil this whole season, with a record of NINE MATCHES WITHOUT A DEFEAT ACROSS ALL COMPETITIONS! Thats a crazy stat IMO! Also to add, USG has three back to back losses on UCL this season.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Galatasaray to Win.**


BOL, let,s turn the record to 1-1! 

ps. sorry if the text is not perfect in english, english is not my native language.</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>**POTD Record:**  95 – 62 - 9

**Previous:**  Hajduk Split Double Chance &amp; Over 1.5 Total Goals - LOSS

**Recap:**  Single worst beat ever.  Best team in the league vs one of the worst and they lost by 5-0.  Absolute thrashing even suspect at times.  Hadjuk’s defense was passing the ball directly to the attackers right in front of the box.  Just a brutal lack of concentration and effort.

**New Event:**  UCL Man City vs Leverkusen &amp; Marseille vs Newcastle

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:**  Man City -1 Asian Handicap  &amp; Newcastle Double Chance @ 1.80 (Usual 3 units)

**WARNING:**  DO NOT TAIL ME.  I am on 3 game losing streak on <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>. 

**Leg 1 :  Manchester City -1 Asian Handicap vs Leverkusen**

* City lost to Newcastle this past weekend by 2-1 in a fantastic match and are looking to bounce back strong and with good reason.
* City are 23-0 home games without defeat in the Champions League league phase/group stage - winning 20 of them.
* City have found the back of the net at least twice in each of their seven straight wins at the Etihad.
* Earlier this month City beat Dortmund by 4-1 in a match with similar circumstances.
* Leverkusen’s team is riddled with injuries and suspensions making this a lopsided affair favoring City.
* Erling Haaland faced Leverkusen 4 times during his Dortmund days and scored 4 goals against them.

**Leg 2 – Newcastle Double Chance vs Marseille**

* Newcastle are riding high off a tremendous win against City this past weekend.
* Newcastle have lost only twice in their last 13 Champions League away matches.
* Marseille have not won a single match of their last 12 matches against English teams. 
* Marseille have many injuries and one suspension whereas Newcastle’s starting 11 against Man City should take the field.

Once again, all I can do is take the teams in better form and with higher probabilities of giving us a win.  It seems is has not been happening for me lately but fortune has not been kind to many others on <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> either.

The two teams have been consistently covering this line with Southport at home covering in 9/12 competitive games this season, Radcliffe in 7/11 away games, with all away games for them going over 2.5 goals. The two sides already met this season at Southport&#x27;s home in a 3-2 win for Southport. Last season, this line covered twice between them in 4-1 and 2-2 scorelines.</td></tr>

**League - Champions  League**

**Game: Chelsea Vs Barcelona** 

**Time: 3:00 pm EST**

**-----------------**

**Champions League is back baby!! Keeping it in keeper markets <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> to keep the streak going (see what i did there lol).**



**Sanchez has played 3 Champions League games and covered this line in 2/3  of those games.**

**Saves: 1, 3, 3**

Barcelona are going to put pressure on that Chelsea goal to keep their Champions League dream alive. Chelsea structurally will give up more than enough chances to cover this line.

It should be an open game on both ends with Sanchez having to be at his best to keep this Barca side out. With both teams currently 11th and 12th in the table, shots will fly.

**Anyway BOL**</td></tr>

Sport: Tennis Tournament: Athens 2 Challenger Time: 3:30AM est

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Carlo Alberto Caniato ML -154 1u
(Playable up to -180)

Reasoning: absolutely love the young Italian in this spot. He’s very talented (mainly a clay courter) and now he’s having a breakthrough year putting his hard court game together too finally. He had a great showing two weeks ago on the Sentra hard courts where he claimed the title. His performance in the finals *really* impressed me against his biggest step up in completion vs Bailly. He’s had two weeks now to acclimatize to the conditions for Athens 2 so championship hangover won’t be a factor. He’ll be super motivated to continue his great form into this challenger tournament with more ranking points and prize money as incentive.

James Story. 24 year old British ITF hard court farmer. Better doubles player than he is a singles player. He’ll be playing doubles here too so he’s got a built in fall-back mentally (and financially) knowing he has a doubles game the following day. He does ok farming low level M25 hard court tourneys but He’s only played *TWO* challenger level singles this year on hard courts beating Silvestre as a -10000 favourite and then loses the next game to Sakellaridis as a -500 favourite… He’ll be exposed tomorrow and Caniato will show levels on the outdoor harcourts of Athens 2.

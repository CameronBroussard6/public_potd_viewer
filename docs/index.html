Yesterday’s Pick: (NBA) Dallas Mavericks +5.5 vs Los Angeles Lakers (-138) ❌

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: (NFL) Los Angeles Rams vs Seattle Seahawks under 47.5 points (-140) (6:30 PM EST)**

Reasoning: Line opened at 47.5, now 45.5. First meeting between these two teams this season, the total was set at 49 and the game finished 21-19. Second meeting was a high scoring game however the score was 23-14 after 3 quarters before a 28 point burst in the 4th and OT. Highly doubt that type of outburst will be replicated <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> in a playoff setting. Seahawks have #1 scoring defense in the league and held Stafford to less than 150 yards already this season. The Rams defense has caused trouble for Sam Darnold as well, having thrown 4 interceptions against them earlier this year. All in all, I believe this line is inflated due to the 75 point game these two teams played in week 17. I expect a low scoring game here so I’m playing under 47.5 points. ***purposely taking u47.5 alternate number bc 47 is a KEY number in NFL totals***

**Write Up:** 

Arsenal will win the Premier League 2025/2026 title. It&#x27;s a fantastic team featuring some of the best defensive performances we have seen over the last 15 years in the EPL and perhaps unprecedented squad depth.  
It is hard to bet against them however humour me:

* **Arsenal&#x27;s offence is not ticking in the EPL**. Specifically this team is not great (or even above average) with attacking low blocks, not even at home. The last opponent Arsenal has beaten with +2 goal differential in the EPL - except the cathartic display against Villa at home which will be regarded as the statement/signature victory against the boogie opponent when the story is told of this championship run  -  is Brentford in R14.
* **Manchester United has underperformed this season according to the xG metrics**.  This team is actually above Arsenal in the total xG created this EPL season (according to Fotmob) !  Bruno Fernandes is creating chances left and right and of course they are especially deadly on the counter as we saw perfectly well against City.
   * Man Utd defence was leaky all season against bad teams (**where they cannot set up in low block and wait**) and together with their bad execution in front of goal it created an underwhelming season for them to date, leading to the sack of Amorim. **However given all that, Man Utd is still \~top 5 in the rankings.**
* **Manchester United scored in 11 straight games. Furthermore they scored in 18 of last 19 games,** they only failed to score in that aberration of a match against Everton where Everton got the red card and outjerked them somehow. They are scoring against bad teams, they are scoring against good teams. The fact is, this is a good attacking team and they will even get better when luck turn and they start putting away the chances.
   * Given United scores, Arsenal needs 3 goals to beat +1 handicap goal line. I don&#x27;t see this happening at the moment.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: **Southern Illinois -2.5 (-115 FanDuel) 1U**

Event: CBB | Southern Illinois @ Evansville (4 pm EST) | 🏀

*Recap: What a fun game. Wofford trailed by seven at the break, then led by 10 with four minutes to go in regulation, then held on for a 70-67 win and sweet, sweet cash in my first plus-money <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>. That&#x27;s four wins in a row.... I&#x27;ve got a crippling ice storm bearing down on me. Let&#x27;s see if my picks stay hot.*

First prediction: this could be sweaty as hell. Second prediction: Southern Illinois will use this as a get-right game. The Salukis (8-12) have been slip sliding away with four consecutive losses, although three have come by six points or fewer. The one that wasn&#x27;t? A 70-57 road loss at Illinois-Chicago. And if we&#x27;re comparing common opponents, UIC beat Evansville by 27 on Jan. 20. As I write this, Southern Illinois&#x27; moneyline is -162. They are 5-1 straight up when favored by -160 or higher, suggesting that they generally take care of business when they&#x27;re the better team on paper - even in this lost season. Southern Illinois is also a respectable 4-5 against the spread on the road, and this is an incredibly favorable road game. Evansville (5-15) is just 3-7 at home with wins over storied programs like Calumet College, Oakland City College, and Ball State.

The Purple Aces are bad. Real bad. They&#x27;re 1-9 over the last 10 games. The lone win came against an Indiana State team that shot 17 percent from beyond the arc, 39 percent from the field, and still only lost by 3. Otherwise, Evansville simply cannot put the ball through the basket, and they don&#x27;t get second chances or fast breaks. They are 338th in scoring average, and it&#x27;s not like they play slow. KenPom ranks Evansville&#x27;s adjusted tempo 145th. The shooting is just not there. Evansville is 324th from the field (42.1 percent), 326th from beyond the arc (30.8 percent), 293rd in rebounding, 324th in offensive rebounding, 302nd in steals, and 338th in turnovers. In short, the shots don&#x27;t fall and there are no second chances off the glass or easy chances off the break. It&#x27;s no wonder they&#x27;ve won five games all year.

Meanwhile, KenPom ranks Southern Illinois higher in overall strength (136 to 287), offensive rating (226 to 334), and defensive rating (75 to 180). If home teams generally get 3-4 points, then this line indicates two even sides. But the numbers don&#x27;t tell it. Southern Illinois will push the ball. Their adjusted tempo is 79th in the nation. They will likely shoot better (46.3 percent - 197 spots better than Evansville). They rebound better (54th in NCAA). They create possessions (85th in steals), which translates to being the number one fast-break team in the Missouri Valley Conference. How is this a one possession game?

Devil&#x27;s Advocate: there is some injury concern for Southern Illinois. Guards Isaiah Stafford and Quel&#x27;Ron House are both listed as questionable for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>’s game. House is the Salukis&#x27; leading scorer at 13.7 ppg. He played 35 minutes in a 3-point loss to Drake on Jan. 14, but has missed the previous two games. Despite his absence, Southern Illinois played 18-win Belmont within five points on Jan. 17 thanks to 20-point games by Jalen Haynes and Drew Steffe. Southern Illinois has depth and spreads the wealth on offense. They&#x27;ve got seven players - other than House - that are averaging seven points or more. If House plays, it just bolsters my thesis that the better team can cover one possession against a dog water team. When it comes down to it, Southern Illinois has had a poor season, but their losses look better, and the statistical averages lean their way in almost every metric. Evansville *does* shoot the 3 better, but that&#x27;s about all they do better. I&#x27;ll highlight rebounding for a moment. Southern Illinois is third in the MVC in rebounding while Evansville is dead last. I think SIU will clean up misses and transition quickly against a team that ranks near the bottom of the MVC in allowing points in the paint.

Looking at historical data, Southern Illinois is 7-3 over its last 10 games at Evansville, including six wins in a row. The winning margins in those six games: 9, 12, 27, 2, 4 (OT), 7. Better yet, Southern Illinois has covered the spread in five of its last six games played at the Ford Center, including the previous three. The last time Evansville covered was 2018. This season, Evansville is 3-5 ATS at home. They covered their last game out, but failed the previous three games. My thesis is simple: Southern Illinois is limping into a get-right game. They&#x27;ve done well against good teams - and even beat MVC-leading Belmont back on Jan. 4. If House plays, I see Southern Illinois feasting against an Evansville team that cannot score and *will* get outrebounded.

Good luck and Godspeed!

Stupid of me to trust Elche, I switched to Elche to score a goal which was great odds and hit but I didn’t change it here which is stupid on my part. I’ll never do that again because it’s scummy.
I like this one a lot. I’m on the road so I don’t have the specific data to back this up but real Oviedo is a really tough team to beat. Even if they’re last place right now, they’re fighters. Barca also aren’t really known lately for being that dominant in the first half, they’ve been scoring most of their goals lately LATE in the second half of games which is why I think this one should hit.

Edit: For some reason it was +1.0 and not 0.5 so the odds would&#x27;ve been higher for 0.5 if anyone had it and took it.</td></tr>

Competition: Premier League

Reasoning: Chelsea double chance covers the away-game variance while still leaning on their squad-quality edge over Palace. Under 3.5 goals fits the likely script: Palace games are rarely high-scoring blowouts, and Chelsea away tend to control matches without turning them into chaos.

Team Campbell are coming off a brutal 11-3 loss to Team Stevens while Team Reese-Hansen had a bye yesterday. Mackenzie, the BC lead had a great game Friday night and was making everything, regardless of the shot called. She should out play her counterpart, Demmans, which is a big advantage for Team Reese-Hansen. Campbell herself had an awful game last night, missing almost every raise/take out that she attempted. The Saskatchewan rink doesn&#x27;t have a chance to keep this one close if she looks anything like she did last night. Team Reese-Hansen are 31-6 this year against teams outside the world top 25.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Florida Panthers vs Chicago Blackhawks at 7:00pm EST (NHL/Hockey)

Matthew Tkachuk over 2.5 shots (-130)

Panthers are not in a playoff spot right now and Florida&#x27;s coach needs to overuse his best players. Tkachuk has hit that line in 2 of his last 3 games ever since he came back from injury and you can see he&#x27;s getting back to his dominant form. He&#x27;s still looking for his first goal and if you watched yesterday&#x27;s game, he&#x27;s clearly trying to get the monkey off his back. What makes me confident about this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> though is that Tkachuk literally dominates when he plays against Chicago. 10 of his last 12 games vs the Blackhawks went over the 2.5 line easily. If you look at those games, he had 5+ shots in more than half of them. 

Blackhawks are 5th worst in the league in shots allowed this season and in their last 10 games vs the Panthers they allowed **37 shots on goal on average!!** Panthers did play yesterday but Tkachuk only played 3 games this season so there shouldn&#x27;t be too much fatigue from him.

BOL or fade me to oblivion!</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>Record 9-3 

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Chet Holmgreen over 9.5 rebounds**

The raptors currently are short handed of a center, Jakob Poetl being out has actually been a huge huge blow for them due to the fact they don&#x27;t have a traditional center aka a 7 footer. While Sando and Collin have been doing a very good job on the glass there is only so much you can do at 6,9 and 6,7. 

This is evident with them losing a lot of games where centers flourish because of this whether it be from offensive rebounding or due to a pure mis match. Here is some evidence to prove this, Donavon Clingan 13 points 16 rebounds and 8 being offensive rebounds, also the first quarter he had 7 rebounds. Dylan Cardwell third string center but 6,11 had 25 minutes and 7 offensive boards and ended on 13 rebounds. Quenten Post had a fair few offensive boards as well, however his role is to mainly box out and raptors scored majority of the points, Ayton yes this soft ass got 13 boards and 25 points. Zubac had 16 points and 14 rebounds as well.

Now why do I like this spot? Because OKC is already so shorthanded Chet Holmgreen will get minutes regardless of his performance furthermore he is a key piece on defence and offence. I think 10 rebounds is very fair, assuming he is active on the glass and hustling.</td></tr>

Writeup: Trying a parlay of player props. Please wait for the lineups, if ur bookie doesnt give a refund for non starting players

Leg 1 - Caicedo has been more involved for Chelsea in the final third this season, with the Blues increasingly coming up against stubborn low blocks which allow him to step into forward areas. Caicedo has taken 14 shots across his 16 starts in the Premier League this season with 10 of these efforts coming from outside of the box.

Leg 2 - Thiaw has had 14 shots across his 18 Premier League appearances for Newcastle this season  which is a brilliant record for a centre back. Thiaw has had a shot in three of his last five league appearances. Newcastle are averaging 7.45 corners per game at St James’ Park this season, so we can expect Thiaw to have chances to get into the box here and get a header (has an aerial win rate of just under 70%)

TNT Tropang Giga vs San Miguel Beermen

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: UNDER 195.5**

Finals Defense is Tough Defense: In the finals, every single point matters. Both teams are likely to be playing super tight, physical defense. There&#x27;s less room for easy baskets because the coaches have their players focused on shutting down the other side.

Looking at Game 1: The first game of the series actually ended with a total of only 187 points. That&#x27;s significantly under the 195.5 mark. That game showed just how defensive this matchup can be when both sides bring their A-game.

Slowing the Game Down: This isn&#x27;t just about fast breaks and shooting threes. The coaches are likely to play a more tactical game, using up the shot clock and trying to engineer perfect shots. A slower pace naturally means fewer total points get scored.

The Coaches&#x27; Comments: Even the coaches are emphasizing defense. After San Miguel won Game 2, their coach pointed out that their defense was the main reason they took the win. When defense is the main topic in press conferences, you know it&#x27;s going to be a key part of their strategy going forward.</td></tr>

I don’t have a big write up <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> but a Rice shot on goal seems like pretty good value considering how consistent he has been with it in recent months. Zubumendi getting comfortable in an Arsenal shirt has been massively helpful in letting him have even more freedom to go forward. 

*His shots are almost all the same:*

* Right footed
* On the edge or just outside the box
* Centrally or just slightly to the left 

If you look at the shots United has faced a lot recently, a lot of them come from that area. 

I just assume United will have to defend a lot and sit deep, relying on counter attacks like they did against City last week. However, Arsenal is not as pathetic as what City are at the moment and should be able to keep hold of the ball better than what CIty did and get into better shooting positions than what City could. 

Rice also has a decent record against United despite failing to have any  of his three attempts on target when he played them in the season opener, before that he had: *1(Goal), 2(As a sub), 0 (But had two attempts + an assist in this game), 1, 1 (Scored).* </td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>: Portsmouth vs. Southampton gg@1.71✅

Portsmouth drew (1-1) with &quot;gold&quot; at Watford&#x27;s home ground, which generally had a good image and mainly appeared to be read, which allowed them to successfully face the opponents&#x27; trump cards for a long time. All the great things happened in the last twenty minutes, with Pompey initially finding a goal in the 73rd minute and the hosts then equalizing in the 79th minute. In the last quarter, Watford looked for the turnaround, but it did not come.

Southampton secured a &quot;professional&quot; 1-0 victory over Sheffield United on Wednesday night. The goal that decided the match came in the 7th minute, with the &quot;Saints&quot; controlling the pace for most of the match and essentially taking the game to the tempo that suited them.

Both teams are eagerly awaiting the big derby. The home team is looking for a win that will boost their standings and morale, while the visitors started the season with goals and ambitions, but their results are not in line with their quality. The only thing that is certain is that it will be a game with increased intensity and the ambiguity has a good chance of being confirmed since neither of the two defenses is showing any confidence.
Because of the defenses and their mistakes, I bet on both teams to score.

Matt Stafford 1st TD (Rushing) parlayed: +23150
Units: 5u (Max Play)

Write Up:
If you don’t like free money, this isn’t for you.

Let’s talk patterns.

Over the past three seasons, teams wearing darker uniforms in early-window games score first at a higher rate. Both of my guys check that box.

The Patriots are at their best when they establish Rhamondre early. When he gets fed on the first two drives, touchdowns follow. That’s not a theory - that’s film.

The Rams are coming off a win, which means confidence is high and the playbook opens up. McVay gets creative when he’s rolling. That’s when the misdirection comes out.

Momentum matters.

Rhamondre:
There’s been tension behind the scenes involving Henderson and Vrabel. When Vrabel wants to send a message, he does it on the field. That means establishing the run early and letting his most trusted back eat.

Opening drive. Inside the 10. No cute stuff.
Rhamondre punches it in.

Also fun fact: Stevenson hasn’t gone back-to-back games without being featured early all season. This is a feature game.

Stafford:
Everyone sees him as a passer. That’s why this works.

He hasn’t had a rushing TD in forever. He’s due.
Defense sells out.
Play-action. Boot.
Six points.

Stafford’s last goal-line keeps all came off broken coverage or misdirection. Same OC. Same look. Same result.

Designed. Practiced. Executed.

Why This Works:
• Stevenson = usage + coaching message
• Stafford = script + momentum
• Situational trends align
• Both tied to opening-drive intent

This is a setup play, not a lottery ticket.

5 units. Full confidence.

Start Time &amp; TV 3:00pm EST (CBS)

Units: 4.25 Units

Reasoning: For this Championship Sunday <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick of the day</mark> we will be going with the New England Patriots (16-3) over the Denver Broncos (15-3). Drake Maye has been having a sensational year in his sophomore campaign. He has thrown for over 4800 yards this season with an extremely efficient completion percentage over 70 percent, he has thrown for 35 touchdowns on just 10 interceptions and he is averaging 9 yards per attempt. This Patriots offense ranks much higher than the Broncos offense as they are 4th in the NFL in passing yards per game, while the Broncos are in 17th place, this New England rushing attack is solid ranking 6th in rushing yards per game while the Broncos rank in 16th place and they are in second place in points scored per game tallying 29 points per game while the Broncos are in 14th place scoring 23 points per game. My key factor in this one is how the Denver Broncos will be without their starting quarterback Bo Nix as he broke his ankle in end of the Bills game so they will be going with backup quarterback Jarrett Stidham. Stidham hasnt thrown a pass in the regular season since the 2023 season and in that 2023 season he did not have impressive numbers so I think it will be hard for him to get up to game speed against a very good Patriots defense. This Patriots defense that he is going up against is a very strong defense as they rank 6th in rushing yards allowed per game, 9th in passing yards allowed per game and 4th in points allowed per game as they only allow 18 points per game. They have been red hot in the playoffs so far as they only allowed 3 points to the Chargers in the wild card round and they made CJ Stroud look like an XFL quarterback in the divisional round as they picked him off four times in the first half of the game so I expect them to make things tough on Stidham in this one. With all of this in mind I like the Patriots to take this one by more than a field goal.

Prediction: 26-14 Patriots

Write Up: I&#x27;m still fuming about that Rosario Central loss. Leading 1-0 until the 88th minute and then conceding two in sixty seconds is the kind of stuff that makes you want to retire from betting. But we don&#x27;t tilt, we find value.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> I’m going with Brentford at home against Nottingham Forest. The math here is simple: if you look at the home-only table, Brentford is the 4th best team in the league. They’ve turned their stadium into a total fortress (7-3-1 record this season).

On the other side, you have a Forest team under Sean Dyche that’s hovering just above the relegation zone. They’ll probably try to park the bus, but Brentford’s high press and set-piece efficiency are built to break down exactly this kind of opponent. Even without their old stars, the system Andrews has in place is top-tier. Getting nearly evens (1.90) for a top-4 home side against the 17th in the league is a gift from the bookies. 3 units to get us back to green.

**Write-up:** JSN has covered this line in both games against the Rams this season. He is 13 out of 18 on the season. He is averaging 100 receiving yards this season. Rams have a mediocre passing defense. They have just allowed Odunze, Moore, Coker, and McMillan to all go over their lines during this playoff run. JSN lines up in the wideout slot majority of the time, where Rams rank 25th in defense. Rams also play a ton of zone defense, at 80% of snaps. JSN is averaging 3.84 yards per route against zone coverage. This season versus bottom 20th ranked zone defenses, JSN has went over in 6 out of 7 games. Without Tory Horton and Zach Charbonnet, I think the Seahawks are going to utilize JSN in this spot. He has been consistent all year. Combined with the recent data showing the Rams getting burned by multiple wide receivers, I have to take the Seahawks No. 1 weapon <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.

Writeup: Taking a shot at the AFC championship in this one. I’ll keep it short and simple. The Broncos defense has been one of the best in the league, yet it isn’t talked about enough how their secondary gets absolutely torched whenever they play against an elite QB. Considering Patriots QB Drake Maye is the reincarnation of Tom Brady, yeah I would say he’s an elite QB. The Broncos love playing 1on1 coverages considering their large amount of talent, but this has made them quite susceptible to the deep ball. The Patriots never truly have an alpha receiver for a game, which helps us here as Broncos CB Pat Surtain’s role of locking down the alpha WR doesn’t really matter here - any Pats receiver can catch the deep ball. Oh, and I forgot to mention that Drake Maye has statistically been the best deep ball thrower in the league this year. He’ll launch one for 36 or more yards in this one.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>: Netherlands | Eredevisie | 1045 Eastern | Feyenoord vs Heracles | BTTS O 2.5 goals | 2U @ -105

Feyenoord vs Heracles sets up as a favorable matchup for goals, with the numbers supporting both BTTS and over 2.5 goals.

Head-to-head meetings between these sides have consistently produced high-scoring games. Feyenoord regularly score multiple goals against Heracles, and while Heracles often lose these matches, they have still managed to find the net in several recent meetings. The overall trend points toward games comfortably reaching three or more goals.

From a recent and season-long form perspective, Feyenoord remain one of the Eredivisie’s most aggressive attacking teams, particularly at home. They maintain a high tempo even when leading, which keeps matches open and totals elevated. Defensively, they can allow chances, especially against teams that counter quickly.

Heracles continue to struggle defensively, especially away from home, but they do create scoring opportunities and rarely sit back once they concede. Their matches often become stretched, increasing the likelihood of goals at both ends.

There are no significant weather concerns expected, and no major attacking absences reported that would materially reduce goal expectation.

Overall, this matchup profiles as a Feyenoord-controlled game with enough attacking intent and defensive vulnerability on both sides to support BTTS and over 2.5 goals as a logical, data-backed play.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:**  Kenneth Walker III Over 20.5 Receiving Yards @ 1.88 (4 units)

It is not that difficult to ignore all of the suggestions coming from so many pundits on websites, podcasts and videos suggesting their angles with analysis.  All I do is take in so much info that eventually it becomes clear which ones don’t make that much sense and then I can focus on a chosen few to eventually narrow it down to one and share here on <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>.    If you think about it, every single prop can go either way for any number of reasons.  That is why this is called gambling and that is why everyone on <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> needs to do their own research.  Doesn’t take long to find reasons to like or dislike a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>.  When you have personal conviction, it is easier to tail someones suggestion.

What noone is allowed to do, is launch a personal attack when said <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> loses.  I don’t ask for tips, so this is not about me, but guys please, adopt some bankroll management as boring as it sounds.  The whole YOLO mindset does not work in the long run.  You can’t bet your rent money or get into debt over what is nothing more than a game of “Clue”.  In this instance I’m guessing it’s Ken Walker III with receptions over 20.5 at home in Seattle. 

Here are the reasons:

* The Rams have yielded over 21.5 receiving yards to a running back in a game in 10 games this season.
* The Seahawks use play-action at the 9^(th) highest rate in the league and Charbonet has been the beneficiary.
* KW has seen increased pass usage since Charbonnet has been out.
* KW has gone over this line in 3 of his last 5 games with 64, 36 and 29 yards.
* In week 11 vs the Rams, KW had 44 receiving yards.
* KW’s 2025 season high was in Week 16 against the Rams with 64 receiving yards.
* The Rams defense ranks 22^(nd) allowing receptions to backs on checkdowns and screens.
* From Week 11 through the Divisional Round, Walker had a 34% participation rate, a 9.4% target share, 25 targets, 23 receptions, 25.3 receiving yards per game and 9.91 yards per reception.
* In the two games against the Rams this season, Walker had a 33% route participation rate, 8% target share, 108 receiving yards, and 18.00 yards per reception.
* In the previous 2 meetings the Rams did not have an answer for Walker in the passing game.

I think this is a modest line given Charbonet is out.

This is supposed to be a fun past time, not a business.  If you think it is business, think again. The books have way more of an edge than you will ever have and will win in the long run.  Have some fun, and don&#x27;t be foolish please.</td></tr>

**Rugby | France  TOP 14 | 25 january 3:30 PM CET (central european time)**

**Write-up :**  
I&#x27;m locking in the over 53.5 points for the Toulon vs Montpellier Top 14 clash because the odds have plummeted from 4.30 to 1.86, screaming sharp action and likely some late team news favoring a shootout. Toulon at home is a scoring machine, averaging around 39 points per game at Stade Mayol, with recent blowouts like 62-22 against Bayonne and 45-34 vs Bath showing their attacking firepower. Montpellier&#x27;s away defense is leaky as hell, conceding big in road games, and their own attack can keep up, leading to high totals. Looking at H2H, Toulon&#x27;s last home thrashing of Montpellier was 54-7, easily clearing 53.5 with room to spare. Both squads are mid-table scrappers without a lockdown mentality, so expect open, running rugby rather than a grind. January weather in Toulon is typically mild and dry, perfect for fast-paced play without mud slowing things down. Key stars like Toulon&#x27;s backline are reported fit, boosting their try-scoring potential. The line feels soft for these two—Top 14 games often explode when favorites like Toulon push the tempo. My real take: This has all the makings of a 35-25 type scoreline, and the value at 1.86 is too good to pass up. **If you&#x27;re skeptical i always recommend picking the live over if the game starts slow and the line drops down.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Chelsea Over 4.5 Corners @ 1.64 ✅**

**Confidence: 85 %**

**Details : Premier League  - Crystal Palace VS Chelsea   - 10:00 AM EST**

**---**



**---**

Chelsea are coming into this game after putting up 12 corners against pafos, now they&#x27;re facing much tougher opposition here but considering Palace have 0 wins in their last 10 games, lost their captain and best defender, and manager looking to bounce in the summer, the structure isn&#x27;t stable.

Now when looking at corner matchup, unlike city, Chelsea play wide and there&#x27;s a big emphasis on wing play that forces set pieces. They&#x27;ve now scored the second most goals in the league from corners and will look to utilize that for an early lead and if pressure builds late on they will rain.

Chelsea have covered this line in 3/5 of their last 5 Prem games, averaging 6.8 corners per game.

Bublik&#x27;s playing great right now and when he&#x27;s locked in he&#x27;s kind of like a marginally worse version of sinner. He has great movement for a tall guy with very solid groundstrokes and a huge serve. He&#x27;s beaten demon past 2 times on hardcourt, and this is the late match so the heat will be less of an issue. DeMinaur is very consistent with a high floor and relatively low ceiling but Bublik playing well will beat him. He&#x27;s talked about approaching tennis in a more mature way since he had his kid and has looked very locked in since then. Think he will take this one, not a lock though I&#x27;d give him about a 60% chance to win - you have to play your best to beat deminaur</td></tr>

Tennis | Itajai Challenger | 9:00 AM EST 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Thiago Seyboth Wild vs Adolfo Daniel Vallejo | **Seyboth Wild to win 2-0 at +175. 1 unit.**

Write-up: Riedi unfortunately got hurt again, and was forced to retire from the match. It seemed like most people got their bets voided, which is why I am tracking it as a push for my record. However, feel free to let me know if your bet was resolved as a loss, or you think I should track it differently. I would rather have a record that underestimates my success than one that overstimates it. 

 Thiago Seyboth Wild is no stranger to the big stage, having broken out with a shocking five-set win over Daniil Medvedev at Roland Garros 2023 and beaten top 30 players like Taylor Fritz, Lorenzo Musetti, and Karen Khachanov. A string of poor results in 2025 saw him pushed out of ATP events and into obscurity on the Challenger Tour, so he will now look to rebound in 2026 and get closer to his peak ranking of No. 58 in the world. A title here in Itajai, where he has the home crowd behind his back, seems like the perfect way to kick off that rebound. Seyboth Wild is yet to drop a set in this tournament, spending just 5 hours, 48 minutes on court (compared to Vallejo&#x27;s 6 hours, 35 minutes). He also has earned a strong average performance rating in his matches (7.47 vs 7.05). This trend continues even when adjusting for # of points played in each match (7.46 vs 7.00). Seyboth Wild also has a higher average rating in 3 of 4 categories (serve, forehand, backhand), while Vallejo narrowly edges him on return. This is despite Seyboth Wild only making 54.1% first serves (62.3% avg), while Vallejo has made 58.0% (64.2% avg). Seyboth Wild has played 6 (5 singles + 1 doubles) on Center Court, while this match will take place, while Vallejo has played 3. I expect Thiago&#x27;s aggressive game to be firing from the start, and while Vallejo has enjoyed quite strong form on the Challenger Tour as of late, these feel like the conditions for Seyboth Wild to capitalize. The weather conditions are expected to be hot and humid, but pretty standard for this location, and I wouldn&#x27;t expect that to have a huge effect on the match. The main reason I&#x27;m going for Seyboth Wild 2-0 instead of his ML is that both of these players are big hitters, and this feels like a match where one of them builds confidence early and takes over. Of course, I think that player is more likely to be TSW, and I also felt like he looked a bit better in the defense and touch departments in the semifinals. I also would trust Seyboth Wild&#x27;s fitness and focus a bit less in a tight third set, and so I&#x27;d rather buy into the outcomes where he dominates at a much better price.</td></tr>

Mechelen vs Westerlo, over 3.5 goals @ 2.5

Mechelen vs Westerlo shapes up perfectly for over 3.5 goals. Mechelen’s home matches are often goal festivals, with constant pressure, wide play, and multiple scoring options. Westerlo struggle defensively against high-tempo sides and usually concede early, which opens the game even more. Once Mechelen get ahead, they rarely slow down, and Westerlo’s willingness to attack can easily push the total into a high-scoring outcome.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: LA Rams vs Seattle Seahawks/ Seahawks ML (-138) 3u/ Odds Via FanDuel


Write up: Let’s get back in the win column. The Rams have been on the ropes twice and narrowly escaped defeat against 2 teams that aren’t in the same world as Seattle right now. This is a huge moment for Macdonald and the Seahawks team to return to greatness. Last time they played, Seattle’s offense exploded late despite the defensive shortcomings early on. This defense has looked about as great as you can ask for these last few weeks. Allowing just 9 points to the Niners in 2 games. This will also be a complete home field takeover, given that the rams don’t really have that many fans, and it’s of course in Seattle. Puka was extremely limited last week against a mediocre Bears defense. I expect Seattle to at least slow him down just enough to win this football game. Stafford has also looked a little shady this last month or so. With all things considered, I see Seattle winning this game and advancing to the Super Bowl. Let’s go!!

**Odds:** \+190

**Write Up:** Ohhhh yeahhh we are onto winning ways. Palmeiras looked sharp and converted their chances nicely to see the game out at 3-1, with the high pace of the game it was a breeze for corners, totalling 11 by the close of play - if you took the regular line like I mentioned well done or if you bought down appreciate the tail - either way we cashed!

On to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>todays pick</mark>, their H2H have given us goals for both sides 7/9 matchups; whilst the cards has gone under 5/last 6 for Brentford and 6/last 7 for Forest. Brentford currently sit 8th and Forest in 17th, Nottingham have the quality to score just not seeing results currently, as for Brentford they are in good form consistently finding goals with Thiago upfront being a huge contributor to this. I expect Forest to be wanting to stay clear of the relegation zone and want to put up a fight against a mid-table team. The referee for this match, Samuel Barrott is averaging 4.1 yellow cards this season, and due to the style of football both teams play I expect 2-3 cards but no more. I&#x27;m liking my odds for these, you can also take these as singles if you would like.

I was also leaning towards an NFL <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> but being a Seahawks fan I steered clear, lets hope both the championship games are a good watch! Have a wonderful day folks, lets make some money.

He&#x27;s a bright young star, but he holds the ball a bit too long &amp; doesn&#x27;t have the quickest release. As opposed, Allen is one of the stars of the formidable Bronco defense &amp; he&#x27;ll be facing Wilson (one of the least effective offensive lineman for the Patriots). Furthermore, he&#x27;ll (mostly) be coming from the left side which also sets him up perfectly.

__Event:__ NFL: Patriots @ Broncos 3pm EST

__POTD:__ Rhamondre Stevenson o49.5 rushing yards (-115), 4.6u to win 4u

__Write Up:__ The The New England Patriots (16-3) are traveling to Denver to take on the Broncos (15-3) in the AFC Conference Championship, with the winner earning a ticket to the Super Bowl. In last week’s win against Buffalo, Denver became 12-2 in 1 score games this season. However, QB Bo Nix fractured his ankle ending his season. He will be replaced by backup Jarrett Stidham, who will be playing in his first game this season. He will be come just the 7th QB to start in the playoffs after not starting in the regular season, with the previous 6 having just a 1-5 record. Stidham has just 4 starts in his NFL career with just a 1-3 record. In his career, Stidham has a 4.1% interception rate on 197 passes. That ranks 90th/102 QB’s whove thrown 150+ passes Stidham entered the NFL. But he’s even worse when pressured, completing just 40% of his passes for 5.8 yards per pass &amp; a 20.5% sack rate opposed to 70.7% of his passes for 8.1 yards per pass when not pressured. Now he faces a scary Patriots DLine that has a 52.1% pressure rate so far this playoffs, after a 40.3% pressure rate this year (7th but injured &amp; now healthy). The Pats D has allowed just 6.4 yards per pass (6th) this year, but in the playoffs vs Justin Herbert &amp; CJ Stroud they have only allowed 4.8 yards per pass &amp; a 50% completion rate. A huge part of that is they just got back a healthy Christian Gonzale who is one of the best DB’s in the league. With Gonzalez on the field, the Pats D has allowed just an 83.4 QB rating, a 62.8% completion %, 6.0 yards per pass, &amp; a 4.1% TD rate. With him off the field, those #s move to a 100.2 QB rating, a 69.9% completion %, 7.8 yards per pass, &amp; a 4.9% TD rate. Stidham will have his hands full vs this defense. But even with Nix Denver’s offense ranked just 16th in points per drive (2.09) &amp; 19th in success rate (41.5%) &amp; punted as much as any team in the league. They punted on 39.3% of possessions (28th), failing to get a 1st down on 38.3% of them (29th). The Pats D has allowed just 1.67 points per drive (3rd) &amp; has given up points on 30.8% of opponent possessions (3rd). This playoffs they have allowed just 1 TD on 24 possessions. The Pats are going to want to play a slow tempo game, not make any mistakes, &amp; run the ball. Especially with the defensive minded Head Coach in Mike Vrabel.

Pats QB Drake Maye has been sacked 10 times for a brutal 13.9% sack rate, fumbling 6 times this playoffs. Maye’s 57 sacks this season is the 2nd most in the NFL. The Broncos are 3rd in the NFL in pressure rate (41.8%) &amp; lead the NFL in sack rate (10.1%). With the Pats having a defense that is scorching hot facing a backup QB &amp; Maye struggling with pressure &amp; fumbles, the conservative defensive coach in Vrabel is going to want to put the ball on the ground. Especially with a in RB Rhamondre Stevenson who is playing the best football of his career right now. __Stevenson just became the FIRST player in the Super Bowl Era, over ANY 6 game span, to have 400+ rushing yards, +7.0 yards per carry, 4 rushing TD’s, 200+ receiving yards, +11.0 yards per catch, &amp; 2 receiving TD’s. Since Week 16 he’s gone for 402 rush yards, 4 TDs, &amp; a league-best +194 rush yards over expected. He’s has 11 explosive runs in that span, more than he had through the first 15 weeks. This led him to rank 5th in the NFL in Explosive Run % (6.9%).__ But things have flipped in the postseason. Stevenson has 26 carries for 123 yards (4.7 yards/carry), &amp; 7 catches for 86 yards. While Henderson has just 21 carries for 52 yards (2.5 ypc), 2 catches for 7 yards. Last week vs the Texans who have one of the best run defenses in the NFL, Stevenson had 16 carries &amp; played 40 snaps compared to Henderson’s 25, &amp; that includes an entire quarter where Stevenson was out with an eye injury. Stevenson has been much harder to bring down as well. He has the most missed tackles forced in the playoffs (10). In the regular season Stevenson averaged 2.75 yards after contact per run (5th among RB’s) compared to Henderson’s 1.91 (42nd among RB’s ). Stevenson also averaged 0.23 missed tackles forced per run (5th) compared to Henderson’s 0.13 (33rd). In the receiving game, Stevenson is clearly the preferred option. Henderson only has 3 TOTAL catches in his past 5 games &amp; is a poor pass blocker. Stevenson has gone 7 straight games with at least 2 catches &amp; is one of the best pass blocking backs in the NFL. Stevenson has out touched Henderson 33-23 this postseason &amp; that number will shift even more vs a tough Broncos defense that has allowed 4.5 yards/play (2nd), &amp; 1.68 points per drive (4th), &amp; has a 62.9% success rate (2nd). However, on the ground the numbers for Denver have actually been pretty poor towards the end of the season. Denver ranked 6th in the NFL EPA/rush allowed through Week 10. But they fell to 15th in that same metric in the background half of the year. Since Week 12 they are allowing the 12th most yards/carry (4.51), &amp; are rank in the bottom 10 of explosive rush rates &amp; success rates allowed. They just gave up 117 yards on 24 carries to James Cook on the Bills last week. __The Broncos have been particularly poor against man &amp; gap rushing concepts, ranking bottom 10 in both ypc (4.51) &amp; success rate. Since Week 12 they’ve given up 5.3 ypc to runs specifically between the tackles, 3rd worst in the NFL. New England runs these concepts at the 3rd highest rate in the NFL. Stevenson ranks #1 in the NFL in rushing yards over expected on runs between the tackles. Stevenson on man/gap runs (Last 7 Games): 62.8% Success Rate, 6.95 YPC, 4 TDs. All rank #1 in the NFL.__ The Broncos allowed 50+ yards to James Cook (117 yards), Travis Etienne (50 yards), &amp; Josh Jacobs (73 yards), all of which are elite gap runners. Vrabel is going to attack this weakness.

Stevenson has hit 50+ rushing yards in 5 of his last 6 games, &amp; with a rushing attempt line at 12.5 (also love the over on that), you can count on him to average at least 4+ yards per carry. The only way the Patriots lose this game is by turning the ball over. With Maye having 6 fumbles in 2 playoff games &amp; now facing the pass rush in the league, Vrabel is going to have to run the ball to slow this defense down. Especially as the Broncos defense’s weak spot is on the ground in the gaps. I think Rhamondre eats here.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Atalanta win &amp; over 1.5 goals @ 1.66
Staking 2 units✅

Write-up:

I was initially looking at Atalanta -1.5, but ended up taking win &amp; over 1.5. Feels like the safer play and less risk if it’s a tight game.

Atalanta have been in decent form lately… won 3 of their last 4 and only conceded 1 goal in that run. At home they usually control the game and create enough to score more than once.

Parma on the other hand struggle a lot going forward. Only 2 goals in their last 4 games, and one of those came when the other team had two red cards. Most games they just sit back and don’t offer much.

This line covers most scores I’m expecting 2-0, 2-1, 3-0, 3-1 etc.
Only real danger is a boring 1-0, but Atalanta usually don’t stop at one goal vs weaker teams, especially at home.

Not trying to overthink it… better team, better form, home game, low scoring opponent. Simple play with decent value.

Good luck to anyone riding with me on this one, hope it lands 🤞

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Alexander Bublik 🇰🇿 ML vs Alex De Minaur 🇦🇺 3 units to win 4.1U @2.37 (Bet365)

I’ll start off by saying that if you’re looking for a lock then this isn’t one. However, for this price? Yes please. Obviously for some safety you can take the games and set handicaps but I just think the straight ML is simply better value. 

Bublik has been on a tear this year, making his top 10 debut and going 7-0 for the season, clinching the title in Hong Kong with a straight set victory over Musetti. He’s hardly recognisable from the inconsistent player he was just a year ago and his ranking will only increase with little points to defend until the clay season. Major lifestyle as well as playstyle changes have shown a really serious face to Bublik who hasn’t dropped a set so far at the Open, confirming his excellent form. He’s one of the best servers on tour and hits incredibly hard off both wings whilst also having the ability to possess incredible variety in his game to disrupt rhythm. Sascha genuinely has extraordinary talent with all the tools to succeed at the highest level and with both confidence and consistency it can be really hard to find the means of beating him. With how good his serving is I believe that he will have more chances on De Minaur’s return games as opposed to the opposite despite his “just” good return game, as a result of ADM’s “just” good serving. 

Let me reiterate that this will be far from a walk in the park but should really be priced closer to a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>’em in my opinion. De Minaur is the No. 6 and whilst he has some incredible qualities about him also comes with limitations. Higher floor than Bublik, lower ceiling. ADM performed well in his opening three rounds but I feel like the first set against Medjedovic (which the Serb won in a tiebreak) will be closest to the level Bublik will bring, Hamad having as usual tired out after a huge hitting set. The demon is arguably the best counterpuncher and mover on tour who loves to grind down opponents with his defensive skills which on paper would frustrate Bublik’s hyper-aggressive game. It produces some insane levels of consistency against worse opponents but the lack of raw power and of an offensive game leads to the Aussie losing almost every time he faces a better opponent, which I believe to be the case on form personally. He’s 0-13 against Sinner whose power overwhelms De Minaur every time they face and this version of Bublik will have a similar effect. Now I’m not comparing Sascha and Sinner per-say as Bublik does fold earlier in rallies but it’s the stylistic comparison that can be made. Whilst ADM may put loads of balls back to force the Kazakh to play an extra shot, often deep, and increase the chance of missing which could very well lead to an error-prone performance from his opponent on a bad day, the sheer speed that Bublik can consistently put on a ball may very well lead to him taking the upper-hand in exchanges on a good one. Based on form, there is no reason to believe he will be in a bad day. Sascha won both their encounters last year, including a battle back from 2-0 down at the French Open on his least favourite surface. This promises to be a big battle on Rod Laver Arena so make sure to get the popcorn out. BOL !</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>Record: 3-2 Event: Big Bash League Cricket Scorchers v Sixers

Time: 7:30pm AEDT

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Steve Smith over 31.5 runs

Odds: $1.9

Write Up: Taking this play for the 4th time cause it’s too low of a line for such a world class player. Genuinely can’t see it not hitting. It’s landed in all of his Big bash games this league apart from one when he finished with 19 not out due to rain ending the game short. Smith’s form at the moment is undeniable. His last 5 matches he’s gotten: 65,37,54,100,19 not out. His only threat in my opinion is Jhye Richardson who should only bowl maximum of two out of the first 4 overs. After having a not so good outting while fielding in the second innings last game, the competitive nature of Smith will be on show in the grand final. 
Best of luck if tailing!</td></tr>

Really interesting play here, but I absolutely love it. Since coming over from New Orleans, he has gotten a carry in 7 out of 10 games and last week in their first playoff game, he got 2 carries. He also returned a TD last week. Now, the Seahawks are out Zach Charbonet. It seems unlikely to me that he wouldn’t get any work in the run game, especially with how well he has played since coming over. In their week 16 shootout game, he got a carry and took it 31 yards

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Map 1 - Over or Exactly 31:30 Map Duration 2-Way (1.83) 2u to win 1.66u** ✅️

**Start Time:** 17:00 KST, \~8 hours from posting

**Writeup:** Last matches of LCK Week 2 and it starts with a good one!

T1 have been tested on every series so far. They are still undefeated in matches but they have had to work for their victories. Domestically they have not been the strongest in the last few years and it&#x27;s showing. T1 are very beatable.

FearX on the other hand have been one of the biggest surprises of the first two weeks. They are punching way above their weight class, and are finding ways to win despite being behind. Their most recent test did end in an 0-2 defeat, but that match line does not paint the whole picture. They were competitive against Gen.G, the best team in the league, and they should&#x27;ve won at least one game.

Both teams have some of the slowest average map durations in the league. T1 average 33:02 per game, on Map 1 they average 32:20. FearX average 31:54 per game, on Map 1 they average \~33:40. T1 are the favourites here but they have naturally slow tendencies; leaning on strong fundamentals and game management. FearX on the other hand try to push the agenda early, targetting botside to get Diable ahead. FearX have a relatively hard time converting early leads so they tend to slow it down until the midgame as well.

The key here will be the botside. FearX send a lot of attention that way, securing the early game and dragon count. T1 can be a bit psychotic at times, but when they are behind they let the opponents dictate the pace and force them to play perfectly to win the game. If they don&#x27;t, they will snatch the victory away through sheer will. If FearX can get Diable ahead, and secure a few dragons, the over will be a breeze. Even if T1 get ahead early, FearX have shown they can stay and prolong games. I don&#x27;t expect either team to get an insane lead early that snowballs out of control. Should be an exciting series.

**NFL - Los Angeles @ Seattle, 6:30 PM ET, FOX**

***Kyren Williams o65.5 APY (-120) 2.29u***

We go back to an old friend for championship Sunday in Seattle as the Seahawks host the Rams with a spot in the Super Bowl on the line... With all the talk about the Seahawks 2 headed running game being slashed down to one, **LA have shown their own two headed attack is leaning one way themselves**.

We are going to challenge the best run D in the NFL - again. We are going to keep our faith in Kyren - again. I have to say, I’m no expert on line balance, but this number is genuinely 5/6 yards lower than I anticipated it would open at, and it has creeped there. **Personally I will be playing this as high as 75**.

The seasons work speaks for itself: **65 all purpose yards in ALL BUT ONE game this season. He had 95 on 23 touches last season, 96 on only 13 touches in week 11, and 85 on 26 touches 5 weeks ago**.

*His rushing floor has been 46 yards which is low for this range*, but as I’ve emphasized a few times over the last few weeks he’s naturally become a part of the receiving game. **He’s had over 15+ receiving yards per game &amp; 21 total targets in the last 5 weeks**. If Seattle DO show their run D card, Kyren is still showing himself as an option in Staffords progressions

If the Rams are winning, they are going to have to run the ball… if the Rams are losing the game, they will need to keep Kyren an option to keep Seattle guessing… basically either way **I can see Kyren easily getting 20+ touches tonight**.

Which means - once again - We’re going to fade the Corum effect. **He only had 6 touches last week**, and has been shaky in his on ball output when he’s gotten them in recent weeks. Playoff time means teams will rely on what they have faith in - **Blake hasn’t hit the ground running now in a few weeks**, as it feels like his inclusion into the overall game plan depends on how he starts. **As a result has clearly shifted into RB2 territory**. He’s still a threat to us, but it doesn’t feel as direct anymore.

I feel like I’m repeating myself as alot of these details and stats have remained the same as the weeks have gone by. **Kyren has been a huge winner for me this year away from Reddit, to the tune of 91%**, let’s hope we can get one more.

Last play review:

***Fulham/Brighton BTTS (-155) 1.5u*** ✅

(Game went to script essentially, a touch late to get there but it really never was in doubt. Good to get back on track, and cheers to these guys for an entertaining, parlay smacking game on the side of things)

**Write Up:** Nothing is falling our way at present unfortunately, Ballard had a great chance early and just missed the target. West Ham finally started defending and kept him at bay the rest of the game. Great day in the Soccer thread, but we keep falling short on the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>.

I&#x27;ve taken Morgan Gibbs-White a few times with good success. He is the #10 for Forest and likes to take shots on. With Wood still out, he&#x27;s the team&#x27;s penalty taker and usually the captain. He had a tough game in Europa mid week, while I played his SOT there as well, which cashed in the first 10 minutes, he missed a penalty and wound up with 3 SOTs in a big 0-1 loss. I see him coming back for blood <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> and taking his shots to make up for the mid week match. 

I also like this because Igor Jesus is still questionable, and with limited other options there&#x27;s a non-zero chance they throw MGW back up front as the striker. If they put on Big T or their new signing Lorenzo Lucca, I still expect MGW to take on plenty of shots as neither have had many EPL minutes.

Game against the Broncos at 3:30

Don&#x27;t overthink this one. The Patriots are almost back to the Super Bowl. Stevenson has hit this in five straight, and I expect they&#x27;ll rely on him heavily with Henderson struggling to be productive. The Broncos play a lot of man defense and blitz as much as anyone in the NFL (were leading the league late in the season with this). I expect quick throws and check downs from Maye. I look for the Patriots to capitalize on a mistake or two by the Broncos and jump to an early lead. They won&#x27;t milk the clock early on, but slow meticulous drives to wear out the defense which favors more running back touches. Denver defense again the run (3.9 yards per carry for runbingbacks) is good, so I don&#x27;t want to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> just the rushing prop as Stevenson has only gotten than three of the last five.</td></tr>

Last pick:Lamelo Ball over 6.5 assists, easy win, no sweat 


Event: Patriots @ Broncos 


<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Treveyon Henderson over 8.5 carries (-130)


Write Up: If this looks familiar, it&#x27;s because this was my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> a week ago on this exact same total. Same reasoning applies here, only moreso than last week because the Broncos are starting a backup QB. New England will most likely be playing with a lead, so they&#x27;ll be running the ball at least as often as they usually do. 


Henderson averages 9.5 carries per game, but in the last 12 that average has jumped to 10.5. He&#x27;s cleared the 8.5 total in 11 of his last 12!


There was clearly a preference for his counterpart Stevenson last week against Houston, but the Patriots like to run the ball, especially with a lead, so there are plenty of carries for both of them, as we saw last week. Henderson has been the preferred back this year (180 vs 130 carries), but even if those percentages reverse again like last week, NE should be running enough to get Henderson double digit carries again. 


Denver does have a great run defense, and they allow only the 9th most rushing attempts per game with 24.2. A big part of that is playing with the lead though. In their 3 losses, they allowed 29 carries per game, and I do expect this to be a loss for them. The Denver defense is good, but the Houston defense was better than Denver, and they didn&#x27;t have any issues falling behind so much that they had to abandon the run. I&#x27;m picking carries instead of yards to account for the possibility that NE hands it off many times in a row just to bleed the clock. Those runs are usually for 1 or 2 yards. 


Even if Stevenson gets most of the carries again (though he&#x27;s averaging 2.5 fewer carries this year than Henderson), I don&#x27;t think Henderson has any problems hitting his total again.


The other thing to note is that despite 50 more carries than Stevenson, he has only 1 fumble all year compared to Stevenson&#x27;s 3. So if it comes time to milk the clock, ball security isn&#x27;t an issue for Henderson.


Patriots most likely win, so they won&#x27;t be below their run attempts average from playing from behind, and if Henderson gets even a third of those 29 carries, he hits his over. Most importantly of all, again, 11/12 over this line, so I&#x27;m comfortable going back to the well. If Houston at full strength couldn&#x27;t hold back Henderson from getting his carries, neither can Denver with a backup QB.

Ajax take care of Volendam 2-0 and another <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> is a winner. It was tight but we keep winning.

2 winning days in a row too, this weekend is going extremely well. 

Let&#x27;s keep riding this momentum.

**Write Up:**

For <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> I am going back to the dutch league once again. It has been good to me so far and giving it some extra attention is the right thing to do and keep the streak alive.

Telstar are 8-2 with o2.5 goals and BTTS at home. 9-1 in BTTS by itself.

In 10 games they have a record of 1-4-5, scoring 17 goals and conceding 22 times. They attract goals at home and this match will be the same.

AZ Alkmaar away from home are 6-4 with BTTS and o2.5 goals. Only slightly favored for my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>.

In 10 games AZ Alkmaar has managed a 4-1-5 record. Scoring 14 and conceding 16 times.

Earlier this season the game ended 2-1 in favor of AZ. I can see the same happening <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Chance of more goals is higher than less goals too.

Telstar need every point to avoid relegation whilst AZ are in the race for top 3/4 and football in Europe next season.

This will be an open game and the streak will continue another day. It has been a very good weekend so far, time to end it on a high note too.

• I have never done a bet like this before, but the main reason for doing this is because of the history between these two teams: When you look at the L10 matchups between the two, 2 games have been won by 10+ while 8/10 have been within 10 points - The last two matchups, this year, have ended with the two following scores: 38-37 &amp; 21-19 - these two teams always play each other well and close, and I expect the same here tomorrow - On top of those H2H stats, this game is for all the marbles, NFC Championship - stakes will be a lot higher in this game than any other - I lean Seattle in this matchup. Any time Seattle is at Lumen, that gives them a small advantage, aka the 12th man - I feel like we don’t need to go into a lot of detail here about these two things: Seahawks defense &amp; Rams offense - Seahawks have one of the best defenses in the league, while the Rams have one of the best offensives in the league - This Seahawks offense is ranked 3rd in PPG while the Rams give up an average of 20.2 PPG - Seahawks D is #1 in the NFL in PPG on defense, while the Rams are #1 on offense for PPG - Unlike the 49ers vs Seahawks game, I don’t think Seattle’s D will be able to perform as good as they did against the 49ers here, where they themselves won Seattle that game - Between Mcvay, Stafford, Puka, and Adams, I see the Rams getting there’s regardless - but Seattle slows them down just enough - The one downside to this bet, is our man Sam Darnold - part of sits here and thinks about his playoff performances and how you can’t trust him, and the other part of me is thinking, well you have to give him the flowers where they are due, he has had a good year - Even if Seattle turns the ball over 1-3 times, their defense should still be able to limit the Rams offensive output - The stats and data point to a close matchup here, my gut tells me this comes down to a FG - again, if you cannot place this bet, please check the comment section for 2 alternatives

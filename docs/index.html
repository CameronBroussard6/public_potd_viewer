Net: -32

Previous: Europe | LEC | 1045am | Vitality vs Los Ratones | Los Ratones ML 2U @ +110

Actually had a chance to win and threw the game at the end. Moving on. 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>: Spain | La Liga 2 | 2pm Eastern | Racing Santander vs Mirandés | Racing to win and Over 1.5 goals | 3U @ -117

Racing Santander enter this matchup with a clear structural advantage, particularly at home, where they have been one of the more reliable attacking sides in the Segunda División. Their home performances are defined by consistent chance creation, sustained possession in the final third, and an ability to score early, which often forces opponents into more open game states. Racing have scored in virtually every home match this season and average close to two goals per game at El Sardinero, making them well positioned to control the tempo and scoreboard.

Mirandés, by contrast, continue to struggle away from home. Their road form is marked by defensive instability, especially against teams that press high and attack through wide areas—an approach Racing use effectively. Mirandés concede regularly on their travels and rarely keep games tight for a full 90 minutes, which increases the likelihood of Racing finding multiple scoring opportunities. Even when Mirandés remain competitive, they often allow high-quality chances that eventually translate into goals.

From a goals perspective, this matchup strongly supports over 1.5 total goals. Racing matches routinely clear this line due to their scoring consistency and willingness to commit numbers forward, while Mirandés games also trend higher because of their defensive concessions. Historical meetings between the two sides further reinforce this pattern, with most encounters producing at least two goals.

Taken together, Racing’s superior home form, stronger attacking output, and Mirandés’ away defensive weaknesses point toward a Racing Santander victory in a match that realistically surpasses 1.5 total goals.</td></tr>

Write Up: Time to bounce back. <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> we’re going with Canada v Czechia, Sarah Fillier anytime goal scorer. Sarah had 6 shots in her last game and lit the lamp on one of those. I believe she’ll do the same <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.

Last 10: 5–3

Last Pick: Furman -12.5 vs UNCG

Result: LOSS ❌ (Furman lost by 3)

Furman didn’t cover the –12.5 largely because the game never developed the type of possession separation a double-digit favorite needs. While Furman actually shot slightly better overall (43% vs 42%) and dominated points in the paint (32–18), that advantage was neutralized by UNCG’s three-point efficiency gap — UNCG hit 10 threes at 53%, while Furman went just 5-for-19 (26%) from deep. That alone erased Furman’s interior edge and kept scoring compressed.

Add in nearly identical foul counts, similar free-throw volume, and limited fast-break scoring, and there was no late-game scoring accelerator to stretch the margin. Furman controlled the game for most of the night (led 79% of the time), but without perimeter shot-making or turnover-driven runs to create distance, control never translated into separation — resulting in a straight-up loss that never seriously threatened the spread.

College Basketball | NCAA Men’s
Yale @ Howard
Time: 7:00 PM

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Under 147.5 

Odds: -115 (DraftKings)

Write-Up:

Yale–Howard sets up as a matchup where game flow and structure matter more than raw scoring potential. Yale consistently plays with strong pace discipline, prioritizing half-court execution, shot quality, and clock management. That approach naturally limits possessions and reduces scoring swings, especially against teams that are more comfortable playing in rhythm than pushing tempo. When Yale controls the pace, games tend to settle into longer offensive possessions and fewer transition opportunities.

From a broader profile standpoint, this matchup leans toward stable scoring outcomes rather than high volatility. Yale games often stay close to their expected scoring range, with fewer explosive runs that dramatically inflate totals. Howard’s offense is capable but tends to be more shot-dependent, which can lead to uneven scoring stretches when defenses force them into longer half-court sequences. Without consistent pace acceleration or extended transition play, scoring remains more measured across both sides.

Late-game tendencies also support a controlled environment. Yale is comfortable closing games without speeding things up, and Howard is less likely to introduce chaos unless the game completely deviates from script. With disciplined tempo, limited transition volume, and a game state that favors execution over urgency, this matchup projects as one where the overall scoring environment stays contained relative to faster or more volatile pairings.

Writeup: Going back to the Netherlands lower division to try my luck again. This event has been hit in all of Jong AZ&#x27;s last five games and four of Dordrecht&#x27;s last five games. Only concern would be their last meeting was a 1-1 draw, though that was a few months ago. Lets just hope we see the goal in first half.

Fenerbahce vs Genclerbirligi, OVER 5.5 CORNERS FIRST HALF @3

Fenerbahce take on Genclerbirligi in a game where corner opportunities should be frequent. Fenerbahce play very attacking football at home, using wide players and fullbacks to deliver constant crosses into the box. Genclerbirligi are likely to sit deep and defend for long periods, which usually results in plenty of set-piece situations. With strong pressure expected from the hosts and counterattacks from the visitors, over 5.5 corners at odds of 3.00 looks a very solid option.</td></tr>

Event: Roma vs Cagliari

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Roma -1 Asian handicap @1.85


Cagliari is on a very good streak, 3 wins in a row Including Juventus, Roma on the other hand, is 3 games without a win, so why are we betting on Roma and on Monday? Well Roma rotated in UEL, because they need to focus on top 4, specially after Juventus dropped points, I can&#x27;t hide that I also like Cagliari +1 but the Olímpico stadium will be a deciding factor, Cagliari strength is a solid defense but I believe Gasperini can figure them out.

**8 IN A ROW.** The derby was exactly the war we expected—8 yellow cards and another 3-unit bomb cashed. We are on an absolute heater, but we stay disciplined. Back to a 1.5-unit play for tomorrow.

* **The Matchup:** Estudiantes is playing at home, where they are incredibly solid. They are arguably the strongest team in Argentina outside of the &quot;Big 5.&quot; They have a clear tactical identity and a much higher quality roster than their opponents.
* **The Opponent:** Riestra is a &quot;peculiar&quot; team. They are known for being very physical, &quot;dirtying&quot; the game, and having strong ties with AFA officials (which often leads to favorable refereeing). However, in terms of actual football and talent, they are tiers below Estudiantes.
* **The Play:** If Estudiantes plays their game and doesn&#x27;t get frustrated by Riestra&#x27;s antics, they should take the 3 points comfortably. The 1.82 price offers great value considering the massive gap in quality.

PORTO VS SPORTING

Date: 09 FEBRUARY 2026 at 21:45

BET ON: Both teams to score- Yes

Odd: 1.92



\- Porto’s Francesco Farioli has made it abundantly clear in the lead-up press that his side will not sit back after their surprising loss to Casa Pia, emphasizing repeatedly that Porto must enter the clássico with “atitude e grande espírito” and proactive aggression, using the rare full week of preparation to work specifically on ball entries, transitions and high pressing patterns — a sign he plans to impose his typical vertical, possession-oriented attacking style rather than bottleneck into a low block. Sporting’s Rui Borges, on the other hand, has publicly stated that his team only thinks about winning even if the game isn’t “decisivo” for the title, underlining his motivation to attack with purpose and not simply manage the match, which fits his tactical profile of possession control, dynamic wing play and pressure after loss seen in training reports this week. Porto’s defensive lines are weakened by suspensions and absentees, forcing Farioli into a less familiar back setup that could be exploited on transitions, while Sporting, although also missing squad members through injury, has repeatedly trained with a compact midfield and quick vertical passes to exploit half-spaces — a risky but attacking-leaning tactical setup. With both coaches stressing attacking intent and competitive spirit in their Portuguese press build-ups, and tactical plans that favor forward momentum rather than containment, BTTS Yes becomes a highly plausible outcome.

**Write Up:** We can&#x27;t catch a break, Semenyo had a great chance at the start of the 2nd half and opted to blast his shot into the keeper rather than find a corner. These <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> plays have become sacrificial plays, unfortunately. But we will turn it around, please tail with caution while I recalibrate.

No EPL <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> so we&#x27;re going to head to Italy and try out Serie A. But the player we&#x27;re backing <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> will be familiar to many of you who have followed my picks. Malen, the ex-Aston Villa striker, was sent to Roma a few weeks back on loan. Since joining he has only played 3 Serie A matches, but has racked up some great numbers in those games. He is averaging 5 shots and 2 SOTs per game, scoring one goal between the three matches. He has recieved fantastic praise from the coach and I&#x27;m excited to see what he can do for Roma through the rest of the season.

BOL and happy Monday!</td></tr>

Avs might be last in the league but they get a great matchup to get corners here and also get a good amount themselves.

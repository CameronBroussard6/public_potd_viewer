Both their wins were against stage 1 teams, who weren&#x27;t that good. In contrast, B8 have been pretty impressive &amp; clinical. I think this will be the first good test for Navi. I predict B8 to get atleast a map off Navi or maybe a win.

Analysis: 100% hit rate this year. Facing a very tough defense which explains the nice discount on yardage here.

CMC should continue to get a high target share and capitalize on his recs as he has every game this year to clear this number</td></tr>

Last POTD: 🏈 Eagles team total under 26.5 points (-113). 💰

Writeup: Just like I suspected, if Philly started from behind, it would be really difficult for them to have a chance in this one. Needed a smash <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> here, glad it happened.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: 🏈 Bills vs Steelers under 47.5 points (-108).

Game starts at 4:25pm EST. Bet 3U

Writeup: Taking the under in the Bills vs Steelers game mostly due to likely game script. 

The Bills have been such an interesting team this year with quality wins against powerhouses like the Chiefs and Ravens, but really bad losses against teams like the Dolphins, Falcons, and Texans. Something seems off about Josh Allen this year mainly due to just how many sacks he’s taken this year, and his ability to not get sacked used to be one of his greatest assets. He was sacked 8 times last week, and now gets a Steelers defense that includes the likes of an healthier Alex Hysmith, T.J. Watt, and others. I expect Allen to have some limited success in the passing game and rely more on his running backs.

The reasoning for this bet, like I mentioned, comes from the high likelihood that both teams will have success running the ball and will not need to pass as much as they typically do. Both teams have bottom 6 rush defenses in the league the season, and both offenses have highly efficient rushing attacks thanks to James Cook for the Bills and Jaylen Warren for the Steelers. I don’t expect Allen to find a lot of success creating explosive plays through the air against a Steelers defense that is quick to getting to the QB, and I expect Rodgers to take some slight precautions given his injury to his non-throwing wrist. 

Both teams running the ball will keep the clock running throughout the game, giving both teams less time to score. James Cook did not get a lot of usage last week, which is typical in the games the Bills lose. I expect heavy usage of Cook in this one, along with Warren for the Steelers, which will result in a game with under 47.5 points.

Remember to only bet what you can afford to lose, and BOL!</td></tr>

\-One of the worst if not the worst losses we have taken in 351 picks so far, W0nderful with his team up 12-0 and at match point had 3 headshots, then proceeds to get 5 headshots in 3 rounds to cover the line despite a 13-2 blowout win and game script going exactly as predicted, heart breaker

**NicX U 9.5 Headshots Map 1**

* Passion UA vs. 3DMAX in the 1-1 match, a b01. 3DMAX lost to fnatic 13-6 in their opener then beat FlyQuest 13-7 in the 0-1 match. Passion UA lost to FaZe 13-10 in their opener then beat MIBR 13-10 in their 2nd round match. Passion UA come in as slight favorites and the higher seed, as stated yesterday higher seed in a b01 has started on CT side so far in 95% of games played at the major
* 3DMAX ban Mirage, 3DMAX ban Train. Passion UA ban Ancient, Inferno, Nuke, 3DMAX ban ?? (unsure but lean Overpass ban). Map will either be Overpass or Dust 2 with Passion UA on CT side but strongly lean Dust 2 as I think neither team really wants this map to end up on Overpass, and with PA having side choice and Overpass being very CT sided, think we are very likely getting dust 2
* NicX is averaging a .63 KPR in the L3 months for Passion UA with a 59.2% headshot overall. He is averaging a .62 KPR in 2025 with a 61.5% headshot percentage overall
* On Dust 2, NicX is averaging a .51 KPR L3 months with a 54.9% headshot overall, both significant decreases. In 2025 he is averaging a .50 KPR with a 56.2% headshot overall
* On Overpass NicX is averaging a .68 KPR L3 months with a 56.2% headshot overall, slight increase in KPR
* Model projecting 90% chance of him going under this line with a near 24% overall edge

**Staehr&gt;INS Map 2 Kills**

* Astralis take on FlyQuest in the 0-2 match, Astralis have lost two close games against some solid teams overall, while they don&#x27;t look good they have been competitive, FlyQuest on the other hand have gotten blown out twice in a row back to back. This is a b03 since it is an ellimination match, Astralis really should be picking only Ancient ever in this spot, small chance they could justify an Overpass if they are confident enough in it but I don&#x27;t really see that at all with them being the better team and how big the stakes
* Staehr is averaging a .71 KPR L3 months, INS is averaging a .66 KPR in the L3 months, Astralis is -200 favorites on the map. Staehr is averaging a .69 KPR in the last month, INS is averaging a .56 KPR last month

Aston Villa vs Wolves

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> : Aston Villa to Win + Total Under 5.5 Goals @1.61 for 3u

Villa are the clear favorites at home and should win easily while keeping the match controlled against a team that is completely out of form. Aston Villa are fourth in the Premier League with 21 points from 12 games and have won their last seven home games across all competitions, showing they are a fortress at Villa Park, while Wolves are in absolute crisis with only 2 points from 12 matches which is the third-worst record at this stage in Premier League history. Villa just beat Leeds 2-1 away and Young Boys 2-1 at home in the Europa League, proving they can score goals easily, but Wolves have lost their last five league games and conceded at least two goals in their last six competitive matches, meaning Villa will score multiple times without facing any real attacking threat. The under 5.5 goals is safe because Villa have only scored 1.3 goals per game on average this season and while Wolves concede 2.3 goals per game on average, realistic scorelines like 2-0, 3-0, or 2-1.

Bayshul Tuten Over 27.5 rushing yards (steadily moving upward) 

This guy is beginning to get his share of rushing attempts for Jacksonville and showing flashes of what he can do. The jags gave away tank bigsby and ended up drafting this guy in the 4th round with the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. Clearly they want him in the mix. With Jacksonville a decent favorite in this game you have to think they’ll be playing ahead most of the game and rushing the ball a lot. Hes averaging about 8-9 carries a game which should translate to this line being too low added with the implied game script against Tennessee. Tuten was a menace at Virginia tech and the jags are looking to get more of that out of him and he should be able to hit this line easily if he gets 8 or 9 carries. There’s not much to think about. I got the line at 26.5 and Ive got it upwards of 30-35 easily. It’s moving fast, get it as quick as you can. ✌️</td></tr>

Sport: English Premier League - Crystal Palace vs. Manchester United @ 7:00am EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Tie or Man Utd + BTTS = +140 (5 units)

Write Up: This is very similar to my previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, is Crystal Palace a bounce back team? I think not. While this too is a home game for CP, they just played and lost to Strasbourg in France as of two days ago and now have a quick turnaround game against Manchester United. While CP is one of the best coached and managed teams in England, they’re not used to playing in Europe and the Prem. Manchester United is a wild card, they’ve shown flashes of progress, only to take a step back again. I do believe there is a sense of belief within ManU, they’ve proven to themselves they can play well and win. I think with more time off than CP, they’ll be more prepared. They also have the added benefit of only needing to focus on the Prem, ManU can win this. To manage a bit of risk, I’ve selected Tie OR Win for ManU, as well as BTTS. I think ManU will score, I also think they’re shaky enough to let in a goal.

I’ll update based on lineup announcement.

While Yakult Brothers are a decent squad, Execration has historically performed well in high-pressure elimination series like this one.

Recap: Beautiful Sunderland comeback. They stay unbeaten at home and we ride the wave. City made it sweaty but got the job done. We cash and move.

Todays Event: Wolves at Aston Villa / Brighton at Forest (EPL) @9:05am EST 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: Aston Villa ML + o1.5 goals in Brighton vs Forest (-110) 

Write Up: Aston Villa has sneakily stacked up to 5th in the table. They have lost one prem game since August which was away at Anfield. They have been solid at home. In all comps they have won five straight at home. As well as their last four in a row in the prem. Wolves. Nothing to be said. One goal away from home all season. No wins all year. I can’t help but continue to fade them. 

Brighton and Forest feels like a tricky matchup. I debated with a second leg for this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>potd</mark> but ended up here. Two goals. In a tricky toss up game. I like it. This o1.5 has hit in 11/12 prem games for Forest. As well as 12/12 for Brighton. Both teams combined only have 3 clean sheets all season. Expecting both teams to have many chances to score. Ideally we see a first half goal and we are in business.

Kenneth Gainwell o50.5 Rushing + Receiving (Fanduel)
(Line already moved from 49.5 yesterday, the market clearly respects greatness.)

I’m keeping it short because I don’t want to break my undefeated streak with too many words, but here’s the vibe: Gainwell has quietly been eating into Jaylen Warren’s touches, and the team is clearly trying to get him the ball in space. Over the last couple weeks he’s been trending up in both usage and snap share, and this matchup sets up nicely for him to rack up chunk yards on the ground and through dump-offs.

He’s basically the “oh crap nothing’s open” button for this offense right now, and that alone gives him R+R upside. If he gets anywhere near his recent touch share, this line feels soft and the movement from 49.5 to 50.5 shows the books agreeing.

May my perfect record continue its historic run. BOL and bet responsibly.</td></tr>

Event: Raiders @ Chargers 2:25MST

Write Up: Chargers are looking to get back on track here with a get right game against one of, if not the worst team in the NFL. Going into their BYE week the Chargers got absolutely embarrassed against Jacksonville. Los Angeles has had two weeks to prepare for this game and will be fully rested to go up against this weak Las Vegas pass defense and get themselves back on track.

With Omarion Hampton ruled out for presumably one more week, and with the Raiders competent run defense, it will be up to Justin Herbert and his wide receivers to get the yards LA needs through the air. Since entering the league, Keenan Allen has been consistently Justin Herbert&#x27;s favorite target and his go to guy in big spots when they need it most.

Through 11 games Keenan Allen has averaged 7.8 targets per game and has cleared this line in 9/11 games this season. The Raiders are ranked 28th in receptions allowed to wide receivers with 12.9 per game and Allen cleared this line previously against Vegas in week 2 with 5 receptions.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **Total Corner Over 10 @ 2.37 1.5U (Bet365)**

**EPL | Chelsea v Arsenal**

I like taking corner bets more than rebounds. NBA can be unpredictable with player injuries, minute restrictions, and all. But corners in soccer won&#x27;t stop due to a single player&#x27;s injury. My belief is corners are often driven by game script and the team&#x27;s eagerness to create chances.  
Chelsea and Arsenal are the leaders in corners taken in the EPL right now, with 80 and 79 corners respectively so far in their 12 games.  
I do not have to worry about Chelsea or Arsenal leading the game; both are capable of creating double-digit corners.  
Both teams have an average of 6 corners per game. If either of the teams scores in 1st half, the corner will start to burst from the other team, or if neither of the teams is able to score, corners will still burst from both teams. Both teams have players active in the roster who are on top of the leaderboard with the most final third passes as well. Generally speaking, I like this bet.  
Sorry I cannot give more stats this time since this bet is more of a situational bet, and situations/game-script are in our favor. GL 🍀.

**Game:** NFL - Jaguars @ Titans, 12pm CDT


**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Travis Etienne o63.5 rushing yards (-114 on FD) 1u to win 1.14u


**Rationale:**


Travis Etienne has been a solid rusher this season, averaging 74 rushing yards per game. He has hit this line in 6 of 11 games this year, with most of the misses coming in games where the Jags were trailing heavily (Rams, Seahawks) or against an elite defense (Texans). Another consideration is last week&#x27;s return of Brenton Strange. Strange has been very important to the Jags&#x27; run game, and the splits make this clear. *With* Strange playing, Etienne averages 96 rushing yards per game. *Without* Strange, that drops to just 43.3. Last week he toted the ball 15 times for 86 yards, and Strange was a contributor to that.


On the Titans&#x27; side of things, they come into this week surrendering 108 RB rushing yards per game. Their opponents&#x27; RB1 has only not hit this line twice. Once was against the Texans, whose rushing attack has been spread out and mediocre, and the other was against the Chargers, who have had similar issues. They also give up 20.5 running back carries per game.


Divisional games are always shifty, and I expect the Jaguars to lean on their rushing attack to try and open up the play-action game and control this incredibly important matchup.</td></tr>

I also think this might be our last clear play on this line. Let&#x27;s talk about that.

I&#x27;ve always based this play on the simple fact that Enzo plays further forward, takes penalties, and take free kicks with Cole Palmer out. This has now hit in 9/9 of his last matches in all comps, averaging over 3 shots and just about 2 SOTs per game. Enzo has been arguably Chelsea&#x27;s best player this season. Chelsea coach Maresca has said Palmer is ready to come back from injury, but has been very cryptic about his role. I think Palmer will suit up for the match, but I don&#x27;t think he starts. If he does start, I doubt he will be playing the whole match. All of that said, I don&#x27;t suspect Enzo&#x27;s role will change overnight here and expect he will get at least a half without Palmer.

**To be clear, I like this play whether Palmer starts or not.** It does change the team dynamic, but Enzo has been balling and I don&#x27;t see him slowing down. This is a massive match with title implications - big players show up for big games.

BOL if tailing, have a great Sunday!</td></tr>

__Event:__ NFL: Broncos @ Commanders 8:20pm EST

__POTD:__ Courtland Sutton longest reception o20.5 yards (-120), 3.6u to win 3u

__Write Up:__ The Denver Broncos (9-2) are traveling across the country to the nation’s capital to take on the Washington Commanders (3-8) in a Week 13 Sunday Night Football showdown. The Commanders will once again be without star QB Jayden Daniels who remains out with an elbow injury, as Marcus Mariota continues to start in his place. Washington has now suffered 6 losses in a row &amp; are trending in the opposite direction as their opponent this week. The Broncos are coming into the game looking to extend an 8 game winning streak, with the 2nd best win % in the NFL. With one of the best, if not the best, defense in the NFL, their offense gets a juicy matchup vs a vulnerable Washington defense.

Denver’s offense has been solid lately, but Washington’s defense has been HORRIBLE lately. __Washington is 31st in defensive EPA since Week 6 (-76.1). They have allowed a league high 7.0 yards per play since then.__ Not only have they been just bad, they have been specifically bad against the pass. __Washington’s pass defense is the worst in the NFL in dropback success rate (51.4%) &amp; dropback EPA allowed (0.266). Those are even worse in the last 4 weeks. Their 63.6% success rate &amp; 0.515 EPA allowed on dropbacks are both at the bottom of the NFL. They have allowed the 2nd most receiving yards per game to WR’s (170.3).__ Their biggest issue has been giving up deep passes to opposing receivers. __Washington is allowing a league high 13 yards per reception &amp; a league-high 6.7% touchdown rate. They have also allowed a league high 59.6% completion rate &amp; a 120.0 QB rating (31st) on throws 10+ yards downfield.__ Here is how opposing pass catchers have fared for their longest receptions vs Washington, starting with the most recent:

Waddle 31 yards, Achane 22 yards

Williams 41

White 60, JSN 26, Arroyo 26, Horton 25

Kelce 38, Worthy 27, Rice 25, Juju 24

Lamb 74, Pickens 44

Swift 55, Burden 37, Monangai 25, Odunze 21

Allen 29, Conklin 21

Bijan 69, London 43, Pitts 26

Tucker 61, Meyers 45

Kraft 57, Heath 37, Musgrave 23

They’ve been crushed every single game. __Washington has allowed the 7th most 20+ yard receptions (38) &amp; the 2nd most 40+ yard receptions (10).__ Now they face the Broncos who have a QB/WR tandem that have an elite 20+ yard reception connection in QB Bo Nix &amp; WR Courtland Sutton. __Sutton had 17 catches of 20+ yards last year &amp; has had 12 20+ yard catches in 11 games this season. Sutton has had a longest reception for 21+ yards in 8 of 11 games this season, including 4 of his last 5, with the 3 of those going for 30+ yards.__ The schematic matchup also works in Sutton’s favor. Sutton plays the X receiver in this Broncos offense. Washington’s defense plays a ton of man coverage &amp; single high on the outside, with a banged up cornerback room. Those are the looks where you typically target the X receiver &amp; this team allows the most yards per dropback in single high coverage this season. __Washington The Commanders play man coverage at the 9th highest rate in the NFL (31.5%). Sutton has put up 29% targets per route run &amp; 3.29 yards per route run versus man coverage.__ That is more than double his yards vs zone. Another reason we will see Sutton get his share of targets is Denver’s run game. Since Broncos RB JK Dobbins went down with a foot injury in Week 10, 2nd round Rookie RB RJ Harvey has taken over the Denver backfield. He has been somewhat underwhelming for this offense forcing them to lean on the pass more. __Harvey has a 26.2% success rate as a runner this year, ranking 53rd of 54 RB’s with 50+ runs. He has gained 10+ yards on just 3.3% of his runs, also 53rd.__ So with the lack of rushing success combined with Washington’s severely decrepit pass defense, we should see Bo Nix dice up this secondary &amp; pepper Sutton with targets. 

Sutton is going to feast, he’ll get at least 1 long one.

*If your book doesn’t have longest reception props, take over on receiving yards.*

__Courtland Sutton longest reception o20.5 yards__

Yet again, somehow my picks find a way to be sweaty when Leeds should have been dead and buried by half time.

City took the lead on just 1 minute, Foden putting city ahead and the bet off to a perfect start. They doubled their lead before half time and had countless chances and should have been at least 3-0 up at half time. They were 1.03 to win at this point.

City uncharacteristically then took their foot of the gas and dispute scoring the 2nd fewest goals in the league Leeds managed to score twice to make it 2-2 heading into the final 20 mins

City eventually break them down again in the 91st minute to get the win this should have been completely sweat free but we get what we need in the end.

Premier league

**West ham Vs Liverpool**

**Both teams to score and over 2.5 goals**

(1.83) 3 units 

A rejuvenated West Ham side take on free falling Liverpool side in London.

West ham come into this starting to turn a corner on their season, they are 2nd only to Burnley (who has played an extra game) for **highest goals conceded in the league 25 goals in just 12 games**

They have scored 9 goals in their last 4 games, some really impressive performances against Bournemouth away, and have back to back 3-2 and 3-1 wins against Burnley and Newcastle.

The shock of the season has been Liverpool&#x27;s collapse, in attack they play fairly well, and have been unlucky to not score more goals for the chances they&#x27;ve created. But in defence it&#x27;s just so easy to cut them apart, Van Djik has been poor and Konate has been pathetic, his body language so poor he doesn&#x27;t even seem to care anymore.

Liverpool have conceded 10 goals in their last 3 games, and **away from home they have just 1 clean sheet all season** against Burnley

Of course Liverpool still have the better team partially in attack. The goals will eventually come particularly when playing a poor defense like West Ham, however West Ham will smell blood on this wounded Liverpool team.
This game has the potential for a lot of goals and I can&#x27;t pass up this bet.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s match: Carolina Panthers vs Los Angeles Rams (NFL)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: LA Rams -8.5 Alternate Spread (-135, Fanatics)

Won&#x27;t be too long of a write up simply because we took the 49ers on Monday night on the spread vs the Panthers and everything in my writeup there can apply here. I think the Panthers are bottom feeders and Bryce Young is still not good. The Panthers 6 losses this season have been by an avg of 17 points a game and they have lost by 10+ in all of them except vs the Cardinals. The Panthers now face their toughest opponent of the year in the Rams with Matthew Stafford leading the MVP race being levels above Bryce Young. If the Panthers could not put up double digits in crucial game to take the lead in their division vs a 49ers team that had given up 22+ in 7 of their last 8 games then I fail to see them do better against this Rams team who are not only much better offensively but also defensively. This Panthers defense is also banged up missing their star corner in Jaycee Horn who was responsible for picking off Purdy twice on Monday night. BOL and bet responsibly.</td></tr>

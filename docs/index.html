Game: NHL- Golden Knights at Ducks (8:30 PM CST)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Tomas Hertl over 0.5 pts -125 (FD)

The Knights offense improves greatly when Hertl is on the ice. Among forwards with 300+ TOI, he&#x27;s ranked 11th (out of 402) in xGF/60 and 30th in actual GF/60. Hertl also historically has success against the Ducks, with 10 points in 9 games since the 23-24 season.

Ducks rank in the bottom 6 in goals against/game and save%. They are one of only four teams without a shutout. None of their goalies have a save% over 90%.

Hertl may start on the third line, but he should still get his usual 17-19 minutes.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Delhi Capitals Women’s ML 1.58 vs UP Warriorz Women

Event: Indian Premier League

Edit:

I’m backing Delhi Capitals Women to win this match. UP Warriorz have struggled with their bowling this season, which plays right into Delhi’s strengths. With explosive batters like Shafali Verma at the top, along with strong middle-order contributors such as Lizzie, Niki and Rana, Delhi have the firepower to put pressure on the Warriorz attack.

This is also a must-win game for Delhi, and they tend to step up in these situations. On the other hand, UP Warriorz Women have shown vulnerability when batting first, often failing to post competitive totals. If that trend continues, it gives Delhi a clear edge to control the game and finish on top.

&gt;Team Einarson and Team Sturmay play this afternoon in the semifinal. Team Einarson got absolutely smoked yesterday against Team Lawes, Einarson really struggled to make the big runbacks and upweight hits. Team Sturmay&#x27;s third, Schmiemann, has been very strong this week, making every peel that Sturmay calls. This ability to keep the front open late in ends has been crucial for Team Sturmay&#x27;s success this week and will go a long way toward keeping the match close. This style of play will also lean into Einarson&#x27;s struggles with her hitting this week and, conversely, Sturmay&#x27;s strong hitting this week. In their previous matchup, at the trials, Einarson won 9-7. I expect a very close match here where Team Sturmay cover the spread.</td></tr>

**Write Up:** Sweatiest that a bet could get honestly but they pull through both with late winners, feels good. I&#x27;m going to keep this quick and simple as I am short on time.

Aston Villa vs Brentford has seen BTTS 6/8 last meetings, it is being played at Villa park which is usually a massive boost for AV in terms of performance - HOWEVER the injuries to McGinn, Tielemans, Kamara in midfield means that although they have quality they are relying on players that would not normally be first choice. I do see Brentford squeezing a goal through here with the players they have. I see it being 2-1 Villa, either way I do not see a clean sheet for either team.

Man U vs Fulham have seen under 10.5 corners in 5/6 meetings, with Man utd on a 4/5 current game streak. With both teams averaging around \~4.4-4.6 corners per game and if you do the maths that totals to around 9. At Old Trafford Man Utd play much better, more controlling football won in midfield and im predicting the corners to be around 7/8 coming mostly from clearances from other set pieces instead of open play. I also like AV ML + Man U ML if anyone is looking at money lines.

Apologies for the short writeup, tail or not up to you but have a wonderful day everyone regardless.

**Recap + overview(?):**

My hangover hit me hard yesterday and my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> shows that. It was absolutely horrendous and the worst <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> so far. Apologies but <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> will make up for it with a huge 4U bet that has been succesful in recent times.

3/3 4U bets and 1/1 5U bets have hit. Let&#x27;s continue that.

**Write Up**

A 4U bet is here and it might seem risky to some but let me take you through this one. I absolutely love this spot and am excited for the game!

Man United has been reborn under Carrick. Winning his first 2 games against no other than Man City and Arsenal.

Whilst the away game vs Arsenal was pretty evenly matches, the home game vs Man City was just dominating. Which makes me hopeful for another home game <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.

Man United have a record of 6-3-2 in home games in which they have scored 20 and conceded 13 goals.

Only losing vs Arsenal 0-1 and Everton 0-1. Both games Man U were the better team but failed to get a result. At home Man U is dominant and I expect <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> to be the same.

Fulham away have a record of 3-2-6 with 11 goals scored and 18 conceded

Their more positive results have come in their last 5 away games, which could be a problem but here is why it&#x27;s not

The teams and their home ranks:

Wins against Tottenham(#19, 9 points), Burnley(#17, 10 points) and West Ham(#18, 10 points)

Draw vs Crystal Palace(#15, 12 points)

Loss vs Leeds (#13, 19 points)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> they face Man U, ranked #12 with 21 points. With a home win Man U will rise to #5/6 with 24 points. Depending on goal diffence. 

Fulham are still not a convincing away team and with the honeymoon phase of the new manager this will continue.

H2H the teams are 17-3-2 in favor of Man U in their home games. 

This year the reverse fixture ended in a 1-1 draw. Which gives me even more hope for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.

If Fulham couldn&#x27;t beat Man U at home with their 7-2-3 record then away with their 3-2-6 record it will be really tough.

A big 4U play. It has been succesful before and it will continue here.

Fade or tail, BOL!</td></tr>

| P**ick:** ***FUT ML*** (vs. G2) | **2.10 odds** | **1u** |

| **Reasoning:** Everyone is going to auto-click **G2** here because of the logo and name value, but this matchup feels like one of those spots where the odds haven’t fully caught up yet.

**FUT Esports** are not a fluke run. This roster is built around a **tight academy-style core** that’s already proven they can handle tier-1 pressure. Their wins earlier in Krakow weren’t scrappy cheese maps – they were **structured, disciplined series**, with strong CT sides and confident mid-round decision making. That matters a lot against teams who rely on individual openings.

On the other side, **G2 Esports** still live and die by momentum. When G2 get rolling, they look unbeatable – but when early rounds slip away, they can tilt into over-aggression and hero plays. That’s exactly the kind of opponent FUT have punished so far: slow the pace, trade efficiently, and force uncomfortable retakes.

From a **map pool perspective**, this matchup isn’t nearly as one-sided as the odds suggest. FUT have looked very comfortable on staple maps like Mirage and Dust2, and they’ve shown they can punish mistakes rather than needing flashy executes. If they avoid getting dragged into G2’s best comfort <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, this series becomes very playable.

The biggest edge here is **pricing**. At current odds, you’re not being asked to believe FUT win this match 7 out of 10 times – just often enough that the risk is worth it. Given their current form, confidence, and the fact that they’re still slightly underestimated, that feels reasonable.

**TL;DR:**

* FUT are structured, confident, and already proved they belong at this event
* G2 are dangerous but inconsistent when momentum swings
* Map pool + form make this closer than odds imply

Event: LA Kings @ CAR Hurricanes | 3:00 PM EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: Under 5.5 Goals (+102) 2u To Profit 2.04u

Write-Up: Volkanovski won the decision handily, went exactly how I wanted it to! The Los Angeles Kings are coming to Charlotte to play the Carolina Hurricanes. In net for the Canes is Brandon Bussi, he has had a phenomenal year so far. On the season, Bussi has a save percentage of .908 and a 2.25 goals against average. The Kings have Anton Forsberg in net for this one, he is considered the backup but has been playing at Darcy Kuemper’s level, if not better. This season, Anton Forsberg has a .910 save percentage and a 2.35 goals against average. Kings are doing pretty bad offensively this season, ranking all the way down at 29th in goals. Hurricanes on the other hand are on the higher end of scoring, ranking 5th in goals on the season. Despite them being a high scoring team, I’m not worried because the Kings are good at limiting shots, ranking 11th in least shots on goal allowed. The Hurricanes are the best at limiting shots on their goalie, having the least shots against this season. With 2 goalies having great years, and both teams limiting shots on goal well, I expect there to be few scoring opportunities. I also expect these goalies to stop the dangerous scoring opportunities due to their high save percentages.

Take The Under 5.5 Goals!</td></tr>

Last pick: Rudy Gobert Over 12.5 Rebounds (✅ WIN)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the day</mark>: Karl-Anthony Towns (NYK) Over 11.5 Rebounds

Reason • : KAT is the NBA&#x27;s current rebounding leader at 11.8 RPG. While Ayton and Hayes provide height for the Lakers, they are middle-of-the-pack in preventing center rebounds. With Austin Reaves OUT, the Lakers lose their most efficient secondary playmaker, leading to more forced shots and a higher volume of misses for KAT to secure.

Scenario A (The Long Bounce): Luka Doncic and Jalen Brunson engage in a &quot;clash of the titans.&quot; Both stars take high-arc shots that produce long rebounds. Since Ayton and Hayes stay deep to box out, these &quot;over-the-head&quot; balls fall right into the hands of the active KAT.

Scenario B (The Fatigue Wall): The Lakers are on the 7th game of an 8-game road trip. In the second half, road-weary legs stop jumping. KAT is fresh at home and should dominate the 3rd and 4th quarter glass simply by being the more energetic big man on the floor.

Scenario C (The Hart Compromise): Josh Hart &quot;vultures&quot; his usual 8 boards, but because the Lakers&#x27; shooting percentage drops due to travel fatigue, there are 50+ total rebounds available. KAT and Hart both eat well, finishing with 13 and 9 respectively.

Scenario D: The white flag 🏳️ : The Knicks dominate early and lead by 25 points. Brown pulls KAT with 8 minutes left in the game to preserve him. KAT finishes with 10 rebounds, missing the Over because he didn&#x27;t play a single minute in the final frame.

Scenario E: cold night: KAT gets into early foul trouble trying to guard a driving Luka. He spends the first half on the bench, loses his rhythm, and finishes with a season-low 6 rebounds while Josh Hart and Mikal Bridges clean up the mess.

Scenario Proof: KAT has cleared 11.5 rebounds in 6 of his last 10 games, and currently leads the league in total rebounds (532). Even with the &quot;Vulture&quot; presence of Hart, KAT’s 31.6 minutes per game at home historically result in double-digit boards against non-elite rebounding teams like this road-weary Lakers squad.</td></tr>

NBA | Kings v Wizards | 🏀  

Another hook as he ends at 5 rebounds, minutes cut short to the blowout too but overall definitely expected more upside..

Not getting too deep into this one, system play against the Wizards take your bigs against em. Wizards are allowing most rebounds to centers and top 3 in points allowed to centers. 

Rebounding numbers haven’t looked great lately but that’s largely due to the big minute restrictions on his first few games back, minutes are ramping up and gets the best possible matchup here. Had 13/6 in the earlier meeting but only played 21 minutes due to the heavy restrictions. Played 33 minutes against the Knicks &amp; 28 against the Sixers most recently (foul trouble) should be in for 30+ here. Has had a double in 4 straight games prior to that against the Wizards.

In his last 3 games he’s avg 19.5 rebound chances so the chances are there, scoring wise Domas should dominate against this horrible Wizards interior, allowing 3rd most points in the RA.

Don’t mind his PRA or PR either, but when u get a playable line for a Domas DD and especially in this matchup it’s a no brainer.</td></tr>

This <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Rangers ML vs Hibernian. +110

Writeup: This is more about Hibernian to me over Rangers. I honestly think the odds should be much lower for rangers because of one simple issue. Hibernian are missing THREE key players: Campbell, O’Hora and Mulligan. Campbell was injured first which didn’t really shake their rhythm because they now have to play McGarth out of position but I think the main issue is both Ohara and Mulligan being injured at the same time. Mulligan is a holding midfielder and Ohara is a cb and both going out at the same time really tarnished their defence and chemistry a bit. You can see this seeing as they lost both their next games after that. Im going heavily based on these 3 key players being out and let’s hope rangers can get us all a good straight or parlay.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the day</mark> (two units) Ausur Thompson over 1.5 steaks (-130 on Fanatics, other books already at -160 and climbing). Game at 6:00 pm vs the Nets. He is coming off a six steal game. He has at least two steals in eight out of his last ten. He is averaging 2.7 steals per game for the last ten. The Pistons get the pleasure of playing the Nets who rank in the bottom third for ball control and turn it over frequently. Thompson should be on Michael Porter JR regularly, who for a wing, commits a lot of turnover. I like many of the. 
 pistons props all over this game. The Pistons like to play with tempo and the nets do not so I suspect (with the over/under of only 214) a grind it out game with lots of post ups and jump shots. These create more opportunities for steals .</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: PSV vs Feyenoord - PSV ML(-150)

8:30 AM EST, ESPN+

I find this to be quite good value. PSV have been far and away the best team in the Netherlands for the last season and a half, and Feyenoord is a distant second. PSV has a 14 point lead on the table at this point, and a win tomorrow would essentially wrap the league up. Feyenoord have been in very poor form as of late(I&#x27;m a bit surprised their coach, one of my favorite former players Robin Van Persie hasn&#x27;t been fired). PSV are winless in three(though two of which were very difficult UCL fixtures), after a blistering run of form, but Feyenoord have struggled to find any sort of consistent form since late October, since they lost to PSV at home. Since that match, Feyenoord has 5 wins, 2 draws, 10 losses. Very poor for their standards. PSV have also gotten the better of Feyenoord in their last four matches. PSV also has the best home record in the league(though not as good as their away record), a better offense and a better defense than Feyenoord. Feyenoord has struggled against top teams away from home.

Write up: I can’t get a read on either side of this game in terms of who’s gonna cover. But I do love the value we get with the total. The line opened at 152.5 and now it’s even at 150.5. Buying down 2 points at -155 is tremendous value. Illinois has been rolling with 8 straight victories while Nebraska is looking to bounce back. Illinois is battle tested and poised as we saw last week against Purdue. Nebraska is looking to create a bang in front of their home crowd. I don’t see a reason why either offense can’t explode for 75-80. We’re moving with caution so only sprinkle 2u, but I love this matchup. These two exploded for 163 last game and I don’t see that slowing down too much. Not to mention the potential for overtime and a chance for a plethora of late game free throws. Let’s take these two dawgs to score 149 points. Let me know if you’re riding with! Happy Sunday!

1st plays 2nd here. PSV have a nice buffer at the top which they will want to maintain. At home in the Eredivisie they are ruthless averaging over 3 goals per game. Feyenoord also have a growing injury list.

I suspect PSV will win so my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> was going to be PSV &amp; over 2.5 goals for the match but a 2-2 draw wouldn&#x27;t surprise me as I do expect both teams to score.</td></tr>

Sunday’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> - Djokovic o2.5 total breaks for serve +100 (1u to win 1u)

I’m pretty torn on what’s going to happen in this match and I don’t think anyone is going to be able to say with confidence one way or another. Carlos is younger and probably has an easier time recovering from a match like that, but Djokovic has so much experience on tour, a good H2H against Carlos, and has never lost in the final here. 

Here is what I do know. Djokovic is undoubtedly the greatest serve returner of all time and he has had 3 or more breaks of serve in every match so far this tournament. Alcaraz hasn’t gotten broken too many times this tournament, but he has had a good amount of break points saved. Zverev 2/7 on break points. DeMinaur 2/7 on break points. Moutet 2/4. Hangman 1/7.

I like Djokovic’s chances to get 3 or more breaks in this all timer of a match.

Good Luck!</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: 🏀 Memphis -9.5 (-112)

Game starts at 3pm EST. Bet 2.25u

Writeup: This game has teams of similar play styles, and it is typical for the better team to shine in this scenario. This better team would be Memphis, who has a top 50 defense against a Tulane offense outside the top 200. Beyond the defense, Memphis is simply better in every way besides slightly more consistent play from Tulane. Tulane could force some turnovers on defense, but their allowed field goal percentage is below 200th in the nation. On the flip side, Memphis’s allowed field goal percentage is top 30. This is simply the better team, and I expect the home crowd to back Memphis’s defensive play, who has the 18th best home effectiveness in NCAA basketball. Give me Memphis to show out for their fans and win by double digits.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Aurora Map 1 ML (+160)** vs. Falcons 5u

Game/Event/Time: Counterstrike 2 (CS2) | IEM Krakow | 8:00 AM EST.

\-If anyone needs help finding the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> or a place to bet esports can always reach out!

***Aurora:***

* Aurora made one roster change in the off season, replacing jottaaa with soulfly, overall imo it is a downgrade in skill but an upgrade in vibes for a team that probably needs more help with vibes then skill anyway. In their first tournament with soulfly they struggled heavily bombing out to GamerLegion. So far this tournament they have improved a lot, beating GamerLegion in the opener, losing a close 2-1 to PARIVISION who might be the hottest team in the world right now, and beating paiN 2-0 yesterday.

***Falcons:***

* Falcons haven&#x27;t played since BLAST where they went on a super impressive run without star rifler kyousuke which they got 2nd place upsetting Vitality, before losing 3-0 in the finals to PARIVISION. Kyousuke is back and they will be looking to start the year strong and get in title contention

***Head to Head:***

* These roster cores faced off 5 times in 2025, Aurora went 9-3 in overall maps against Falcons core, and beat them in 4/5 of the series overall taking at least a map in all of them
* A lot of these matches are outdated in fairness, Aurora have gotten worse and Falcons got kyousuke. However. Aurora strategically have done well against Zonic and this matchup has been favorable

***Veto:***

* Aurora lower seed so Falcons gets selection, almost every team picked to veto 2nd with higher seed this tournament so far outside of Spirit being the one exception, expecting Falcons to do the same meaning Map 1 will be Aurora <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>
* Aurora ban Ancient, Falcons ban Overpass
* Aurora <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> Anubis

**Anubis Stats:**

* For those that don&#x27;t know, Anubis was readded to the map pool to start 2026, it took the place of Train. There was no one happier about this then Aurora, these guys loved Anubis, they played it the most of any tier one team, they single handedly defined the Anubis meta and were for the entire time the map was out, the most dominant Anubis team in the world.
* Falcons used to permanently ban Anubis, this was their old ban back when it was still in the map pool. Since it came back, it has not been their ban and they have been banning Overpass instead. Falcons for that reason have 0 maps played on Anubis as a core roster
* Falcons played this map once since it was readded, they lost to Vitality 13-4 in brutal fashion looking quite poor throughout the series on the map.
* Aurora as stated above are known for this map, in 2024 + 2025 combined this roster core went 40-13 while mostly playing top teams/tier one/1.5 teams on the map. A nearly 76% win rate on the map, they dominated every team on it and were so strong both tactically and with their rotations on the map
* Aurora picked Anubis in their series against PARIVISION, they dominated on it 13-5 against one of the hottest teams in the world. That is the only time we have seen them play it as most teams are banning it against them</td></tr>

Rangers has kinda gone little under the radar this season with all the drama around Celtic and how big of a surprise Hearts has been, nobody outside of Scotland is talking about how well Danny Rohl has got them playing. Hibs aren’t doing too badly so far this season with their 5th place, but I don’t see them having what it takes to win this one. </td></tr>

Two losses in a row unlucky. Honestly Spirit played horribly and overcooked on drafts with cheesy Puck carry for Yatoro and useless Viper picks both maps, that’s why for tomorrow’s game I’m going with Team Yandex ML. These two teams have already played in the grand finals last major two times and both times Yandex won and Spirit took only one map out of the 5 maps they played. After watching Spirit <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> I think Yandex has the edge.

Goodluck

Chira has played 8 maps so far this tournament. He has hit this line in 7 out of 8 maps with average of 7.5 kills per game. He picked mostly Slardar, Earth spirit and Puck. All these heroes are playmaking heroes which increases the chances of hitting this line even more.</td></tr>

**New Event:**  Australian Open Final – Alcaraz vs Djokovic

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:**  Set 1 Over 8.5 Games &amp; Over 3.5 Total Sets @ 1.85 (5 units)

I love to watch quarter finals onwards for tennis slams and they never ever disappoint.  The bets may not always go as planned but the matches tend to be of great quality especially in the semis and finals.  These semis we just witnessed yesterday were perhaps the greatest semifinals I have ever seen, both going the distance to 5 sets with plenty of drama.  Alcaraz with cramps and vomiting, somehow surviving the last 3 sets in a 5+ hour match to beat Zverev, whom once again manages to implode and not close out the match.  In the other match, Djokovic managed to beat Sinner in a stunning 4+ hour upset.  I posted a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> for Djokovic to lose 3-0 and lost bad.  He was a 13 to 1 moneyline longshot to win.  Noone gave him a chance.  Yet he proved once again he is truly the GOAT.

Now these two players go to the final of the Aussie Open but not without concerns.  Alcaraz was suffering from serious leg cramps and nausea and was unable to run for most of the 3^(rd) and 4^(th) sets.  Yes, he is only 22, and chances are he will recover quickly unless there is a more serious injury we do not know about.  While Zverev foolishly did not take advantage of his injured opponent, should this happen again to Alcaraz, Djokovic will be merciless.

Djokovic, at 38 years of age, will be taking the court against the world’s number 1 ranked player less than 48 hours after his marathon victory.  He has been known to dig deep and has the strongest mental stamina ever seen on court.  However, this guy did not get any sleep until well after dawn yesterday and coming into play will not only be fatigue, recurring blisters he has been having and inadequate physical recovery time, but there are also questions whether he will be able to keep up with Alcaraz after long a 5-setter with Sinner. 

Djokovic is chasing his 25^(th) career Grand Slam title which would place him atop of all other tennis greats.  He has had it very easy until the semis of this tournament, and he may never get another chance to come into a final with such little exertion on the court overall.  Last year in the US Open he was toast by the time he got to the final, and had no energy left.  This time it is different, and he wants this one bad.  Beating Sinner and Alcaraz back to back would be a monumental accomplishment.  As far fetched as it sounds, if there is any man on the planet that can pull it off it is Djokovic.  I am definitely not betting against him anymore.

**Leg 1 - Set 1 Over 8.5 Games**

Alcaraz and Djokovic have played 10 previous H2H matches.  The only 2 matches that did not have at least 9 games were played on a Grass surface and Djokovic lost both as that is not his best surface to play.  The other 8 averaged at least 10 games.

**Leg 2 - Over 3.5 Total Sets**

Given what may be perhaps the closest Djokovic may ever get to winning his 25^(th) title, and after the performance he put against the world’s #2 player, I just don’t think he will do down without a fight.  Meaning, even if Alcaraz wins it most likely will not be in straight sets.

On the flip side, if Djokovic manages to win this match, it would be even less likely that Alcaraz goes down in straight sets.  The kid is the #1 ranked player for a reason and up until his last match, he had not dropped a set the entire tournament.</td></tr>

Brentford are absolute frauds on the road. three wins in eleven away games is pathetic for a team &quot;fighting for Europe&quot; haha.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Tottenham Win or Draw, +110, 1 unit

**Write Up:** Tottenham are Guardiola&#x27;s **bogey team** as he&#x27;s **lost more games to Spurs than any other opposition** in his illustrious managerial career. We know **Manchester City are totally out of form** and they were rocked back by some truly embarrassing defeats, for example, the recent schooling by Bodo/Glimt in the Champions League. Their **Premier League form doesn&#x27;t look great** either as they&#x27;ve registered just **one measly win in their last 5 matches.** Nothing seems to work for the Citizens at the minute. Their gameplay is stale and consists of robotic passes back and forth, seemingly without any line breaking. Reijnders has been absolutely atrocious for them, not excelling at a single task (truthfully, he&#x27;s barely average at anything), while Foden looks more like a passenger with each passing game. There&#x27;s no sense of urgency and the team sits back and relaxes way too quickly when they&#x27;re in front. Even the Norwegian robot, **Haaland is on a bit of a goal drought.** To make matters even worse, one of their few penetrative players, **Doku, is out** for this clash. On the other hand, *Spurs are on a bit of a roller coaster themselves with 0 wins in their last 5 Premier League outings,* but they did <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> 3 hard fought draws in that time. And we all know, a draw is more than enough for us here.

Based on the bogey team situation, the Doku absence, and general poor overall quality of City&#x27;s gameplay, I&#x27;m backing the Spurs to get something out of <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>&#x27;s game.

‎Dortmund are straight-up flying in the Bundesliga right now. They&#x27;re sitting 2nd in the table with **42 points from 19 games**, only one loss all season, and that +21 goal difference shows how solid they are at both ends. At home? Unbeaten ***7 wins, 2 draws from 9 matches***. The Yellow Wall is gonna be rocking, and that&#x27;s not just hype; teams crumble there when BVB get on top early.


‎BVB had a rough midweek in Europe (lost to Inter or whatever), but they always bounce back strong in the league. Their attack is clicking Guirassy and the boys are scoring for fun and Heidenheim&#x27;s defense is basically an open door.

‎**Ajax** are in decent nick this season, sitting 3rd with around **37 points from 20 games**, and their attack is firing on all cylinders ***39 goals scored so far***, averaging close to 2 per game overall. Away from home they&#x27;ve been leaky at the back sometimes (conceding 17 in 9), but up front? They&#x27;ve dropped 20 goals in those away matches alone, which is nuts , econd-most in the league for away scoring. Guys like Godts and the rest are clinical, and even if they&#x27;re rotating after Europe or whatever, they still create chances like crazy against weaker sides.


‎Excelsior?, their defense is a mess. They&#x27;re down near the bottom, ***conceded 35 goals in 20 games (that&#x27;s 1.75+ per match)*** , and it&#x27;s worse away but home isn&#x27;t much better they&#x27;ve shipped plenty at Woudestein too. They&#x27;re struggling to keep clean sheets, only a handful all season, and against top teams they get opened up quick. Last time these two met earlier this year, Ajax won 2-1 (wait, no,actually Excelsior nicked a shock away win back then, but that was an outlier, historically Ajax smash them).

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** (CBB) No. 9 Illinois (+2.5) at No. 5 Nebraska

**Start Time:** 4:00 PM ET (FS1)

**Odds:** \-110 (FanDuel)

**Units (to win):** 1.5U

**Reasoning:** Nebraska broke the hearts of Illinois on Dec. 13, knocking home a three at the buzzer to secure a dramatic 83-80 victory in Champaign.

But instead of dwelling in their feelings, the Fighting Illini (18-3) have used that loss as a springboard, winning 10 straight. That includes six victories by double-digits and all but two by eight or more points. To earn a 11th consecutive win on the road against a Top 10 foe will be no easy task, however, under head coach Brad Underwood, Illinois has earned six such victories over the last seven seasons—tied with Alabama for the most in the nation.

As for the Cornhuskers (20-1), they will rely on their stingy defense to bounce back after picking up their first loss of the season.

Through 21 games, Nebraska ranks 14th in the country in defensive efficiency (0.936). However, when the team has faced top offensive units—Illinois enters ranked first in the category (1.244)—the defense has struggled. In five contests against opponents that rank Top 40 in offensive efficiency, the Cornhuskers have conceded an average of 80.0 points on 47.8% shooting from the field (33.4% from beyond the arc). Furthermore, each opponent managed to shoot above 46% from the field and all but one topped 34% from long-range. That includes the Illini, who poured in 80 points on 48% shooting (34% from deep) in the previous meeting.

The X factor in this one is plain and simple: Keaton Wagler.

The freshman was pivotal in Illinois upset of then-No. 4 Purdue last week—46 points on 13-of-17 shooting—and he was equally as effective in the team’s 75-66 victory against Washington on Thursday, pouring in 22 points to go along with eight assists. The Illini will need hip to be on top of his game and get the rest of his teammates involved on Sunday.

Trust Illinois to get revenge on the road.

•I was stuck all day between Djokovic to win 1 set or Alcarez ML - rolling with his ML - Alcarez has the tools to beat Djokovic in this one, as he has showed us in their previous matches against one another - he’s faster, has more endurance, and a little more aggressive - Part of me is sitting here thinking the obvious, how much does Novak have left in the tank after the other day - On the flip side, I don’t think that applies much to him because he’s shown for years, he’s the top dog, and get through anything, like the match against Sinner - it’s going to be another strength vs experience in this one and I’m rolling with Alcarez on this one, hoping he doesn’t <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> up an injury during the match - also stinks that it’s at 3:30am EST.. so I unfortunately won’t be able to watch 

•If Alcarez wins, and we get to the 2nd leg of the parlay, and Florida lets me down AGAIN, they will be headed towards the no bet list - I was wary about Florida after that Auburn game, but man, they answered questions on the road against South Carolina the other night - The first thing that sticks out to me in this matchup between Alabama and Florida is the rebounding edge that Florida brings - They are 1st in the country in RPG &amp; ORPG - They are a top 50 team in the country in terms of defense efficiency, which should slow Alabamas high scoring offense down - On the flip side, Alabama’s defense is subpar at best - With a defensive rating not even in the top 200 in the country…….. To be continued…..

**Last Pick**: Leeds United vs. Arsenal BTTS-YES 4u ❎

Tough luck here. I think the line was good given this is Leeds second game all season not scoring at home so not overly upset about it. 

**Event**: English Premier League: Tottenham vs. Manchester City 8:30am PST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>**: Manchester City ML (-143) 2u

**Write up**:

Manchester city have had a rocky season so far, but since the additions of Guehi and Semenyo they have looked much stronger. Pep has been rotating to squad and it seems like the lineup is getting somewhat finalized currently, plus having Nunes back has made them look much more comfortable in the back. I will preface this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> by saying I am a City fan, so I watch every single game. If this match was a few weeks ago I would never make this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, but these new signings have been incredible. I will also note that the Bodo game didn&#x27;t include either of these players and city were missing a couple good pieces due to injury who are now back. 

With Arsenal dropping points to United last week, City are still in this title race. A win against Spurs puts them only 4 points off the top (not to mention they will still play Arsenal at the Etihad later in the season). This is a must win for city, and I think they can come out on top. With Doku now out, this is a game for Foden and Marmoush to really prove themselves in this squad. Not to mention Haaland only scoring in 1 of their last 5 games. As someone that&#x27;s seen City in this position the last few years, this is where the season turns around. 

Spurs have been extremely bad at home, sitting 19th in home record only winning 2 games all season. Recently losing at home to a squad like West Ham is further proof of how poor they&#x27;ve been. I&#x27;ve seen my team get railed by Spurs away a lot recently, but with the massive changes to their roster the past couple years, and the likes of Van De Ven and Porto out, I see city stealing this match. 

**FRIENDLY REMINDER**: for people who comment hate AFTER the picks don&#x27;t hit, don&#x27;t forget that you&#x27;re coming to this thread looking for help because you aren&#x27;t able to formulate your own picks.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s Event:** English Premier League (Soccer) | Man United vs Fulham (6:00AM PST)

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Samuel Chukwueze 1+ SOT (+125) 1 unit to win 1.25 units

**Write Up:** Enzo comes through for us again, this time in heroic fashion with a stoppage time game winning goal for Chelsea. I really enjoy late wins, I know some people dislike sweaty wins, but to me they make the game extra fun when you can win up until the last minute. Whatever side of that fence you&#x27;re on, a big plus money win is a great way to start the weekend!

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> we&#x27;ve got what should be a great matchup betwen 6th place Man United and 7th place Fulham. Two teams in great form - United are unbeaten in 7 matches and Fulham have only lost 1 match in their last 8. I&#x27;m giving United a slightly edge at home, but backing a Fulham player to land an SOT.

Chukwueze is a Nigerian winger on his first season with Fulham, having joined from AC Milan in the fall. He has only had a few matches with Fulham, having joined after the season started and being away at AFCON. That said, he has looked very promising when he has played. He scored 2 goals vs Man City back in December and hit a great equalizing goal as a sub in their last match against Brighton. I&#x27;m expecting him to get a start here and find an SOT against United. Keep in mind, he has only started a handful of games this season, so while I believe he will start based on form, there&#x27;s always a chance he does not. 

BOL and happy Sunday!

Excelsior vs Ajax, Over 3.5 goals @ 2.36

Excelsior face Ajax in a game with strong potential for goals. Ajax play attacking football and consistently create many chances home and away. Excelsior matches are often open with defensive weaknesses regularly exposed. Recent meetings between these teams have produced high scoring results. Ajax need victory and will push forward from the start. With both sides favoring offense over defense, over 3.5 goals at 2.36 offers clear value tonight again.</td></tr>

ASTON VILLA VS BRENTFORD

Date: 01 FEBRUARY 2026 at 15:00

BET ON: Both teams to score- Yes

Odd: 1.67



\- Aston Villa and Brentford profiles — both tactically and statistically — strongly point toward Both Teams to Score. Under Unai Emery, Villa’s wide pressing and forward-passing philosophy has been consistently emphasised in press conferences, with Emery explicitly stating his team must “drive forward, control the ball and create danger” rather than sit back when missing key players like Watkins, Tielemans, Kamara and McGinn. This approach inherently opens up transitional spaces, particularly when Villa are missing midfield shielding. Brentford boss Keith Andrews has also stressed his squad must attack with intent on the road and not just counter-attack, a mindset reflected in recent comments about taking the game to opponents even after narrow losses. Statistically, Villa average around 12.2 shots per game with Brentford averaging 10.1 shots per game in recent fixtures, and both teams often register shots on target figures near 4–5 per match, showing real offensive activity from both sides. Across H2H and recent meetings, combined matches frequently reach 20+ shots with balanced xG profiles, indicating that expected goals from both sides are healthy rather than one-sided. Historical match data also show xG totals often above \~2.3 combined, meaning both teams create chances rather than hitting a single goal and sitting in. With Villa’s forward-driven set-ups and Brentford’s proactive intent — plus injuries that weaken defensive cohesion — the tactical scene, combined with shot and xG volume, makes BTTS Yes a compelling expectation rather than a marginal outcome.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: **Florida Atlantic -11.5 (-112 DraftKings) 1U**

Event: CBB | East Carolina @ Florida Atlantic (2 p.m. EST) | 🏀 

*Recap: Sweat. Free. Wake Forest didn&#x27;t want that smoke. Down 18 at the half, and Williams ate for the Wolfpack. At least they beat the heavy snow accumulation. It&#x27;s about all Wake can beat these days.*

Let&#x27;s start with the elephant in the room. This line is low, yes *low,* for two reasons, and their names are Devin Vanterpool and Kanaan Carlyle. All things being equal, I believe Florida Atlantic should be favored by north of 19 points. But things aren&#x27;t equal. FAU is the vastly superior team, but it may take a vastly superior *team* effort to clear 11.5 points. Reason being: neither Vanterpool nor Carlyle played in the Owls&#x27; previous game - Thursday&#x27;s 92-65 mollystomping at the hands of a .500 Memphis squad. They&#x27;re currently listed as game-time-decisions for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>&#x27;s game against hapless East Carolina (6-15). Both these guys average 30+ minutes for FAU (14-8). Vanterpool leads the team in scoring (16.0) and rebounding (6.7). He also adds 2.6 assists and 1.6 steals per game, and makes 35.8 percent of his threes. To say the offense runs through him is an understatement. And Carlyle is no slouch, either. He&#x27;s second on the team in scoring (14.7) and leads in assists (3.3). Both players have a higher than 56 true shooting percentage. If - and it&#x27;s a big if - they can go <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, this line *will* rise. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m grabbing it now. And if they can&#x27;t play, I think FAU has enough in the tank to take care of an incredibly-poor East Carolina side that refuses to cover anything this season and cannot shoot their way out of a paper bag. Let&#x27;s dive in...

We start with a recent common opponent. I played Rice at +2.5 against ECU on Jan. 28. Rice shot 42 percent from 3, held the Pirates to 4-of-19 shooting from beyond the arc, and finished with a six-point win on the road. This is the same Rice team that has lost six straight against FAU by an average margin of 12.8 points. After FAU&#x27;s embarrassing display at Memphis, East Carolina - *at home* \- presents the *perfect* get-right game as the Owls try to keep pace with Atlantic Athletic Conference-leading Charlotte. FAU is one game back in the standings, and they&#x27;re looking to snap a two-game losing streak. I&#x27;m not saying they want to rush Vanterpool and Carlyle back to take care of bottom-feeding ECU, but there is *some* urgency here. FAU&#x27;s next game is Tulsa, winners of five straight and currently sitting a half-game up on FAU. If Vanterpool and Carlyle can play, I believe they will get close-to-typical minutes to find a rhythm and prepare for Tulsa on Wednesday. The AAC is widely considered a two-bid conference. Right now, Charlotte is one, and third-place FAU might be on the outside looking in. They need to set things right against ECU and keep it going against Tulsa. Like I said, there&#x27;s urgency here. Everyone will feel it. Hence, why 12 points feels low even without FAU&#x27;s big two.

Next, don&#x27;t lose sight of the fact that ECU is bad. Real bad. They&#x27;re 7-13 against the spread this season and 1-6 straight up on the road. They&#x27;ve never won in four games at Boca Raton, and they won&#x27;t <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. They&#x27;re also allowing 90.2 points per game at FAU. Meanwhile, the Owls are 9-1 at home and winning games in friendly confines by an average margin of 20.9 points. Granted, this stat leans heavily on Vanterpool and Carlyle&#x27;s contributions. When those two play, FAU covers 70 percent at home. When each plays and scores at least 15 points, FAU is 8-3 ATS. Basically, we are taking this bet and praying for a good injury report tomorrow. What makes me hopeful is that Carlyle was a late scratch for the Memphis game. However, he&#x27;s dealing with a calf, which are ...tricky injuries for explosive guards. Vanterpool wasn&#x27;t even listed on the injury report for Memphis, so his absence is particularly curious. We&#x27;re going to know a LOT more around noon Sunday. I can see laddering this line up as it increases with good news. The contrarian play would be to take ECU at +12.5, +13.5, +14.5 if we learn that Vanterpool and/or Carlyle are definitely out.

KenPom ranks FAU 106th and ECU 274th. The Owls have offensive and defensive rating in the 110s. Their adjusted tempo is 35th. ECU&#x27;s offense (323), defense (168), and pace (106) simply can&#x27;t hang with a healthy FAU. As of this writing, KenPom puts the spread at 13.5, which seems to incorporate the injuries. Bart Torvik has it as a 20-point win for FAU, which I would welcome, but that&#x27;s all mental gymnastics if Vanterpool and Carlyle both sit.

My thesis (oh hell, call it my hope): Vanterpool and Carlyle are healthy enough to play, and they will as FAU tries to keep up in league play. If they do, this line is an absolute steal. If they don&#x27;t, we&#x27;re counting on ECU to continue to play terrible basketball. The Owls are 13-7 ATS this year, and they crushed the Pirates, 81-53, in their previous meeting last season. ECU is dead last in the NCAA in 3-point shooting percentage, so don&#x27;t expect comeback power or offensive surges. They want a slugfest. They want a grind. FAU wants to run. The Owls are averaging 81.9 points to ECU&#x27;s 68.3. FAU needs this. ECU is just happy to be somewhere that&#x27;s not frozen with snow.

Good luck and Godspeed!

One of my favorite props when Inter and Juve play, they have both covered this line 4 times during that last 5 games, they both failed only against Napoli, Audero is an old wolf in serie A, very decent keeper and has had at least 3 saves in every match in the last 5 games, Corvi is 3/5 but sn attacking Juve with a rested team should get the job done.

UFC: Volkanovski vs Lopes $1.7 odds BANG ANOTHER UNANIMOUS DECISION 

3pm AEDT

Alexander Volkanovski should beat Diego Lopes because he’s the more complete, disciplined fighter with proven five-round cardio, elite fight IQ, and the ability to neutralise Lopes’ biggest weapon — explosive finishing. Volk’s constant pressure, feints, and volume striking force opponents to fight at his pace, while his wrestling defence and clinch control reduce the chaos Lopes relies on to create submissions or big moments. Over time, Volk’s consistency, experience in championship fights, and ability to make mid-fight adjustments should allow Alexander Volkanovski to outwork and outthink Diego Lopes, likely winning rounds through control, output, and composure rather than taking unnecessary risks. Additionally, Volk beat him in the last fight by unanimous decision.</td></tr>

Event: Australian Open Final 2:30 A.M. CST

Edit:✅

Backing this to be an incredibly exciting and close to even final. Alcaraz is looking to complete the career grand slam and Joker is looking for number 25. I expect this one to be tight and Alcaraz is probably in better form but what we saw from Joker last round was nothing short of incredible. We saw him playing insane defense and controlled aggression. He’s gonna have to do that again and no sense in not backing that. I expect Alcaraz to come out hot and Joker to settle in. IMO the crowd can push Joker to winning atleast 1 set here and who knows maybe even the whole thing. One of these players may 3-1 or 3-2, but I highly doubt a straight sets here

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Aston Villa ML @ 2.14

Write Up:

Not sure why the odds are this high - this feels like a 1.7 odds <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> or something. Aston Villa at home have 8 wins, 1 draw and 2 losses (18:9 goal ratio), while Brentford away have 3 wins, 0 draws and 8 losses (12:20 goal ratio). Villa have some injuries but I don’t think they’ll lose or draw.

Villa seems to be in a far superior position here.

Also keep in mind that I try not to overthink my picks. They mainly consists of taking a few minutes to look at stats, form and line ups and if I get that “hmm, looks good” feeling then I post it. It has worked out well so far.

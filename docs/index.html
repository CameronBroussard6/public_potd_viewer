Game: NHL- Predators at Bruins (6:00 PM CST)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Elias Lindholm over 0.5 pts -135, 1.74 (theScore Bet)

Lindholm is expected to play on the same line as Pastrnak and Geekie, the top two offensive weapons on the team. And Lindholm himself was a 40-goal scorer just 4 season ago, and he&#x27;s still only 31. This line is one of the most potent in the league, behind only the Avs, Lightning, VGK, and Oilers on a PPG basis.

Their opponent is Nashville, who allows the 4th most goals/game this season. Juuse Saros will probably in goal and this season, this season he&#x27;s the definition of average. I would&#x27;ve expected the odds to be in the -150&#x27;s at best, so -135 is good value imo.</td></tr>

NBA | New Orleans Pelicans @ Oklahoma City Thunder | 8:00 PM ET

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Cason Wallace Under 2.5 Assists (-115) | 2.0 Unit Wager

**Write Up:**  
This sets up as a strong role- and matchup-based assist fade on Cason Wallace. Over his last 10 games, Wallace has stayed under 2.5 assists in 9 of 10 contests (90%), posting both an average and median of 1.5 assists during that span. Notably, the lone over came in an outlier spot, while the majority of his recent games have consistently landed well below this number.

From a usage standpoint, Wallace’s offensive responsibilities remain limited. He is not a primary initiator in Oklahoma City’s offense, with ball-handling duties concentrated among Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Josh Giddey, along with secondary facilitation from Jalen Williams. Despite averaging roughly 24–25 minutes per game, Wallace’s potential assists sit around 3.3, which leaves very little margin to clear a line of 2.5 without an efficiency spike from teammates.

The matchup further supports the under. New Orleans has been effective at limiting assist production from opposing guards, and recent results against similar guard profiles show a trend toward suppressed assist totals. Guards facing the Pelicans in comparable roles have frequently fallen short of their assist lines, reinforcing the difficulty of generating consistent playmaking volume in this matchup.

Given Wallace’s clearly defined role, modest potential assist numbers, and a defensive opponent that limits guard facilitation, this line appears slightly inflated at -115. Without a meaningful change in usage or offensive responsibility, the under presents value in this spot.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Toumani Camara o19.5 pra (-132) DraftKings 2u

**Write-up:** To start, Camara has covered 30 of 47 games. Avdija is expected to play <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, which helps, going from 64% to 67%. What really helps is Camara&#x27;s recent surge in court time. Over his last 10 games, he has averaged 36 minutes, the most on the team. This is because Kris Murray is carrying an injury. Jerami Grant has found his way back into the lineup from his injury, and when Camara, Grant, and Avdija all play, he is 15 out of 21 this season. Without Murray, he is 3 out of 3. I&#x27;m hoping Camara stays on this trend of 30 minutes played because he has covered in 29 out of 39 games (74.5%). He just played the Kings, Heat, Raptors, and Celtics and achieved 22 or more PRA in every game.

Camara is a spot-up shooter who plays GREAT defense. Most of his points come from behind the arc + the restricted area. Wizards rank 26th in defending spot-up shooters this year. Camara is torching teams that cannot defend that type of player, going 14 out of 17 against 20th or worse. In the Wizards&#x27; last 15 games, they are getting blasted from the arc, especially from small forwards, ranking 29th. Camara is averaging 7 three-pointers attempted this season. Camara is making at least 3 threes tonight. Inside the restricted area, Wizards are pretty bad, ranking 26th. 

Wizards are ranked 27th in defending transition points. Really good for us considering the Wizards give up the most steals this season. As I said earlier, Camara plays great defense, averaging a steal a game. Wizards are allowing opposing small forwards to average 2 steals a game, so I see Camara eating. Steals lead to some easy buckets or assists. 

Talking rebounds and assists, the Wizards have consistently ranked 15th or worse in allowing those stats. In the season, they rank 28th in opponent assists and 29th in rebounds. Last ten, they are 25th and 15th. Camara is about to feast! Versus the bottom 16th in allowing rebounds, he has covered at 76% or better throughout the season + last 5/10/15 games. On assists, he sits around the 70% mark. This season, against teams that rank 16th or worse in assists + rebounds at the same time, he is 14 out of 15. If we add horrific spot-up shooting defense, he is a perfect 9 of 9.

Wizards are also giving up a ton of free throws, ranking 29th in FT&#x27;s allowed, plus playing at a fast pace, where Camara thrives. The only way I don&#x27;t see Camara getting 20 pra is if he gets sat early from an uncompetitive game.

<tr><td class='post'>Hoffenheim @ 2.00 - €200.00 (CircusNL)

Last 5 &gt;WWWWW // Profit: €3,692.61

I was debating <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>... shall I put it on Hoffenheim or pass... on paper Hoffenheim should win this but you never know which team is gonna show up. Anyway, my motto is that scared money don&#x27;t make no money. If it looks good, don&#x27;t overthink it.

The reason for me debating it, is because Bremen are not bad at home. Being 11th in the league as a home team and 2-2-1 in their last 5 home games. Hoffenheim though, are the 3rd best away team with a 5-3-1 record and a 17:10 goal diff while Bremen are still in a negative goal diff (11:15). The form of Hoffenheim in their away games have slightly been going down though, but they are in the same spot like Bremen, 2-2-1 in their last 5.

If we look at overall form, Bremen is heading into the wrong direction, being winless in 8 Bundesliga games, having a 0-3-5 record. Hoffenheim are going into this game 5 games unbeaten (4-1-0). H2H is a huge upperhand for Hoffenheim, with them being 7-1-2 against Bremen. At their home, Bremen have not won since 2014 against Hoffenheim in the Bundesliga. Even more, Hoffenheim have won 3 straight games at Bremen currently. Also lots of injuries for Bremen...</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: 🏀 Nebraska +15.5 alt spread + Providence +12.5 first half alt spread (+103).

Game 1 starts at 7pm EST. Bet 2u

Writeup: Taking a shot at this whacky 2 leg parlay where we take some alternate points against two of the best teams in the nation. 

Let’s start with Nebraska at Michigan. There are only 3 teams left in men’s college hoops that are still undefeated who have a chance to make March Madness - one of them is Nebraska at 20-0. While showing some inconsistencies at times, they have a solid all around team on both the offense and defense. They go up against Michigan, who I have as the best team in the country. They have blown out multiple top ranked teams in a fashion we have not seen in a long time. Michigan will have the advantage on the defensive side against Nebraska’s offense, but I also like Nebraska’s defense to hang in there against Michigan. The biggest difference for me is the momentum of this game. Relatively speaking, Michigan has been playing a bit under their standards and have not been challenged recently, whereas Nebraska is absolutely riding this 20 game win streak. If Nebraska starts to feel something, they can absolutely keep it competitive. I would be shocked if they win, but giving them a 15.5 point cushion sounds great to me.

Now let’s move to Providence at UConn. UConn was my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> to win the National Championships this year before the season started, and they’ve certainly shown they’re capable. They are the #2 ranked team in the nation (though I like them closer to #8) and have one of the best defenses in the program, all while going against many quality opponents. Their one drawback is they can be a bit shaky on offense at times, which can hurt their slow and methodical play style. It’s one thing if they were Alabama or Louisville and launched 3 pointers all day, but this UConn play style demands efficiency. This play style is in complete contrast to Providence, who has a top 10 fastest paced offense in the league. This is the type of matchup you circle when making March Madness brackets - fast pace vs slow pace. Upsets come more often when teams have opposite play styles, and this could not be more true here. UConn will have a solid defensive advantage here, but I like Providence’s fast pace and consistency compared to UConn’s methodical pace and slight inconsistencies at times. It wouldn’t surprise me if Providence comes out the gate and takes it to UConn early. UConn should be able to take care of business, but they may need the second half to do so. I like Providence getting a 12.5 point cushion in the first half to take it to the Huskies early.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: Under 5.5 Goals (-105) 2.1u To Profit 2u 

Write-Up: We’ve now made it 7 IN A ROW!!! And I’m very happy that my account here is finally unbanned, let’s keep it going. The Stars are coming to St Louis where they will play the Blues. In net for the Stars we have Jake Oettinger, he has been good this season and especially as of late with his consistency these past games. This season, Oettinger has a .902 save percentage and a 2.61 goals against average. For the Blues, Joel Hofer is in net and he has a .902 save percentage alongside an impressive 2.54 goals against average on the season. This is where I really start to like it, on the offensive side of things, the Blues are terrible, ranking dead last 32nd in goals this season. They also can’t get shots on net, ranking 32nd in shots on goal for the year. The Stars are mediocre on offensive this year, being 12th in goals but they don’t get a lot of shots, ranking 29th in shots on goal. The Stars and Blues played recently, and in that matchup, the Stars could only put up 3 on the Blues with Binnington in net, and Binnington has been HORRIBLE this season. Both goalies are pretty solid, with Oettinger being very locked in these past few games. Both offenses are very weak this season and that will cause this to be a good matchup with a low amount of shots from both teams.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** RB Leipzig Moneyline @ 1.85 (2Units)

**Write-Up:**
Honestly, getting Leipzig at nearly evens against a team sitting in 17th feels like a bit of a gift. I know the &quot;curse&quot; of the Millerntor is a thing people talk about since Leipzig hasn&#x27;t won there in ages, but the talent gap right now is just too big to ignore. St. Pauli is really struggling to find the back of the net they&#x27;ve only got 13 goals all season and their top scorer, Hountondji, is out with a busted ankle. They just played a massive derby against Hamburg a few days ago too, so they’re bound to be a bit gassed emotionally and physically.

Leipzig, on the other hand, looked super sharp in their 3-0 win over Heidenheim over the weekend. Both their full-backs, Raum and Baku, are playing out of their minds and actually scoring goals themselves. Even with a couple of injuries in the midfield, they have way too much depth for Pauli to keep up with for 90 minutes. St. Pauli hasn&#x27;t kept a clean sheet at home in forever, and with Leipzig’s attack starting to click again, I just don&#x27;t see the home side holding them off. It might be a bit scrappy early on, but Leipzig’s quality should take over in the second half. BOL!</td></tr>

Event: Blackhawks vs. Wild, 8pm

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Mats Zuccarello over 0.5 assists

Odds: -128 Fanduel

Reasoning: Zuccarello has recorded an assist in five straight games. At home this year, he has an assist in 9/15 games with eleven total. Tonight, he&#x27;s up against the Blackhawks who are a bottom third team on the road. They allow the most shots against (33.4), have the fifth fewest wins (10), and are eleventh in goals allowed (3.35). Importantly, they are the second worst team in the league in allowing assists to right-wingers (Zuccarello&#x27;s position) with 1.5 per game. So, the combination of Zuccarello being good at home and the Blackhawks sucking on the road is the reasoning for this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Chet Holmgreen over 7.5 Boards and 76ers ML**

Chet Holmgreen should see 8 boards assuming he&#x27;s active on the OFFENSIVE GLASS not just defensive glass. I think due to Missi and DQ being fairly bad on the glass should allow Holmgreen to see boards, this team also loves to throw double teams and it allows easy put backs but I think he may end up scoring more. I think Daigneault will not play around with Chet Holmgren&#x27;s minutes either due to the fact that this is a very ideal match up for Holmgreen so I think he plays 32 minutes easily or at least 31 minutes. 

I love Pelicans for this matchup as they chuck up a lot of threes as well, and they turn over the ball a lot and this team will force turnovers and bad offense. So im hoping to see Poole, Murphy threes from half court or even Hawkings if he sees the floor and I expect Holmgreen to be anchored in the paint due to Zion&#x27;s presence and Missi as well as either can not shoot threes. So expect him to block and hopefully collect boards. Ah also if you want you can take this as a straight at 9.5 if you dont like parlays.</td></tr>

The weekend was a succesful one but sunday did end up a losing day

Let&#x27;s start the week with a quick one and a succesful one. 

**Write Up:** 

Honestly. I want to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> BTTS in the 1st half for 3.50 odds but that is sadly not allowed in <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> because of the high odds. 

So the second best thing is o1.5 goals in the 1st half. 

I will keep it simple <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Basics can be good sometimes. 

9/10 home games saw FC Emmen score in the 1st half. It is almost a given they will score at least one. 

7/11 away games saw SC Cambuur score in the first half. 

The H2H game this season in the reverse fixture had a 3-2 scoreline and both teams managed to score in the first half which ended 1-1 with 7 shots on target. 

Taking this for 2U. It will also cover 1 team scoring twice so it is a nice bonus.

**Event**: Michigan State vs Rutgers (NCAAM) | 6:30 PM EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>**: Rutgers Scarlet Knights +14.5 (-105)

**Write Up**: Penn state was down by 28 at half and ended up with the late cover, exactly how my model predicted it would play out, happy birthday to me! 

My model has flagged another Big Ten matchup as the best <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> from <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>’s slate. While the public sees a mismatch between #7 Michigan State and unranked Rutgers, the math shows this line is far too high due to a fundamental misunderstanding of pace.

**Model Data** 

The total for this game is set at 136.5, implying a game played in the low 60s for possessions.
 
The Math: To cover a 14.5-point spread in a 62-possession game, the favorite must be +0.23 PPP (Points Per Possession) more efficient than the underdog. That is a statistical chasm rarely seen in conference play.
 
The Trends: My backtesting shows that road favorites laying &gt;10 points in games with Totals &lt;140 cover at a rate of just 38%. The lack of possessions simply denies them the opportunities needed to extend (and hold) a lead beyond what the books are saying.

True Line: The model projects a final margin of Michigan State by ~5 points, nowhere near the 14.5 points the books are offering.

**Nightmares at the RAC**

Rutgers has one of the most distinct home court advantages according to the data. Historically, Michigan State&#x27;s offensive efficiency drops by ~12% when playing at the RAC due to the unique sightlines and physical defensive style Rutgers employs at home.

**The Bottom Line**

We’re back to fading a public-heavy road favorite in a game that will be a dog fight in the mud. Michigan State wins, but Rutgers drags this into a grind and stays well inside the number.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Alex de Minaur (+6.5 Games) Vs. Carlos Alcaraz 1.18U to win 1U 

Time: 3:00 AM Central 

I guess this is technically my 2nd posting, but the Australian Open has some weird start times. Running this one because I like it almost as much as the Zverev winner. 

De Minaur has struggled against Carlos, but the beauty with this bet is we don’t need him to win, me might not even need him to win a set. 
De Minaur really impressed me against Bublik, his ground strokes had additional pace and he won in a dominant fashion I didn’t think possible. 

Carlos is a stud, but this will be the best opponent he has faced. I think Carlos new serve still has the potential to get shaky, and this will be Carlos’ first major quarterfinal without his long time coach. 

I think this match goes 4 sets and De Minaur gives us an exciting match.</td></tr>

NBA | Clippers vs Jazz | 🏀  

Giddey had plenty of chances to get it done but ultimately the slow start cost us the most, ends at 13 with nothing in the last few minutes. Tough one

Harden gets the best matchup possible to rack up his assists in this one against the Jazz who’s allowing MOST assists to PG’s this season and most assists allowed in the league overall.

Two man game with Zubac could be lethal here against a weak Jazz interior where Zu should be fed, not to mention that Jazz leaks 3’s aswell where there is good shooters for Harden to find.

Had 7 assists in their last meeting without Zu, but had 11 in the other meeting where Zu was active, both in blowouts where he had 17 potentials in each game.

Of course slight concern for a blowout again but Jazz being at home should hopefully make em stay in the game, spread at 8.5 is suggesting that too. 

Harden won’t get a better matchup, backing him in this one.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>: England | EFL League One | 245pm Eastern | Lincoln City vs Bradford | LINCOLN CITY -0.5 | 2U @ -122

I’m taking Lincoln City -0.5 because the matchup strongly favors them in both form and underlying performance.

Lincoln have been far more consistent this season, especially at home, where they control games well and concede very little. They’re creating more chances, converting at a higher rate, and generally managing matches better than Bradford. Bradford, on the other hand, have struggled recently, particularly away from home, where their defensive record and game control drop off noticeably.

When you combine Lincoln’s home strength, superior recent form, and Bradford’s issues on the road, this looks like a spot where Lincoln should be winning the game outright rather than settling for a draw. Laying the -0.5 simply backs Lincoln to do what the numbers suggest they’re more likely to do — take all three points.</td></tr>

**Reasoning:** Wow that Justin Faulk bet for Faulk was close, his second shot came with 12 seconds left, after first being considered a miss, I had to challenge Draftkings in order to get my payout (i put 3u on it personally), Faulk also got 2 SOG in the last minute of the Kings game as well, so i&#x27;m turning too Jordan Kyrou, he has been on a tear ever since Robert Thomas has been out on injury. He scored 2 goals and the game tying goal vs the Kings (off Faulks 2nd shot) and having points in 4 out of his last 5 games and meeting shooting at least 3 SOG in 4 out of his last 5 games. Both teams just played each other on Friday and was it a good game. Kyrou had 3 SOG and the game in Dallas was settled with a minute left when Dallas took the lead to win. At home, I&#x27;m sure the blues will \*try\* to come out swinging and I&#x27;m riding Kyrou&#x27;s hot hand.

Event: CBB | Creighton @ Marquette (9:30 pm EST) | 🏀

*Recap: What a great game for me, personally. Not only do I hit on the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>, but I hit on LeMoyne at +1.5 moments before tip-off. Why the sudden line flip? Because leading scorer and senior center Shilo Jackson didn&#x27;t play for Le Moyne. But it didn&#x27;t matter. The Dolphins led by 15 at the half and shot 61 percent from beyond the arc in an easy, easy cash. FDU is straight up ass. We move...*

What are we doing here? Marquette already lost 84-63 to Creighton on Dec. 20. If you think homecourt gives you 3-4 points, then this line suggests a 17-point swing. What am I missing? What&#x27;s changed in the last month? Creighton remains the No. 53 team, according to KenPom and Marquette is 124. The Blue Jays have a higher rated offense (49 vs. 136), defense (88 vs. 128) and nonfoncernce strength of schedule (84 vs. 149). The only thing Marquette is better at is pace of play. Creighton is 33rd nationally in 3s made (10.4), which ought to afford them plenty of come-from-behind energy and certainly win-by-at-least-2 motivation. This is a lost season for Marquette. They&#x27;re 5-16 against the spread all year. And *this* is the game where they put it together and cover? Miss me with that. 

Creighton has a huge shooting advantage. The Blue Jays make 46.6 percent from the field, 35.5 percent from beyond the arc, and 75.5 from the charity stripe. All three are miles better than Marquette (42.2 // 30.2 // 67.8). In a close game, that matters. Creighton also turns the ball over 9.7 times per game compared to Marquette&#x27;s 11.1. In a close game, that matters. Creighton is 2-1 in games decided by three points or fewer. 

....I&#x27;ll have more to come but I wanted to write up the line early, since I think it&#x27;ll move more to Creighton&#x27;s favor. For example, it&#x27;s already 2.5 on FanDuel.

Good luck and Godspeed!

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>⭐️:🏀Purdue -3.5 (-120) \[Bet365\]

Start Time &amp; TV 9:00pm EST (Peacock)

Units: 3 Units

Reasoning: Weve got a triple collab lined up for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> as u/SP7988 u/SoggyDatabase2348 and I have put our minds together for this play as we have the #12 Purdue Boilermakers (17-3) taking on the Indiana Hoosiers (13-7). Do not be fooled by the 82-59 drubbing of a very bad Rutgers squad-239th in defensive efficiency and 258th in offensive efficiency-because when push comes to shove against the upper echelon of the college basketball world, Indiana is the one on the receiving end. The team is just 0-6 vs Quad 1 opponents and 1-1 vs Quad 2 foes. Meanwhile, the Boilermakers (17-3) enter Bloomington looking to let off some steam. The team enters Tuesday night&#x27;s tilt on a two-game slide, despite holding leads of five or more points during the final media timeout of each of its last two contests. The loss to Illinois on Saturday is especially tough to stomach, as Purdue shot a blistering 56.9% from the field (36.9% from beyond the arc) with senior guard Braden Smith chipping in 27 points and 12 assists. This Boilermakers squad has an edge over the Hoosiers in points scored per game, points allowed per game, field goal percentage as this Purdue squad is shooting over 51 percent from the field, rebounds per game, three point percentage, steals per game, blocks per game and less offensive turnovers per game. This Purdue squad has a couple impressive wins this year as they knocked off Alabama on the road as well as handing Texas Tech a beat down by 30 points while Indiana has lost by 6 or more to every ranked team they have played this year with losses to Nebraska by 6, Louisville by 9, Michigan by 14 and Michigan State by 21. These two teams have a few common opponents as these teams have played Minnesota (Purdue W by 28, Indiana L by 9), Iowa (Purdue W by 7, Indiana L by 17), Rutgers (Purdue W by 16, Indiana W by 23), Washington (Purdue W by 8, Indiana W by 10) and Marquette (Purdue W by 20, Indiana W by 23. Purdue is the better team here, and this is a perfect spot for them to bounce back after their last 2 performances - When looking at the data on KenPom, KenPom suggest that Purdue would be -10ish point favorites if they were at home - Purdue is top 10 nationally in FG % while Indiana is outside of the top 75 in FG % - They average 84.2 PPG and hold their opponents to around 68ish PPG - Indiana is 1/4 their L5 - and looking at their recent opponents like Michigan, Iowa, Michigan State, and Nebraska - Indiana does not perform as good as they would against a team that is not Top 25, whether that be home or away - One thing that stands out to me here is the rebounding edge that Purdue brings to the table in this one - Indiana can be beaten on the glass, Indiana ranks outside the top 250 in rebounds &amp; ranks outside the 300 in offensive rebounds - Indiana does average 80+ PPG, but that number is inflated due to their weaker non-conference games this season - Looking at their recent results vs. the teams I listed above, they have not gone above 80 PPG in any of those - Lastly, Indiana is more vulnerable to having scoring droughts - I think, Purdue catches Indiana off guard tomorrow, Purdue is in a great bounce back position here - Purdue is a top 5 team and I think they have something to say tonight at the good ole Assembly Hall.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Utah over team total 111.5 points 


Write Up: It looks like Lauri Markkanen is finally returning, Utah has decided they&#x27;ve tanked enough...for now. 


Starting with bigger picture stats, Utah averages 119 points per game and 123 points at home this year, with or without their star. That&#x27;s a top six offense overall and NUMBER ONE IN THE LEAGUE, and it&#x27;s far above the total of 111.5. They&#x27;re the best offense in the NBA at home. They&#x27;ve covered this total 16 of their last 20 games, and a chunk of those without their star. 


A big part of that is their pace, they are #2 in possessions, and of course, #1 at home in possessions. 


Now we throw in Lauri. Utah is 18 of their last 20 covering this line when he plays, 10 of their last 10.


Now the Clippers are a top 8 defense, but they&#x27;re allowing 116 points on the road vs 113 overall. Both those are still above the total of 111.5. Kawhi is a little dinged up right now, and he&#x27;s been on limited minutes the last 2 games. Not sure if that will continue, but he&#x27;s a Questionable GTD to play, and his defense is a huge part of LAC&#x27;s great defense. 


I&#x27;d be remiss not to mention that LAC has held ALL of their last 10 opponents under this total, so tail with caution knowing that. 




I&#x27;d take the over even if Lauri wasn&#x27;t back (it wouldn&#x27;t be my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>), so I&#x27;m definitely taking it with him coming back to lead the number 1 home offense in the NBA above their projected total.

The Kings probably go with Kuemper. They played in St. Louis on Saturday and then were supposed to go play in Columbus on Monday, but the game was postponed due to weather. Kuemper has given up 3 or more goals in 7 straight games. The one thing that could cause some concern is that the Kings have been a pretty good road team this year.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: (CBB) Oklahoma +2.5 vs Arkansas

Start Time: 7PM ET ESPN

Odds: -105 (DraftKings)

Units: 2U

Reasoning: While the average cbb fan may see number 15 Arkansas as only a 2.5 point favorite against an 11-9 Oklahoma team and think that’s the side to bet on, they are surely mistaken. 

It is no debate that college basketball gives way to a bigger home court advantage than any other sport. While Oklahoma has not looked great at home lately they are still a much better team when playing in the Loyd Noble Center with an 8-2 record. 

Why is this especially more important for this game? While Arkansas has not played many road games this year they have ONE road win and it’s against a subpar Ole Miss team. Arkansas is 1-3 on the road and lack of road tests + lack of road wins = road losses. 

Led by Nijel Pack, Oklahoma has plenty of scoring power to keep up with Arkansas in what is sure to be a very high scoring game. OU is playing well lately almost beating Missouri on the road if not for wild buzzer beaters. 

Lastly, Arkansas is an 8 man deep team. They do not go any further than that on their bench and any bit of foul trouble can really hurt them. They average 1.9 more fouls in away games this year which is a significant amount and can be a game changer in this one. 

Give me Oklahoma to win this SEC battle outright but as always in cbb betting, if they are giving you points, take them. 

I know I am new here and have no credibility so tail at your own risk. I have been on fire betting cbb this year so I figured I’d try to help others out. Hoping to build some credibility over time and make both of us some money during the rest of this cbb season.</td></tr>

We are taking PlayTime Moneyline because the market is disrespecting the experience on this roster.

While recent results have been mixed, these guys (Gabbi, Armel, Kuku, DJ) have way more high-pressure LAN experience than their opponents. In elimination matches like these, decision-making beats mechanics. YB.Tearlaments is a volatile Chinese stack that tends to get messy in the mid-to-late game.

PlayTime’s win condition is simple survive the laning phase and let Kuku and DJ out-maneuver them on the map. At 1.94 odds, we are getting a coin flip price on a team that actually knows how to close out games. I’m banking on veteran discipline to force errors from the younger squad.

**Odds:** \+182

**Write Up:** Right in a rough space here, last 3 have been healthy scratches barely missing by the smallest margins on each play. All from hitting woodwork and poor finishing to getting 11 corners in the last minutes of the game. It is what it is, onto the next.

Im staying confident in my methodology which has proven to work for me. Todays we are visiting the German Bundesliga 1 for TWO fixtures but a mixture of the both. First up is RB Leipzig moneyline, where St.Pauli are winless in 5 fixtures and head to head RB Leipzig haven&#x27;t lost in the last 3. RB sit 5th in the league with St.Pauli fighting relegation in 17th, most of RB&#x27;s losses have come from teams which are similar or are powerhouses in the league (Dortmund, Bayern, even Hoffenheim and Stuttgart in current form). They seem to be winning 62% of their fixtures at these odds with St.Pauli only coming through on 8% - this alone, PLUS their current form gives me confidence that RB will deal with SP and come through. SP are the home team, currently in terrible form going 2-2-4 (W-D-L), RB are 4-2-3 respectively and despite these numbers I am confident enough they have the quality to win.

Second leg of the bet is u11 corners for the other Bundesliga fixture, which has hit u10.5 in their last 8 encounters - current form for corners is last 4/5 for Hoffenheim and 7/8 for Werder Bremen. Hoffenheim sit 3rd and WB sit 15th, WB are winless in 9 games I see them playing for a point at least especially being at home and trying to create a cushion from the relegation zone which they sit 5 points ahead of. Because of this I do think both teams find the net and it could result in an attacking centred but defensively controlled game. Corners tend to be better for unders in games that teams are looking for control in the midfield and defence, while taking advantages of breaks and big chances. Lets hope this plays out how we expect and teams can convert on their chances unlike the last few! If I stuck to my gut yesterday we would be 2W-3L and \~+4.0 units but such is life.

Tonight’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> Arkansas -2.5 vs Oklahoma (7 pm)

Oklahoma has lost six in a row. Arkansas has one of the most efficient offenses in the country and do a great job of spreading assists and playing with tempo. Oklahoma’s hope to win relies on home court advantage, lots of turnovers from Arkansas, or a career night from Xzavier Brown. I think Arkansas is way more talented, more disciplined, and better coached. Arkansas has a size advantage at guard, which I think will be hard to defend. Oklahoma has some size with their bigs, but they struggle in transition and are not as athletic as Arkansas. I look for Arkansas to get to an early lead and push the pace, neutralizing Oklahoma’s bigs and causing foul trouble for Oklahoma’s guards.

TR struggle defensively against high-tempo sides and usually concede early, which opens the game even more. Once Ba get ahead, they rarely slow down, and tran willingness to attack can easily push the total into a high-scoring outcome </td></tr>

**---**

**RB Leipzig** are an impressive attacking side given their position this season. They just put up 8 shots on target against Heidenheim, who sit next to St. Pauli in the table. After such a strong attacking display, I expect them to run it back here as well.

* Leipzig rank third in the league for shots on target at 5.83 per game, and I see them hitting well <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>
* Leipzig have covered this line in 9 of their last 10 games.

\---

**Como** under Fàbregas are something to watch. They just beat Torino 6–0, so there’s clearly no lack of confidence in shooting with this side.

* Como rank third in the league for shots on target as well, sitting at 5.18 per game.
* Como have covered this line in 9 of their last 10 games.

**Write Up:** 

* Nusa with a shot on target in 4/6 away games
* St.Pauli averages the 5th most shots on target against
* RB Leipzig averages the 3rd most shots on target

I love Nusa! When he is in form, he is just so fun to watch. Unfortunately he just gets injured way too often to go on any longstreaks, but he is injury free again now. In his first game back from start he failed to get any on target, but managed five against Bayern Munich and should probably have had a goal with the chances he had, then last round away against Heidenheim he scored and had two on target.

St. Pauli is currently in the relegation zone which is not so surprising when you have only won once since the third round, that win came against the only team that is below them in the league table… So things aren’t going so hot for the host. 

Despite playing out wide on RB Leipzig’s left wing, he gets centrally very often. If you look at St. Pauli’s map over shots faced, you will see a lot of shots in areas Nusa thrives in. 

I see most bookies have it between 1.6-1.65, so one could add St. Pauli over 2.5 corners to boost the odds above evens (Coolbet gives 2.15). 

*St. Pauli has managed 3+ corners in:*

* 3/3 h2h
* 16/18 league games
* 8/8 home games

Event: Australian Open QF 🎾

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Carlos Alcaraz 🇪🇸 3-0 vs Alex De Minaur 🇦🇺 3 units to win 3.8U @2.25 (Bet365)

Alcaraz is the closest to tennis perfection we have in <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>’s game with his elite mix of variety, ball striking/power and movement bringing him to the No. 1 spot. It seems as though he had no holes in his game most of the time except when his focus drops and becomes unrecognisable spraying errors for portions of matches. With how electric his game is it’s almost part of the fun he brings to the court as it can bring some momentary drama to his matches. He’s won 59 of his last 63 matches with only losses to Sinner and Norrie (lmao) but since the US Open it’s just felt like he’s gained a serious boost in consistency in his matches. Alcaraz has dropped just one set in grand slams since Flushing Meadows (against Sinner in the final) and has been dominant yet again here in Melbourne. Following two opening rounds where he was solid if unspectacular he did well to deal steamroll past Moutet’s tricky game and managed to beat Paul in straights in spite of the American playing the match of his life. Carlos is looking to be the youngest person ever to win the golden slam and has been getting better and better, when in confidence he can genuinely be unplayable in the literal sense of the term.

As I’ve said before De Minaur is a very consistently great player with a glass ceiling when playing against stronger opposition. He will give everything he’s got in front to the home crowd, play a lot of balls back but simply doesn’t have the weapons to harm the top of the top. To have a chance at being competitive with a Sinner or Alcaraz you have to either hope they’re having a truly terrible day or redline as they’re simply better in all aspects. It’s almost impossible to sustain such a level of intensity in BO5 like this but De Minaur physically doesn’t have the raw power to do such so I believe he doesn’t even win a set here. ADM loves rhythm which Alcaraz just doesn’t provide but won’t be able to get out of his metronomic style due to the Spaniard’s intensity putting him on the back foot which his opponent should feast on. I expect the demon’s serve to be largely neutralised in this match-up considering it’s already a weakness of his compared to the elite and with how well Carlos has been returning so far. As a result, ADM’s service games should be more contested than his opponent’s throughout the match. 

As I said Carlitos does sometimes dip in quality in matches which is why asking him to not drop a set is risky but I believe fairer odds should be around the 1.9 mark and therefore see value. I have found that Alcaraz has been dropping the tempo in the less important moments (e.g. Moutet recovering from a double break in the second set) by playing with his food before turning the machine back on when it matters (still won 6-4). This seems similar to last year’s AO where De Minaur brushed aside the competition until reaching the quarters where he lost 3,2,1 to Sinner. BOL !</td></tr>

**Last:** (CBB) Arizona -2.5 (1.5u) - ✅

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** (CBB) No. 7 Michigan State (-13.5) at Rutgers

**Start Time:** 6:30 PM ET (FS1)

**Odds:** -110 (DraftKings)

**Units:** 1.5U

**Reasoning:** Death. Taxes. Vegas disrespecting Sparty.

If that Washington line was disrespectful, and if that Oregon line was downright blasphemous, then this line is straight up unforgivable. Especially given that we just got a good look at the disaster of a runaway train that is the Rutgers men’s basketball team when fading them for Friday’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>. 

But mostly, it’s because Michigan State has been playing some of the best basketball in the country right now. 

Since a 58-56 loss at Nebraska back on Jan. 2, the Spartans (18-2) have reeled off six consecutive victories. All have come by 10 or more points with all but one by 16+. Even more impressive, is the fact that the team has done so by an average margin of victory of 22.7 points, including a 91-48 thumping of Maryland on Saturday. Not surprisingly, Michigan State’s recent form has helped it soar up to 4th in the KenPom rankings. 

As is the case with most Tom Izzo-led squads, the defense has been the backbone. 

Through 20 games, the unit finds itself among the nation’s elite, ranking 4th in scoring defense (62.8 PPGA), 6th in defensive efficiency (0.910), 7th in opponent field-goal percentage (38.8%) and 23rd in opponent three-point shooting (29.7%). But it’s the Spartans’ tendency to take it up a notch away from home that makes them a tough out, ranking 1st in defensive efficiency (0.901), 2nd in scoring defense (61.9 PPGA), 6th in opponent field-goal percentage (38.8%) and 31st in opponent three-point shooting (29.7%) on the road. Furthermore, ever since an uncharacteristic showing against lowly Cornell on Dec. 30—97 points allowed on 46% shooting—the unit has been in something of a flow state, conceding just 56.9 points on 37.8% shooting from the field (25.9% from beyond the arc) in seven outings. 

That all adds up to what should be yet another lackluster offensive effort from the suddenly reeling Scarlet Knights (9-11). 

Following a 82-59 beatdown at the hands of Indiana last Friday, the team enters as losers of three straight and four of its last five. And while Rutgers already ranks among the worst in the country offensively—258th in offensive efficiency (1.010), 270th in three-point shooting (31.9%), 277th in scoring (69.7 PPG) and 330th in field-goal percentage (40.7%)—things only take a turn for the worse against stiffer competition. In six contests against opponents that rank Top 75 in defensive efficiency, the team averages just 59.2 points on a porous 37.5% shooting (29.8% from the perimeter). That includes being held to 37% shooting or worse in all but one of those games. 

Unfortunately for the Scarlet Knights, things don’t get much better defensively. 

On the year, the team ranks 170th in scoring defense (74.5 PPGA), 196th in opponent field-goal percentage (44.8%), 239th in defensive efficiency (1.079) and 332nd in opponent three-point shooting (37.2%). Over the last three games, things have gone from bad to worse, as Rutgers has conceded 82.1 points on 48.5% shooting from the field (40.5% from beyond the arc). Not the kind of run of form you’d like to have when hosting a surging Michigan State offense that enters ranked 41st in field-goal percentage (47.9%), 47th in offensive efficiency (1.147), 71st in three-point shooting (35.8%) and 95th in scoring (79.1 PPG). 

But while those numbers won’t jump out of the page at you, take a look at what the team has managed to do in its last six meetings against opponents that rank outside of the Top 200 in defensive efficiency:

Oregon (208): 68 points on 57% shooting (35% from beyond the arc)
Maryland (278): 91 points on 61% shooting (47% from beyond the arc)
Toledo (286): 92 points on 51% shooting (43% from beyond the arc)
Penn State (306): 76 points on 46% shooting (56% from beyond the arc)
Oakland (333): 79 points on 46% shooting (27% from beyond the arc)
Cornell (351): 114 points on 55% shooting (46% from beyond the arc)

Not only did the Spartans go 6-0 in those contests, but they did so while averaging 86.7 points on 52.7% shooting (42.3% from long range). That includes shooting 51% or better in all but two games and shooting 43% or better from deep in all but two as well. 

It will be the intangibles that will play an X factor in this one. 

Michigan State topped 30 fast break points against Maryland on Saturday, marking the third time this season the team has accomplished the feat—the rest of the Big Ten has only done so twice. Not surprisingly, the Spartans rank 7th in fast break points (17.3 PPG; 98th percentile). That’s an area the team should continue to thrive in against a Scarlet Knights team that ranks 156th in opponent fast break points (9.8 PPG; 57th percentile). But where the team truly struggles is in conceding second-chance opportunities to opponents, ranking 222nd in the category (11.7 PPG; 39th percentile). This is another area Michigan State should be able to take advantage, as the team ranks 28th in second-chance points (14.3 PPG); 92nd percentile). 

Forget looking ahead. Expect Sparty to put together another dominant performance to springboard themselves into Friday night’s massive showdown with in-state rival Michigan.

Time: 8:30 PM CT (Tuesday in Aus) 

This <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> hurts my soul as an American tennis fan. Tien has had an awesome run this tourney and has taken the next step. With that being said, taking down Zverev is a tall task. 

Zverev is 38-1 in his career against lefties, and this is his 40th Grand Slam quarterfinal. It will be Tiens 1st. Zverev has a penchant for blowout sets. Even if this match goes 4 sets, I expect Zverev to win a set 6-2 or 6-1. 

Zverevs stronger stroke is actually his backhand, and Tien will not be able to dictate points from his left handed forehand like he did against Meddy. I expect a close start to the match and Zverev to pull away.</td></tr>

Write up: Half a unit bet for me on this one because of the injury concern for Nebraska &amp; Frager - Model has this as the highest confident Edge % and EV % for the day. Will add some personal information in this write-up as well.

• ⁠Model has Nebraska covering +11.5 at 56% (with Frager)

• Model says Michigan ML is at 62% (shows me that they are 11 point favorites with only a 62% chance of winning, might be a closer game than expected) 

• EV better betting 100$ = 10-11$ for this play

• I can’t wait for this game - Nebraska has been rolling this season &amp; Michigan is such a fun team to watch (still mad Cadeau left my Tarheels) - Nebraska is 5-1 ATS in L6 while Michigan is actually trending in the other direction, not covering the spread in their L6 - In the month of January, Michigan has dropped off significantly when playing at home, partially because they are playing conference games now, and not non-conference - the biggest concern here is obviously the pace of Michigan, and the fact that Frager is questionable - regardless, Nebraska is a great team in terms of defense, and I think they will be able to slow down Michigans offense just enough to cover the +11.5 - they have depth, and they really do play team ball - they have enough firepower to cover a bigger spread without Frager - Michigan is fast, Nebraska is not - because of this, the game might not be as fast as Michigan would like, leading to a closer matchup - Michigan will go on runs in this game, they are one of the best teams in the country, and I expect them to have a few good runs in this game - on the flip side, Nebraska is battled tested, they have proven to be resilient - I think they will be able to overcome those dangerous runs of Michigan - Nebraska ranks top 10 in the country in turnovers PG, and I really like that stat against this Michigan team because the less time Michigan can have the ball, the better chance Nebraska has - just like any sport, if you don’t turn the ball over, you have a chance to win - Nebraska is a high effeicent, low turnover team, who is 20-0 - you have to give them their flowers - Now do I think Nebraska is better then Michigan, no, but as you all know, I look for value, just like my bet Duke +1.5 vs Louisville - to get a great team like Nebraska, 20-0 at double digit underdogs, while Michigan hasn’t been great this month against the spread, you have to play it - Rolling with Nebraska here for 0.50U because of the injury questionability

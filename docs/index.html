This <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> is based on both teams last 5 games. BTTS hit in their last 4/5 for both sides. Seeing Real Madrid get thrown out of the cup by Albacete makes me believe even more in this hitting. IMO lower level teams will go extra hard against top tier clubs to prove themselves so I think they will score at least once against Valencia.</td></tr>

**Write Up:** What an easy winner yesterday, wish they were all like that.    
    
For <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today’s pick</mark> I’m going with RHIA, a 4yo mare having her second start this prep. First up was ultra impressive, sitting midfield and winning by almost 2 lengths pretty softly. Now the form to come out of this race is amazing, with most horses running really well at their next starts, but it’s the runner up who really enhances this form, winning its next two starts by almost 3 lengths both times.    
    
<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark> we draw barrier 2, and with only one noted speed influence in the race, I envision us camping right of the leader and having a dream run throughout. Hopefully that’s all she wrote. Never won over the 1100m distance, however last starts finish suggests we’ll handle it just fine.     
    
Opposition is pretty moderate here. The second market elect BOLD RESPONSE has a 4kg apprentice on, so I’m not forecasting a great ride, and some of the others are drawn poorly. There is one danger, KYLE, who ran great last start and now draws a soft barrier. I’m hoping that it lands directly behind us, and has a hard time finding clear air.    
    
For this bet, for every $10 you are putting on, you should be be paid out $23.50 ($13.50 profit). If yours is significantly less, you’ve place the bet wrong.

Writeup: Got a nice win yesterday, but we are back to the the MLBB world champs. The 2 favorites for me this tournament are SRG &amp; Liquid PH (had a banger game the day before). So the 2nd leg is pretty self explanatory, Yangon is good, but not that good. Expect a comfortable win.

Now, coming onto the first leg, while Aurora are the favorite (being from PH), Team Spirit has been pretty decent this tournament, including a win against ONIC Esports (another PH team). Given their ability to draft high-pressure comps around Kid Bomba’s EXP lane , I expect Spirit to secure at least one map (a win looks unlikely, but we can hope)

Last Pick: Roberto Bautista Agut +2.5 games vs Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard (-118, 1 unit): Loss

Tennis | ATP Adelaide | 1:30 AM EST (estimated)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Ugo Humbert vs Alexander Shevchenko | **Humbert to win 2-0 at -125 (DK). 1 unit.**

Write-up: RBA put up a decent fight after being down a set and a break against the huge-serving Mpetshi Perricard, but ultimately fell short in straight sets. Nevertheless, that snapped four wins in a row for me, and I&#x27;m still up +3.06 units on the year, so I can&#x27;t be too disappointed.

This Adelaide quarterfinal is one where I see one player having a significant edge. Ugo Humbert&#x27;s results last year were significantly stunted due to a recurring hand injury, but he was still able to round in to form in the indoor season. Now, after a couple months of rest, he seems to be completely healthy again. Humbert has posted excellent performance ratings in all three of his matches so far (7.77 in a Brisbane loss to Norrie, and 8.0 against Atmane, and 9.04 against Griekspoor). In comparison, Shevchenko has made it through four matches here in Adelaide; however, these were against lower-level opposition, and he failed to score higher than 7.57 in any of them. Shevchenko plays a solid aggressive baseline game, but he doesn&#x27;t have Humbert&#x27;s weapons, and it&#x27;s hard to see him finding a good gameplan in these lively conditions. Additionally, Shevchenko has a woeful 3-10 career record against lefties at this level, including an 0-2 H2H against Humbert. Looking at recent market prices, Humbert was priced similarly to where he is here against Atmane, who I view as more dangerous in these conditions despite his bad current form. Overall, Humbert&#x27;s serve and forehand should make the difference here, and he&#x27;s looking at a pretty reasonable title path if he moves on to the semis.</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>**POTD Record:** 6-4, Net Units +2.51

**Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** NCAAB - NCAAB - Lehigh @ Boston (-2.5) 

**Reaction:** Another brutal loss, two in a row. Whitlock hit a buzzer beater 3 to send to OT and Lehigh wins by 2. 

**Event:** Milwaukee Bucks @ San Antonio Spurs

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Stephon Castle Over 17.5 Points

**Write Up:** Castle enters the matchup with significant momentum and a favorable history against this specific opponent. He is coming off a stellar **20-point performance** against the Oklahoma City Thunder on January 13, and he notably dropped **20 points** on the Bucks in their last meeting. Currently averaging **17.3 points per game** for the 2025–26 season, Castle has become a primary playmaker for the Spurs, frequently logging **30+ minutes** and taking advantage of his aggressive drive-to-the-basket style. This plays well against a Bucks defense that currently ranks **22nd in the league** at defending points from the guard position and allows an average of **115.7 points per game**, making it a prime opportunity for Castle to exceed his season average. At home, Castle’s shooting efficiency often sees a boost, particularly with his aggressive rim-attacking style that leads to a high free-throw rate.

* **Recent Home Highs:** 24 PTS (vs. OKC), 23 PTS (vs. GSW), 20 PTS (vs. UTA). 
* He is shooting roughly **46.1% from the field** on the season, but his &quot;per-36 minute&quot; home splits suggest a scoring ceiling closer to **21 points** when he sees heavy usage.
* **The Matchup Edge:** Milwaukee’s perimeter defense has struggled to contain athletic, downhill guards. Given that Castle is averaging **6.2 free throw attempts** per game, he is likely to exploit the Bucks&#x27; tendency to foul in the paint, providing him with &quot;easy&quot; points at the line to help clear the 17.5 threshold.

Thursday’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> - Blackhawks ML -110 (1.1u to win 1u)

Chicago has looked like a solid team in January despite where they are in the standings right now. In January, they have a 5-2 record and they are 4-1 when Spencer Knight is in goal, which I imagine he will be. They also got a boost to their team with their player Bedard coming back from injury recently. He was out in their last game due to illness, but was back at practice <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.

They’re going up against a Calgary team that is 1-5 in January and has a pretty atrocious road record. I normally don’t look into that too much, but 7-12-3 on the road compared to 12-7-2 is a pretty big difference. I’m assuming that Calgary will be starting Dustin Wolf who has given up 4 goals in 5 straight games.

This is not as much as a BTTS rather than it is a &quot;can Waalwijk be competitive&quot; bet. For those of you that don&#x27;t know, possession and pressure based football (*Totaalvoeetbal)* was created in the Netherlands in the 1970s, more specifically by Ajax in Amsterdam. Pretty much the tactic that revolutionized soccer forever, and leads us to just continue the nice tradition that Mr. Cruyff instructed in legendary teams like the early 90s Barcelona. Anyway, I&#x27;m drifting away from the point; I expect this to be a typical soccer game in the Netherlands; explosive attacks, high pressure; and punishing the opponents mistake.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Bologna to score + Under 9.5 corners (Como vs Milan) @1.86 (1u)

**Write-Up:**

Bologna have scored in their last 8 away league matches. The only two away games where they didn&#x27;t score were the first 2, against Roma and Milan, two of the strongest defenses in the league. Verona, meanwhile, have conceded in their last 8 home games, with the only cleansheet at home coming in their first home match. Bologna sit 9th, Verona 19th, making Bologna the clear attacking favorite.

Como&#x27;s home games consistently produce low corner counts, averaging 6.55 corners per game. Even against the strongest opponent they faced at home this season, Juventus, the game ended with just 5 total corners (4 for Como, 1 for Juventus). Last season&#x27;s H2H between Como and Milan also ended with 5-6 total corners in both games. Milan’s style relies on structured, central build-up rather than constant wing pressure, which means corner counts are often suppressed against disciplined, compact teams like Como.

Some caution points: although Como has a very low corner count at home, Milan averages 9.1 corners away this season. I’m counting on Como’s disciplined style to suppress their usual numbers, but if Milan generates pressure quickly or scores early, the corner count could rise.</td></tr>

🚨🚨🚨“UNDERDOG ALART”🚨🚨🚨 <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: John Higgins to WIN VS Zhao Xintong @ +146 on FD for 2.06u  win 3u

EARLY BIRDS START YOUR ENGINES! Now to me, this feels like a spot where John Higgins just has the edge in a first-to-6. He’s already shown this season that his game is in a really good place, especially at the Masters where he looked sharp, confident, and controlled from the first frame. The head-to-head also leans his way, and that matters in a short race like this. Higgins knows how to manage Zhao tactically, slow things down, and turn small mistakes into stolen frames. In best-of-11s, that experience and match awareness usually producing a win.

Now it’s obvious Zhao Xintong is dangerous and can outscore anyone when he gets rolling, but Higgins’ current form plus his history against Zhao make all the difference here. Higgins doesn’t need to dominate; he just needs to stay solid, win the safety exchanges, and capitalize when Zhao overreaches. Over six frames, that kind of pressure and consistency is often enough, which is why Higgin should take his game to the Semi finals. And at plus odds I felt like it’s worth sprinkling a few units. 

A part of me wanted to take the spread at +1.5 frames but I trust that if it’s gets to a decider, Higgins locks in and takes it. He either Wins by 2 or loses by 2+

**Event:** Copa del Rey, Racing Santander v FC Barcelona, 3:00 pm EST

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Racing Santander +1.5 Asian Handicap, +120, 3 units

**Write Up:** We saw another massive shock yesterday, as a struggling Albacete side that hangs just above the relegation zone in the second division knocked out Real Madrid in a pretty convincing fashion. This is a type of game the Spanish league cup can readily cook up and I truly believe we&#x27;re about to see more of that <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> as Racing Santander host Barcelona. Travelling from Saudi Arabia, where they&#x27;d just played an intense match against their bitter rivals, Real Madrid, a few days prior, and perhaps feeling **tired,** as well as **complacent, the Barcelona players are not going to be at 100%** for the clash with Santander. Moderate to heavy **rotation and minute management** of the star players are also expected, and that only nudges the odds further in our favor.

Racing Santander, unlike Albacete, aren&#x27;t struggling - quite the opposite, they in fact find themselves at the very top of the Segunda Division at the halfway point of the season, *though their recent form hasn&#x27;t been stellar.* Still, they certainly aren&#x27;t a pushover. They have some quality players, such as the talented **Asier Villalibre, who has already scored 10 goals and added an assist in 20 games this season** and will be looking to continue his fine run of form against a Barcelona team that isn&#x27;t defensively bulletproof. I&#x27;m feeling a shock <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, but even if Racing lose by a goal, the bet still comes through for us. So far, we&#x27;ve seen an uninspiring Atletico Madrid barely beat Deportivo 1-0, Athletic Bilbao needing extra time to dispatch Cultural Leonesa, and Real Madrid deservedly getting knocked out by one of the weakest sides in the Segunda Division in Albacete. What am I getting at? **All the big Spanish sides have struggled against second division teams so far,** and these teams are, on paper, much weaker than the one Barca are coming up against <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. A shock is certainly on the cards, and I&#x27;m sending it with 3 whole units. Covering three outcomes *(win, draw, narrow defeat)* at these odds is just a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> I can&#x27;t refuse.

Racing Santander vs Barcelona, over 4.5 goals @ 2.6

Racing Santander vs Barcelona is set up for goals, with over 4.5 goals looking very achievable. Barcelona’s attacking quality, squad depth, and aggressive approach should generate chances from the first minute. They rarely slow the pace and continue pushing forward even when ahead.

**NBL: Kings v Bullets - Alex Ducas 10+ points** **4U** $1.65 (Bet365) 9:30PM AEDT

   * Sydney play one of the fastest paces in the game scoring 95 PPG and are a transition team.
   * They may only allow 86 PPG but this is a different story with Delly and Bul Kuol out. Their starting 5 is all out attack.
   * Even when Delly and Kuol were in, they were letting in 31 3P attempts per game. Melbourne got up 36 shots against them last round in the game Delly went down. That&#x27;s a 20% increase over Melbourne&#x27;s season average 3PA.
   * Brisbane&#x27;s two primary attack weapons right now are Moldonado (legend) and Terry Taylor. Moldonado attacks the rim and Terry Taylor plays from the key and backs his way to the rim. If the focus is on these two guys, there will be plenty of kick-out options.
   * Ducas has attempted 140 3PA (5.6 per game) this season. That is more than **double** the 3PA of any other Brisbane Bullets player. Given the Kings tendency to give up the 3 ball, he will get plenty of looks tomorrow night.
   * But he&#x27;s not just a one trick pony. He&#x27;s young and athletic and has good handles to attack the rim. In a high pace game, I can&#x27;t see why he can&#x27;t get one or two rim attacks in transition or when they run him off the 3.
   * He might be averaging 9 points per game but with all the injuries and the 3 pt stats above, I think this line should be an easy clear for him.

These odds seems to be dropping quickly so please consider that when staking. At some point, his natural 11.5 point line @ $1.85 becomes the better bet. Your call but this is what I&#x27;ve locked in.

Hopefully <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> is the day we break the curse and start the win streak. 

Tosay we take a rare trip to Spain for an interesting cup match between Barcelona and 2nd division team Racing Santander. Racing is currently first place in the 2nd division of spanish football. What i like about this matchup is that Racing scores the most goals in the 2nd division and, outside of the bottom 2, concedes the most goals in the 2nd division. Their matches are the highest scoring in the league. 

Barcelona, as many may know, are currently the first place team in La Liga and also score the most goals on La Liga with an average of over 2.5 goals per match. While they tend to have a decent defensive record, they have been struggling on the road recently. Conceding 2 goals to Madrid in the Supercopa final, 3 goals to Real Betis a few weeks back, and 2 goals to Celta Viego before that. These sorts of inter division cup matches tend to be boom or bust with goals, usually hinging on how early the higher division team scores. The earlier they score, the more risks the lower division team takes, the more open the game is. I&#x27;m banking on an early Barca goal or two against the spotty Racing defense, which will hopefully lead to 5-6 total goals. 

To clarify, over 4 is a push if 4 goals are scored. We win with 5 or more. I&#x27;m predicting 4-5 Barca goals and 1-2 Racing goals to win this one, let&#x27;s say 5-2 Barca.

<tr><td class='post'>**Record 2-0**

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Orland Magic -4.5

Now the reason why this one sticks out to me is because the game is actually held in Berlin, which is where Franz and Mo Wagner are from. Franz is actually a very critical part of this team because of how BAD this teams three point shooting is, Desmond Bane and Banchero can not shoot the three ball. Making the spacing on the floor horrible and predictable, not only this but the injuries have deeply hurt this team. The bench depth is very skeletal as Anthony Black does best on the bench but currently he starts meaning the substitute players that come in don&#x27;t really bring in energy or that firing power. I expect Franz and Mo playing will be a good enough help, also considering that they are from Berlin will be extra motivation.

Memphis on the other hand I believe are at an all time low so this could be a good bounce back spot for them. However I can&#x27;t really see it. Ja Morant is arguing with team mates now and also commenting that he feels betrayed by team mates and Jaren Jackson also wants to be traded. Recent performance in last quarters has been horrid, they lost to a OKC team with no starters besides Jdub and nearly collapsed to a nets team without Michael Porter Jr.</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>**Record: 38-22 (+12.17U)**

**ROI: +16.34%**

Last POTD: NCAAMB: UVA +9.5 ALT Spread vs. Louisville + ALT Total Under 162.5 -127 (0.50U TO WIN 0.33U) ✅

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: NBA: Magic vs Grizzlies U230.5 -110 (0.50U TO WIN 0.40U)**

Write up: 0.50U on this play - We are 8-2 in the L10, riding a 6-bet win-streak - unfortunately a smaller slate <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, I hate betting on the NBA, college basketball is slim pickens, so rolling with another 0.50U bet here - Model has this as the highest confident Edge % and EV % for the day. Will add some personal information in this write-up as well.

• ⁠Model has Under 230.5 at 54%

• Model projects Magic covering -4.5 at 52% while it also projects the game&#x27;s total ending at 224

• EV better betting 100$ = 7-8$ for this play

• Rolling with 0.50U here because the NBA is just not fun to bet, always some stupid things happening, but there is not a lot on the board - As always, I try to get a play out for you all each day, whether there are a lot of games or barely anything - First thing that stands out here is that they are playing overseas, so fatigue should play a very small factor, different atmosphere, long flights/travel, and just a weird situation in general playing overseas - Second thing, injuries - Grizzlies are still without Morant and Edy - Magic are without Suggs, with Franz expected to make his return - Low scoring affair here, with the Grizzlies averaging just 114 PPG, which is not even top 20 in the NBA - the last 4 games for them have also gone under, which is something to note - Last time these two teams played, both teams healthy, the final score ended at 209 - The over has only hit 39% in all of the Grizzlies games this year, while the Magic&#x27;s overs have hit 51% of the season - some key injuries on both sides, recent games going under, and the game being across the pond, I like the under 230.5 here

It assigns ELO ratings to players and projects a win chance based on the combined ELO ratings of the players on each team. TeamReddit is projecting a 62% win chance here which creates value here on the ML.</td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>

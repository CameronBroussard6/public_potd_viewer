January Record 9-9 (-0.62u)

Wednesday’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> ✅ - Nuno Borges + Frances Tiafoe +104 (1u to win 1.04u)

Thursday’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> - Shapovalov -1.5 game spread -112

FYI, this match is Thursday in Australia, but it’s Wednesday night in the U.S., so you’ll have to get in quick.

We have a matchup of big hitters here. I’m going to lean on the side of Shapovalov. He plays his best tennis on the hard court slams. He has a very high ceiling and if he is playing well, he will be too much for Cilic. If he isn’t playing well, then Cilic can certainly win this. Shapo had a good first round showing and I expect that to continue into rd 2.

Cilic of course has had a great tennis career, winning a slam all the way back in 2014 and was a finalist here in 2018. However, it’s been a while since he’s been able to go deep in a major (he did make 4th round in Wimbledon last year). This is the first time he’s been past the first round in a hard court major since 2022. He had a ton of respect and experience and could certainly pull this off, but I think he’s getting a little too much from the books.

Good Luck!</td></tr>

Writeup:

**Casting U 3.5 Kills Map 1**

* This is definitely the &quot;safer&quot; of the two legs in my opinion but I love both a ton. To understand why I think their is so much value, we must look at the state of top lane as a role at the moment, top lane in league was already the lowest kill participation role, and often the lowest kills besides supports in the game. This has been exemplified by the recent meta changes of incentivizing split pushing, the summoner spell changes to teleport, and the heavy kill meta in the jungle especially early on in series. This has lowered top liners kills by a significant amount and brought it even lower. Looking at the major regions, in LPL, their is currently only 1/13 top liners averaging more then 3 kills per map, In the LCK their are only 2/10 top liners averaging more then 3 kills and one is mainly because Faker is a very low kill share mid lane.
* Casting has played 5 maps in the LCK so far, he has averaged 1.4 kills per map in the 5 games so far, he has a 0/5 hitrate on this line this split so far with his top kill game being 2 kills so far this split. He has the lowest KP% in the entire LCK at the moment as well
* BRO are massive underdogs in this series, HLE were considered a super team and they started 0-2 and are itching to make it right, this is likely to be a stomp and it is one of those games you kind of feel bad for BRO for being the unlucky ones that draw against HLE on the schedule.
* While 5 games this split isn&#x27;t a ton of data, we also have Kespa Cup and 2025 pro data we can utilize. In Casting&#x27;s LCK games so far, he has a 1/19 cover rate in map losses on O 3.5 kills which was a hook to the over. He has averaged 1.21 kills per map loss in the LCK so far. Even in his map wins, this isn&#x27;t a guaranteed cover as he has hit in 5/8 wins so far in LCK. As said HLE are -1000 favorites, Zeus is one of the best top laners in the world, nightmare matchup imo for BRO.

**Clear U 3.5 Kills Map 1**

* Everything written about the top meta and top lane also applies to Clear as he also is a top laner. He also enters this game with a nightmare matchup going up against GenG and Kiin, GenG have run LCK for 2+ years now, barely dropping series, they are 4-0 so far and despite FearX impressive start, GenG have dominated them only dropping 1 map to FearX in the last 2 years
* Clear and fear have performed much better with an 80% map win rate in 5 maps, but despite the wins, he is only averaging 1.8 kills per map, amongst the lowest in the league. He has a 1/4 over rate in map wins so far this split and a 4/5 under rate overall. Clear is slightly scarier in my opinion as he does have more pop off games, in his last 50 map losses in the LCK, he has a \~15% cover rate and also hits this line in a higher % of wins then Casting does
* However with that being said, the thing I am most focused on is the h2h matchup. A lot of Clear&#x27;s stats last split were inflated because of the LCK format, they only played bottom tier teams + Damwon, allowing them to pad stats and only play against weaker top laners making Clear look better.
* H2h against Kiin, this has been a nightmare matchup for Clear, Kiin is 15-1 lifetime against Clear in the head to head, Clear has gone U in 14/16 of those h2h matches. Lifetime Clear is averaging 1.56 kills when he faces against Kiin, the last time he covered the Over was February 4th 2024. In his last 13 map losses against Kiin, he has only totaled 12 kills overall meaning he has averaged 0.92 kills against GenG/Kiin in map losses. IF this isn&#x27;t enough, GenG are similarly -1250 favorites, both matches should be one sided blowouts, both guys easily clear their unders here in my opinion</td></tr>

**Details: Europa League - 12:45 PM EST**

**Not many lines im interested in tmr with the run of games so I apologize for lower odds here**

Vikrotia lie mid- Europa table with Porto in an edgy 8th spot that can be both a positive or a negative. Both sides will intend on stamping their tempo early on but expecting a clash that leads to end to end opportunities that print our corners. Expect one side to lead heavily on first half corners - play just doesn&#x27;t matter who (Similar to our Barca <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> but Slavia came through with 4 first half corners to Barca’s 2).

**---**

Playable up to 4 just weary of ending right on 4.

**Recap + overview(?):**

Another correct <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>. From 1-8 to 8-9 already. The units are in the positives, time for the record to follow.

1-1 after 10 minutes but it made me sweat a little bit to see the third goal go in only in the 78th minute. It ended 3-2 so the scoreline says no sweat but the doubts were close to hitting halfway through the second half.

Also I am working on a spreadsheet to easily check past and upcoming <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> bets for a quick overview and to be even more transparent.

**Write Up:**

A lot of matches <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> but I am sticking with what works. Both teams have something to play for.

Ferencvaros are 2-1-0 at home in the Europa League in which they scored 6 and conceded 3. 9 goals in 3 matches, a good sign.

In the Hungarian league they are sitting in second place but their home record is only 9th out of a 12 team league with a 3-2-4 record. Scoring 17 and conceding 12. Another good sign.

Panathinaikos are 2-0-1 away in the Europa League, scoring 6 and conceding 4. 10 goals in 3 matches. The signs keep on being positive for this play.

In the Greece league they have a 2-2-4 record with 10 goals scored and conceding 14. Combined with the Ferancvaros record I like this play.

Both teams will want to secure their positions in the table. Ferencvaros will have to face Nottingham Forest and Panathinaikos will face AS Roma in the last match of the group stage.

Getting a decent result <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> will be key for both teams.

POTD Record 5-2 (+3u)

Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> - ✅ Manchester City win and over 2.5 goals -155 (1.55u to win 1u)

Sunday’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> - Kirk Cousins longest completion u 31.5 yards -110 (1.1u to win 1u)

No Drake London in this game again means that I expect the Falcons to have a hard time on offense against a defense that doesn’t give up a lot of big plays. The Seahawks do give up some yards to the TE, so I could see a lot of plays to Pitts and not a lot to Mooney down the field. 

Kirk had a tough time with down the field throws in their last game, despite totaling 234 yards passing.

Seattle needs this game to keep pace in their division, so I think they will be ready and on top of their game on both sides of the ball. 

Good luck!</td></tr>

Teams/Time: FaZe vs. Passion UA | 11:30 AM EST.

**Writeup:**

* Jcobbb despite a ton of scrutiny since joining FaZe and having major struggles early on has been on absolute fire this tournament, he has the highest rating of any FaZe player in the last two stages of games played and has been looking increasingly good in his spots
* Despite this great form, Jcobbb is still averaging only a .63 KPR in the L3 months,
* Passion UA ban Ancient, FaZe ban Train, Passion UA <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> Overpass (chance of Inferno)
* Passion UA are 67% winrate on 6 maps of Overpass L3 months, FaZe are 33% winrate on 3 maps of Overpass in the L3 months with a 1-5 record in 2025
* Jcobbb has awful Overpass stats, even before he joined FaZe, this was his worst map as a tier two pro where he went from a .78 KPR&gt;a .54 KPR while playing on Betclic, since joining FaZe he is their worst rated Overpass player with a .45 KPR in the 3 maps he has played with the team so far, combined .49 KPR in 2025
* Jcobbb is averaging 9.75 kills per map on Overpass in 8 maps played, he has a 0/8 over hit rate on this line and the most kills he has ever gotten is 11
* Despite the advantage of starting CT side, Jcobb has the worst CT splits on the team on the map as well, averaging just a .47 KPR on CT side
* FaZe have just looked awful on this map, its a bit weird cuz they have karrigan, think under projects really well here, would likely need OT for jcobbb to hit this line outside of just farming eco&#x27;s, blowout potential due to the CT sided nature of the map, and think Passion UA have a solid shot of winning
* If for some reason map is Inferno, Jcobbb is averaging a .56 KPR L3 months with a .55 KPR since joining FaZe, this is his second worst map by far (its these two then big increase), even in the last month where the team has seen a big spike in Inferno success (4-0 record) his KPR has only gone up to a .66 in these 4 matches where most of his work was done on T side (eco kills) and I&#x27;m not expecting this map to appear either way, he has a 4/11 hitrate on the over at this line, but only 1/7 if you factor out overtime games</td></tr>

Writeup: okay okay, I know everyone’s wondering where I’ve been, because I’ve been asking the same question. No seriously I died and was reincarnated into a slightly better form of myself. Not really but it makes me feel better saying it….Sunday morning we have ourselves a heater of a snooker match, the UK Championship FINALS! Judd trump vs Mark Selby. Trump is coming in with a potential B2B championship win, Selby is coming in most recently the 2016 champion. They both have two UK Championships under their belt and I believe Trump has one more appearance. But those were different years. <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>/tomorrow we’re talking about 2025. Trump has reached 3 other finals in ranking matches in 2025 while Selby has reached 3 others as well and one two, NOTABLY the Champion of Champions final where he BEAT Trump 10-5… I know Trump is overdue for a Win but I just don’t believe it’s tomorrow. Selby is the KING of safeties and escaping them when it matters. Trump looked a little shaky vs Robertson <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> until he found his grove AFTER going down 3-2 <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, I dint see Selby giving up a lead as easy as Robertson did. This entire tournament Selby has been IN CHARGE, winning 6-2,6-2,6-2 an 6-3. Although Trump leads their overall head-to-head, Selby’s recent victories and experience in long, tactical matches give him an edge in a best-of-19 final where patience, safety play, and momentum matter as much as heavy scoring. MARK recently said, this season he’s “found something” and I think he’ll find his second silverware versus Trump and for PLUS money.

If you’re down for a good ole fashion 6hr snooker match tomorrow, hop on the train!

BOL AND ALWAYS OVER BET! Just remember Snooker is a silly sport, this shit could be a blood bath on either side, but as a wise man once said, “There will be BLOOD”

[Michigan State write up](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/s/NXcxEbXvao)

Event: Missouri @ Kansas (NCAAB) (12pm central)
(Bears @ Packers) (NFL) (3:25pm central)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Kansas ML/Packers ML (-105) (2U)

4-1 on 2 unit plays!

Write up:

Let’s start with Kansas. This team hasn’t lost two consecutive games at Allen fieldhouse since February of 2018. The tigers are coming off a hard fought loss at notre dame which was their first true  road test. Not to mention they have had the easiest cake walk of a schedule in all of college basketball. Three point shooting has been one of their main strengths yet Kansas comes into this matchup holding their opponents to the 5th best three point percentage in the nation. My power ratings make this Kansas -8 regardless. This is a win.

Packers: 
The bears might just be the luckiest team in the NFL. They have a bottom 5 SOS. They barely beat the 6-6 Steelers by 3 points, they barely beat a 4-8 Vikings team by 2 points last minute. The 2-11 giants by 4 points. And allowed 42 points to the bengals. Lost to the 6-6 ravens by 14. Beat the 3-9 commanders by 1 point on a Game winning field goal. The 2-10 raiders by 1 point. And allowed 52 points and got their ass handed to them by the 7-5 lions and lost week 1 to that same Vikings team. The packers are top 5 in total defense and top 10 in total offense and have revenge from last years loss at home to the bears. Public is also all over the bears and they do not even have Odunze. This is also a win.

Let’s get after it fellas. As always, cheers 🍻</td></tr>

**Game:** NFL - Colts @ Jaguars, 12pm CDT


**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:**  Travis Etienne o51.5 rushing yards (-110 on Bet365)


**Rationale:**


Going back to the well with this one. The weather is supposed to be atrocious tomorrow, with pouring rain throughout most of the game.

The Colts will be without DeForest Buckner as well, which hurts their rushing defense. The Jags have run well most of this year, despite last week&#x27;s odd result. The Jags had very few long drives, opting instead for chunk plays and short fields.

I think he easily hits this super low line, as he has most games this year with Brenton Strange on the field.</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>Apologies to those of you who have started following me over the last couple of weeks, it’s been really brutal. Gonna switch up my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> philosophy as my personal plays based on gut calls have been doing so so much better than these picks that I put way more research into. Pretty ironic, but it’s time to turn things around for the holiday season.

Last 10:✖️✖️💰✖️✖️💰💰✖️✖️✖️

Last POTD: 🏈 George Pickens longest reception over 25.5 yards ✖️

Writeup: Pickens reminded us why the Steelers let him walk. Lackadaisical, low effort, out of it. Dak threw a perfect 30+ yard pass right to Pickens at the end of the game and he put in zero effort to get it and let it drop right by his feet.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: 🏈 Commanders ML (-124).

Game starts at 1pm EST. Bet 3.25U

Writeup: Welcome to day 1 of my new <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> mentality. For this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, give me my Commanders winning straight up against the Vikings. 

Jayden Daniels had the greatest rookie QB season of all time last season, and finally has all of his wide receivers healthy for the first time this season. On the other side, J.J. McCarthy might be the worst starting QB in football. The Vikings have one of the best receiving cores in the league, but McCarthy has completely stifled any and all offensive momentum and playmaking for his players. 

On defense, the Commanders defense has not been good, at all. However, Dan Quinn took over the defensive play calling a few weeks ago, and they look like a completely different defense. Still not great, but they are playing with a completely different energy. The Vikings have a much better defense on paper, especially in the pass game. However, these stats are completely skewed thanks to them getting to go up against the Bengals when Jake Browning was the starting QB. Take this game out, and the Vikings are the 22nd best defense in football. 

So for arguments sake, we’ll call these 2 defenses pretty equal, and I’ll take this Jayden Daniels led defense over J.J. McCarthy any day of the week. Commanders win this one outright.

Remember to only bet what you can afford to lose, and BOL! </td></tr>

Event : Germany Bundesliga 🇩🇪

Borussia Dortmund vs Hoffenheim

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> : Dortmund to Win or Draw + BTTS @1.9 for 3u

Dortmund are clear favorites at home and the last four out of five meetings between these teams have had both teams scoring, showing this is a reliable pattern. Dortmund are third in the Bundesliga and are a strong attacking team at Signal Iduna Park, while Hoffenheim are fifth with 23 points and have had both teams score in five of their last seven games away from home, proving they will definitely have high chance of scoring. Dortmund have dominated this fixture historically, winning 8 of their last 10 meetings against Hoffenheim. Both teams are on unbeaten streaks in the league, with Dortmund unbeaten for almost two months and Hoffenheim unbeaten in six consecutive league matches, meaning both teams will attack and create chances instead of playing defensively. Hoffenheim are ranked second away from home in the entire Bundesliga and have scored 12 goals in their last five games, so they will come to Dortmund with confidence and attack-minded football, while Dortmund have scored 10 goals in their last five home games, meaning both teams have the quality to break through and score goals. The win or draw protection gives you safety in case Dortmund only draw, while the both teams to score requirement is almost guaranteed based on the last four to five meetings where both sides found the back of the net every single time.

**Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** NFL Bengals at Ravens 8pm EST Each team to score 1+ TD in each half (+100) 3 Units (L)

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** NFL Bengals vs Bills 1:00pm EST - **Chase Brown + James Cook Over 150 yards Rushing (-138)** 3U 

On first glance at this game you may think Burrow and Allen - O/U of 53 - its gonna be a shootout with tons of passing. While that may happen to some extent, a closer look at the data suggests a run-heavy script. 

Bengals D: Yes they give up a lot of yards through the air (265/game - 6th most) but they are even worse defending the run (RB&#x27;s rush for over 128/game against them- worst in the NFL).

Bills D: Is a funnel rush defense - giving up the third most rushing yards (113/game) while having the stingiest pass defense in the league (177/game - 1st) 

This matches up well with where both offenses have been recently. The Bills have a receiver problem. Kincaid went down, Coleman had been a healthy scratch for weeks before they couldnt find anyone else to catch the ball, Gabe Davis sucks, and Shakir - their only decent wideout - had 1 catch for 5 yards last week against Pittsburgh. In fact the Bills overall had 125 total pass yards against the Steelers D which was second worst in the league against the pass (263/game). That same game James Cook, on the other hand, rushed **34 times** for 144 yards.          

Meanwhile, Chase Brown has been on a roll. Over the past 6 weeks he has rushed for 108-73-37-99-77-108. Thats 2 - 100 games and only one game under 70. Over the same last 6 game span - James Cook has 4 games of over 100+ yards including one of 216. Asking these two to combine for 150 yards rushing against two of the worst run defenses in the league on a cold day in Buffalo doesnt seems like much.

This bet is under Rushing -&gt; Combined Rushing Yards -&gt; **Cook and Brown Over 150 (-138)** on Draftkings. If you dont have this bet - you can also find it under Head to Head Matchups - where their total over is at 155 (-114) BOL if Tailing!</td></tr>

Last Pick: Korpatsch vs Friedsam - Korpatsch ML @ 1.80 ✅️

Great performance by Korpatsch, a player who&#x27;s certainly been improving the level of play as the tournament goes on. Clean straight sets win.

**Tennis** | **Challenger Angers (Women)** | **9 AM (Eastern Time)**

**Plays will always be shared as 1 unit for fair record purposes**

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** **Korpatsch vs Rakhimova - Rakhimova ML @ 1.71**

Both players have been playing solid tennis. Korpatsch didn&#x27;t drop a set in this tournament but faced two weak opponents in the first two rounds, before beating Parks, who played at a terrible level, and then Friedsam, who I was expecting to get knocked out after a really intense battle in the previous round against Sonmez.

Rakhimova had a much more difficult path to the final, where she faced Klimocicova and Ruzic, players who can certainly be dangerous on a good day. All her opponents in this tournament were solid from the baseline, and she was able to get the best of them, playing at a high level even when she needed to win in 3 sets.

When it comes to playstyles, both players certainly play baseline tennis, but Korpatsch tends to be a lot more passive, and usually things don&#x27;t go right for her when she&#x27;s forced to be aggressive. Rakhimova, on the other hand, is much more efficient when turning defense into offense, and her backhand is certainly an advantage in this matchup.

I believe that Parks and Friedsam, players who tend to make a lot of unforced errors, were not a good test for Korpatsch, and she will find a lot of contest from the baseline in this final. With this, I&#x27;m expecting Rakhimova to win this match. Their H2H record is 1-0 in favor of Rakhimova, where she won last year in the hard courts of Ningbo by 6-0/6-3.

Good luck!</td></tr>

Hello everyone.  Long time tailer and first time picker with this one.

Event - NFL, Cardinals/Rams, 2:25 MST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> - Michael Wilson O5.5 Receptions -106(currently at -148 on FD) 2.5U

Going to keep my first <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> short and to the point.  The cardinals are having an abysmal season and are dealing with a ton of injuries.  Wilson averaged 12.5 receptions a game when MHJ missed 2 games earlier this season, and that was WITH Dorth and Dimercado playing(they are both injured and OUT for this game, Weaver is also questionable with a DNP yesterday, MHJ is OUT).  The card are playing one of the best offenses in the Rams, and i expect them to be playing from behind and throwing the ball a ton like they have all season against lesser offenses.  Someone has to catch the ball besides McBride!

I wish the Sunday picks were up earlier as there has been massive line movement.  I&#x27;m laddering this up to 10 receptions personally.  BOL!</td></tr>

__Event:__ NFL: Washington @ Minnesota 1pm EST

__POTD:__ Chris Rodriguez o41.5 rushing yards (-115), 3.5u to win 3.05u

__Write Up:__ Chris Rodriguez has now taken over the role a the lead RB in Washington, passing rookie Bill Croskey-Merritt. Rodriguez has had 90% of the 1st Quarter RB carries in Washington’s last 2 games. Rodriguez has now had 10+ carries in 3 of his last 4 games, going for 41 yards, 79 yards, &amp; 65 yards. His one miss was when he suffered a shoulder injury vs the Lions. Last week his 41 yard performance was against the Broncos who have a top 5 run defense, allowing just 93.1 rushing yards per game. Now he faces a Minnesota defense that ranks 23rd in rushing yards allowed per game (128.4) &amp; ranks just 20th in EPA run defense. In their past 6 games they’ve allowed:

Walker 13/56, Charbs 14/52

Jacob’s 28/107

Swift 21/90

Henry 20/75

Monty 11/40

Vidal 23/117

Now they face Washington who has turned to a run first approach offense in the past month. In the first 8 weeks of the season, the Washington’s RB’s averaged 17.4 runs per game. In their past 4 games that number has shot up to 24. This week Washington gets star QB Jayden Daniels back at QB from a dislocated elbow &amp; their offense should be firing on full cylinders. The Commanders enter the game as favorites, vs a struggling Vikings offense that ranks LAST in points per game over their last 3 games averaging just 7.7 points per game. 	Minnesota has the league&#x27;s worst turnover differential (-15) &amp; ranks LAST in the NFL in EPA pass offense over the last 8 weeks (-67.0). Minnesota does have a great pass defense. Over the last 5 weeks, Minnesota has allowed a 59.6% completion rate (7th), 6.3 yards per pass attempt (9th), &amp; a 2.1% TD rate (3rd). Minnesota leads the NFL in 2 high safety rate (64%), which helps them limit deep passing, allowing just the 4th fewest deep yards per game (21.3) over the past 6 weeks. Their 2 high approach also allows them to limit the sidelines &amp; specifically deeper downfield passes (2nd fewest years per game allowed to 15+ yard targets on sidelines). 

With Daniels coming back from injury, the run game heating up, &amp; Minnesota sucking on offense, Rodriguez is in line for his busiest game of the season &amp; Vegas has not awfully adjusted his rushing props.

Hertha are on a **7-game winning streak**, with **6 clean sheets**. Their clean-sheet streak was broken last match by a somewhat lucky long-range shot from Kaiserslautern.

Hertha now face Magdeburg, who sit dead last and are playing terribly. Hertha should win this comfortably. The only thing worth noting is that Hertha sometimes tend to play down to weaker opponents, but even with that in mind, I’m very confident. They have the best squad in the league, which is why I’m putting 3 units on this.

As always, everyone should do their own research and bet according to their own risk tolerance.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Brighton &amp; Hove Albion Over 4.5 Shots on target @ 1.61**

**Brighton VS West Ham**

**--**

Keeping things in similar matchups <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> and we&#x27;re backing Brighton to get over 4.5 shots on target <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> at home. Brighton put on a spectacle against Villa last weekend, losing 3-4, with them getting a total of 7 shots on target. That same Villa just beat Arsenal and I see Brighton realizing the importance of 3 points here <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.

**Brighton Last 8 games - Shots on Target: 7, 6, 5, 3, 7, 6, 5, 5**

**--**

**Brighton have hit over 4.5 shots on target in 7/8 of those games (87.5%)**

**Within that run, they averaged 5.5 shots on target per game.**

**Brighton is currently on a 3-game streak of hitting over 4.5 shots on target.**

**--**

**In Brighton&#x27;s last 6 home games, they&#x27;ve covered this line in 5/6 of those games with the miss coming against Tottenham where they had exactly 4.**

**Against a struggling West Ham side, I see them clearing this line well again.**

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Hunter Henry OVER 3.5 Receptions -138 (FanDuel), 1u

The strength of the Seattle defense comes from their interior pass rush and their secondary. Drake Maye is likely going to be a working from a collapsing pocket, searching for his check downs.

Henry has a good matchup against the Seattle linebackers who aren’t great in coverage while Henry should be able to find some open zones. Maye will likely have to pass a lot in this game so look for Henry to be that security blanket</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: (NBA) Miami Heat vs Washington Wizards over 231.5 points (-192) (2:10 PM EST)**

Reasoning: Miami average 119 points per game, Washington gives up 122 points per game. Washington averages 112 points per game, Miami gives up 117. Those averages alone favor the over. Miami like to play extremely fast, 1st in the league in pace while Washington like to play fast as well, ranking 9th in pace. Expect both these teams to run up the points <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Line movement has moved in favor of the over. Game starts in 1 hour.

<tr><td class='post'>Previous Play Recap:

Houston -1 (-110) ✅

Houston wins 77–66 and controlled the game statistically — holding BYU (an 86+ PPG offense) to just 66 points, 39.6% shooting, and a season-low scoring output. Houston also shot 47.5%, won the glass 40–36, and had a 30–24 edge in paint points. Defense and rebounding dictated the game exactly as projected.

Record: 1–2

Net Units: -1.36u

ROI: -30%

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>**: Rashid Shaheed OVER 30.5 Rushing + Receiving Yards (+100)

Units: 1.25u

Write-Up:

This number is still light for Shaheed’s usage profile. Since being added, Seattle has manufactured touches for him whether it be pre snap motion, screens, and vertical shots designed to create space. He doesn’t need volume; he needs one or two efficient touches.

From a matchup standpoint, New England has shown vulnerability to secondary and slot-type receivers. They’ve allowed explosive games to complementary pass catchers and gadget usage out of motion.

Patriots sit middle-to-lower tier vs slot/secondary receiver production overall, allowing consistent yardage to wideouts outside true WR1 matchups.

30.5 yards is essentially one designed touch + one reception, or a single explosive play — both realistic given role and matchup. At plus money, this is a numbers play.</td></tr>

**Odds // Units:** FanDuel (-130) 2u

**Write-up:** Clippers are struggling to get boards without Zubac. Brook Lopez and John Collins are not nearly as good as Gobert in terms of rebounding. The Clippers are giving up a lot of offensive rebounds, an area where Gobert thrives. He ranks top 10 all season in offensive rebounds, averaging around 4. Cardwell from the Kings just got 14 boards, and Jarrett Allen got 11. The Clippers are ranking bottom 10 in the league in rebounds allowed to Centers aswell. This looks like another Donovan Clingan situation, where he grabbed 17 &amp; 19 boards against the Grizzlies, who didn&#x27;t have a center and were gifted a low line.</td></tr>

Last Pick: Chelsea ML

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s Pick</mark>: Man City Over 4.5 SOT

Competition: PL 

Sport: Football

Odds: 23/20

Reasoning: Lots of decent value out there <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> but I think this one tops it. Manchester City over 4.5 shots on target is priced below their season-long average of around 5 SOT per game, so the line is structurally low. With Arsenal leading the title race and a late slip at Spurs last week, City have to push for control rather than manage the game. The lineup confirms attacking intent with Omar Marmoush starting (big plus sign imo), plus Phil Foden and an in-form Antoine Semenyo driving shot volume with of course the seasons top goal scorer Haaland. Crucially, this bet is not result- or goal-dependent; it’s purely about sustained shooting pressure.

**Analysis:**

Guardiola&#x27;s struggles at Anfield are well documented and discussed many times over. For this reason and also the fact that Arne Slot is potentially playing for his coaching position <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> - Liverpool is essentially in the hunt for the Champions League places - I&#x27;m not more bullish on this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> and going &quot;only&quot; with 1 units stake.

But hear me out - are you sold on this Liverpool&#x27;s &quot;resurgence&quot; after Salah&#x27;s return from AFCON ?  
Nothing for me suggests that Liverpool should be the favourite <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Past encounters at Anfield don&#x27;t matter - it is completely new teams in front of us. Liverpool does not resemble their last season&#x27;s title winning squad at all, and arguably Manchester City is even more different with 10+ new names and another 500 millions spent.

Liverpool won 4:1 against Newcastle in the previous round but guess what - City steamed Newcastle 2 times inside couple of weeks in probably the only chance for the Newcastle to win the trophy this season (Carabao Cup).

Manchester City are still in the EPL title hunt, Arsenal is only 2 games away. (if City wins <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>)  
Guardiola will be tremendously motivated for this match at Anfield to improve on his stats at this historic ground. Haaland is dry for ages now and you can count on him to perform <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.

Regarding form, aside from aforementioned results against Newcastle, City was in its way to win comfortably away at Tottenham and then a combination of very poor officiating and inexplicable circumstances resulted in a draw.

I&#x27;m taking Manchester City to not lose <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, 2X @ 1.729 odds is great opportunity.</td></tr>

Reasoning: I usually like to take Mbappe every game no matter what, but considering he’s scored in his past 5 games and is 8/10 I like this spot even more.

The Italians focused on their 4-person teams this season and the lack of reps together has really shown. Coming into this event, Czechia were 3-2 against intermediate level teams like Italy, they are a better team than their place in the standings would indicate and this line is also partially an overreaction to that. Czechia covered +4.5 in the only previous meeting between these two teams, a 7-4 win for Italy.</td></tr>

Last pick: American @ Navy Under 134.5

Result: LOSS ❌(155 points)

This was a rough loss. It missed for a clean (and instructive) reason — not pace, but efficiency. 

Navy shot lights-out (56% overall, 46% from three) and lived at the free-throw line, adding 29 attempts without needing extra possessions. 

American also contributed enough offensively to keep the total afloat instead of collapsing. The game felt slow throughout, but when hot shooting and foul points show up together, an under can lose without anything “breaking.” This was a classic right-tail efficiency spike.

College Basketball | NCAA Men’s
UNC Greensboro @ Furman
Saturday | 1:00 PM

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Furman -12.5

Odds: -115 (DraftKings)

Write-Up:

This is a spot where the spread tells a story, and it’s not as aggressive as the matchup might suggest at first glance. Furman already went on the road and won this matchup by 23, yet the number is sitting at -12.5 at home. 

That usually signals that the book expects a calmer, more controlled game flow rather than a repeat blowout — slower tempo, fewer possessions, and less urgency from the underdog. When totals are lower and pace is suppressed, spreads naturally compress, even when one team is clearly better.

That said, Furman is the kind of favorite that can still cover in that environment. They don’t rely on transition runs or shooting flurries to separate. Their edge shows up possession by possession — cleaner execution, fewer empty trips, and the ability to keep scoring even when the game slows. UNCG doesn’t have the offensive profile to flip tempo or force Furman into uncomfortable shots, which makes it hard for them to hang around for 40 minutes.

The risk, as always with double-digit spreads, is game state. If Furman builds a lead and the game turns into a long, uneventful second half, you’re vulnerable to late stagnation. But unlike some favorites, Furman tends to keep playing through their offense rather than bleeding the clock excessively. If this game follows its most common path — controlled pace, steady execution, no chaos — Furman covering -12.5 is very much in play.

Best of luck!

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Superbowl LX Seahawks v Patriots 1st half UNDER 23.5 total points @ 1.68


Write up: longtime reader, first time poster. Greater place to start, THE SUPERBOWL. While dumb money will be backing crazy prop multis, the length of the anthem and the colour of the Gatorade you intelligent bettor can do better. For me the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> is 1st half UNDER. This was my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> two weeks ago and it hasn&#x27;t changed. Both teams are defence minded especially in post season. We saw the high calibre defence Seahawks go first half under against the league highest scoring la rams. Neither team will want to make early mistakes or concessions. Not that it matters but I expect more points second half and I know some books have that market.


If you can get 1.90 for 22.5 or key number 21.5 - I&#x27;d take it but no lower than 21.5 first half under. But for official play it&#x27;s the line the books set, 1st half under 23.5</td></tr>

Form: WLWWLW

Match: AZ Alkmaar v Ajax &amp; Bayern Munich v Hoffenheim

Time: 14:30 &amp; 17:30 CET

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: BTTS + Bayern to Win (2.02)

Reasoning: 

Ajax BTTS is backed by both form and matchup dynamics. Ajax are one of the most attack-minded teams in the Eredivisie, averaging close to 2 goals scored per game, but defensively they’ve been far from reliable, conceding in the majority of their league matches this season. BTTS has landed in around 65–70% of Ajax games, especially against top-half opposition. AZ Alkmaar are strong offensively themselves, scoring in over 80% of their league matches, and rarely sit deep against Ajax, which usually creates an open, end-to-end game. With both sides preferring proactive football, goals at both ends look very likely.

Bayern Munich to Win vs Hoffenheim
Bayern to win is supported by clear quality and consistency edges. Bayern sit at or near the top of the Bundesliga, averaging 2.7+ goals per match, and have one of the strongest home records in Germany, winning the vast majority of league games at the Allianz Arena. Hoffenheim tend to struggle against elite sides, especially away, and have conceded 1.5+ goals per game this season. Bayern dropped points in the last two matches in the league so I don’t see any other result happening here <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.

<tr><td class='post'>1) Benfica - Alverca, 1/1 at Half-Time/Full-time @ 1.61

Jose Mourinho and his team are determined to fight for the 2nd place in Liga Portugal. The team will do their best after the unexpected qualification to the knock-out stage of Champions League. Alverca is stuck in the middle of the league-table, they are stable hosts but poor as guests.

2) Besiktas - Alanyaspor, Besiktas -0.75 AH @ 1.60

Besiktas is demonstrating a decent home form. Considering the width and the potential of the squad, I expect an easy win against Alanyaspor. Besiktas will be vehemently supported by their fanatic fans.

3) Konyaspor - Goztepe, X2 + Under 3.5 Goals Combo Bet @ 1.75

The team of Goztepe is doing miracles this season in Turkish Lig 1. The coach of the team Stanimir Stoilov managed to won promotion in Lig 1 for season 2004/25 and finished above the middle of the league-table. This season the team is showing higher ambitions for European football. On the other side, Konyaspor will try to keep their place in Lig 1 and will be more cautious not to lose this game. The Combo Bet I have prepared is safe nad includes all possible outcomes. I epxect a game with a few goals and a draw or a win for Goztepe.

**Write Up**: Yeah, we&#x27;re going Atletico to win. They just played Real Betis in the cup and they honestly looked incredible. Every time they went forward they looked like they could score. Betis had absolutely nothing for them and this is with both teams playing strong XIs AND Betis being at home. It ended 5-0 for those not in the know. This is the second time Atletico have beaten them this season away from home. Atletico have the most points from home this season with 31 points out of a possible 33. Betis have a mixed away record being hard to actually beat recording 7 draws from 11 and 2 of each other result. Atletico reinforced over January with Ademola Lookman and he was the best player on the pitch.

Atletico have scored twice at home in 11/15 games this season, winning 13/15 of them. Betis have conceded in 14/18 games away from home. They concede an average of 1.54 xG away while Atletico generate 1.95 xG at home.

This bet would hit in 11/15 games this season for Atletico, 73% percent of the time, and would hit 4/5 of the last games versus Betis.

**Bet:** [Kotov P.](https://www.flashscore.dk/spiller/kotov-pavel/809HrNqi/) to win 2-0 at odds 2

**Units:** 3 Units

**Explanation:**

We are going with a 2-0 win for Kotov again at odds 2. As described earlier Kotov is a top player who have been out with an injury and is now fighting to get back in top 100. Kotov has won all his matches in this tournament 2-0 and quite solid sets with no sets going above 10,5 games.

Tom has played 2 matches with 3 sets and also played a close match yesterday with 2 tiebreaks. I dont believe he has the necessary energy to win this match and Kotov should be much more recharged (because of his fast matches) going into this match.

I see VERY solid value hence we are playing 3 units.

Good luck!

Last pick: Austin Reaves (LAL) OVER 23.5 Points❌❌🤮❌ Scenario E (Cold Night)

Lesson here :  Point props always sucks because of many situations

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: : Jaylen Brown (BOS) OVER 6.5 Rebounds

Reasoning: 🕵️ Detective clues:

Evidence 1: The Vacuum Trend: Since Jan 1st, Jaylen has cleared 6.5 rebounds in 15 of his last 17 games (88% hit rate). He’s currently on a tear, averaging 8.0 RPG over his last 10.

Evidence 2: The Injury Glitch: Jayson Tatum is OUT (Achilles). Without Tatum, Jaylen’s rebounding volume increases to fill the wing void. More importantly, the Knicks&#x27; Karl-Anthony Towns and Josh Hart are Questionable—if they sit or are limited, the Knicks lose their top two glass-cleaners (Towns leads the NBA in RPG).

Evidence 3: Jaylen is a home-court hunter. He’s averaging 8.5 rebounds at the TD Garden over the last two months.

Scenario Playbook

Scenario A (The Ideal): Knicks struggle with shooting efficiency due to a lack of KAT’s spacing. Long misses fly toward the wings where Jaylen tracks them down. He hits 7 boards by the 3rd quarter.

Scenario B (The Grind): Physical Atlantic Division battle. Lots of interior clanking. Jaylen out-muscles the smaller Knicks wings to secure high-traffic boards.

Scenario C (The Outside Influences): Knicks play &quot;small-ball&quot; to keep up with Boston&#x27;s pace. Jaylen becomes the biggest athlete on the floor, feasting on the defensive glass.

Scenario D (The White Flag 🏳️) Boston blows them out early. Jaylen grabs 7 rebounds in 25 minutes of work before hitting the bench to rest for the Super Bowl.

Scenario E (Cold Night): Jaylen gets in early foul trouble or the ball simply bounces to the other side of the rim 10 times in a row.

Scenario Proof: Brown has recorded at least 7 rebounds in 14 consecutive games where he played at least 30 minutes. Even with minor hamstring/knee soreness, his &quot;floor&quot; has consistently stayed above this 6.5 line.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>⭐️:🏈Seahawks -3 (-155) \[Fanatics\]

Start Time &amp; TV 6:30pm EST (NBC)

Units: 4 Units

Reasoning: For our Super Bowl <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick of the day</mark> well be going with the Seattle Seahawks -3 over the New England Patriots. I think the Seahawks have big edge in offensive production in this one as Sam Darnold has turned off the turnover problem he had in the regular season and he has been extremely efficient in the playoffs throwing for 350 yards, 3 touchdowns and no turnovers in his last game against the Rams. Kenneth Walker has been having an amazing postseason as well, in his two games he has tallied 4 rushing touchdowns and he has been effective catching ball as he is averaging 11 and a half yards per reception in the playoffs. And then you have JSN, this dude is gonna be a huge problem for the Patriots. 153 receiving yards and a touchdown in his last game against the Rams and the leagues offensive player of the year has been a headache to defenses all year long and I think he has another amazing game in this one. These Seahawks are also paired with an amazing defense as they finished the regular season with the number one scoring defense in the league allowing only 17 points per game and their rush defense finished 3rd in yards allowed per game so I think they will do a good job slowing down TreVeyon Henderson and Rhamondre Stevenson and forcing the Patriots into predictable passing situations. Lastly, the Seahawks have an edge in special teams as Myers is a more accurate kicker and Rasheed Shaheed is one of the most dynamic punt and kick returners in the league. With all of this in mind I dont see the Seahawks winning this game by less than a field goal.

Prediction: 27-20 Seahawks

**Reasoning:** The tanking extent of the Wizards is downright embarrassing. They&#x27;re expected to rest the majority of their &quot;starters&quot; again, which means more third string starting minutes if you consider Trae and AD as the real &quot;starters&quot;. Washington has no interest at all in winning. Their loss to the Nets was the most dominant 14 point win I&#x27;ve ever seen, and really should have been 25+. The Heat are coming off of a blow game against the Celtics, but are also 13-6 coming off of losses this year. I believe this line is somewhat competitive due to Miami&#x27;s middling nature and Washington&#x27;s homecourt. However, Miami is 4-2 ATS as road favourites, as their fast paced offence exposes weak defences, a trend I expect to see continue as the Wizards play the back half of a back to back.</td></tr>

Write Up:  
I know it&#x27;s only been one game, but Vucevic looked too good in his Celtics debut to pass on this. First, he fills exactly what the Celtics needed: a big body big. And he showed that in his debut grabbing 12 rebounds and (in combination with the other Celtics bigs) held the Heat to just 50% in the paint.  
Vucevic brings a lot more than that though. His passing works perfectly with the Celtics&#x27; offense and adds a new layer to it. He is also a great scorer. In the game against the Heat, he wasn&#x27;t forcing anything at all in terms of scoring. He had 8 FGAs with 4 makes; 2 of the misses were tip-putbacks (don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s the actual word). The thing is, there really isn&#x27;t a need for him to hunt for shots. The Celtics offense was already second in offensive rating.  
At the time of this write-up, the Knicks have listed Miles McBride out and Anunoby, Hart, and Towns as questionable. Miles McBride is a pretty big piece of the team, so I think this is worth noting. The other three Knicks will probably play if I had to guess. Anunoby has a sore toe; Hart has a sore ankle; and Towns got that cut above his eye from the game against the Nuggets. Towns came back to finish the game and shot 0/3 from three after starting the game hot. This same injury made him miss a game against the Pistons which I feel like should be a must play game if a player is able. My guess would be that his eye is still be bothering him.  
A 3.5 spread just doesn&#x27;t feel right to me. If the Knicks were completely healthy, sure. But they aren&#x27;t, and the Celtics just got a huge upgrade.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>TODAY</mark>&#x27;S <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> - 630PM (NFL SUPER BOWL) - SEA vs N.E. - G. Holani o1.5 rec eptions (-140, Hard Rock Bet) RISK/WAGER AMOUNT: 5u

REASONING/PROJ. ANALYSIS:

As I writie this up, I can already hear some of y&#x27;all saying &quot;WHO&quot;, some more of y&#x27;all saying &quot;WHAT&quot; &amp; the remainder of y&#x27;all saying something far less &quot;PG-Rated&quot;, but HEAR ME OUT as I truly believe it is one of the picks surest to cash out &amp; likely even be doubled by the end of the game. So, let&#x27;s get into why this is my favorite <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> on the board. While Kenneth Walker III is Seattle&#x27;s primary rushing back &amp; a threat which N.E. has already admitted to primarily be targeting to stop, it was Zack Charbonnet who was the back that handled the majority of the check down, dump offs &amp; designed screen passes throughout the season until his injury a few weeks back sidelined him for the rest of this year. The next man up was 3rd string running (and primarily a blocking) back George Holani. In Charbonnet&#x27;s absence, Holani ( in his first real action) saw four targets last week &amp; reeled in three of those for receptions totalling 27 yards. Now, Holani has had two additional weeks to practice &amp; gel with the 1st team for the 1st time this year, and I can only imagine that this usage will continue if not increase, as it was not only quite the successful undertaking (vs the Rams), but it&#x27;s also a scheme (&amp; one which is using a player) which New England will find minimal footage on as their coaching staff studies every play Seattle has done throughout this year in preparation for the big game. Additionally, all of the extraneous factors work in favor of this being the case. For example, Holani that&#x27;s primarily enter the game just to be an additional blocker for D&#x27;Arnold, and with N.E&#x27;s blitz heavy defensive packages, Seattle should find ample opportunities for short passes to Holani after he breaks off his block of the extra New England defender &amp; heads off toward the sideline totally uncovered. Furthermore, with D&#x27;Arnold having the arguably better team, on both offense and defense, it will be most critical not for him to necessarily win the game, but rather just to limit or abstain from making any of his mistakes such as turning the ball over by being intercepted or fumbling the ball just as he has done for the past three weeks, and it&#x27;s now Holani, in for Charbonnet (&amp; on at least 80% of the passing downs) who will now become the one who offers D&#x27;Arnold BOTH the surest hands &amp; the safest short play option &amp; by taking the reception tally  instead of the total receiving yards, we don&#x27;t even have to worry about whether he makes any moves after the catch, but rather we can be near certain that there will be, at very least, three to six planned &amp;/o runplanned  passes headed his way tomorrow, &amp; with a 75% reception rate in his first ever real action as part of Seattle&#x27;s offensive scheme, I would imagine the Seahawks &amp; D&#x27;Arnold have plenty of confidence in Holani being able to fulfill that prophecy!!!!

NOW LET&#x27;S GO CASH THIS SHYTE OUT!!!

Last time it was Zack Allen at +165 who got him 20 minutes into the game. This time, I take two; the hard charging  long-arned veteran Lawrence &amp; the DT facing N.E.&#x27;s weakest link in their offensive line rookie back-uo Jared Wilson who is not only covering  Drake Mayes blind side, but well there&#x27;s also let somebody through week after week).

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Boston Celtics ML v NY Knicks

I’m a huge fan of playing the Celtics when they’re at home, especially against contenders. I feel like they’re invincible just like the Knicks in MSG. 

The spread is kinda too much for my liking so i’m gonna go for the Money Line at 1.65 just to play it safe.

I know the Celtics handed us our first loss, but watching that game, especially with them having that worst shooting slump in the first half, down by 20 coming into the second half, and eventually winning, showed me they have what it takes to beat any team in the East.

For our reliable statistics on Net Adjusted Efficiency;

On the last 5 games, the Celtics are 2nd vs Knicks’s 8th spot.

On the road, the Knicks are ranked 11th, while Boston are ranked 2nd at home.

All signs align for us to get the win here.

Best of luck and hope we can get the streak to 2!

Groningen vs PSV Eindhoven, over 3.5 goals, @ 2.27

Groningen vs PSV offers strong value for **over 3.5 goals**. PSV’s attacking depth and relentless tempo often overwhelm weaker defenses, and they are capable of scoring three or more goals alone. Groningen tends to struggle when pressed high and usually concedes chances against top teams. If PSV scores early, the game can open quickly, increasing the likelihood of a high-scoring, one-sided match.

The most dominant team in the league in the past few years and atop the table playing against a Rizespor in pretty bad recent form sitting at 12th place.

They are also the one team in the league that gets special treatment by the refs on the regular; this is a hot and controversial topic yet being a regular watcher of the league I personally can attest to there being truth to it. While they may have some rotation in their starting eleven due to the fixture (they just played a cup game 3 days ago), this is a team they should easily beat regardless.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>: Europe | LEC | 1045am | Vitality vs Los Ratones | Los Ratones ML 2U @ +110

Los Ratones come into this matchup playing with way more cohesion and confidence than Vitality. They’ve looked like a team that knows exactly how they want to play the game. Strong early setups, clear mid-game plans, and decisive calls once they get a lead. Even when games get messy, they don’t panic, which is huge in a best-of setting.

Vitality, on the other hand, have struggled with consistency. They tend to give away too much early pressure and often rely on opponents making mistakes rather than forcing plays themselves. Against a team like Los Ratones, that’s a problem. Ratones are comfortable punishing overextensions and snowballing small advantages into wins.

Another key factor is drafting and game identity. Los Ratones usually draft comps that are straightforward to execute and fit their players well, while Vitality have shown some questionable drafts that leave them scaling without control. If Los Ratones get even a slight draft edge, they’re very good at converting that into tempo and objective control.

Overall, this matchup favors the cleaner, more disciplined team and right now, that’s Los Ratones. If they play their standard game and don’t overcomplicate things, they should be in control for most of the series.</td></tr>

Games start at 6:30pm EST. Bet 2.5u

Writeup: Here’s the way I look at it. Either Sam Darnold plays the way he’s been playing, in which he’ll absolutely deserve the MVP, or he’ll start seeing ghosts again, in which case the Seahawks won’t even win the game. The only way I see JSN winning MVP is if Darnold turns the ball over more than once and JSN accounts for a huge percentage of the receiving yards and touchdowns, but again, if that’s the case, I don’t see Seattle winning. Given Darnold just had his best game of his career on the biggest stage last game, I like the former.

Now that we’ve established this, our bet essentially becomes Seahawks ML with better odds. I like for this to be a defensive battle, and given that the Patriots OLine has been shaky and Drake Maye quietly has not been good this postseason, Seahawks should come out on top. Even with a defensive battle, Darnold has too many weapons at his disposable and has been playing too well to lose, or win and not earn MVP.

While backing a player who had a decently long week in Dubai is risky, i think Sangakew simply doesn&#x27;t have the weapons to punish any potential fatigue. Just hoping she doesnt withdraw.

Leg 2 - Nothing much to say here. Just supporting my favorite team in Japan.

We made it to the big game and we have two teams that I don’t suspect many teams anticipated being here. I’m on the Seahawks side here and could see them winning the 7+. Even though they’ve obviously made the SB, I haven’t been very impressed in their wins in the playoffs. This Seahawks team is different than the beat up o-line of the chargers and the inept offenses of the Texans and Broncos.

Rhamondre has been above this line in all 3 of their playoffs games this year, but it’s going to be tough to get there on Sunday. He got 25 carries in the AFC Championship game due a lot to the weather. His rush attempts line is around 15 and he will be going against the number 1 defense in the league in yard per carry to the RB position

**Game/League/Time:** League of Legends (LOL) | LEC 2026 Versus Season | 10:45 AM EST./12:15 AM EST.

* If anyone needs help finding the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> or a place to bet esports can always reach out!
* These two lines both seem too high given the circumstances/the matchups they are in. League model putting this at 76% chance of hitting at +140 money, meaning it is incredible value/ROI play

***Baus U 2.5 Kills Map 1 (-182)*** (Teams: Vitality vs. Los Ratones)

* Baus is averaging 1.1 kills per map as top laner despite having a 50% winrate, 10th/10 top laners in the league. Baus is averaging a horrendous, -1037 XP at 15 min, and a -933 gold differential at 15 min, by far the worst metrics in the league, on top of this, teams will ban his sion every game, so he is left picking stuff he isn&#x27;t nearly as comfortable on. So far this split he has a 1/10 hitrate in maps, with a 0/5 hitrate in losses averaging 0.8 kills per map loss. Vitality are -154 favorites and I think this is a bad matchup for the rats as much as I am rooting for them. I think this line is a near guarantee in map losses, and a &lt;75% chance in map wins. Baus actually played a great lane <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, got his gragas, arguably his second best champ outside of sion which he will never get,
* For my money, **Naak Nako (Vitality top) has been the best top laner of the tournament** so far to my eye test. Naak Nako is averaging **the best GD/15, XP/15 and 3rd best CSD/15, all categories Baus is last it.** Also they should ban Sion + Gragas as Baus has looked significantly worse off of these two and has had two very strong gragas games and force him back on the things he struggles on. Naak Nako leads the LEC for top laners in solo kills with 6, this is a disaster matchup can&#x27;t stress it enough
* Lifetime Baus has a 1/27 hitrate in map losses, this is gonna be his hardest lane yet imo, I think <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> SK showed what NOT to do against Ratones, by picking a tank top laner and not punsihing Baus, expecting this to change tomorrow and Naak Nako and Vitality to play heavily thru top, if Ratones will win, it will be because of Nemesis/Crownie as most of their wins have been, think Vitality will stomp Ratones

***Wunder U 4.5 Kills Map 1 (-182)*** (Teams: SK Gaming vs. Shifters)

* The model didn&#x27;t see the vision on this line at first until I fed it more data, this is why stats without context arent&#x27; always good. Wunder is leading all top laners in kills at 3.5 kills per map, and has had the second best laning stats in the LEC, despite this, a 4.5 kill line for any top laner is absolute insanity which I will break down a bit more below. As for Wunder though, his kill average is driven way up by two double digit kill games, with 10 kills on Kennen and 11 kills on Rumble. Despite this inflated line, Wunder is averaging just 3.5 kills per map this split, this is the highest, with only 3/12 top laners in the LEC averaging &lt; 3 kills per map
* Wunder took 2025 off, but for extra data, can go back to 2024, Wunder averaged 1.9 kills in 45 maps played, with a 40% winrate overall. During this time, Wunder had a 0/27 hitrate in map losses, and a 1/18 hitrate in map wins. Giving him a combined 1/45 hitrate in 2024, and a 0/7 hitrate in map losses this split and 2/3 hitrate in wins. Combined 3/55 hitrate last 2 years, and 0/34 in map losses
* For top lane kill averages, in the 4 major regions for league, there are 44 top laners, only 1/44 top laners is averaging 4.5 kills (Kiin, with a 100% winrate), only 1 other is averaging 4 kills, 42/44 top laners are averaging &lt;4 kills, 34/44 top laners are averaging kills, on top of this, a portion of top lane meta right now is tanks, if any tank is locked in, this line is a near guaranteed under off the bat, no matter win or loss. Ksante is a tank with a bit more kill threat, rumble is a kill threat, then Sion is third who is another tank meaning 2/3 of the most played top laners are tanks, in total so far in LEC, tanks have made up \~42% of top laners picked this split so far
* SK are eliminated from playoffs, Shifters are technically still in all tho the road is hard. I favor them in this matchup, think bot matchup in particular is very favorable</td></tr>

**Write Up:** Love the look of this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. Real Madrid really don&#x27;t enjoy playing at the Mestalla, having **won just one out of their last three games** there. Not only that, but they&#x27;re **missing so many key players** for <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>&#x27;s matchup. **Vinicius, Rodrygo and Bellingham are all out.** Madrid keep playing very stiff, uncreative football, **needing a 100th minute penalty to bail them out against Rayo.** Valencia aren&#x27;t exactly a powerhouse, but they have enough quality about them to shut out the guests <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>.

Valencia&#x27;s LaLiga form is nothing to write home about, but they&#x27;ve seen an uptick in the recent results with **two wins in their last three outings.** I think everything points towards a draw here, but just in case Real Madrid pull off some weird 90th minute VAR assisted magic, I&#x27;m going with the +0.5, +1.0 AH. The odds are just too good to pass up on. BTTS Yes seems like a good option too as I just can&#x27;t see Mbappe not finding the back of the net here.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today’s pick</mark> (five units) Patriots team total rushing yards over 108.5 (-120 on Bet365)

They’ve hit this 4 out of their last five regular season games, over against the Chargers and Broncos, and 105 vs the Texans. For those eight games, they are averaging 154 rushing yards per game. Vrabel wants to control the clock. Stevenson and Maye have showed this playoff that they can be relied on to run, so why not take one of their player props? Henderson has the home run potential as he may be the fastest player on the field (hit over 22 mph on multiple runs this year). I can see the Seahawks stuffing the box against the Patriots. Henderson has been a non-factor in the playoffs, making him an intriguing play for the Super Bowl (especially if he gets good yards on his first few touches). Seahawks allow 92 yards a game against the run, which ranks very high in the league. I’m just betting that the game stays close enough that Vrabel calls a few extra run plays and they can get those 17 extra yards.</td></tr>

Over 44.5 is a piece of cake. He finally made it to the Super Bowl, and he’s going to go all out.</td></tr>

Time: 9:00 AM EST

​<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Tundra -1.5 Maps @ 2.07 odds (5u)

​Write Up:

The mid lane match-up here is a mismatch. Heroic is fielding a 16-year-old rookie, TaiLung, who looked fine against a lower-tier team, but <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> he has to lane against bzm, one of the best midlaners in the world. In a high-pressure elimination series, Tundra’s veteran squad is going to target the rookie, pressure him early, and force him to crumble.

On top of the skill gap, Tundra has a massive tactical advantage. While Heroic was scrapping for their lives against Rekonix and showing all their strategies, Tundra was resting and watching their games. They already beat Heroic comfortably in the Group Stage earlier this week, proving that Tundra&#x27;s disciplined, suffocating playstyle is the perfect counter to Heroic&#x27;s chaotic brawling.

We are backing the more disciplined team to handle business again. Tundra 2-0.

SILKEBORG VS VIBORG

Date: 08 FEBRUARY 2026 at 14:00

BET ON: Over / Under team- VIBORG Over +1.50

Odd: 1.93



\- Ahead of the derby, both coaches have signalled an attacking approach rather than caution, which points toward a match with space and scoring opportunities. Silkeborg coach Kent Nielsen has openly highlighted the team’s many “offensive essences” in his pre-match press build-up, naming several attacking profiles and making it clear that Silkeborg intend to play proactively at home despite their defensive issues this season. With Silkeborg needing points to stay clear of the relegation battle, a passive setup is unlikely. From Viborg’s side, motivation is just as strong: they sit only two points from the Top 6 and face a brutal upcoming schedule, making this a game where they must push for a win. Tactically, the matchup favors Viborg scoring multiple times. Silkeborg’s possession-based 4-3-3/4-2-3-1 under Nielsen involves high full-backs and aggressive positioning between the lines, a structure that has repeatedly left space in transition. Viborg are well suited to exploit this, sitting compact before attacking vertically through quick combinations and wide overloads into the channels behind Silkeborg’s advanced defenders. With Silkeborg unlikely to abandon their proactive style and Viborg confident after a strong winter and positive test matches, the tactical and motivational setup strongly supports Viborg scoring two or more goals, making Over 1.50 goals a compelling angle.

 big with a five unit play, and we am going with Brondby to win.

Brondby have 5 wins, 1 draw and 3 losses so far this season and Randers are 2W 2D 5L. This is the first game of the season and I think brondby is going to come out with a win. Before season ended before christmas, Randers lost 3, won 1 where the other team had a red card and a draw.

Its not proud to bet on the rivals, but they have outclassed everybody in this window and expecting big movements from them as they have quality players now.</td></tr>

Recap: Unfortunately we lost our streak. That one hurt so much. We only needed 45 more seconds to win the bet, very unlucky XG suddenly stopped playing at all. I was so sure that it would go over the line when I was watching it. Map 2 also went over the line

  
Writeup : Liquid and Tundra are both favourites to win their games. Liquid has played against Gamerlegion a lot of times and has never conceded any map; their record has been 3-0 against GL in recent tournaments. I don&#x27;t see them losing any map tomorrow. They also already played during the group stage, and it was a 26-minute stomp. Heroic on the other hand, is a very inconsistent and unpredictable team, but they barely won against a tier 3 SEA team. I don&#x27;t see Tundra losing against Heroic.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Roberto Carballes Baena vs Mees Rottgering | **Carballes Baena ML at -185 (DK). 1 unit.**

Write-up: Seems like parlaying heavy favorites was not a popular move, but it ended up working out fairly well. Bublik got an easy 6-0, 6-3 win to start, and later in the day Gojo finished things off after moving from -364 to -453 pre-match. 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>, I&#x27;m fading the 18-year-old local talent Mees Rottgering in a situation where I see him being overmatched. Rottgering did really well to get past Kyrian Jacquet after being bageled in the first set, but his performance rating came in at just 6.31/10. Roberto Carballes Baena may not be a natural hard-court player, but he does have experience in all conditions, and he already scored a nice win over Pablo Carreño Busta with a 7.16/10. Another factor to consider is that Jacquet was a much bigger favorite than RCB is here, even though I don&#x27;t see a huge level gap between them. Even if Rottgering has a strong serve and overall game for his age, he still doesn&#x27;t feel fully developed as a player, and I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s going to cut it against someone like RCB. These courts are indoors, but they don&#x27;t play lightning-fast, and that works to the benefit of the more consistent Spaniard.</td></tr>

Girona looked almost set for relegation before they had a big uptick in results that has taken the to 12th, albeit it&#x27;s still just three points down to the relegation zone.

**CET 12:15 Football Eredivisie**

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>: Utrecht vs **Feyenoord -1 handicap** at **4,2** odds

Explanation: I want to start first by saying that we lose if Feyenoord wins with only one goal. So there is no push/void here. The second point is the odds being really weird here. Feyenoord have a huge motivation to win this game, sure it’s an away game. They are aiming for second place on the table, which gives direct Champions League placement. Utrecht on the other hand, seems to sit safe from relegation so far. The thing is that Feyenoord won the last two away games vs Utrecht and this handicap hit. Another weird thing here is the fact that the odds are so high for Feyenoord just to win at 2,17 (time of writing). That’s just ridiculous in my opinion. Either they know something which we don’t or they completely misplaced the odds. I’m thinking the latter and I’ll gladly take those 4,2 odds with a handicap on. 



Not much to say besides Feyenoord being the stronger team here and having the potential to completely outplay their opponents in this league. The exceptions are of course PSV and Ajax, who usually finish on the top every year. Handicap results here are quite common just like in the Portuguese league, where a gap between the top and the rest seems to remain.



I’m trying to keep track of the results in all the top leagues. I had way too many games to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> from Sunday, and honestly almost got a headache from trying to choose one. My goal is to have something around the 3x odds barrier or higher. This one qualified well and we will **always aim for** **long term** gains. I will try to post another <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> in the coming days. Seems like a good week is coming, with lots of league football to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> from. Good luck everyone.

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:**  Kenneth Walker III Over 20.5 Receiving Yards @ 1.90 (5 units)

**Warning:** I am 4-5-1 (W/L/D) in my last 10.  Worst streak ever in 195 picks here on <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>.  Everything is fine, except when I post it.  So do not tail me blindly, do your research and please bet responsibly.

“If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it”.  This is the same prop bet with the same yardage line and even the same odds that we won with in the divisional playoff game against the Rams where walker had 49 receiving yards.  Charbonnet is still out for the Seahawks and Walker has been the beneficiary of this extra load not only with more rushes, but he has become the go to checkdown receiver which easily got us over this line and will do so again. 

The Patriots pose a different challenge as their run defense is pretty damn good.  So good in fact that clashing with the Seahawks own defense may result in a lackluster defensive boring game where yards are hard to come by while punts abound.  Well, that seems to be what everyone is thinking so chances are we will probably see something else.

In either case, Walker eats.  No point repeating all the stats leading up to the first <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, since nothing has changed other than the opponent.  But if anyone wants to see them, here is the link to the original WINNING <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> post.  [First Ken Walker Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/comments/1qm1kn8/comment/o1k3bmf/?context=3&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)

Here are a few more:

* Patriots defense regularly gives up yards to running backs in the flat because they have successfully contained them limiting yards after the catch.
* Since week 16, Seahawks’ running backs averaging 54 receiving yards per game.
* The Seahawks rank #2 in running back target teams in the NFL ahead of the Detroit Lions and just behind the Atlanta Falcons.
* Sam Darnold has been targeting his RB’s on early downs to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> up short yardage, and allow more discretion on 2^(nd) and 3^(rd) downs to target downfield receivers. This may hold especially true with the Patriot’s defensive that will most definitely be pressuring Darnold all day.

**Edit:**  Lowered the odds since most folks cant get this prop anymore.

**Comment:**  So just for clarity, I have been getting asked to post all my SB bets which I will not do.  My advice has been take the player prop Overs that you like, and then everything else is an Under.  This is the SB.  Not everyone can have a great game.  Last year, the game went way over on points with 61, yet most player props went Under, starting with Saquon.  This is the case in most SB&#x27;s and  this one should be no exception.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Semenyo To Score or Assist (+145) 1 unit to win 1.45 units

**Write Up:** Running this play back as we&#x27;re taking Semenyo to score or assist in the match of the weekend. Liverpool and City, two giants of the EPL, are set to square off at Anfield after the reverse fixture in Manchester went 3-0 in favor of City. 

Semenyo has scored in his last 2 EPL matches and 4/5 in all comps. He has really hit his stride since joining City and has had great link up play with Haaland. I&#x27;m again buying down the juice of just ATGS, even though I think that to be the most likely cash, because I think he may wind up in a position to provide an assist to Haaland. Semenyo also scored 2 goals at Anfield earlier in the season while he was still with Bournemouth, so he knows how to beat this Liverpool defense on the road. 

BOL and happy Sunday!</td></tr>

5 Points separate these teams in the table, Western Sydney are starting to drop behind the rest of the pack and dropping points at home will see that continue to stretch. Considering the lack of ability to keep a clean sheet in both sides I see an end to end result here.

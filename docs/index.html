Streak (Last 10): ✅✅✅✅❌❌❌✅❌❌ &lt;--- Latest

Football | Serie A | 19:45 (GMT)

Game: Cagliari vs Lecce

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Over 0 Goals for Cagliari + Over 1 Corner for Cagliari in the 2nd Half - 1.83 (Bet365)

*Recap: Can&#x27;t believe this is the same Atletico team that spanked Barca. Oof!*

Write Up:

Supporting the home team to get one in <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. Against Lecce, I see Cagliari getting at least one goal in and dominating a huge chunk of both halves. There should easily be 2 corners for Cagliari in the 2nd half. Also, Cagliari at home have only been goalless in games vs much stronger teams like Inter, AC Milan and Bologna. Lecce shouldn&#x27;t prove difficult, all things remaining equal.

Good luck if you tail! 🍀</td></tr>

From oldest to newest: ✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌🅿️❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌

\+30 units (translated all dollars to units).

Last pick : Rayo Vallecano vs **Atletico Madrid -1,5 handicap** at **3,4** odds ❌

**CET 21:00 Football Championship**

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>: Coventry vs Middlesbrough **over 4,5 goals** at **5,5** odds

Explanation: Really bad <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> yesterday, but that’s bound to happen as well. We move on to the next one. We have a final here between two of the best teams. They have been the best for the most part this season. And the expectation is lots of goals. The reason is simple, they have a lot of action in their games. Coventry has 98 goals scored + conceded together. The most so far and Middlesbrough are ranked 1 on the table at the moment. Talk about a heated game with lots at stake. The trigger that we need is an early goal and all hell will break loose. I definitely don’t expect these teams to lay back and play defensive. My expectations are 3-2, 3-3, 2-3 or anything higher here. This might be the last time I’m attempting **over/under** bet, if it fails. I need a sign that I’m decent at this, even if I won’t attempt it often. 

On the side note: My tactics won’t change by lowering the odds. The goal is to find high odds to play here. I’m trying to keep track of the results in all of the top leagues. We will **always aim for** **long term** gains here and make sure to manage your bankroll. I changed my mind in the end about lowering the units. The approach will rather be to **quit over/under**, if it goes horrible. I will try to post another <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> in the coming days. Good luck everyone.

Bookie: **Leovegas** and a **5** unit bet. Gamble **responsibly**!

Appreciate all the support:

LONG-TERM STRATEGY IS THE KEY IN SPORTS BETTING



MATCHES RECAP: Decent Performance from Athletic Bilbao ( 1-2 Win ) As Expected &amp; Very Poor Final Result from Salzburg ( One Full Half To Score , 1.65xG ) ; 



<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>PICK</mark> - Brentford Win &amp; Real Madrid Draw No Bet - 1.90 ODDS / -110 ODDS FOR AMERICAN MARKET

 ! ( 2-Days Parlay As I see Value ) !



\- Brentford FC enters this match with a massive advantage in squad quality, tactical structure, and professional experience, which should allow them to control possession and create consistent attacking pressure against Macclesfield FC.

\- Despite Macclesfield FC’s surprising victory over Crystal Palace FC, that result is widely viewed as an isolated upset rather than a reflection of consistent performance, as cup matches often produce unpredictable outcomes due to rotation and situational factors.

\- Expect a positive outcome, the non-league team&#x27;s dream must come to an end in this match, most important factor - 90 minutes.



\- Real Madrid CF’s previous defeat against SL Benfica was a costly result that allowed Benfica to qualify from the final position, serving as a clear lesson and exposing moments of defensive vulnerability and lack of efficiency. Matches of this magnitude typically reinforce tactical discipline and focus, especially for a club with Real Madrid’s competitive standards.

\- Kylian Mbappé is expected to start in the first XI and enters the match in excellent form, bringing pace, directness, and attacking efficiency. His current momentum, combined with the motivation to respond after the previous defeat, positions him as a key factor in Real Madrid’s offensive threat.

\- Real Madrid is likely to approach this match with greater tactical awareness and composure, having learned from their previous mistakes. At minimum, they have the structure and experience to secure a draw, which would allow them to consolidate their position and take full control of the tie at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium.

**Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Ollie Watkins ATGS (+140) ❌️

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s Event:** English Premier League (Soccer) | Brighton vs Bournemouth (12:00 PM PST)

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Kaoru Mitoma to Score or Give Assist (+135) 1 unit to win 1.35 units

**Write Up:** I guess Villa was bound to lay a goose egg at some point, really bad showing by them all around. Couldn&#x27;t find Watkins or any other passes near the box, and Everton played a mean defense. Well played to Everton, on to the next for us. 

Brighton host Bournemouth here in a battle of the mid-lower table. Expecting a shootout here as both teams need points and tend to participate in high scoring matches. Bournemouth have been a poor defensive team this season. They concede the 2nd most goals in the EPL, behind only West Ham, the 3rd most xG, and the 4th most SOTs. Their games are also the highest scoring in the EPL. This is especially true on the road, their last 8 away matches they have conceded 3-2-4-4-3-4-3-3. They have conceded over 3 goals in 7 of their last 8 away matches, which bodes well for our home team here. 

Mitoma has been dealing with injuries most of this season, having only participated in roughly half of Brighton&#x27;s EPL matches. He is now fully fit though and has come back to the starting lineup. That said, he is coming back into form and scored his 2nd goal of the season in their last match against Man City. His first goal, coincidentally, was in the reverse fixture at Bournemouth earlier in the season. Over the last 3 seasons, he has scored 4 goals against Bournemouth in 4 games. He was also Brighton&#x27;s joint top scorer last season. Since his minutes have been limited and the sample size this year is small, this play is more about my opinion that Mitoma is the best player on the Brighton team, when healthy, and Bournemouth are one of the worst defensive teams in the league. 

BOL, happy Monday, let&#x27;s start the week off with a win!</td></tr>

**Event/Match:** Football | Israel Premier League — Hapoel Tel Aviv vs Hapoel Beer Sheva (18:00 WET)

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Hapoel Beer Sheva ML @1.70 (2u) 

**Write-Up:**

Luck was not on our side yesterday, with the way the game was going Barcelona should have gotten an easy win, with even 2 invalidated goals, but it is what it is, let&#x27;s hope luck is with us this time.

Hapoel Beer Sheva come into this match in a very strong position. They sit 2nd in the league with a record of 13W, 3D, and 2L, but that’s only because Beitar Jerusalém (1st) have played one extra match. With a win here, Beer Sheva reclaim 1st place, which adds extra motivation to an already important matchup.

Form strongly favors the visitors. Beer Sheva are unbeaten in their last five matches in all competitions (4W, 1D), while Hapoel Tel Aviv (5th) have been inconsistent over the same stretch (2W, 1D, 2L). Despite Tel Aviv’s solid home record this season (8W, 1D in the league), context matters: they’ve struggled badly when facing top opposition.

Looking at Tel Aviv’s home defeats in all competitions this season, all of them came against teams in the top of the table: Maccabi Tel Aviv (3rd) twice and Beitar Jerusalem (1st). Going back to last season, the last time they lost at home before that was a heavy 1–5 defeat to Hapoel Beer Sheva. Against top-five teams this season, Tel Aviv have only managed one win: a 3–2 victory over Beitar Jerusalem that was heavily influenced by a late red card.

The head-to-head history is also very telling. Beer Sheva have won 4 of the last 6 meetings, and in Tel Aviv specifically, they’ve won 3 of the last 5. The last two visits saw Beer Sheva dominate, winning 5–1 and 4–0.

Away from home, Beer Sheva have proven they can handle big games. This season they’ve beaten Beitar Jerusalem (0–1) and Maccabi Haifa (0–1) away, dominating both matches statistically with higher xG, more shots, more shots on target, and more big chances. Even in away games where they dropped points, performance wasn’t the issue, luck and a red card played a major role.

So even though Tel Aviv have a very strong home record this season, considering their struggles against top teams and Beer Sheva’s head-to-head dominance, I’m backing Beer Sheva to win this game and reclaim 1st place in the league.

ESTRELA VS ESTORIL

Date: 19 JANUARY 2026 at 21:15

BET ON: Both teams to score- Yes

Odd: 1.73



\- For BTTS – Yes, there are compelling tactical and motivational reasons suggesting both teams will score. Estrela’s coach José Faria has publicly framed the match as one of “importance máxima” and a chance to end their winless patch, stressing that his side are confident and see positive momentum as key, even if they’ve struggled recently — he expects Estoril to come with high motivation and a different stimulus, which means Estrela will not sit back but try to take the game to them. Estrela’s recent games show they are aggressive in transition and score after the break but are also prone to conceding once the game opens up, reflecting a tactical willingness to commit players forward that weakens them defensively. Four of their last five league games have finished with over 2.5 goals, underlining this attacking-but-vulnerable profile. Many Portuguese sources confirm coach Faria’s intent to push the team forward rather than park the bus against a motivated Estoril.

\- On the other side, Estoril’s Ian Cathro has insisted his team will always play to win and “não compra o empate” (doesn’t play for a draw), even in tough away fixtures, highlighting confidence and an attacking mindset. He regularly emphasizes rigor and concentration but also the need to play their style — which is proactive and forward-looking — and has acknowledged that results haven’t matched their ambition but the approach remains the same. With Xeka out injured, Estoril’s midfield balance is more open, often leading to gaps that invite transitions — exactly the kind Estrela thrives on.

\- Combine all this with Estrela’s attacking identity under Madeira’s 4-2-3-1/4-4-2 hybrid and Estoril’s desire to impose their game and score away, and you get a match where both teams have tactical incentive and motivation to score, while neither has shown defensive solidity recently. All signs point to goals at both ends.</td></tr>

__Write Up:__ Curt Cignetti took the worst program in Power 5 history &amp; turned them into the best team in the country in less than 2 years. If Indiana beats Miami &amp; goes 16-0, it will be the greatest coaching job in the history of American sports. This will be the 1st national championship in school history. Indiana has beaten multiple elite programs, including the former #1 Ohio State Buckeyes &amp; top 5 ranked Oregon twice. They’ve outscored their 2 playoff opponents 94-25. They rank top 3 in both scoring offense (40.4 PPG) &amp; scoring defense (11.9 PPG) in the NCAA. Indiana QB  Fernando Mendoza (Miami native) has put on one of the best performances we have ever seen the CFB Playodds. The Heisman Trophy winner has thrown 8 TD’s with just 5 incompletions, owning an 86% completion rate. He shines in big moments, leading Indiana to a 5-0 ATS record against ranked teams.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Novak Djokovic 🇷🇸 -8.5 games handicap vs Pedro Martinez 🇪🇸 5 units to win 4.2U @1.83 (Bet365)

The spread is quite large but I expect a beating of Martinez in this match from Djokovic. The Spaniard started the season with a title in Bengaluru but didn’t face a single player ranked in the top 230 so it won’t mean much other than give a slight bit of confidence heading into the season. The world No. 71 had a pretty bad year in 2025, especially on hard courts going 4-10 on outdoors and performed considerably worse as the season went on leading to some big losses culminating in a 4 and 1 loss to Giron in Athens. It’s no wonder really considering his lack of weapons on hard courts - with a subpar serve and conservative gamestyle he doesn’t have the game to take it to win free points on faster courts and instead has to rely on opponent’s mistakes. Unfortunately for him, most of the top players are simply too good baseliners nowadays with the exception of a couple of error-prone players (looking at you Rune who went 0-2 against the Spaniard) and therefore struggles to stay competitive against these top ranked guys. Outside of clay courts, top 15 opponents have covered this spread in all six grand slam matches against the Spaniard. Last year, Martinez lost 1,4,1 against Zverev here and I expect a similar result here. I mean, even No. 435 Riedi covered the handicap against him at the US open for crying out loud.

Enter the GOAT of tennis Djokovic for one of his last chances at winning a 25th grand slam at his favourite tournament, having won it a whopping 10 times. He has nothing to prove nowadays but he’s still as hungry as ever saying he was here to take the title from Sinner and Alcaraz in his press conference. Despite playing a very limited schedule last year he’s still the world No. 4 and was undoubtedly the third best player last year, reaching the semis of each slam. I couldn’t really think of a better match up to get his season running than Martinez, he should concede few free points on return, win quite a few on serve and come out on top of most rallies to put him in confidence for the rest of the tournament. Basically, Pedro’s style of play comes mostly from waiting for the opponent’s error but is up against the most patient player on tour who should redirect the Spaniard’s pace to overwhelm him even on a bad day. It’s a hellish match-up on paper and expect a comfortable win for the Serb who won’t want to hang around in an opening match to conserve his slightly-diminished fitness levels for the later rounds.

Monday’s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> - Stan Wawrinka ML -127 (1.27u to win 1u)

Stan is playing in his final Australian Open this year and he will have the full backing of the crowd. Realistically for him, a win in round 1 would be a successful tournament and I believe he knows that. He should leave it all out there against Djere.

Djere had a tough 2025 with injuries, which could negate some of the concerns of stamina with Wawrinka. Wawrinka has a H2H record of 2-1 in this matchup.

With all these factors, I’ll take the veteran one last time.

Indiana’s run game is one of, if not the best in the nation - Miami is susceptible to big plays on defense, while Indiana in ranked 3rd in 20+ yard rushes - Indiana should be able to control the tempo with their run game, limiting Miami possessions throughout the 1H - Indiana has been pretty dominant in their 1H’s and they seem to catch opponents off guard early - Indiana will come out with an awesome game plan, and I see them being damn near perfect in the 1H - Hoosiers cover -4.5 for us in a low scoring 1H

Kartal vs Pieri - Kartal Handicap -6.5 Games @ 1.71 ✅ 

Bassols vs Leonard - Leonard ML @ 2.19 ✅

Close match when it comes to serve percentages but I always felt like Leonard had the advantage and she ended up winning in straight sets. 4th win in a row for us!

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** **Kartal vs Kalinina - Under 19.5 Games @ 1.85**

Kartal is here after beating a really weak opponent in the first round by 6-1/6-0, where her level of play was quite high, which might be a sign that she&#x27;s taking this tournament quite seriously, in order to try to climb some ranking spots before the start of the new season. 

Kalinina did not play for 6 months before coming into this tournament and beating Deichmann in straight sets in the previous round, which was an expected win. By missing most of the 2025 season, she&#x27;s now out of the top 150. 

When it comes to playstyles both players like to be aggressive and dictate the pace of each point, with Kartal being superior when it comes to pace absorption and point construction. Kalinina is considerably taller than Kartal but I don&#x27;t consider the Ukrainian a better server. In my opinion, Kartal serves much more efficiently, with a disguised toss and decent accuracy. 

With this, I&#x27;m expecting a one-sided match, especially because Kalinina hasn&#x27;t gained much playing rhythm and is yet to face a player with Kartal&#x27;s quality since her return. The under can work both ways but in summary, this play is focused on Kartal&#x27;s quality.

Good luck!</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Ivica Zubac over 10.5 rebs (-111) (Stake)

Bet 4U to win 3.6U

Write up:

PJ is out guaranteed while Day-to-Davis is questionable again so I would take this line ASAP it WILL go down before game time.

Mavs give up the 5th most rebounds to centers. Zubac averages 10.4 rebounds per game but this is with a caveat as his playing time should be 30+ but 6 of 11 games so far hasn&#x27;t covered it due to blowouts or etc. and even if the clippers wipe out the mavs, he still would likely get around 25 mins and he has cleared the line 6/11 times and 3 of them came from under 30 min games so yes I am still very confident in this play.

Another straight forward explanation for the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> but still very confident thats why im putting 4U on it.

Anyways this is not financial advice always bet withing bankroll limits and BOL!</td></tr>

Analysis:

This tip is mainly to back Tom Paris, he’s been playing impressive tennis. Only got broken once in this tournament and won all his matches in straights sets. Has a big serve, with at least12 aces in each match. I can see him cruising here against the older Broady.

TODAYS FIXTURE: Slovakia v Northern Ireland (7:45pm uk / 2:45pm EST)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>PICK</mark>: Slovakia ML @ 2.1 (2U)


Write up:

Slovakia come into this game desperate for a win. In decent form after beating Germany at home and Luxembourg away they will be keen to keep up there chances of qualification with a win.

The injury list is looking good with one of the star men Lobotka avaliable after the Napoli man’s injury. 

Northern Ireland on the other hand have had their already slim squad hit with a few key injuries meaning they will have to reshape in some areas.

It is true that NI beat Slovakia at home last month , but in totally different circumstances. Slovakia are a different proposition at home and can see them winning this 2/3-0.

I think at 2.1 , they hold great value especially given how poorly NI tend to perform on the road.

Best of luck to those who tail and as always see you on the other side

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** Croatia Win + Under 3.5 Goals @ 2.05 (1u)

**Last Pick:** England to Win to Nil @ 1.93 ✅

Feels good to get that first win, England weren&#x27;t convincing with it and Serbia had their chances to score but things fell our way and England took the 2-0 win. Let&#x27;s keep the ball rolling and get into positive units with this one.

**Write Up:**  
Sticking to the WC Qualifiers here and taking Croatia to win and keeping it under 3.5 total goals. Croatia are clearly the superior team, and they should handle business at home without too much stress. But they’re also not the type to blow teams out just for the sake of it. They usually control possession, take their chances when they come, and manage games professionally rather than chasing huge scorelines.

The Faroe Islands tend to sit deep and make life annoying, and while they’ll concede chances, they’re usually organised enough to avoid the absolute hammerings people expect. Their last 7 losses have only been by 1 goal - which fits this combo perfectly.

Croatia’s attack can absolutely break them down, but the tempo they play at doesn’t often lead to four or five-goal explosions unless the opponent completely collapses. With Croatia’s patient style and Faroe Islands&#x27; low block, this has all the makings of a routine, low-event Croatia win.</td></tr>

League: NBA

Time: Bucks 7:00 PM Central | Lakers 7:00 PM Central

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Bucks ML + Lakers ML

Bet 3 units to win 1.53 units

Why: The Bucks look like the safer side tonight because their offense is humming and they match up well against a Hornets team that just can’t get stops. Milwaukee consistently clears the scoring marks that give Charlotte trouble, and with the Hornets getting out-scored on the season and struggling as underdogs, it’s hard not to lean Bucks in a tight but controlled win. On the other side, the Lakers are in a good bounce-back spot against a Pelicans squad that’s been allowing teams to shoot the lights out and giving up one of the highest point totals in the league. Even with their own flaws, the Lakers shoot more efficiently, force more turnovers, and should control the interior against a weaker defensive front.

As a side note, I&#x27;m still puzzled over how Cleveland put up such bad performance against the raptors yesterday in what should have been, a very easy win.</td></tr>

While Poland is desperate here and really want a point, they are dealing with injuries and Netherlands is just better. I&#x27;ll bet that Netherlands will not lose.</td></tr>

**Event:** NBA: Houston - Portland

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>:** Houston to score over 10.5 threes in the game, 1.80, 1u

I somehow got fixated on this game and analysed it thoroughly after I gave up on the Efes EL game. I still like Efes there, but not as much as a few days ago to cover the spread.

Houston is the worst team in the league per 3p attempts per game, they do only 29.9, that is the reason for this limit from bookies, I think. Still, they make a solid 13.0 3p on average, and in their 10 games, they had 7 above this limit.

A 70% chance at 1.80 odds is a nice overvalue.

The only worry I had was that Sengun is going to dominate the small Portland lineup under the basket, but they manage to cover big guys relatively well (only Ayton destroyed them in the 2nd game, but he was extra motivated there, of course). Jokic, for example, in a loss, didn&#x27;t really do anything special (for his standards, though he had a good %, as always).

I think Sengun also doesn&#x27;t like double-teaming that much and quick agile defenses, so there should be a good number of open 3p opportunities on the return passes from the paint.</td></tr>

**Write up:**

**Poland v Netherlands**  
Netherlands is the favorite in this matchup because they simply have the better players, players who have played together for basically the entire World Cup qualification period. Gakpo has managed to get a shot on target for the past 4 international matches, one of which against Poland. He likes to cut inside and with an attacking Matty Cash on the right I think he&#x27;ll get space. The Dutch Team average 6.7 shots on target per match in the last 10 matches.

**Flint v The New Saints**  
The New Saints a.k.a. TNS have been dominating the Welsh top flight for a decade now, with 12 championships in the past 15 years. They are on track to win another one this season as they are comfortably sitting 1st once again with 9 points clear. Their goal difference is 48:15 at the moment. They are away against Flint this Friday. It&#x27;s safe to say Flint are struggling this season as they sit in 10th (out of 12). They have a negative goal difference and gained 9 out of 15 points against bottom league teams. If you take out results against teams lower then them they haven&#x27;t won in a long time. Last 5 H2H between the teams? 4-2,5-0,1-4,5-1,1-8, all in favor of TNS. I think TNS will dominate once again, hence the 3-way handicap here.

NBA | Heat vs Knicks | 🏀  

Hunter made us sweat for this one, well not really - his teammates bricking every shot did but we still got it done. We move 

Going back to my guy Mr. Hart here who gets a great matchup against my favourite opposition yes you guessed it the Miami Heat. What’s even better is that Knicks are without Jalen Brunson who’ll miss a couple of games meaning huge assist upside for Hart here against a Heat side ranked #1 in pace and top 6 in assists allowed.

Faced the Heat earlier this season where he recorded 5 assists in 28 minutes WITH Brunson playing, without Brunson last season against the Heat he had 11 assists. 

Over in 8/L10 games WITHOUT Brunson avg 7 assists and 11.4 potentials which is a huge jump from his L10 WITH Brunson averaging 3.7 assists per game and 5.2 potentials.

Not confirmed if he’ll start tomorrow but 30+ mins should be in store for Hart regardless which is enough time to get it done.

Huge upside for Hart here and they’ll need a playmaker with the absence of Brunson, expecting Hart to be an important role of this offense tomorrow in a great matchup. Was contemplating RA but I like the assist angle better.</td></tr>

Clemson is just straight up ass no other way to put it, they’re just a sad team to watch Dabo needs out of there. but I’m gonna be honest I’ve done almost 0 research but also feel like I don’t need to for this one that’s how bad Clemson is. Now Louisville is coming off a tough 3 point loss to Cal, who I would argue is a better team than Clemson, but I think that’s one of the reasons they take this game. Barely staying in the top 25, Louisville simply cannot lose this game. The spread is at -2.5(Louisville) i think they get that and I’m probably throwing a little somethin on an alt spread line around -9.5/-10.5.

Event: NBA 🏀| Charlotte at Milwaukee 5:00 PT

Kon Knueppel rebounds O 5.5 (-120 on DK) @ 4 units

Finished last season weak and sat out the start of this year until something caught my eye. 

Kon has been rebounding well lately and his line has not caught up. He has had 6+ rebounds in 6/6 of his last games (including the previous game vs. MIL), averaging 8.33 rpg. He is consistently in the starting lineup as CHA&#x27;s starting SF, and playing 30+ minutes per game, providing plenty of rebounding opportunities. 

In the 8 games in which Kon played 30+ minutes, he grabbed 6+ rebounds in 7/8, and the one miss was his first ever NBA game.

Lamelo is expected to return in this game but that shouldn&#x27;t upset things, as all of the above were still true in games both with and without Lamelo. 

Lastly, MIL gives up the 4th most rebounds to the SF position in the league, so this is considered a favorable matchup for Kon&#x27;s rebound line. 

Good luck if tailing!</td></tr>

Apologize about the sweat on win two. I told you that prime-time games get nuts. Henderson scoring 3 touchdowns but not breaking 70 yards is just what I&#x27;m talking about. Here is another progression parlay.

**Write up : Davion Mitchell** has quietly been one of Miami’s most reliable role players over the last 10 games, stepping up while the Heat navigate injuries to Herro and Bam. He’s hit his mark in 8 of those 10 contests, and the game logs show this isn’t a fluke. With Brunson out tonight, expect Mitchell to grab a couple of boards and put up roughly 11–12 points in what should be a competitive matchup.

**Tari Eason** has been just as consistent at home, hitting this line in 7 of his last 10 home games, including all three meetings against Portland. The Blazers have allowed 6 of 10 opposing power forwards to clear their key lines in recent matchups, and with this being a crucial “cup” game, every point counts. Eason looks primed to deliver again.

Banchero is out. Wagner has already been rebounding well, expect more boards to be available for Wagner.

Wagner has hit 34-37 minutes in L5/5. By virtue of being on the court, expect some free boards from the Nets.

The Spurs just put 120 from 46 field goals up on the Warriors, only getting 16 FT’s - so my Warriors don’t give up shooting fouls easily, Spurs score around 50% FG range rings true which gives a lot of room for potential assists.

-everything is bet to win unit amount-

Write up: 

I am going to keep this fairly short, sweet, and simple for you guys <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. We have a spurs team that just played this same warriors team on Wednesday the 12th. The spurs held a 15 point lead at one point in the second quarter and a 9 point lead in the 3rd and ended up giving away the game to the warriors, who rode the backs of a 46 point performance by curry. Not only that but kuminga went down with a knee injury and his status is going to be up in the air for this game. 

I’m going to go ahead and leave you with this here. Curry single handedly put the team on his back to will his team to a 5 point victory. He simply will not play any better than that again against the spurs. not only that but in that game the spurs closed as -3.5 and opened at -4.5. So now at -2.5 (yes I bought to 2 sue me once again) we are getting EVEN BETTER VALUE, then what Vegas originally thought of them yesterday. Have the spurs really done anything wrong that bad to warrant an even smaller line?

This will be the warriors 3rd game in the past 4 nights, kuminga is questionable, and not only that but since the spurs have gotten fox back in their last 3 games they have the 3rd best eFG% in the league and have been playing at the 5th highest pace! Tired legs for the warriors and a banged up kuminga? Cmon man. I just don’t see another repeat curry 40 point performance and I love the spurs to come out motivated to not only get the revenge win against the warriors, but this is also the second game for the spurs in the NBA cup group play! They already beat the rockets in their first go around and these young guys will be hungry to compete for the nba cup ship (even though I think it’s the stupidest fucking thing of all fucking time). This is a fantastic spot for the spurs.  If you have been following me for the entirety of my <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> journey you would also know I am 3-0 on 2 unit plays!

**New Event:**  Luxembourg vs Germany &amp; South Korea vs Bolivia

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:**  Germany -1.5 &amp; South Korea -1 @ 1.85 (Usual 3 units)

Not going to do a long write-up like yesterdays.

**Leg 1**: Luxembourg vs Germany – Germany -1.5 Asian Handicap

Luxembourg are in last place in this group winless with 0 points while the Germans sit atop the group with 9 points tied with Slovakia whom they will face in the final match. Germany can ill afford to drop points here and are by far the superior team in their match against Luxembourg. We need the German&#x27;s to win by 2 which should not be much of an ask given that in their last H2H where Germany won 4-0, they had 85% possession, 31 shots vs 1, and 8 Shots on Target vs Luxembourg&#x27;s 1.

**Leg 2**: South Korea vs Bolivia – South Korea -1 Asian Handicap

South Korea, already qualified for the World Cup, host Bolivia whom still have to contend with playoffs to stamp their ticket. This is a friendly match but one where the South Korean&#x27;s hold a huge advantage.

**Write Up:**  
The Knicks are 5-1 SU and 4-1 ATS in their last 6 home games, covering as 5+ point favorites in 4 straight. Miami is 3-3 SU on the road and 2-3 SU as +177 or greater underdogs this season, with road scoring dipping to 120 PPG (vs 124.8 overall).

Brunson is **probable** (questionable tag removed this morning) and has cleared 27.5 points in 7/11 games, including 37 vs Miami earlier. Heat rank 23rd in points allowed (120.7) and face a Knicks defense holding opponents to 113.7 PPG at MSG.

Simulations project Knicks 119-115 (58% cover rate on -5). Miami’s 8-3-1 ATS is inflated by home games; they’re 3-2-1 ATS as road dogs. Value on the home favorite before the line climbs to -5.5.

Tennis | Drummondville Challenger | 2:30 PM EST (estimated)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Duncan Chan vs Gabi Adrian Boitan | **Chan ML at +118 (FD). 1 unit.**

Write-up: Buse closed at -223, and while the match was pretty up-and-down, he eventually won in a third set tiebreaker.

Duncan Chan is a college player (TCU) who has been lighting it up recently. In September, he won the title at the ITA&#x27;s Battle in the Bay Classic without dropping a set, and followed that up with a strong performance as the No. 2 seed at the ITA All-American Championships. He then scored a big win over ATP #251 Clement Chidekh at an ITF in Montreal, and has already gotten off to a great start here in Drummondville, as he just defeated a really solid indoor player in Antoine Ghibaudo in straight sets (7.18 performance rating)&gt;

Meanwhile, Gabi Boitan is a solid player, but he plays most of his tennis on clay courts. The market hasn&#x27;t exactly been loving him here in Drummondville, as he was pushed from +125 to +290 in the opening round and from +135 to +200 in the second round. Sure, he got through both of those matches in straight sets, but he didn&#x27;t necessarily put in an amazing performance in either of them (6.95 and 6.87). In particular, I felt that he was starting to struggle physically in his second match against Ilagan, but got bailed out by his serve and a few poor points by Ilagan in the second-set tiebreaker. Looking at how Boitan was priced in that match, Ilagan closed at almost the same odds against Nicholas Arsenault in R1; however, I believe that Chan is playing at a slightly higher level than Arsenault right now. In addition, Chan closed at around +160 vs Ghibaudo, but I would honestly put Ghibaudo pretty close to even money in a match against Ilagan. 

Overall, my analysis of each player&#x27;s form and recent market pricing makes this a 50/50 match to me. Both players are baseline grinders, but I feel that Chan brings a bit more variety to the table with his slice. Duncan was also hitting his returns with interest against a pretty big server in Ghibaudo, and I feel like that should help him against Boitan, who utilizes a heavy serve as one of his main weapons in these conditions. For those reasons, this is a 1-unit play for me.

Last Pick: Atlanta Hawks -3.5 vs Sacramento Kings @ 1.91. 3U. ✅

The Hawks win by a whopping 33 points. That makes it 4 wins in a row betting on an away team favorite to cover their spread. For a change, I will go with the home team spread here, still betting on a favorite though.

 

Next <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **Miami Heat vs New York Knicks -4.5 @ 1.95**. 3U play.

The Knicks had high expectations coming into this season, and while they started off rough, they got into a nice groove recently winning 5 in a row (both SU and ATS). They did lose their last game (Magic) but I’m willing to cut them some slack since it was the second half of a B2B. The Heat have been fairly good, but without Bam, their offense does seem to rely on Norm Powell (who I like) more than it should. In their last game, they also lost to a Cavs team that rested multiple starters, so I think some of the weaknesses of this squad are being exposed. I expect OG or Mikal to focus on Norm to reduce his threat, and with Mitchell Robinson/KAT they should be able to limit easy looks for Ware. I’m happy to back the better team at home to cover this line.   </td></tr>

Write Up:  
 
Smart averages about 5.2 assists and 3.4 rebounds per game against the Pelicans in his career.  That’s a combined average 8.6, so the 5.5 threshold is well below his historical output vs the pels. Smart is a primary ball‑handler / facilitator when healthy, so assisting will be his role , rebounds are less of a strength but add “bonus” that help him exceed the RA. The Pels have many injuries that will help Smart getting his props with Zion averages significant rebounding and assists himself and his absence means the Pelicans lose some of their offensive balance and rebound support and Poole being out removes another playmaker which may force the Pelicans to rely on less experienced playmakers, opening passing lanes for Smart.

Event CBB: USC vs Illinois State 7:30PM Eastern Time

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **USC -16.5** (-110 FanDuel) 

USC is looking really good to start the season. They brought in the 7th ranked Transfer Portal class, and return a starting Senior who was a 10ppg scorer last season.

USC has covered the spread in both games so far this season, winning by 30 and 31. They draw a great matchup imo with Illinois State. USC is a lot bigger across the board and their opponent Illinois State’s top 2 scorers are 5’11 and 6’2. I expect USC’s height across the board to bother them.

USC’s shortest starter is 6’5 and the others are taller. They currently rank 11th in the country at Offensive rebound percentage at 44%. Last game they grabbed 24 offensive boards.

Not only the size advantage, the talent USC brought in is top-notch in my opinion. 

The 3 best starting transfers are Chad Baker-Mazara was one of Final4 Auburns top players last year, R. Rice was one of Sweet16 Maryland’s top scorers, and Ausar who avg’d 12.5ppg for Utah. 

Take USC -16.5</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Minnesota +25.5 -112 3u to win 2.8u

Oregon Ducks vs Minnesota Golden Gophers, Eugene, Oregon. 7:30pm EST kickoff

I had an Iowa +6.5 writeup ready to go for last Saturday. I traveled to Iowa City to go watch that game and completely forgot to post it, but I looked a lot at Oregon and how they operate.

The numbers will point towards Oregon pretty considerably in every aspect so I’m not even going to acknowledge them. Oregon is a 25.5 point favorite for a reason.

I watch a lot of Big 10 football and I’ve had this theory over the past 2 years since the addition of the west coast teams that they get pretty flustered when playing against the old Big 10 west. This is showcased when the king of the old Big 10 west (Iowa) covers the +6.5 against one of the best teams in the conference in Oregon and almost beats them, Wisconsin kinda hangs around Oregon until the 4th quarter, and teams like Washington get the doors blown off by teams like Michigan, Iowa last year, lose to a bad Wisconsin team this year. There’s something about playing against these gross midwestern farm teams that they have the ability to drag you down into the mud and make games competitive that really shouldn’t be.

Oregon notably did not cover against their past 2 matchups, Wisconsin and Iowa. Minnesota is cut from the same cloth as both of those teams, and they employ a similar style of gross football. 

Oregon is missing it’s 4 best pass catchers this week to injury, and will rely on running the ball through the heart of Minnesota at home in another cold and rainy Oregon climate. Oregon is also coming off of a massive emotional spot in beating Iowa at Kinnick with 3 seconds left in the game, and is in a look-ahead sandwich spot after getting hyped up for their biggest test of the year at Iowa City, and going to play USC after Minnesota. They are also on a short week.

Oregon got into a war with Iowa. PJ Fleck wishes he could be Iowa’s Kirk Ferentz, and plays a lot of the same style of football as Iowa. I expect a low scoring matchup where Oregon wins by 2 touchdowns, but doesn’t quite get over that 25.5 marker. Oregon will run the ball at will, burn clock, and start preparing early for USC. Minnesota will slowly drive the field with their very good QB in Drake Lindsey, get a touchdown or 2 and cover the spread.</td></tr>

NCAAF // Minnesota Golden Gophers @ Oregon Ducks

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Oregon -25.5 (+100 ESPNBET) 1u**

  
Let&#x27;s head out to Eugene, Oregon where 8-1 #8 ranked Oregon hosts 6-3 Minnesota. After looking at Oregon&#x27;s last two games most people probably think this line is too big. They only beat Iowa by 2 and lowly Wisconsin by 14, not covering their spread in either game. So why would we think they are able to cover this week??

Minnesota is actually having a decent year; they secured bowl eligibility early, don&#x27;t have any terrible losses, and picked up a quality win against a ranked Nebraska team. The two huge blemishes on Minnesota&#x27;s resume are their outings against Ohio State and Iowa. In both of these games Minnesota only managed to score 3 points. They tallied 162 total yards against Ohio State and 133 total yards against Iowa. What do Ohio State and Iowa have in common? Well, not much...other then they both have elite defenses. Who else is in that club? Oregon.

Ohio State and Iowa rank top 4 in both Scoring Defense and Total Defense. Right there with them sits Oregon at #3 in total defense, allowing 239ypg and #7 in scoring defense, allowing 13.78ppg. Minnesota has faced elite defenses before and has nothing to show for it, now they have to travel 2 time zones west and try to muster up some points on the road. I just don&#x27;t see it happening. 

Oregon should put up some points here like they have all season long, and now we are at the point of the year where style points come in to play as well. The committee is watching games and puts their rankings out each week, Oregon is currently on the outside looking in when it comes to the Big Ten&#x27;s auto bid, so they are going to have to earn an at large bid. This is a Friday night game on Fox, and they will have all eyes on them, the perfect opportunity to run it up against a conference opponent. 

Oregon Total Offense: #13 (472 ypg)     Minnesota Total Offense: #118 (313 ypg)

Oregon Scoring Offense: #9 (38.7 ppg)     Minnesota Scoring Offense: #95 (23.8 ppg)

Oregon Total Defense: #3 (239 yards allowed per game)     Minnesota Total Defense: #21 (312 yards allowed per game)

Oregon Scoring Defense: #7 (13.78 points allowed per game)     Minnesota Scoring Defense: #39 (21.56 points allowed per game)

Oregon: 5-4 ATS (3-2 at home)     Minnesota: 2-6 ATS (0-3 on the road)

  
Oregon does have some key offensive injuries with their coach being coy about their possible returns during his press conference this week, I suspect some are back, some still out. But they were without them at Iowa and still managed to move the ball in a monsoon against one of the country&#x27;s best defenses. Weather looks great for game night, and I think they will still be running smooth on offense even without a couple of their dependable weapons. 

  
I see Minnesota struggling to get anything going and Oregon utilizing their balanced attack to run up the score early and often. Go Ducks! 🦆</td></tr>

**Write Up:** Tough break yesterday as we take our first <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> loss. Anderson had a few good opportunities, but unfortunately they were all blocked before reaching the keeper. We move on. 

We&#x27;re coming back swinging after our loss with what I see as a high value-high <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. I really like this match <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> where we see 1st place in the group Netherlands visiting 2nd place Poland. Netherlands comes into the match carrying a 3 point lead, so a win or a draw here secures their place in the world cup next summer. Poland equally are battling for 2nd place and a loss here makes their match in Malta on Monday a spicy one. I fully expect Netherlands to win this game and dominate possession, however I see some value on the other side.

Matty Cash plays right back. With Poland typically lining up with a back 3 in a 5-4-1 or something comparable, Cash tends to play pretty far forward. He also (if you can sense a theme) loves to shoot from distance. But not only does he shoot from distance, he can score from distance with some absolute screamers (2 weeks ago against Man City, for example). 

Now onto data. Cash has had at least 1 SOT in his last 3 club matches as well as in his last 4 country matches. In his last 4 matches for Poland, he&#x27;s averaging 3 shots per match and 1.5 SOTs. This includes a goal in the reverse fixture at Netherlands in September. I see Cash continuing his streak and landing a shot on target here.

France had a pretty commanding 4-0 win. Mbappe scored twice, with the first being in the 55th minute. I also mentioned it might be a good idea to combine it with Olise to score or assist - and he did both (he won the penalty, and my bookmaker counts that as an assist). Easy win.

Top of the table AB play bottom of the league Helsingor.

FC Helsingor have scored in 8 of their last 10 games and were good last season - they&#x27;re not the hopeless away side we sometimes see at the foot of these lower leagues.

So far this season, plenty of games have had goals:

\- 87% of Helsingor games have gone over 2.5 goals (85% of home games)

\- 90% of AB games have gone over 2.5 goals (85% of away games)

Likewise, there are plenty of BTTS games.

\- 65% of AB games (69% of away games)

\- 67% of Helsingor games (62% of home games)

And the last six games are even more telling.

\- AB: 6/6 o2.5, and 5/6 BTTS

\- Helsingor: 5/6 for both o2.5 and BTTS

I&#x27;ve put a few different multis on this game, with versions of this along with AB to win. However, the best bet of the lot is the o2.5 and BTTS.</td></tr>

Fading Zverev in a high stake match (choker ptsd) against an inform *RECOVERED* *lol iNjUrY* Felix on favourable conditions and boasting a 78% win rate on IHC’s in 2025. He gets a set *more* than 61.4% of the time in this spot; back the leaf🇨🇦 
Whatever the opposite of *tldr* is: Only two logical matches to look at between these two. Their 2024 Miami member was on historically slow courts (35.5 CPI ((lowest of all HC 1000’s that year)). These conditions were way more favourable for Zverev. *However* Zverev also delivered an immaculate performance winning 93% of FS and a jaw dropping *100%* of SS. He of course didn’t face a single break point and delivered an impressive 11 winners to only 6 unforced errors (great numbers on such slow courts). Godly performance. Onto the next. 
Just over 2 month since their last meeting at the US Open. I couldn’t find the CPI but it’s much faster than 2024 Miami lol. Felix showed improvements and came through as a +275 underdog from a set down. Felix brought an aggressive game to Sascha blasting 50 winners to 35 UE’s. He found success with his serve +1 going 24/27 at the net. I think tomorrows match will play out similarly if Felix plays aggressive, rushes Zverev’s forehand and ends points quickly.</td></tr>

Teams: Vitality vs. Spirit  
Time: 5:30 AM EST.

**Writeup:**

* Vitality take on Spirit in the quarter final matchup tomorrow. Both teams have been looking incredibly shaky. Vitality who were most dominant run in recent time have really fallen off in level as of late. They have looked way weaker/less dominant, map pool has gotten worse, and they have struggled against much worse teams they previously would&#x27;ve dominated.
* Spirit on the other hand despite a fire power upgrade in adding tN1R have also struggled, their calling/overall strat book is just non existent. Watching them on some of their best maps is horrendous how all they can do is send donk to get a multi kill and if he can&#x27;t, they can&#x27;t do anything in rounds.
* Vitality are 3-0 in matches against Spirit and 7-1 in maps in 2025, however all of these games came from the first half of 2025 when Vitality was much more dominant. While I still favor Vitality, they are definitely in worse form then they were back then but I think on paper this is still a really good matchup for them

**Veto:**

* Spirit ban Inferno, Vitality ban Ancient
* Spirit <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> Mirage (chance of Train/Dust 2)

**Mirage Stats:**

* Spirit are 64% winrate on 11 maps of Mirage L3 months
* Vitality are 64% winrate on 11 maps of Mirage L3 months

**Player Stats:**

* Zywoo is averaging a .80 KPR L3 months
* Sh1ro is averaging a .80 KPR L3 months
* Both guys are AWPers, while they are both capable and strong on riflers especially Zywoo, their is a big advantage for AWPers on CT side (Defense) as it is the much better side in general for sniping/using the AWP. Since Map 1 is Spirit&#x27;s map <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, Zywoo will start on CT side
* Zywoo is averaging a .91 KPR L3 months on Mirage for Vitality with a .87 KPR in 2025. This is his best/strongest map. Since its Spirit&#x27;s map <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, Zywoo would start on CT side, he is averaging a .95 KPR on CT side of Mirage while averaging 1.18 kills per round win for Vitality
* Sh1ro is averaging a .80 KPR L3 months on Mirage for Vitality with a .78 KPR in 2025. This is an average/slightly lower map for him compared to some others in the pool. Sh1ro would start on T side which is much worse for AWPers. He averages a .67 KPR on T side on Mirage
* Zywoo is 7-1 in the h2h against Sh1ro in their h2h matches out fragging him 161-113 in h2h matches in 2025. Zywoo is 3-0 on Mirage h2h against Sh1ro beating him by an average of 6 kills per Mirage map they have played, and 1-0 on Dust 2, beating him by 8 kills on Dust 2</td></tr>

Yesterday’s Pick: (NBA) James Harden o27.5 PRA’s + David Pastrnak 1+ points (-198) ❌

***<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: (NBA) Nikola Jokic o8.5 rebounds + Devin Booker u46.5 PRA’s (-186) (ALT PROPS)***

Reasoning: Tough one from James Harden last night. He looked great early with 23 PRA at halftime but completely cooled off and finished with just 25 😔How he ended up with only 1 assist and didn’t score in the 2nd half… idk 🤷‍♂️ Frustrating result but we stick to the process and move forward. <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>, I like Nikola Jokic to grab at least 9 boards. He has eclipsed this line in all 3 games so far this year and 85% of his games last year. He also has a favorable matchup as he faces the Pelicans, who rank 29th in rebounds allowed this season. As for Devin Booker to go under 47 PRA’s, he has the Memphis Grizzlies who give up the least amount of PRA’s to point guards this season. Booker went under 47 PRA’s in 85% of his games last year and is 75% of his games so far this year. Yes, last years numbers might be skewed due to Durant not being on the team, however the Suns are looking fully healthy tonight with Jalen Green quite possibly making his Suns debut (which would dig into Booker’s usage rate) With that being said, let’s bounce back with a Jokic/Booker parlay 💪</td></tr>

Marseille vs Angers. Marseille -1.5 (-140)

Marseille are on a hot streak at the Vélodrome, winning all five home games this season across competitions with a staggering 20-4 aggregate score—scoring at least three goals in four of them. In Ligue 1 alone, they&#x27;ve netted 15 goals in their last five matches overall, averaging over 2.3 per game, led by Mason Greenwood (9 goals, 4 assists) and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (3 goals).

Despite recent away slips (2-1 losses to Sporting Lisbon in Champions League and Lens in Ligue 1), they&#x27;ve won their last eight Ligue 1 home games when leading at halftime and scored in nine straight home league outings. This setup screams a bounce-back with goals aplenty against a porous defense.</td></tr>

PROFIT/LOSS = -1u

PREVIOUS BET = Aston Villa -1.5 vs GA Eagles

RESULT = Big L. Villa should of been 5-0 up before HT but did not take there chances and in the end it came back to bite them as they lost 2-1 after being 1-0 up and then they go and beat Man City at the weekend. Sums our luck up.

TODAYS BET:

EVENTS: Palace o0.5 goals + to qualify + Marseille ML (5u @ 1.95)

It&#x27;s a late <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> as I only fancied this after I saw the abysmal team Liverpool have fielded and I&#x27;m not even talking solely about the starting XI. I am talking the bench. It consists of players wearing the shirt numbers 94 all the way to 99. The only starting XI player to keep his position in the side is Kerkez (the LB) who tonight is playing CDM. 

Palace however field 80% of there usual starting XI with there top goalscorer on the bench at least. I genuinely have laddered this play along with Palace ML, -1.5, -2.5 and -3.5 the Liverpool team is that poor. Palace are Liverpools bogey side also to make it worse for them.

Marseille is self explanatory. They are in top form and are playing a side who are yet to win away.

I personally have staked 10u I am that confident on this however I&#x27;m not sure if that much is allowed on here so I will stick to 5u.</td></tr>

Cavaliers have the celtics phone number, they are 5-1 against Boston. Donavan Mitchell will feast. The whole team is gonna eat. And with no tatum to back them up, should be an easy cover.  Nobody cares that the celtics are at home. 

Other <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> is middle state Tennessee, the spread stated at +6.5, we got all the top cappers taking them at +4. I think this game will be down to a field goal, take the home teams to cover the +4 spread.

Reason: Newly promoted Paris have made a decent start to the season, but they have lost their past 2 league games.

Lyon ended a 2 game losing run in the league with a win over Strasbourg during the weekend and will look to build on that with a victory here. Prior to those 2 games, they were one of the form teams, having won 7 of their 8 games in all competitions.

It’s safe to say these two do not like each other after their last encounter at the Phoenix Challenger, which ended with Bublik offering to meet Moutet outside to fight 😂

This should be an exciting and emotional matchup — both are crafty and unpredictable, but I expect pride to play a major factor here.

Bublik is the more talented player and the bigger hitter, and he’s already 3–0 vs Moutet head-to-head. Given the bad blood, his serve, and his shot-making advantage, I like Bublik to handle business and cover the -2 spread.

NBA - SUNS VS GRIZZLIES

* 5 UNIDADES

Los Suns han sido aplastados por sus bases, permitiendo que Zach LaVine y James Harden anotaran más de 30 puntos, y Keynote George consiguió 26 en el último partido.  
  
Y Ja es MEJOR ANOTADOR que todos ellos y debería recuperarse enormemente después de su 8/23 en tiros de campo en el último partido y de no haber alcanzado esta línea en 3 partidos consecutivos.  
  
Lo que convierte esto en un escenario perfecto, ya que los Suns no tienen ni un solo defensor que pueda frenar a Ja, razón por la cual ha superado esta línea en 6 partidos consecutivos contra los Suns.  
  
Incluyendo sus dos últimos partidos con 29 y 29 puntos contra ellos, y con anotadores mucho peores superando esta línea contra los Suns, este es un enfrentamiento perfecto para que Ja se recupere.</td></tr>

Past <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Lamelo Ball o7 Rbs

Recap: This one hit pretty fast but surprisingly Ball still had fewer rebounds than I expected. I think the reasoning was pretty sound so we’ll take this win and move onto another rebound <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> because those are sort of fun.


Game: Kings @ Bulls 8:00pm EST

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Josh Giddey u8.5 Rbs, +101, 1u -&gt; 2.01u

Reasoning: Giddey has been leading the league in rebounds for guards. Against the Bulls Giddey had 14 assists, however, this is against the Hawks, a relatively poor rebounding team. The game against the kings I expect a brawl of rebounds between Sabonis and Vucevic, making offensive rebounds harder to come by as well as defensive rebounds. Giddey’s stats have been inflated by his game against the Hawks</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>**: Over 17.5 games (-120) | 3u ✅

Tough loss last POTD, vintage Wawrinka came to play.

Anyways, back to Basel, we have #2 Sinner taking on #41 Bergs. Surprisingly, these two have never matched up before.

I think this line is insultingly low for a player of Berg&#x27;s calibre. If this was clay or slow outdoor hard, I would understand, but not for fast indoor hard. Sinner is 5-0 on indoor hard this season, but only one of those matches has finished in under 17.5 games (against Altmaier). On average, Sinner&#x27;s matches finished in 21 games. 

In addition, Bergs is playing pretty well with a 6-2 indoor hard record this season. Looking at his recent losses, none of them were in less than 17.5 games, including a 21-game loss to Djokovic in Shanghai.

Sorry for the super last minute post. Feeling pretty good about this one. Lets get back in the win column!

NBA | Nets vs Hawks | 🏀  

Insane amount of assists sold by his teammates including two breakaways with missed layups from Ellis and LaVine.. Feel good about the read tho, on another day those goes in and he’d have 7-8 assists instead. We move

MPJ is over this line in 3/4 games this season avg 9.0 RA per game on 16.1 RA chances per game, with the sole miss being a 28 blowout loss to the Rockets where he only played 28 minutes and finished with 6 RA. MPJ has a different role in Nets obviously and has taken his passing role up a notch, 2+ assists in every game so far and 34.8 passes made per game where he’s avg 5.8 potentials.

Activity on the glass is always there with him and with Claxton facing Porzingis I love this matchup for Porter Jr who should be in great positions for the rebounds, avg 5.5 rebounds per game on 10.3 rebound chances per game.

Game should be closer tonight than the Rockets game and MPJ should be in for 30+ minutes, just need him to convert less half of those chances to stats to be green. 

No lines available for me last night so I apologise for not getting this out earlier, 8.5 is okay with me too but not higher than that.</td></tr>

Lot of great games to <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> from <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>, but going to keep it simple here. Zach returns to Chicago and coming into this game he has exceeded this line in each of his 4 games this season. In fact he has gone over 30 in each of those games. It is a B2B for the Kings, but I think that favors Zach who is much fitter and younger than many of his teammates (scorers like Russ, DeMar). In a high scoring game with the total set to near 240, and Zach’s amazing form so far, and the dynamics of a B2B, I will make this my first 5U <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> of the season.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: NBA Orlando Magic v Detroit Pistons 
1U Jalen Suggs O1.5 FTM @ $1.86 (-116 American), B365 

Write Up: 
Just a quick admin comment as I know people here love to get huffy about this stuff - I had added only 0.8 when my 1st Pritchard bet won instead of 0.83, hence the minor adjustment from yesterday to get to 4.98U <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark>. I only double checked this when I looked at the <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> tracker sheet yesterday and saw it had me at 4.12U, not 4.09U. For clarity, here are the results of my posted bets so far starting from most recent: 

Embiid 1Q P +0.86U 
Pritchard FTA +0.95U 
Pritchard FTA +0.83U
Maxey FTA +0.8U 
Wemby P +0.86U 
Green TO -1U 
Thompson F +0.68U 
Reaves FTA +1U 

Adding up to +4.98U. 

Onto <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> - the Pistons are giving up 34.8 free throws a game (2nd in the league), from 28.3 fouls a game (=1st in the league), which is enough on average to end every quarter in the bonus, allowing for easy free throw opportunities. In addition, the Magic are taking 35.8 free throws a game, a league high. Obviously small sample size, but it bodes well.

Suggs saw a career high minutes per game last year, and averaged a career high FTA to go with it (3.1). He is a career shooter of around 77%. He finished the last 15 games he played last year averaging 3.5 FTA. He covered this line 23/35 times (65.7%) last year, and at these odds we would need him to cover 54% of the time to be a profit if we reliably bet him every game with same unit, same odds. He has been on a minutes restriction to start this year after knee surgery, but has slowly been building minutes - 17, 19, 21, and in the 21 minute game he shot 4 free throws, making 3. This is more what I’m expecting. 

The Pistons foul issues I mentioned before - Holland, Cunningham &amp; Thompson probably the key ones here with Suggs, but the likes of Duren &amp; Harris will help put the Magic into the bonus and give us a chance. 

The game is expected to be close, with the ML odds close to even &amp; the line just -1.0, so there’s a reasonable possibility of deliberate late fouls for FT attempts. Additionally, the points line is 225 so can reasonably expect a score around 115-110 or closer, with the Magic averaging around 113 points per game. 

Issues here are that Suggs is still playing limited minutes, and Banchero is taking bulk of the FTs anyway. Banchero is a bit of a ball hog &amp; can slow the game down I think - hopefully Suggs building minutes starts to change this. There’s a chance with around 20 minutes Suggs also doesn’t play too much of a playmaking &amp; driving role, which are the plays that would give him the best opportunity to receive FTs. Some things to consider.</td></tr>

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Todays Pick</mark>:** Le Havre - Brest  
**Over 2.5 goals**


**Odds:** $1.90


**Wager:** 2 Units


**When:** 8 hours from post


**Why:**


Honestly, Le Havre vs Brest is shaping up to be full of goals. Both teams love giving away goals. Le Havre at home concedes like it’s a fulltime job, and Brest aren’t much better on the road. At the same time, both can actually score, so we’re not talking about a boring 0‑0 shitter. Their recent head-to-heads suggest plenty of goals.
Expect Le Havre to push forward at home, Brest to try their fancy counter attacks, and boom, bang three goals or more is probably happening. If you’re hoping for a quiet night in, this isn’t it.</td></tr>

I must say that I see it as a positive to get close everytime as it shows we&#x27;re not far off with the picks. Thanks for all the positive comments guys, really do appreciate it!

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>:** ***Hearts to win @ 1.79 -- 3 units***

**Write up:**

For <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> we are going back to the leaders of the Scottish Premiership, Hearts. This weekend they won against Celtic when I put them at Hearts or Draw. Arsenal let us down in that parlay but the confidence in Hearts grew for me. And with a struggling St. Mirren side that only managed to claim 9 points in 9 matches, this should be a pretty straight forward win for Hearts. St. Mirren has lost their last 3 matches and Hearts is on a roll!

Come on good old Hearts!

Best of luck if tailing! 🍀

Anyway, Bologna is still undefeated at home this season in Serie A, winning their 3 home games this year; only receiving one goal in those three games. No injuries for them other than Immobile, on the flip side; Torino has only won one away game this season and sit 12th on the table.

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Inter - Fiorentina | Over 2.5 Goals @ 1.75 for 1 unit | Book: Betano

⸻

Write Up:
Am on a little run with 4 straight wins and want to keep that up. 

If you’re looking for ninety minutes of defensive discipline, you might want to sit this one out — because Inter vs Fiorentina rarely believes in moderation.

Let’s start with the data before we romanticize it.
Across the last five league games, Inter have averaged 2.34 xG for / 1.25 xG against, Fiorentina 1.91 xG for / 1.48 xG against.
That’s a combined 3.3 xG per match, basically screaming “we should be seeing goals.”
Between them, they’ve created 26 Big Chances and conceded 23 in that same window — both teams live in the penalty area like it’s rent-free.

Inter at home have turned San Siro into a high-tempo shooting range: 3.6 xG average total per game, 8 of their last 10 matches went Over 2.5.
They push both wing-backs so high it sometimes feels like they’re running a 2-3-5.
It’s great for chance creation, less great for keeping the defensive line tidy.

Fiorentina, on the other hand, approach away games like a dare.
They press high, swarm the ball, and often end up in those end-to-end exchanges that look fantastic until they realize half their midfield is still jogging back.
Their away fixtures average 3.1 xG total, and seven of their last ten have cleared the Over 2.5 line.

Put those two together, and you basically get an Italian version of a basketball game — just with nicer haircuts.
Both sides like to force turnovers in the middle third, both transition fast, and neither are particularly conservative once the first goal lands.

Weather check? Clear Milan night, 13 °C, dry pitch — perfect for quick passing and sharp transitions.
That means every misplaced press or lazy clearance has a good chance of turning into an immediate counter.

What really tips this toward the Over though isn’t just the averages — it’s tempo rhythm.
When Inter play at home, the ball spends an average of only 39 seconds per possession sequence before a shot or turnover occurs (Sofascore tempo data), which is one of the fastest in Serie A.
Fiorentina rank top 3 in “progressive runs per match” and have been involved in the most high-xG games (&gt; 3.0) in the league this month.

Both sides are happy to trade shots if it means maintaining pressure.
Statistically, in Serie A this season, matches with both teams above 1.5 xG per 90 produce goals in bunches — 73 % of those games go Over 2.5.
This one fits the bill perfectly.

So yeah, if it somehow ends 0-0, I’ll personally light a candle for every wasted expected goal in Milano.
But based on the data, flow, and chaos levels these two bring — this should be fast, frantic, and fun.

I’m riding Over 2.5 Goals @ 1.75 for 1 unit.
And if it cashes, I’ll raise an espresso to Serie A’s ongoing refusal to play boring football. No kidding, currently it’s the most fun league to watch for neutral football fans.

BOL!</td></tr>
<tr><td class='post'>Record: 4-7 (-6u)

NBA: Kings vs Bulls (8pm EST) and Pacers vs Mavericks (8:30 pm EST)\\

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: (5u) Anthony Davis 10+ rebounds and Domantas Sabonis 12+ rebounds (FD -114)**

Sabonis has been dominant on the glass and has grabbed 12+ rebounds every game vs the bulls except one (L7/8) while on the kings. He has 14+ rebounds in 6 of those 8 as well. Sabonis has also covered this line every game so far this season.   
In the other game we have a very injured Mavs team going against a very injured Pacers team. On the Mavs we have Gafford out and Lively housing a doubtful tag. With those 2 out, Anthony Davis will most likely move to the 5 and have more rebound opportunities. On the Pacers we have a committee of Isaiah Jackson, Tony Bradley, and Jay Huff all splitting minutes at center. This group along with the rest of the team has given up the most rebounds to opposing teams so far this season. My only concern is if this game becomes a blowout and they bench AD but the mavs have not looked too great to start the season. As long as this game stays relatively close and AD gets 35+ min he should get 10 rebounds.</td></tr>

**Previous <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>** - Jaume Munar ML vs Daniil Medvedev (+200) 2 units ❌

I can’t be too mad at that. It was a solely value based play, and just didn’t hit. I expected Medvedev to probably win, but at +200 I felt that it was worth action at a low unit size because of the analysis I laid out. Munar was dreadful and Meddy played very well. He also injured his hand early on, needing a medical timeout for it, which might have contributed. Can’t predict that. On to the next—and I’ll focus on finding big plus odds plays that I’m more confident in being winners, like my first <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>. It was only a bad <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> in hindsight, but still, I can do better. 

**<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>** - Valentin Vacherot ML vs Arthur Rinderknech + over 22.5 games (+200) 2 units ✅

**Paris Masters 6:00AM EST**

The highly anticipated rematch of the Shanghai Masters is here, with cousin battling cousin. Vacherot won the Shanghai Masters final against Rinderknech in 3 sets. 

These two have been on a tear, both had incredible runs to the Shanghai final, beating top players as dogs in almost every round. Vacherot’s run to the final was a bit more impressive, considering he had to go through 2 rounds of qualifying and beat Djokovic, Rune, Bublik, Griekspoor, and others. Rinderknech also defeated an absolute gauntlet including Zverev, FAA, and Medvedev to reach the final.

Vacherot won (4-6, 6-3, 6-3) in the final. He served better winning 78% of his first serves and 74% of his second serves compared to 68% and 54% respectively for Rinderknech. Another stat that stood out to me was that Vacherot went 3/14 on break points while Rinderknech went only 1/1. Vacherot forced 14 BPs and could have won the match more convincingly if he’d been more efficient. Credit to Rinderknech for saving them though, but it shows that Vacherot was the better player.

Here in Paris, both of them won their first-round match in straight sets, but it was Vacherot who was again more impressive, destroying Jiri Lehecka (6-1, 6-3). Just giving the world #18 no hope at all. Rinderknech required two tiebreakers to win his against the world #48 Marozsan. Still a good straight sets win though.

Rinderknech will want to avenge his loss in Shanghai, especially considering his familial relationship to his opponent, and he’ll have the home crowd support (Vacherot is from Monaco). It’ll be a boost, and why I think he won’t get rolled in two.

I expect another great match — probably another 3 setter, but Vacherot is looking too powerful right now to not win again. He dismantled Lehecka, and his run of unreal form is clearly not over. Over 22.5 games covers the possibility of a (6-4, 7-6) etc… two setter win and a 3 set win ofc too. 

Don’t bet more than you can afford, and keep in mind that it is a long odds <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>, although I like it quite a bit.</td></tr>

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: Medvedev ML + Khachanov to Win a Set @ 1.61 (-165), 3u

Write-Up:

👉 Medvedev ML
Medvedev’s in great form after taking the title in Almaty and started strong in Paris — easy win, looked comfortable. His game fits these indoor courts perfectly.
He’s also got a solid head-to-head vs Dimitrov; Grigor usually can’t really hurt him.
As long as Daniil keeps his usual consistency on serve and return, this should be a pretty routine win.

👉 Khachanov to Win a Set
Khachanov’s always been solid indoors — big serve, heavy groundstrokes, and he’s actually lifted the trophy here before.
Fonseca just had a long week in Basel and didn’t get much rest, which could definitely show here.
With Khachanov’s rhythm and experience, I like his chances to grab at least a set. Shouldn’t have much trouble doing that.

The bookies are giving us yet another plus money opportunity that has some serious value here.

The Raps are allowing opponents to dominate the glass recently. Jakob Poeltl (their primary rim protector and rebounder) is listed as doubtful with persistent lower back tightness. 

Sengun is built for this exact matchup. He averaged 10.3 reb per game last season and has already shown his rebounding capabilities this season. With Poeltl either out or gutted by injury limitations Raps will need to throw bodies at him but they lack the interior presence to do it effectively.

When the Raptors are struggling defensively (they are), Rockets a fairly good team won’t need to play desperation offense. Rockets should be able to control pace and establish rhythm here. **If we get a script like this then Sengun should clear this line easily.**
 
Be aware if Poeltl is ruled out before tipoff expect this line to potentially move considerably.

<tr><td class='post'>**POTD Record 36-33-1**

We’re coming off an easy Heat win, even with Norman Powell (Miami’s leading scorer) sidelined. That one was never really competitive past halftime and that’s how you know we’re seeing the board clearly right now.

Like I said in my last post, I’m starting to feel a streak coming. The board’s starting to make a whole lot of sense. A lot of these early-season lines feel like they’re still built off last year’s data and outdated player/team evaluations. The sample size is small, and Vegas seems stuck in last spring. I’m not. My reads are part numbers, part watching way too much basketball and knowing how these rosters actually operate in real life. And tonight, that radar locked straight onto one game which yes, I’m Biased. But I’m Also Right (I hope)

**Cavs –4**

If you’ve followed me for a minute, you know I’m a lifelong Cavs fan. So yeah, there’s bias baked in. But this <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> isn’t blind faith, it’s conviction with backup.

I mean did Vegas not watch what Cleveland just did to Detroit? They dismantled the Pistons 116-95 and looked every bit like the defensive powerhouse they’re supposed to be . Sure, they’re missing players, but this roster is loaded with size, length, and experience.

Jarrett Allen and Evan Mobley are about to have a field day against Boston’s bigs. Let’s be honest: Queta and Garza are solid G-League-plus guys, but going up against one of the league’s best frontcourts? No shot. Allen and Mobley should own the paint and the glass.

Last season Cleveland posted the NBA’s top offensive efficiency (121 ORtg) . Through this young season, they’ve maintained a top-five defensive rating, holding teams like Detroit under 100. Boston, meanwhile, ranks near the bottom five in offensive metrics so far. 

Cavs finished top-three in opponent three-point percentage last year, and it’s carried over. That matters because Boston’s only path to covering this is to get absurdly hot from deep  and the Cavs are built to choke that off. I am not going to lie, that part does scare me some, as I do not expect Boston to be this cold all season, but don&#x27;t believe that trend will change tomorrow.

Cleveland averages 45+ rebounds per game , fifth in the league last season, with two elite rim protectors. Like I mentioned at the top, Boston has no interior presence whatsoever .

Donovan Mitchell is in full heater mode at 31.3 PPG, while Mobley is averaging 18 and 9 . Boston’s leading scorer, Jaylen Brown, sits around 29 PPG, but with Tatum out all season , he’s getting blitzed on every possession, and will continue to be. 

Boston’s offense has been ugly to start the year around 105 PPG on 43% shooting and it’s not getting better against this Cavs defense. Cleveland ranks top-five in opponent effective field-goal percentage and just held Detroit under 95 points with pure physicality.

Even without Garland (out all season so far) and Merrill (out tomorrow), the Cavs have Lonzo Ball returning (doesn&#x27;t play back to backs), which helps stabilize the backcourt. He’s not the shooter those guys are, but he brings pace control and defense. When paired with Mitchell, it’s enough to keep the offense humming while locking down Boston’s guards.

Cleveland opened around –2.5, but sharp action quickly pushed it to –3.5/–4 . Roughly 80% of handle is backing the Cavs . Usually, I’d be cautious when the public piles on, but in this case, it’s aligned with the data. Boston’s simply overvalued here because of brand recognition not production. I have felt this way about a lot of Boston&#x27;s games so far (1-3 ATS), and have to pounce on it tomorrow. 

I actually think Cleveland’s opening loss to New York might’ve been a blessing. That gut-check woke them up after last year’s disappointing playoff exit to Indy, and the year prior to the Knicks. They’ve been laser-focused since, and woke up the dog in them. 

Boston, meanwhile, still looks lost without its stars. You can see the chemistry gap passes off-timing, bad rotations, no half-court rhythm. Yes they have good players, so in no way am predicting a blowout, however I think there is a higher chance of that then Cleveland losing this game.

If Boston starts cold again from three (they’ve been shooting 30% from deep this year), this could get ugly fast.

I expect a competitive first half, then the Cavs pull away when Boston’s bench inevitably collapses under the size and pressure. Mitchell will stay hot, Mobley and Allen will control the paint, and the Celtics’ offense will sputter out around 105.

The bias? Yeah, it’s there. But fuck it, let’s ride.

Celtic’s attack is usually strong, yet in their last five matches, only two have gone over 3.5 goals, showing some inconsistency in high-scoring outcomes. Still, playing at home, they average around 3 goals per game and often dominate possession and chances. Falkirk, meanwhile, have scored in most of their recent fixtures but tend to concede when facing top-tier opposition. If Celtic find rhythm early, this could open up, though Falkirk’s defensive setup might slow things down. Over 3.5 goals remains possible.</td></tr>

**Write-Up:**  
I’m backing the 17-year-old phenom João Fonseca to upset Khachanov at plus money. Fonseca’s confidence and shot-making have been on full display lately — his serve has become a real weapon, and he’s consistently dictating points with pace and depth off both wings. Khachanov, meanwhile, has been inconsistent since returning from injury, often struggling to close out tight sets and showing vulnerability against aggressive baseliners. Fonseca’s energy and movement should give him the edge in extended rallies, and in indoor conditions that reward first-strike tennis, his fearless approach can pay off big. At +105, this line undervalues the form and momentum Fonseca brings into this match.</td></tr>

Sport | NCAAF - 8:00pm EST - FIU at Missouri St

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Kejon Owens (FIU) OVER 93.5 rushing yards (-114 FanDuel) 3 units

Write Up: Owens ranks fourth in the country in rushing yards with 824 yards and seven touchdowns through six games. At 7.0 yards per carry, Owens only needs around 14 average touches to eclipse the 93.5-yard threshold. However I expect to see a few big chunk runs to help get past this line. Kejon has shown he can break tackles and create explosive plays, which is what you need when targeting a rushing prop in the 90 yard range.

The matchup against Missouri State favors Owens continuing his season production. Missouri State&#x27;s defense is allowing 141 rushing yards per game this season, landing them as just an average run D. When you put a top-five national rusher against an average run defense, the numbers favor the offensive player. With the tight spread I expect both teams to stick to their game script this will allow Kejon to get his typical 18-20 carries.

Unlike tonight with Alonza Barnett/JMU, FIU is not putting up big passing numbers, with quarterback Keyone Jenkins completing 127 of 201 passes for 1,255 yards, making it clear the offense runs through Owens. Game script works in his favor as FIU will establish the run early and often. Owens should post another big performance and exceed 93.5 yards against a Missouri State defense that has not shown the ability to contain most rushing attacks.

Prediction: Kejon Owens: 20 carries, 126 yards, and 1 touchdown</td></tr>

Todays <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark>: **Bologna v Torino: Bologna or Draw DC + o1.5 total goals + o2.5 total cards @1.91**

Bad two picks from me.  I will now go for something very safe.  Bologna have been excellent at home lately and continue to find the net with confidence. Their attack looks fluid, and their recent scoring form supports the idea that there will be at least two goals in this match. Torino, on the other hand, struggle to keep clean sheets away from home, often conceding under pressure. The head-to-head record between these two sides usually produces open games with chances at both ends, making over 1.5 goals a very reasonable expectation. Given Bologna’s home advantage and current rhythm, taking them on the double chance adds a strong safety net to your <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>.

The nature of this fixture also leans toward physical, competitive football. Both teams like to press and disrupt play, which typically results in plenty of fouls and frustration building up through the game. Torino’s defensive style often forces them into late tackles, while Bologna’s midfield aggression ensures the contest doesn’t stay calm for long. That mix tends to bring out the cards, and surpassing 2.5 in total is a realistic outcome. Combining Bologna or draw, over 1.5 goals, and over 2.5 cards makes this a balanced, high-probability bet built on both form and matchup dynamics.

Best of luck.</td></tr>

Chelsea create nearly double the xG and have far greater depth even if they rotate. Wolves may limit rotation to avoid injuries, but the value on Chelsea to win and over 1.5 goals remains solid given the gulf in quality and form.

**Writeup:** *As per request, I&#x27;ve added an event label to help those not familiar with US sports locate my plays!*

*Death, taxes, and the Celtics killer covering his lines against the Celtics.*

*DM has covered this line in 10 out of the last 11 games vs the Celtics, averaging 30.8 points and 4.9 boards across 20 career meetings (\~35.7 P+R), and he’s posted multiple 30–40 point nights versus them in the past two seasons.* 

*With Cleveland down two starters—Darius Garland (toe) and Max Strus (foot)—plus Sam Merrill (hip), Mitchell’s on-ball load consolidates, and he’s already opened the season at 31.3 PPG with \~33+ P+R in 33 minutes per game.* 

 *Boston’s roster context also tilts toward volume for him: the Celtics are without Jayson Tatum (Achilles), and they moved Jrue Holiday and Kristaps Porziņģis this summer, leaving Derrick White/Jaylen Brown (hamstring GTD) and Simons as the primary perimeter stoppers and less backline deterrence than last year.* 

 *Coaching and team trends align, too—Kenny Atkinson (2025 Coach of the Year) has Cleveland playing fast and efficient since last season (No. 1 in scoring at 121.9 PPG in 2024-25).*

*Celtics are giving up the 9th most points to SGs on the year and the MOST rebounds, allowing VJ Edgecomb, Josh Hart, and Jordan Poole to smash their lines against them.*

*With a competitive spread of +/- 4.5 and a respectable game total, expect Mitchell to steal a major slice of the pie.*</td></tr>

Last Pick: Rafael Jódar to win 2-0 vs Murphy Cassone (+125, 1 unit): Win 

Tennis | Charlottesville Challenger | 11:30 AM EST (estimated)

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Jay Clarke vs Dylan Dietrich | Dietrich ML at +135 (MGM). 1 unit. 

Write-up: Jodar closed around -120. The match one was a bit more competitive than I expected, as Jodar was actually down a break for the majority of the second set (and even faced a break point at 1-3, but it felt like he was able to get his nose into all of Cassone&#x27;s service games. For that reason, it wasn&#x27;t a huge surprise to see him break back with Murphy serving for the set and roll from there.

Jodar might be an exceptional player, but he wasn&#x27;t the only one behind Virginia&#x27;s success (9-4 record in competitive conference and NCAA tournament QF appearance) last season. <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>, I&#x27;m actually going with another strong Virginia player, Dylan Dietrich, to get a win on familiar grounds. Last year, Dietrich played at either #2 or #1 in the lineup depending on whether Jodar was available. He put together a really nice dual season (6-3 at No. 1, 12-2 at No. 2) that led to him being ranked at #9 in the ITA&#x27;s preseason ranking for this year. He was especially strong at home, where he scored wins over ITA #2 Sebastian Gorzny, #11 Aidan Kim, and #6 Jay Friend. All of that is to say that his current ranking of #1172 in the world is in no way representative of his playing ability. 

Dylan already got off to a strong start here in Charlottesville, defeating world No. 318 Alfredo Perez in straight sets (7.04 performance rating) after being pushed down to 2.20 from a 2.70 opening price. That match serves as a useful comparison, since he&#x27;s being priced similarly to his closing odds here. Similar to Jodar, I feel that Dietrich has a very strong indoor game. He&#x27;s definitely not as stable from the baseline from Rafa; however, he stands at 6&#x27;5&quot; and possesses a massive serve that produced 11 aces and a 9.0 shot quality rating in that match. 

Meanwhile, Jay Clarke had an absolutely horrific start to the season, but was able to rebuild his form by playing some ITFs. However, he&#x27;s not really your average Brit in that his strongest career results (including this season) have come on clay, not fast indoor hard courts. He got a solid first-round win over Tyler Zink (7.12 performance rating); however, the fact that he was priced as a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark>&#x27;em in that match isn&#x27;t a great sign of the market&#x27;s confidence in him (Zink had one big run in Tiburon, but his Challenger results haven&#x27;t been too great outside of that). Going back to the Perez match, I feel that Clarke is the slightly weaker player compared to Alfredo, who has recently taken sets off guys like Abdullah Shelbayh and Michael Zheng. 

Overall, this match feels like a toss-up to me, so I like Dietrich at plus money. Clarke&#x27;s biggest asset is his heavy topspin forehand, which doesn&#x27;t work as well on this surface, and Dylan&#x27;s game should be better suited to these conditions. Prices on this play vary quite a bit across books - I would take it down to +120/2.20 or so, but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s value beyond that.

Write up: two solid 1 win teams, the rockets put up 137 in an angry outing last game along with the raptors who have held their own despite losing competitive games to the Mavs then having to play in a tough b2b spot. I know their opponents have shot a ridiculous 55% average but still it’s become defense issues at this point due to their high pace and turnovers. The rockets allow the second worst most attempted field goals per game. The raptors will be hungry for a win in front of their home crowd. But so will the rockets. As they are still 1-2 and won’t want to fall to 1-3. I believe this will go over.</td></tr>

I’m going with **under 2.5 goals** for Parma vs Roma because both teams usually play cautious football. Parma tend to sit deep and defend in numbers, while Roma prefer controlling the game rather than rushing forward. Neither side creates many clear chances, so it’s likely to be a tight, low-scoring match.</td></tr>

The Gamecocks rank near the top of C-USA in rushing yards per game, while the Blue Raiders are bottom-tier in first-half scoring and red-zone defense. Expect JSU to own time of possession, dominate the trenches, and take a 7–10 point lead into the locker room.</td></tr>

Donovan Mitchell OVER 27.5 Points (-112 FD)

Cleveland Cavaliers @ Boston Celtics 
(7 PM)
Anaysis :  

Mitchell has absolutely torched the Celtics in past matchups, clearing this line in 9 straight games against them (100% hit rate) while averaging 33.0 points per game over that stretch. And those were all with Garland active.

Across those 9 meetings, Mitchell averaged 37.8 minutes and 23.7 FGA. In games where he logs 36+ minutes on 22+ FGA, he’s gone over in 24 of his last 28.

The Celtics have struggled to contain guards this season, allowing 3 of 4 to smash their lines: ⬇️

Jordan Poole – 22 PTS (Line: 20.5)
Jalen Brunson – 31 PTS (Line: 24.5)
Tyrese Maxey – 40 PTS (Line: 25.5)

With this game expected to stay close (Cavs -4.5), Mitchell should see heavy minutes and strong usage. And with Sam Merrill out, Cleveland’s guard depth is thin, meaning Donovan should have the green light all night</td></tr>

Last Pick: Lecce +3 corner handicap vs Napoli ✅

Event: SPFL (Scottish Premiership) ⚽️

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick of the Day</mark>: Motherwell U1.5 cards vs Dundee United 4U @ 2.37 (Bet365)

Write-up: Napoli keep their place at the top of the league but were truly made to work for it. Napoli had two quick corners around the 15th minute in a first half pretty poor of opportunities despite Lecce being incapable of keeping the ball. The Giallorossi then started the second half much better than their opponents winning two corners shortly and Camarda missed a penalty. Napoli then brought on their rested big guns in Mctominay and Hojlund to regain conrol, taking the lead shortly after through Anguissa. This coincided with the corner count ending 5-3 to the Napolitans with late heartbreak for those on the +2 handicap that the line moved to after they were afforded a 95th minute corner.

Motherwell find themselves mid-table in 7th spot and defeated Livingston at the last minute in their previous match. They also are into the Scottish League Cup semis where they’ll face off against St.Mirren in a couple of days. Since Askou took over the club in June the steelemen have been playing some nice attacking football and have averaged just 1 card per match this season. On the other hand Dundee United are in fourth spot, ahead of Rangers in what has been a strange season where Hearts are well clear of Celtic and the Gers. They tend to be quite aggressive, averaging 3 cards per match this year. Those stats are in line with referee of the day Chris Graham who has averaged 3.9 cards over his career in Scotland (4.3 this season though the sample size is very small). Using all the stats I have I get a mean of 1.1 yellows for Motherwell.

That gives this play an estimated 72% chance of winning. Honestly I’m quite surprised at the odds as they’ve covered this line in 7/10 matches this season. Obviously it’s quite risky as a red card would kill the bet and in general there isn’t much lee-way but the value is too good to ignore for me so will assume the risk that comes with it. BOL !

**KEPCO - Hyundai Capital**
South Korea 🏐V League ⏳9 Hour

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: **Hyundai Capital -1.5 Set Handicap** @ 1.65

Hyundai Capital has retained its champions from last season and, on top of that, re-signed Leo (Leonardo Leyva). Keeping last season&#x27;s MVP maintains their attacking ceiling. National-level outside player Lim Sung-jin left for KB Insurance during the April FA season; this departure has weakened KEPCO&#x27;s wing scoring. KEPCO&#x27;s revision in wing scoring and their 0-3 performance in the opening week, combined with Hyundai&#x27;s serve-blocking dominance, could tip the balance in the early sets. Hyundai&#x27;s side is reasonable in this match; my scoreline is 3-1 Hyundai. The risk is that KEPCO&#x27;s new outsider might steal a set in a &quot;warm-up&quot; scenario, but Hyundai&#x27;s passing and blocking discipline throughout the match favor them.</td></tr>

Yesterday&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Thun v Winterthur. Thun (-1.0 &amp;-1.5) Asian Handicap. 3u @ $1.87 ✅ 

I&#x27;m writing this as the game goes on. So apologies for any tense jumping...

Thun started really well, scoring two goals within the first 36 minutes. However, three minutes after their second goal, they copped a straight red card, so they played 50+ minutes with 10 men. 

Winterthur dominated possession in the second half - but the shot count was pretty even. As the half went on, though, Thun dominated the xG stat, even though they had next to no possession—which is precisely what you want when you&#x27;re a man down and in a winning position.... Give away limited decent chances, and hit them on the break when you do have the ball. 

Thun even had a great chance in the 78th minute to make it 3-0, which would have given some breathing room. 

However, Thun then scored a couple of minutes later to make it 3-0 with under 10 minutes left.

Thun held out for the rest of the game to win 3-0. Was unsure how we&#x27;d go with this once the red card happened, but a good win for us. 

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Today</mark>&#x27;s <mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Roma to beat Parma and u3.5 total goals. 3u @ $2.05

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark>: Off to Italy <mark style='background:#fff59d'>today</mark> as 15th-placed Parma travel to Rome to play 2nd-placed Roma.

Most of the time, I would be all about the 2nd-place team comfortably beating the 15th-place team at home... And I&#x27;m not against that... But I like the u3.5 goals here. 

Now, you could say a lot of things against Gasperini&#x27;s Atalanta, but you wouldn&#x27;t say they played boring games. 

At Roma, though, his side looks a little different. There are a hell of a lot fewer chances. Parma are not much different.

Both teams have played 8 games in Serie A this season. 

Roma matches have had 11 total goals.

Parma matches have had 10 total goals

Roma have scored eight goals and won six games. Now, that&#x27;s efficiency.

It&#x27;s not like they&#x27;ve been smashing xG and missing goals either; they&#x27;re 9th in the league for expected goals with an even 10 in 8 games. 

It&#x27;s their defensive work that&#x27;s put them in second so far; they&#x27;ve conceded 3 goals this season off a league-beating 7.0 expected goals.

Parma games have been super tight, but very low scoring too. 

Parma have only scored three goals in their games so far off their 6.6 expected goals. 

On top of that, none of their goals scored have been away from home.

However, they&#x27;ve only conceded seven goals themselves. Parma have the 7th best defence xG-wise with 8.3 expected goals against. 

Parma have also played Como, Atalanta, and Juventus.... So it&#x27;s not like they&#x27;ve had a super easy run.

Still, I can&#x27;t see Parma scoring enough to do anything.

I was tossing up between this and the overall under 2.5 goals scored at $1.73. Obviously pros and cons for both. Putting half your stake on both of those results wouldn&#x27;t be the worst idea - but it&#x27;s not exactly a <mark style='background:#fff59d'>POTD</mark> if I do that! </td></tr>

Toledo got an early goal but it was the best thing for the game, it woke Sevilla up. Coming back from a break and losing back to back sucked so let&#x27;s try build some momentum again 

TODAYS BET 

EVENT/S = PSG VS Lorient 

BET =  PSG to score over 2 goals @1.83

UNITS = 5U to Profit 4.16U

SUMMARY = I love this line and think it has way too much value with the current form of PSG. They come up against 16th place Lorient which in the French league is a relegation playoff spot. Lorient have played 3 teams in the current top 6. Monaco, Lille and Marsielle. Monaco had a first half red card so they actually lost to Lorient but Marsielle and Lille beat them 4-0 and 7-1 completely dominating them. So when Lorient come up against a good team they struggle. Psg haven&#x27;t cleared this in every game they should in my opinion but I think that&#x27;s because they haven&#x27;t had PSG calibre line-ups most of the season. PSG have had some world class attackers return from injuries recently including Dembele which is huge for them. He has only been coming off the bench for 30 mins in the last couple of games but I feel like this would be the perfect game for him to come back in and start. Honestly I don&#x27;t really see how PSG don&#x27;t score 3 goals here, they have potentially their strongest line up coming up against a team that struggles that don&#x27;t have a world class keeper that bails them out. I can see this being 4 or 5-0 

If my picks help you and you&#x27;d like to show your appreciation a thumbs up is perfect, if you&#x27;d like to tip which is never expected but always appreciated and does help motivate me for the research here you go.  [Beer 🍺 ](http://Paypal.me/smoothsailinnomore)</td></tr>

Brest will travel to Le Havre midweek for a competitive clash of two league strugglers.

Brest will be looking to return to the form that saw them make the knockout stages of the Champions League last year.

I’d back them to score against an inconsistent Le Havre that has shipped 16 league goals in 9 games including 6 to Marseille recently.

As for Brest they have conceded 17 goals, and scored 14 giving them 31 goals over their 9 games in comparison to Le Havre&#x27;s total of 27. There is an average of over 3 goals per game between these two with both averaging well over 1 goal per game conceded and scored.

Le Havre have scored in their 4 home games this season tallying 7 goals, whilst Brest have managed to score in 3 out of 4 away games with 6 goals total.

The stats alone are enough to suggest BTTS and I just like the fact that it’s a Le Havre home fixture. I think both teams are likely to approach the game positively, and we may see some end to end football. I see the right value here.

**14 wins in 19 bets,** well done to any followers. No pressure whatsoever, but if you are willing, any help will go a long way.

Köln vs Bayern Munich

<mark style='background:#fff59d'>Pick</mark> : Bayern Munich -1.5 @1.62 for 5u

Bayern is the best team in Europe right now with a perfect record and Koln have not beaten them in a professional match in 14 years. Bayern have won 13 straight matches to start the season, which ties the all-time European record, and they will be looking to extend that run to be the record holders for the only team in top 5 league to have won 14 straight wins to start the season. Bayern have scored 47 goals in those 13 games while only letting in 8 goals, showing they are unstoppable in both attack and defense. Harry Kane is in incredible form with 20 goals already this season including 12 in the Bundesliga, and Bayern just destroyed Gladbach 3-0 away last Saturday showing they score lots of goals even on the road. 

Bayern have not lost to Koln since 2011 and have won 18 of their last 20 meetings against them. Koln are struggling badly right now, losing 1-0 to Dortmund last weekend without managing a single shot on target, and they barely survived the first round of the cup needing two goals in the 95th minute to beat a third-division team. Bayern are very motivated to win the DFB Pokal because they have not won it since 2020, and their coach Vincent Kompany just got a contract extension and wants to win trophies. With Bayern scoring almost 4 goals per game this season and Koln&#x27;s weak defense and terrible form, a scoreline like 3-0, 4-0, or 3-1 is very likely, making the -1.5 handicap one of the safest bets tonight.

This game is a bit of a rule breaker for me. I don’t like betting against home dogs. Especially in less than a TD spread but this one is the exception to the rule. 

The reason I’m breaking my rule is I think a run game travels, and boy can JVST run. They are third in the country in rush yards per game at 277. MTSU allows on average 142 a game putting them at 67th defensively. 

MTSU is also not a very good team offensively. They rank 125th in points scored per game, 60th in passing and 134th in rushing yards per game. 

Added bonus, JVST is coming off a bye week so they should be fresh and fired up. 

Sagarin has JVST at 118 and MTSU at 171. 
JVST 4-3 MTSU 1-6

Not a transitive property of football believer but worth noting, 
MTSU lost to Delaware last week by 3
JVST beat them by 13 2 weeks ago. 

Tailer Beware: JVST is 1-5 ATS last 6.

&gt; **Write Up:** This <mark style='background:#fff59d'>pick</mark> is from my soccer model that I&#x27;ve been using for the past two years. It assigns ELO ratings to players and projects a win chance based on the combined ELO ratings of the players on each team. TeamReddit is projecting a 62% win chance here which creates value here on the ML.</td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>

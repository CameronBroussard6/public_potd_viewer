Poland are coming off a very poor 9-3 defeat at the hands of Philippines yesterday evening. In that match, Poland really struggled with their rock placement, leaving very easy shots for their opposition late in the ends. Poland also lost 7-5 to Korea earlier in the day. Japan lost a very close match to the United States early yesterday but followed that up with a 7-5 win over Netherlands. Yanagisawa's take-outs were very strong in that match. Poland are the worst team in this field and their play yesterday really proved that; their back end has been awful. Koizumi, the Japanese skip, has been stellar and his setup shots should put a lot of pressure on a Polish team that will make a lot of mistakes. Japan came into this event 47-18 on the season, 43-13 against weak teams. Poland are 18-16, 17-7 against weak teams. This is a big mismatch in both talent and experience and the price is way too good here to not play.",

      "text": "Record: 63-51\n\nBurgdorf - Fuchse Berlin  🤾Handball Bundesliga ⌛in 1 hour\n\nPick: Burgdorf +3.5 @ 1.70\n\nOne of the main reasons for this choice is Mathias Gidsel. He injured his shoulder in the match against TBV Lemgo on December 2, 2025. This injury prevented him from playing in his team's EHF Champions League match against Kolstad Håndball on Thursday, December 4. The Berlin side fielded a \"Gidsel-less\" squad and lost that match. With and without Gidsel, Füchse Berlin play as if they are two different teams. This week's match against Kolstad demonstrated this most starkly: with Gidsel, Füchse Berlin were an unstoppable attacking machine, scoring an average of 35 goals per game in the Champions League this season. Without Gidsel, the team only managed 24 goals in the match against Kolstad on Thursday, December 4. Füchse Berlin manager Nicolej Krickau spoke with caution in his comments following the injury: Decision Not to Take Risks: Coach Krickau made a clear statement regarding Gidsel's condition, saying, \"We won't take any risks. Even if he says he's ready, I'll wait for the doctors to tell us.\" January Factor: With the European Championship (Euros) taking place in January, the player's long-term health is prioritized over short-term league matches.\n\n\n\nThe importance of the match for Füchse:\n\n\n\nAlready five points behind leaders Magdeburg (25-1 points), another point drop could seriously challenge Berlin's ambitions for both the championship and a top-two spot (CL ticket).\n\n\n\nThe importance of the match for Hannover:\n\n\n\nDespite being in 11th place, they are only a few points behind 7th-place Melsungen; if they can maintain their run, they could once again be close to the European Cup. Hannover's ability to use the ZAG Arena at full capacity creates one of the league's most intense home atmospheres, with an average attendance of around 9,000.\n\n\n\nThe abundance of players missing in Berlin is striking.\n\n\n\nMathias Gidsel (right-back) – After suffering a shoulder injury against Lemgo, he was ruled out and did not play in the away game against Kolstad.\n\n\n\nDejan Milosavljev (first goalkeeper) – He has been injured for some time and missed the Lemgo and Kolstad games; Lasse Ludwig is playing in his place.\n\n\n\nNils Lichtlein & Fabian Wiede (playmaker/right-back) – They were not in the squad for the Kolstad game due to injury.\n\n\n\nLukas Herburger (center) & Leo Prantner (right wing) – Sport4final lists both of these players as \"major absences\" for the Kolstad game.\n\n\n\nLasse Andersson (left-back) – He injured his abdominal muscle against Kolstad and was unable to return. Diagnosis still awaited, serious question mark for Hannover match.",

      "text": "POTD Record: 5-4\n\nLast POTD: Naz Reid Over 2.5 3-Pointers Made ❌\n\nEvent: New Orleans Saints Vs. Tampa Bay Buccaneers 1:00 PM EST\n\nToday's POTD: Devin Neal Over 16.5 Receiving Yards\n\nOdds: -115\n\nWrite Up:\n\nUsage & role: how Neal got here:\nDevin Neal’s season-long numbers don’t look sexy at first glance: 31 carries for 108 rushing yards (3.5 YPC) and 15 catches on 17 targets for 86 receiving yards.\nBut the key is when that passing-game usage showed up:\nFirst 3 games of the year: 0 targets. He’s barely involved.\nLast 5 games: all 17 of his targets and 15 receptions have come in this stretch, including 3+ targets in four of those five.\nHis game log as a receiver in that recent run:\nvs TB: 3 targets, 3 catches, 11 yards\n@ LAR: 1 target, 1 catch, 1 yard\n@ CAR: 3 targets, 3 catches, 9 yards\nvs ATL: 7 targets, 5 catches, 43 yards\n@ MIA: 3 targets, 3 catches, 22 yards\nSo over the last three games specifically (CAR, ATL, MIA), he’s put up 9, 43, and 22 receiving yards – an average of 24.7 yards, clearing a typical 16.5 line in 2 of his last 3 and coming up just one checkdown drive short in the other.\nNow layer in injuries: per multiple odds/injury reports, Alvin Kamara is out (knee/ankle) and fellow RB Kendre Miller is on IR. That leaves Neal as the clear lead passing-down back in a thin RB room. That’s huge for route participation and checkdown equity.\n\nMatchup: why the Bucs specifically scream RB receiving props:\nTampa Bay has been exactly what you’d expect from them defensively:\nStrong against the run between the tackles, but\nMuch more vulnerable to running backs as receivers.\nThe CBSSports “position vs defense” breakdown and StatMuse game logs show some pretty obvious patterns for RBs vs the Bucs in 2025:\nWeek 1: Falcons RBs went 6 catches for 100 yards and a TD through the air (Bijan Robinson alone had 6–100–1 receiving).\nWeek 2: Texans RBs added 3 catches for 66 receiving yards.\nLater vs the 49ers: Christian McCaffrey dropped 7 catches for 57 receiving yards on them.\nSo we’ve already seen three separate games where Tampa allowed 50+ RB receiving yards, and in two of those it was one star back doing most of the damage. This is exactly the profile we want: tough to run on, but willing to concede underneath throws and angle routes to backs.\nThe Bucs themselves have admitted through local coverage that a big focus has been “limiting YAC for RBs,” which tells you offenses are targeting their backs in the passing game. Even if the tackling is solid, we don’t need explosives – we just need a handful of clean checkdowns and swings.\n\nGame environment & script:\nThe macro context is perfect for a dump-off back over:\nSpread: Bucs are around -8.5 at home vs the 2–10 Saints.\nTotal: mid-40s (sites are talking about same-game parlays with totals around 41.5).\nWeather: forecast mentions possible showers and 15–20 mph winds in Tampa.\nWhat that usually means:\nSaints likely play from behind. They’re last in the NFC South standings (2–10 with only 182 points scored in 12 games). They’re not built to grind out a 20–17 run-heavy win here.\nWind + a stout Bucs front = more short passes. When downfield throws are harder and the front seven is stuffing early-down runs, coordinators lean into quick game: flares, screens, angle routes, checkdowns. Those are all Neal touches.\nNo Kamara safety valve. With Kamara sidelined, the “get out of jail free” checkdown has shifted to Neal, especially on 3rd-and-medium. That’s why we’ve seen his target spike: 14 of his 17 targets came in the last four games as his role expanded.\nNew Orleans also just showed us the blueprint in their loss to Miami: they struggled on the ground (81 rushing yards total) but leaned on short passes and play-action as they clawed back. Rookie Devin Neal was inefficient running (3.4 YPC) but still caught 3 passes for 22 yards, which is exactly the kind of line that cashes this over.\nNeal’s efficiency & what we actually need to cash\nNeal’s season receiving line:\n15 receptions on 17 targets for 86 yards (5.7 yards per reception overall).\nBut the per-catch numbers in his more recent, starter-ish usage stretch are better:\nvs ATL: 5 catches, 43 yards (8.6 YPR)\nvs MIA: 3 catches, 22 yards (7.3 YPR)\nIf books are hanging something around 16.5 yards, here’s what that means in practical terms:\n3 catches at his recent efficiency (~7–8 YPR) gets you 21–24 yards → comfy cash.\nEven if his YPR is closer to the whole-season 5.7, 3–4 catches still clears 16.5.\nGiven:\nHe’s hit 5, 3, 3 receptions in three of his last four games, and\nAll the RB passes are consolidating to him with Kamara/Miller out,\nthe math checks out: a very normal 3–4 catch line likely gives enough cushion over a mid-teens prop.\nCorrelated factors in our favor\nDefensive profile match: Bucs are better at limiting explosive RB YAC than at preventing the targets in the first place. We don’t care how pretty it looks; we just want volume.\n\nTeam context: \nSaints offense is low-upside, low-efficiency. That often means long, ugly drives built on underneath passes, not quick bombs. Neal is basically that “boring but reliable” piece of the puzzle.\nDivision game / familiarity: This is their second meeting with Tampa this year. In the first one, with a smaller role, Neal still caught 3 balls for 11 yards. Now his usage has jumped dramatically, and Kamara’s out.\n\nRisk factors (how this loses):\nNo prop is “free,” so here’s what can burn us:\nGame goes weirdly Saints-positive. If New Orleans somehow jumps out to a big early lead on a defensive TD or short field scores, they could get more run-heavy and shorten the game, limiting passing volume.\nRole consolidation fails. There’s always a chance the Saints sprinkle another back into the passing role or decide to pepper the tight ends and slot WRs instead.\nInefficiency / drops / sacks. If the offensive line completely collapses, checkdowns don’t even get to develop – you just get sacks or throwaways. That would cap attempts toward the RB.\nI still think those are outweighed by:\nSaints being sizable dogs,\nmissing multiple backs including Kamara, and\nthe Bucs’ clear pattern of allowing RB receiving production.",

I like Buccaneers over the Saints as the Saints have been having an atrocious year sitting at 2-10 on the season and they will be without starting runningback Alvin Kamara for this one. This Saints offense is one of the worst in the league as they are 29th in rushing yards per game with only 90 per contest and 30th in points scored per game with just 15 points put up per contest. The Bucs offense got Bucky Irving back last week and he made an immediate impact as he found his way into the endzone against the Cardinals. The Bucs facef off against the Saints earlier this year in New Orleans and they kept the Saints out of the endzone in that 23-3 victory. I like the Buccaneers to repeat their success against this poor offense and get another win against them, this time on their home field. I also like the Seattle Seahawks (9-3) against the Atlanta Falcons (4-8) in this one. This Seahawks team has been great on both sides of the ball with an offense that ranks third in the league in points per game with 30 a game and a defense that ranks 2nd in rush yards allowed with just 88 ground yards allowed per game and 3rd in scoring with just 18 points allowed per contest. This Falcons defense has been exploited on the ground this year allowing north of 130 rush yards per game so I think the Seahawks will be able to establish the run game on them which will open up the play action game well and providing opportunities for NFL receiving leader Jaxson Smith-Njigba to run behind this defense gashing them for chunk plays. The Falcons have lost 6 out of their past 7 games with their only win being over the hotdog water Saints so I expect their downtrend to continue in this one against a very good Seahawks squad.\n\nPrediction: 27-20 Seahawks, 20-9 Bucs\n\nLast pick:🏈Virginia ML/Texas Tech ML💩Special teams killed Virginia in the first half. A missed field goal from Will Bettridge, Jacob Holmes jumping offsides on a punt leading to a touchdown and a fake punt leading to a touchdown was the difference in the game. But at the end of the day nobody to blame but me, sorry guys.\n\nBest of luck to everyone tailing and remember to bet responsibly!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p6ezc5h4wq5g1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4c09d2cdd107a7974056bd62584e83d51fab52a0",

It's the busy time of the year and results are getting a little more unpredictable with exhaustion really settling in. This pick is based on my belief in Crystal Palace using this as an opportunity to stop their bleeding, or at least slow it down. They are a great defensive side and let in the 2nd least amount of goals this season. Fulham has had a pretty good run of form lately but I do not think it's sustainable. If you remove the City game, which I think is an anomaly, they're one of the lowest scoring sides in the prem, but also very defensively sound. To mitigate risk I think CP wins but I wouldn't be shocked if it's a draw, and because I loathe “-“ odds, I selected Over 1 goal to juice it up a bit.\n\nIf you find my insight useful, please feel free to donate to BuyMeACoffee:\n\nhttps://buymeacoffee.com/5c2y4cxvy5e\n\nAs you all know, bet only what you're willing to lose!\n\nBOL!",

They’ve consistently allowed opposing running backs to churn out production on the ground, giving up chunk runs, missed gap fits, and sloppy second-level tackling. This is not the Saints front we grew up fearing  this is a unit that lets RBs get comfortable, get downhill, and stay on the field way too long. Exactly the type of defense Bucky Irving punishes.\n\n\nAnd with Tampa Bay missing dependable pass-catching depth, the offensive script gets simple,  lean on your most efficient ball-carrier, shorten the game, and force the Saints to prove they can stop something they've failed to stop all year. Bucky is tailor-made for this,  shifty enough to make one guy miss, tough enough to break through another, and explosive enough to turn a 5-yard crease into a drive-changing play.\n\n\nPlus, when teams play the Saints, their drives naturally funnel toward the run. New Orleans  pass defense is still decent, but their run defense? It’s a welcome mat. Opposing offenses keep choosing the ground game because the Saints keep failing to close the door.\n\n\nSo Bucky isn’t just in a good spot , he’s walking into a volume bump, a matchup advantage, and a game script that practically guarantees touches. With other WRs sidelined, the Bucs will have no choice but to shove the ball into the hands of the one guy who can stabilize the offense.",

Nets end with 7 blocks and MPJ gets one. Big money cash. 4/4 on Blocks props this season.\n\n**🏀 Coby White o18.5 Points -128** vs the Golden State Warriors\n\nNot overthinking this. Fanduel opened this line at 18.5. Coby has been upgraded to probable for the game.\n\nHe has cashed in all 6/6 games this season. He has also cashed in L3/3 matchups vs the Warriors. Never getting below 20p in either.\n\nCoby has been vocal about the Bulls fixing their losing streak and I expect him to put in extra effort to get the W at home vs the Warriors. He likely won't get a full minutes allocation but I don't see him needing it.\n\nIn general, Warriors games are low-scoring but the Bulls operate at the second fastest pace in the NBA, adding some extra opportunities for Coby to score.\n\nWarriors on the second leg of a B2B road trip should see some sluggishness that the Bulls can exploit. They already rank particularly weak vs PGs, 23rd in Points allowed.\n\nLastly, Dosunmu questionable for the game. He may play but if he doesn't, increased PG responsibilities for Coby. With Giddey & Vuce already playing poorly, Coby may take over.\n\nFull stats if you'd like to do additional research: [https://www.statpick.ai/15254266/coby-white-points](https://www.statpick.ai/15254266/coby-white-points)\n\nEdit: Line has already shifted to o19.5 +100 after an hour.

Ohio State gave up six sacks all season long. They gave up 5 sacks to Indiana today. Sayin was absolutely neutralized by the ferocious pass rush that the Hoosiers brought to the table. Mendoza made all the right plays aside from the one deflected interception. Very efficient run game with both lead backs averaging around 4 yards a carry and setting up Mendoza for some downfield shots to Becker from NASHVILLE TENNESSEE. Cignetti has absolutely changed this team's culture. Despite 30 straight losses to Ohio State, these Indiana Hoosiers are the BIG 10 Champs. They are the #1 seed when we wake up tomorrow morning. Mendoza will be the Heisman winner. Cignetti. Enough said. Glad to have gotten the win and keep the streak going!\n\n**Event:** Chicago Bears vs Green Bay Packers NFL\n\n**POTD:** Chicago Bears +6.5 (-105) 5 units\n\n**Rationale:** When I watch the Chicago Bears, I see a team winning in spite of Caleb Williams, not because of him. With wins in 9 out of their last 10 games, they sit squarely atop of the NFC. However, the heat of their schedule is coming up in these next few games. In all honesty, the Packers on the other hand have not impressed me at all and with Jordan Love at the helm, they once again strike me as a high risk high reward offense that peaked in last Thursday's thanksgiving date with the Detroit Lions. While I anticipate Love to throw a pair of touchdowns, I think the Bears defense will be able to contain him well. The Chicago Bears offensively are backed by a ground and pound 1/2 punch with Swift and Monangai set up by an excellent scheme from Ben Johnson. While a lot of the public feels like the Packers have a better pass rush than the Eagles and I don't disagree, I don't think it's all that better as people are making it out to be. This defense gave up nearly 5 a carry to Warren, 4 a carry to Bam Knight, 5 a carry to Dowdle, 4 a carry to Tracy. That being said, if the Bears stick to the run game in a very similar gameplan as to what they ran against Philly, I anticipate them keeping it close. Where this game is going to be won or lost is if Caleb tries to play hero ball and win the game with his own hands. Caleb, to me, does NOT pass the eye test and I root for him to do well but he can't be pass-happy and make careless turnovers by playing around with the football.\n\nDo I think the Bears will win this game? Oh 100%. Do I love getting 6.5 points on top of that? 7 days a week and a bonus on Sunday NFL day. This being said, I will be sprinkling a unit on the Bears Moneyline at +240. To me, this game should be closer to a Bears +3.5 giving the Packers a generous 3 points for playing at home. I considered making the Bears ML my POTD but rules said it had to be  less than +200 odds so I must oblige haha, but hoping the 6.5 point buffer here helps pay us all out!\n\nJust to reiterate, in conjunction with my model, I use the eye test as well as my gut feeling to play what I believe is the most-valuable pick on the slate. Cheers to a great game, and please remember to gamble responsibly and to only wager what you can afford to lose.\n\nBOL!\n\n**Tips:** Received personal messages from a few users thanking me for the picks and how they could support, so feel free to donate if I've made you money, but please never feel obligated to whatsoever.\n\n[Buy A 🍺](http://buymeacoffee.com/Actuary)",

All Lando has to do to win the drivers championship is get a podium which should be done since hes starting 2nd with his teammate in 3rd in one of the best cars. I think Lando won't attack too hard since if he crashes, he doesn't win the drivers championship. He needs a podium which he can easily get with moderately safe driving. McLaren will focus on getting Norris a podium and not 1st place. For the other bet, its Max to win. He's starting in 1st and is known to have aggressive starts. He should retain 1st after the 1st corner and I don't see the Mclarens challenging him. Feel good about this one.",

Selby is the KING of safeties and escaping them when it matters. Trump looked a little shaky vs Robertson today until he found his grove AFTER going down 3-2 today, I dint see Selby giving up a lead as easy as Robertson did. This entire tournament Selby has been IN CHARGE, winning 6-2,6-2,6-2 an 6-3. Although Trump leads their overall head-to-head, Selby’s recent victories and experience in long, tactical matches give him an edge in a best-of-19 final where patience, safety play, and momentum matter as much as heavy scoring.

This team hasn’t lost two consecutive games at Allen fieldhouse since February of 2018. The tigers are coming off a hard fought loss at notre dame which was their first true  road test. Not to mention they have had the easiest cake walk of a schedule in all of college basketball. Three point shooting has been one of their main strengths yet Kansas comes into this matchup holding their opponents to the 5th best three point percentage in the nation. My power ratings make this Kansas -8 regardless. This is a win. Not to mention. Darryn Peterson could be back 👀 \n\nPackers: \nThe bears might just be the luckiest team in the NFL. They have a bottom 5 SOS. They barely beat the 6-6 Steelers by 3 points, they barely beat a 4-8 Vikings team by 2 points last minute. The 2-11 giants by 4 points.

And allowed 52 points and got their ass handed to them by the 7-5 lions and lost week 1 to that same Vikings team. The packers are top 5 in total defense and top 10 in total offense and have revenge from last years loss at home to the bears. Public is also all over the bears and they do not even have Odunze.

The weather is supposed to be atrocious tomorrow, with pouring rain throughout most of the game.\n\nThe Colts will be without DeForest Buckner as well, which hurts their rushing defense. The Jags have run well most of this year, despite last week's odd result. The Jags had very few long drives, opting instead for chunk plays and short fields.\n\nI think he easily hits this super low line, as he has most games this year with Brenton Strange on the field.",

      "text": "Apologies to those of you who have started following me over the last couple of weeks, it’s been really brutal. Gonna switch up my pick philosophy as my personal plays based on gut calls have been doing so so much better than these picks that I put way more research into. Pretty ironic, but it’s time to turn things around for the holiday season.\n\nRecord: 27-19 (+23.14u)\n\nLast 10:✖️✖️💰✖️✖️💰💰✖️✖️✖️\n\nLast POTD: 🏈 George Pickens longest reception over 25.5 yards ✖️\n\nWriteup: Pickens reminded us why the Steelers let him walk. Lackadaisical, low effort, out of it. Dak threw a perfect 30+ yard pass right to Pickens at the end of the game and he put in zero effort to get it and let it drop right by his feet.\n\nToday’s POTD: 🏈 Commanders ML (-124).\n\nGame starts at 1pm EST. Bet 3.25U\n\nWriteup: Welcome to day 1 of my new pick mentality. For this pick, give me my Commanders winning straight up against the Vikings. \n\nJayden Daniels had the greatest rookie QB season of all time last season, and finally has all of his wide receivers healthy for the first time this season. On the other side, J.J. McCarthy might be the worst starting QB in football. The Vikings have one of the best receiving cores in the league, but McCarthy has completely stifled any and all offensive momentum and playmaking for his players. \n\nOn defense, the Commanders defense has not been good, at all. However, Dan Quinn took over the defensive play calling a few weeks ago, and they look like a completely different defense. Still not great, but they are playing with a completely different energy. The Vikings have a much better defense on paper, especially in the pass game. However, these stats are completely skewed thanks to them getting to go up against the Bengals when Jake Browning was the starting QB. Take this game out, and the Vikings are the 22nd best defense in football. \n\nSo for arguments sake, we’ll call these 2 defenses pretty equal, and I’ll take this Jayden Daniels led defense over J.J. McCarthy any day of the week. Commanders win this one outright.\n\nRemember to only bet what you can afford to lose, and BOL! ",

Dortmund are third in the Bundesliga and are a strong attacking team at Signal Iduna Park, while Hoffenheim are fifth with 23 points and have had both teams score in five of their last seven games away from home, proving they will definitely have high chance of scoring. Dortmund have dominated this fixture historically, winning 8 of their last 10 meetings against Hoffenheim. Both teams are on unbeaten streaks in the league, with Dortmund unbeaten for almost two months and Hoffenheim unbeaten in six consecutive league matches, meaning both teams will attack and create chances instead of playing defensively. Hoffenheim are ranked second away from home in the entire Bundesliga and have scored 12 goals in their last five games, so they will come to Dortmund with confidence and attack-minded football, while Dortmund have scored 10 goals in their last five home games, meaning both teams have the quality to break through and score goals. The win or draw protection gives you safety in case Dortmund only draw, while the both teams to score requirement is almost guaranteed based on the last four to five meetings where both sides found the back of the net every single time. \n\n\nIf you found these picks helpful, tips or donations are greatly appreciated as they support the time and effort I put into creating them: [buy me a beer🍻](https://buymeacoffee.com/hercules.son.of.zeus)",

While that may happen to some extent, a closer look at the data suggests a run-heavy script. \n\nBengals D: Yes they give up a lot of yards through the air (265/game - 6th most) but they are even worse defending the run (RB's rush for over 128/game against them- worst in the NFL).\n\nBills D: Is a funnel rush defense - giving up the third most rushing yards (113/game) while having the stingiest pass defense in the league (177/game - 1st) \n\nThis matches up well with where both offenses have been recently. The Bills have a receiver problem. Kincaid went down, Coleman had been a healthy scratch for weeks before they couldnt find anyone else to catch the ball, Gabe Davis sucks, and Shakir - their only decent wideout - had 1 catch for 5 yards last week against Pittsburgh. In fact the Bills overall had 125 total pass yards against the Steelers D which was second worst in the league against the pass (263/game). That same game James Cook, on the other hand, rushed **34 times** for 144 yards.          \n\nMeanwhile, Chase Brown has been on a roll. Over the past 6 weeks he has rushed for 108-73-37-99-77-108. Thats 2 - 100 games and only one game under 70. Over the same last 6 game span - James Cook has 4 games of over 100+ yards including one of 216. Asking these two to combine for 150 yards rushing against two of the worst run defenses in the league on a cold day in Buffalo doesnt seems like much.\n\nThis bet is under Rushing -> Combined Rushing Yards -> **Cook and Brown Over 150 (-138)** on Draftkings. If you dont have this bet - you can also find it under Head to Head Matchups - where their total over is at 155 (-114) BOL if Tailing!",

Clean straight sets win.\n\n**Tennis** | **Challenger Angers (Women)** | **9 AM (Eastern Time)**\n\n**Plays will always be shared as 1 unit for fair record purposes**\n\n**Pick:** **Korpatsch vs Rakhimova - Rakhimova ML @ 1.71**\n\nBoth players have been playing solid tennis. Korpatsch didn't drop a set in this tournament but faced two weak opponents in the first two rounds, before beating Parks, who played at a terrible level, and then Friedsam, who I was expecting to get knocked out after a really intense battle in the previous round against Sonmez.\n\nRakhimova had a much more difficult path to the final, where she faced Klimocicova and Ruzic, players who can certainly be dangerous on a good day. All her opponents in this tournament were solid from the baseline, and she was able to get the best of them, playing at a high level even when she needed to win in 3 sets.\n\nWhen it comes to playstyles, both players certainly play baseline tennis, but Korpatsch tends to be a lot more passive, and usually things don't go right for her when she's forced to be aggressive. Rakhimova, on the other hand, is much more efficient when turning defense into offense, and her backhand is certainly an advantage in this matchup.\n\nI believe that Parks and Friedsam, players who tend to make a lot of unforced errors, were not a good test for Korpatsch, and she will find a lot of contest from the baseline in this final. With this, I'm expecting Rakhimova to win this match. Their H2H record is 1-0 in favor of Rakhimova, where she won last year in the hard courts of Ningbo by 6-0/6-3.\n\nGood luck!",

Long time tailer and first time picker with this one.\n\nEvent - NFL, Cardinals/Rams, 2:25 MST\n\nPick - Michael Wilson O5.5 Receptions -106(currently at -148 on FD) 2.5U\n\nGoing to keep my first pick short and to the point.  The cardinals are having an abysmal season and are dealing with a ton of injuries.  Wilson averaged 12.5 receptions a game when MHJ missed 2 games earlier this season, and that was WITH Dorth and Dimercado playing(they are both injured and OUT for this game, Weaver is also questionable with a DNP yesterday, MHJ is OUT).  The card are playing one of the best offenses in the Rams, and i expect them to be playing from behind and throwing the ball a ton like they have all season against lesser offenses.  Someone has to catch the ball besides McBride!\n\nI wish the Sunday picks were up earlier as there has been massive line movement.  I'm laddering this up to 10 receptions personally.  BOL!",

Rodriguez has had 90% of the 1st Quarter RB carries in Washington’s last 2 games. Rodriguez has now had 10+ carries in 3 of his last 4 games, going for 41 yards, 79 yards, & 65 yards. His one miss was when he suffered a shoulder injury vs the Lions. Last week his 41 yard performance was against the Broncos who have a top 5 run defense, allowing just 93.1 rushing yards per game. Now he faces a Minnesota defense that ranks 23rd in rushing yards allowed per game (128.4) & ranks just 20th in EPA run defense. In their past 6 games they’ve allowed:\n\nWalker 13/56, Charbs 14/52\n\nJacob’s 28/107\n\nSwift 21/90\n\nHenry 20/75\n\nMonty 11/40\n\nVidal 23/117\n\nNow they face Washington who has turned to a run first approach offense in the past month. In the first 8 weeks of the season, the Washington’s RB’s averaged 17.4 runs per game. In their past 4 games that number has shot up to 24. This week Washington gets star QB Jayden Daniels back at QB from a dislocated elbow & their offense should be firing on full cylinders. The Commanders enter the game as favorites, vs a struggling Vikings offense that ranks LAST in points per game over their last 3 games averaging just 7.7 points per game. \tMinnesota has the league's worst turnover differential (-15) & ranks LAST in the NFL in EPA pass offense over the last 8 weeks (-67.0). Minnesota does have a great pass defense. Over the last 5 weeks, Minnesota has allowed a 59.6% completion rate (7th), 6.3 yards per pass attempt (9th), & a 2.1% TD rate (3rd). Minnesota leads the NFL in 2 high safety rate (64%), which helps them limit deep passing, allowing just the 4th fewest deep yards per game (21.3) over the past 6 weeks. Their 2 high approach also allows them to limit the sidelines & specifically deeper downfield passes (2nd fewest years per game allowed to 15+ yard targets on sidelines). \n\nWith Daniels coming back from injury, the run game heating up, & Minnesota sucking on offense, Rodriguez is in line for his busiest game of the season & Vegas has not awfully adjusted his rushing props.\n\n*More write-up incoming*\n\n__Chris Rodriguez o41.5 rushing yards__\n\nAppreciate the love!

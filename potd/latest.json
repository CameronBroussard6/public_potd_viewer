      "text": "POTD RECORD: 19-9-2\n\nNet units: +9.042\n\nLast 10 Form (6-2-2): ✅🅿️✅❌✅✅✅❌🅿️✅\n\nLast POTD: Isaiah Collier O12.5 P -125 1U ✅\n\nToday’s POTD: **UNC Asheville-USC Upstate O140.5 (-115 FanDuel) 1U**\n\nEvent: CBB | USC Upstate @ UNC Asheville (6:30 p.m. EST) | 🏀\n\n*Recap: Have yourself a game, Mr. Collier. The Utah Jazz made a trade early in the day and used seven players against Indiana. So how does Isaiah Collier respond? He set a Jazz single-game assists record for a player not named John Stockton (22) and added 17 points (and just two turnovers!) in 48 minutes. FWIW his previous career high was 37 minutes. He did exactly what I thought he would. He missed all three of his 3-point attempts but got to the free-throw line a team-high eight times. His shooting from the stripe (and floor) was pretty bad, but no matter. When you've only got seven guys, you're gonna chuck the rock. Oh, and Utah won 131-122. Onward.*\n\n**Today's reasoning:** When UNC Asheville and USC Upstate get together, defense often goes missing for long stretches of time. These teams just combined for 152 points on Jan. 21. What's changed in 13 days? OK, sure... USC Upstate scored 65 points in back-to-back games, which is admittedly 10 points lower than their season average. UNC Asheville scored 69 points against a Gardner-Webb team that turns every game ugly and 71 points at perennial nemesis Winthrop. The 70 point average since Jan. 21 is four points lower than *their* season average. But there are no injuries that I am aware of. So why pick this pairing of 10-13 teams to rekindle their offenses today?\n\nBecause they've cleared 140.5 in five straight head-to-head matchups, and 7 of the last 10 meetings. Better yet, they've cleared 140.5 in 7 of the last 9 games played in Asheville. Against all competition, UNCA has combined to clear 140.5 in 7 of 12 home games this season. In conference play, the Bulldogs are 6-3 to the over. Against USC Upstate specifically, UNCA has averaged 79.6 points over the last 10 meetings and has cleared 80 as a team in four of the last five (83, 92, 93, 95).\n\nMeanwhile, USC Upstate is averaging 75.4 points over its last five games against UNCA, including 85- and 92-point outings last season, when UNCA had a much better team. Both KenPom and BartTorvik are projecting totals just over 140.5, so buyer better beware. But I like this matchup as an offensive get-right game for both sides. UNCA averages 2.3 more points per game at home, which is to be expected. If the Bulldogs hit their usual 75 in front of a friendly Kimmel Arena crowd, all USC Upstate needs is 66 points. That's actually two points less than what UNCA usually allows at home. But the Spartans have gone for at least 64 in four of their last five games in Asheville. And get this, USC Upstate is averaging 11 more points on the road against conference opponents than at home (74.3 vs. 63.3). What an incredible split. In their last five road games overall, they've notched 65, 69, 86 (OT), 77, and 65 - 72.4 average.\n\nUSC Upstate likes to push the pace, and they've been more efficient with it on the road for whatever reason. KenPom puts their adjusted tempo at 155. On the road, as an underdog, I wanna see them gunning. Both teams' defensive ratings are in the 210s. UNCA has the second-best 3-point field goal percentage in the Big South Conference (36.1). Both sides are middle of the pack for guarding the deep ball. That tells me that we could see some offensive spurts thanks to outside shooting. In Jan. 21 game, they combined for 36 takes from range, and both made right at their season average.\n\nMy thesis: I look to UNCA to flirt with dropping another 80 on USC Upstate. I also look for the Spartans to push the ball and play to their conference road game average (74) and/or L5 average against UNCA (75). That totals 154/155, easily more than the line for today, and a basket better than they played on Jan. 21 - which did not feature any outlier offensive shooting performance. Even if UNCA scores just a typical 75 at home, all we need is 66 from USC Upstate. The current spread is 6.5. That implies that USC Upstate will get 68, 69. This might be tight, but I like my chances with two teams looking for offensive answers on their buildup to a one-bid conference tournament.\n\nGood luck and Godspeed!\n\nPOTD tracker: https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/Seventh__Place-z37cn7\n\nIf I've made you a few bucks through fades, it's just gonna ask you a few questions: https://buymeacoffee.com/seventh__place",

Bet 2.5u\n\nWriteup: Let’s start with Duquesne. They go up against a 20-2 George Mason team with a top 30 quality of record and are ranked top 75 in the league. Beyond this, I don’t see why Duquesne shouldn’t have a chance to get an upset victory. Their offense vs the GM defense is about as even as they come, and while I would give an advantage to the GM offense, I like Duquesne to rebound effectively and create some turnovers as well. Additionally, Duquesne should have an offensive advantage with shot around the rim, and GM likes to prevent the 3 ball and is a bit softer down low. This is another game where we back the underdog with a polar opposite play style to the favorite. GM’s pace of play is 335th, whereas Duquesne’s is 63rd. Add on top of this that GM has been very inconsistent, plays some of their worst ball at home, and have not had a convincing win in a month, I think Duquesne has a shot to win on the road. We’ll take them to cover by +13.5.\n\nNext is San Francisco vs Loyola Marymount. The big driving factors for me here are defense, momentum, and 3-point shooting, with a few smaller factors on top. San Fran has a defense efficiency just outside the top 100, whereas LMU has an offense efficiency almost in the 300s. San Fran also has a momentum ranking just outside the top 100. Not that impressive, but when you compare it to LMU’s ranking of 365th…oh look that’s dead last in the league. We just took Santa Clara to beat them on Saturday, and Santa Clara won by over 30. LMU has lost 6 straight and I have no reason to trust them. I feel good about this one, so give me San Fran to cover a -2.5 spread at a solid price.\n\nRemember to only bet what you can afford to lose, and BOL!\n\n**Spreads to come…**",

After a rocky 0-2 start, we’ve hit **three wins in a row** and the momentum is real. Today we’re looking at the Argentine Reserve League, a market where the gap between the \"Big 5\" and the rest is often massive.\n\nRacing Club (Home): They have one of the most prestigious academies in Argentina. At home, they are incredibly disciplined, physical, and technical. They usually suffocate teams that don't have the same level of tactical training.\n     \nBarracas Central (Away): To put it bluntly, their youth setup is one of the weakest in the division. They simply don't have the infrastructure to compete with a giant like Racing. Their recent form is abysmal: **only 1 win in their last 10 matches.**\n* **The Play:** While Reserve games can sometimes be low-scoring or tricky, the quality difference here is too large to ignore. Racing should dominate possession and eventually find the breakthrough.\n\n---\n\n*Tips are never expected but always appreciated\n\n[buymeacoffee.com/Francocarde123](http://buymeacoffee.com/Francocarde123)",

It is what it is, you can't predict players being sent off really. Apologies for that.\n\nSi Jiahui has won all 3 of their head-to-head matchups, latest being around a month ago. He is good at getting decent scores with accurate play - I do think he starts better and can continue good form and carry on a lead to secure the win. Jiahui comes into this with 3/2 (W/L) in their last 5 games, with Wilson going 2/3, you may suggest that they have similar records however Wilson with the worse form in combination to the poor H2H record points to Jiahui winning. \n\nRonnie and Josh O'Connors last matchup came in the Saudi Arabia Masters - with O'Sullivan going 5-0. Both players are not in the greatest of form but I do think Ronnie is the better player here. I see him potentially dropping a frame or two but I do think he sees this one out. \n\nShorter writeup - tired today I do apologise.\n\nBOL and always bet what you can afford to lose!",

It’s debut campaign saw it run really well in all 3 starts, culminating in a 2nd placing in the Reginald Allen to the eventual Carbine Club winner (big 3yo races).\n\nThe break in between preps has seemed to do wonders for this horse, as she’s looked to come back impressively based on the two trials this time in. We draw barrier 5 and get the best jockey in the world on top, so I’m fairly confident we’ll end up with a grouse spot in running, probably the 1-1.\n\nWe have a dominant ratings profile over the rest of the field, however I am cautious that the rating came in our grand final as opposed to first up, but with the expected improvement I can forecast a similar number here.\n\nAs I go down the list of opposition, I can pick many holes in them. SIGNOR TORTONI, our main market rival, has trialled the house down either side of its first up run, but that run was absolutely awful, finishing dead last. I can’t possibly trust that horse currently. CLEAR PROOF and KILBRANNAN are going well but they’re definitely not up to the class of our horse. That leaves SNITZEL DANCER, who hasn’t done much at the trials but showed its class last prep, however we comfortably had its measure when we matched up.\n\nGL",

They once again looked dreadful in that second half against Tottenham, showing they really do **struggle to beat their bogey teams** and that they far too often **take their foot off the gas** after going up.\n\nNewcastle are not only a bit of a **bogey team** for Man City, but also **take this cup more seriously** after not really being in contention on the other fronts. They're trailing on aggregate, so I'm expecting them to come in **all guns blazing** to try and cut the deficit, and I can see them nabbing a draw or a narrow win, *which ultimately isn't going to be enough to see them through,* but should be enough to secure another win on the board. They're a physically **strong, well organized** side that can cause a lot of damage to **City's lacklustre backline** even on their good day, let alone in the form they're in at the minute.

That was our 8th win playing Enzo for the POTD, every one of those was plus money other than one. The game played out much as expected, with Chelsea having the majority of possession and Arsenal playing defensively. Enzo came through for us again in less sweaty fashion as he lands an SOT before halftime. Gotta love it!\n\nToday we've got the last semi final for the EFL Cup as Man City host Newcastle. City is already up 2-0 on aggregate here. This should be an even more open game as Newcastle need to score at least 2 goals. We have cashed Semenyo a few times in the soccer thread over the last few weeks and I like him here again today. His goal over the weekend was on a counter attack and I expect that to be City's main threat today. \n\nSemenyo has been on a tear since joining City, scoring a goal in 4 out of 5 games played. He has scored in two straight EPL games and also scored in this reverse fixture a few weeks back at Newcastle. I'm buying down the risk a bit here as ATGS is +190, since City have been moving towards a two pronged attack with Haaland and Semenyo up front. The two have had great link up play the last few games, so I love that we are still in plus odds and adding the option of an assist to cash. \n\nBOL and happy Wednesday!",

I see today going differently as they are now having to learn the new meta and picks and bans are slightly different. This series also isn’t as important for WE as it is for EDG.

Besides that these two teams their latest encounters have all hit over the line, in Blast V in Novemeber last year their BO1 match lasted 56min , in Dreamleague in December their match lasted 46min for map 1. Not only this, Falcons played 4 games today and 3 out of 4 games hit over 40min , XG also hit this line in two games out of 4. Also it’s a morning match, as a gamer usually these players are night owls , when their match is at 9-10am they play very bad and make a lot of mistakes which causes the game to be longer.",

He had a solid run in Australia, qualifying for AO and won his first match against Erhard, who has been playing well recently. He is currently number 117 in the world and meeting number 306 in the world. \n\nShelbayh made a good progression the last year but has not really shown a good form recently. Besides his match yesterday, he has not won a match since October last year and I believe this match is going to be a too big a mouthfull against a Maestrelli who has won 5 out of his 7 matches this year and played all matches on hard court (and one of the matches he lost was to Djokovic, which almost shouldn't count as a lost match in this statistic).\n\nI see a good value in this bet and good luck!\n\n\\_\n\nIf you follow my bets, I would appreciate a little tip - I spend a lot of time analyzing the bets day to day.

      "text": "**Record:** 46-23-1 (+23.62u)\n\n**Last:** (CBB) Indiana ML (1.5u) - Pending\n\n**POTD:** (CBB) No. 10 Michigan State (-6.5) at Minnesota\n\n**Start Time:** 7:00 PM ET (BTN)\n\n**Odds:** \\-112 (DraftKings)\n\n**Units (to win):** 1.5U\n\n**Reasoning:** Death. Taxes. Another Sparty donation?\n\nThere hasn’t been a lot of coin respecting going on when it comes to Michigan State as of late. That’s largely in part to some slow starts, as the team stumbled out of the gate in each of its two games last week against Rutgers and Michigan, trailing at the half by nine and 16 points respectively. But while a second-half surge helped the Spartans (19-3) outlast the Scarlet Knights in overtime, it was a case of too little, too late against the Wolverines. The loss snapped a seven-game win streak and dropped the team to 4th in the Big Ten standings.\n\nBut if there’s one thing head coach Tom Izzo knows how to do, it’s to bounce back: Michigan State is 31-13-2 ATS following a loss over the last five years.\n\nHowever, don’t expect Minnesota to make it easy. Despite a 3-8 mark in conference play—and having lost each of its last seven games—the Gophers (10-12) have been a tough out in the opening half of games. In fact, the team has either led or been tied at the half in four of its last six contests. That includes being knotted up at 34 against then-No. 13 Illinois and leading 36-30 against then-No. 7 Nebraska. Elite defense has been the name of the game, as Minnesota ranks 10th in first half scoring defense (29.7 PPGA).\n\nUnfortunately, that’s about the only positive the team can hang its hat on.\n\nAfter a 10-5 start to the season, it’s been all downhill for the Gophers. Through 22 games, the team ranks 125th in field-goal percentage (45.5%), 163rd in offensive efficiency (1.064), 242nd in three-point shooting (32.7%) and 245th in scoring (71.8 PPG). Not the kind of numbers you want to bring into a matchup with a Spartans defense that enters ranked 8th in opponent field-goal percentage (39.1%), 9th in scoring defense (64.4 PPGA), 11th in defensive efficiency (0.928) and 40th in opponent three-point shooting (30.4%). The last time the team came off a loss, the unit limited USC to just 17 first-half points and 51 for the game on just 33% shooting (18% from beyond the arc).\n\nThings don’t get any more promising on the defensive end.\n\nOn the year, the Minnesota defense can be described average at best, ranking 48th in scoring defense (68.8 PPGA), 97th in opponent field-goal percentage (42.9%), 102nd in defensive efficiency (1.020) and 195th in opponent three-point shooting (34.2%). However, over the last six games, the unit has been leaking water, conceding an average of 76.2 points on 46.2% shooting from the field (40.7% from long range). For a Michigan State offense that ranks 53rd in offensive efficiency, Wednesday night’s matchup could be like stealing candy from a baby. Especially with point guard Jeremy Fears Jr. (14.9 PPG, 8.8 APG) playing the way he has as of late.\n\nTrust Sparty to bounce back convincingly.\n\nBOL if tailing, and as always, please do so responsibly.

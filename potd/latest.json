CP are 4 games winless and recently got kicked out of the cup by Arsenal.\n\nSpurs are also 6-1-3 against CP and pretty decent on their homeground. Also, Tottenham still play better away from home...\n\nRomero Red and Xavi out but tbf not huge missers. Why? Romero is a very good defender but he is also inconsistent. Since he is a defender this inconsistency also leaves gaps in the defense. I think today Tottenham will be even better in defense, especially since Micky is still there.",

Meanwhile this is the worst part of the Season for Jalen Hurts ATS, as he is 34-22 in November or earlier and 14-18 ATS in December or later. Intresting thing about Jalen is that he has never covered 3 straight this late into the season. Josh has also played so much better at home, with 16 TD passes and 4 INTS compared to 9 TD passes and 6 ints on the road. Late game though even if the Eagles are ahead I can see Josh making some miracle comeback and bringing them the win. Remember this is an Eagles defense that struggled alot versus the Bears and the Cowboys, giving up 400+ yards to both of those teams. The Eagles are still without Lane Johnson this game. I predict Bills by 2.\n\nBOL! Please react if tailing!",

The aussie Damon Heta has a slight edge statistically in the last 6 months and Cross' performances of late have been quite underwhelming for his standards.\n\nHeta edges averages in the past 6 months (95.01 vs 94.01), leg win% and power scores per leg (0.26 v 0.22), but most impressively his checkout% at 45.35 v Cross' 39.95 is significant. He's been closing out legs very well recently and I think that's a good sign. Damon has also won the last two meetings between these two so I don't expect any mental edges to exist either way here. It's also not too deep into the tournament where I expect Heta to succumb to the pressure, I believe he performs well here. BOL if you tail.",

      "text": "Record: 64-56\n\nBüyükçekmece - Bursaspor 🏀 Türkiye Basketbol Süper Ligi UTC: 15.00\n\nPick: **Bursaspor** \\-1.5 @ 1.90\n\n**Writeup**: Coaching change in Büyükçekmece (important): On December 26, 2025, Ozan Bulkaz was dismissed and replaced by Faruk Beşok. This is a move to stop the team's poor run of form (1-11 record); a defensive-focused change is expected with Beşok's experience. However, I don't think it will be a significant change. Bursaspor has won 5 out of 12 matches so far in the league and managed to move away from the relegation zone. They have shown signs of recovery by winning 2 of their last 3 matches. Don't let their 1 away win alarm you; they played against Fenerbahçe, Türk Telekom, and Beşiktaş (the best teams in the league). Now they will play against the worst-performing team in the league. Büyükçekmece, on the other hand, is a complete disappointment: they are at the bottom of the league with only 1 win in 12 matches. They lost their last two matches in a row (4 points at home against Karşıyaka, 21 points away against Erokspor). This dip in form puts them at a disadvantage in every game. Bursaspor's roster is more balanced and deeper: they offer variety in offense with players like Brandon Childress (point guard, assist leader), Landry Nnoko (rebounding and defensive power), and Bryant Crawford. Their bench rotation is also sufficient; reserves like Berk Akin and V.J. King can provide extra contributions. In Büyükçekmece, the burden rests on Jalen Lecque and Keye van der Vuurst. Evan Bruinsma is effective at rebounding, but the overall roster depth is low.\n\n\n\nBursaspor needs to beat this struggling opponent in this situation. The odds are quite valuable.",

Once again dominated the match and should have had at least 3 to put the game to bed but they let Brighton back in during the second half. In all honesty they only came away with the win because of one of the saves of the season from David Raya but slip cashes and we move. **FT: Arsenal 2-1 Brighton**\n\n**Event:** Portuguese Liga NOS (Soccer) - Sporting vs Rio Ave (20:30 GMT)\n\n**Today's Pick:** Sporting -2 Handicap @ 2.00 (1 unit)\n\n**Write Up:** Today's game takes us to the Portugal Liga NOS where **2nd place Sporting hosts 11th place Rio Ave**. In pursuit of 1st place Porto, Sporting will be confident in brushing aside todays opponents with the market for them to win sat at a tiny 1.09.\n\nNot only are Sporting the better team but they are playing at home in this fixture where they have been rampant all season. They have lost **only one game on home turf** and that was to 1st place Porto with their only draw at home coming to 5th place Braga. Most importantly for todays pick, their goal scoring numbers here are insane. They've scored **23 goals in 7 home games** this season whilst **only conceding 3**. That comes out to **3.29 goals per home game** as if **2.38 goals per away game** wasn't already good enough. On top of that they are only **conceding 0.43 goals a game at home** which is crucial for this pick as we need them to win by 3 goals. In Sporting's last 4 games in all competitions they have won by the following score lines: **6-0, 4-0, 3-0 and 3-0**. They are red hot right now and have even further motivation today as **3rd place Benfica** have a hard fixture against **5th place Braga** which Sporting will be hoping ends in a draw to give them some breathing space in 2nd position going into the new year. Sporting lose winger Geny Catamo and defender Diomande today to AFCON but they're not losses that will impact the team too much.\n\nRio Ave, today's visitors have lost **8 of their last 9 games against Sporting** and I doubt that'll be changing today. There is a small amount of optimism for them today though because they have gone **unbeaten in their last 4 away games** coming into today's match. I will however swiftly point out that these results came against:\n\n4th place Gil Vicente **- Draw**  \nBottom of the league AVS **- Win**  \n12th place Alverca **- Draw**  \n10th place Estrela Amadora  **- Win**\n\nTheir most recent result against Gil Vicente was something to build upon but other than that nothing all that special and certainly not a run of form that will trouble Sporting today. Away from home Rio Ave have **won only twice scoring 12 and conceding 12** in the process. That averages to **1.5 scored per away game and 1.5 conceded**. Every single part of today's matchup favours Sporting and it really is a matter of how many they will win by rather than if they will win.\n\nArguably one of the biggest pieces of today's pick actually comes in the team news for Rio Ave. **Forward Clayton** picked up a 5th booking in their last game so will **miss today's match through suspension**. This is a **HUGE** hit to the visitor's attack as they have **scored 19 goals in total in the league this season with Clayton scoring 10 of them**. This aids our handicap pick even further than the numbers do already and in all honesty I think the visitors will be lucky to get on the score sheet today.\n\nI see Sporting dominating proceedings and coming away with a win in the region of 3 or 4-0 so hopefully they can capitalise on the chances they will undoubtedly create and not make life hard for themselves like Arsenal yesterday.\n\nDo leave feedback and thoughts in the comments below as I am always open to learning. Also let me know if you're tailing and if you are BOL.\n\n*Edit: Had to paste in 2 parts because Reddit wouldn't let me paste the whole chunk straight up? Idfk*",

Burkina has a good chance to score 1 or more, so, going for the Asian line, giving us money back with 1 goal from Burkina Faso & a win with more than that.\n\nHope we start a win streak soon & BoL",

      "text": "Record: 20-7, +21.63u, 28.55% ROI\n\nForm (oldest -> newest): ✅✅✅❌✅❌✅✅✅❌✅✅✅✅✅✅✅❌✅✅✅❌✅✅❌❌✅\n\nLast Pick: HOU +8.5 v LAC, Derrick Henry o49.5 ru yd v GB, -152 on DK at time of writeup, 5u MAX BET ✅\n\nBlowout max bet winner. HOU won by 4 (but easily could have lost if LAC made kicks). Henry had over 200 yards. Love to see it after 2 losers. Let's build another big win streak.\n\nToday's Pick: D'Andre Swift o39.5 ru yd v SF, Jaren Jackson o19.5 PR v WAS, -161 on DK at time of writeup, betting 2.5u\n\nI don't love the NFL slate since I don't like betting games where teams don't have things at stake. But Swift is in a fine spot. SF has a below average defense, 22nd in EPA per rush allowed and 23rd in EPA per pass allowed. Let's look at recent games of RBs vs SF. JT had 48 on 16 carries in a game where SF went ahead early and IND was forced to pass the ball. Pollard had 104 on 14. Judkins had 91 on 23. CAR got dominated, 9 rush for 54 yards total for Rico/Chuba. ARI had no one go over 25 yards. So, what's the theme? When SF dominates a team, their opponents RBs can be limited because the gamescript is pass heavy. Since week 5, Swift has missed this line once, a weird 15 yard game against PIT. Swift and Monangai go back and forth on carries, Swift has had more carries in the past 2 games. Ben Johnson will roll in with a game plan of trying to keep the SF offense off the field - CHI is 4th in time of possession this year. Even though Caleb will have plenty of chances to exploit a vulnerable SF passing defense, he has had 30+ pass attempts all but once since week 6. Johnson knows he has a defense he can attack in multiple ways, and with WR1 Rome Odunze out for this game, he should lean on his rushing attack (4th in EPA per play) to be the primary way to generate offense and to control the clock to keep his sometimes vulnerable defense off the field. I'm not too scared of Monangai taking too much of the work, these two have been pretty split all year and Swift still sees fine output. He's the overall better and more experienced back to handle the slight majority of the road in a primetime game against a front that is not physically imposing.\n\nI spent tonight updating my NBA model after a couple recent misses. I altered weighting numbers and fixed a bug. I think this output is better. This is the model's top play. WAS allows the 29th most PR to opposing PFs. WAS aren't all of the sudden good, but they are a little better, with wins over MEM and TOR recently, and they aren't getting completely embarrassed as much. Last game, JJJ had 30 PR against them. JJJ has been taking a lot more shots after a weird 5 game spell. Jock Landale might not play, which could mean more minutes. We have a high total of 237.5, and WAS is at home, which can reduce blowout risk. JJJ should eat against a team that lacks defense. He's been hitting some 3s too, and his rebounding form is currently very strong, with 7+ rebounds in 4 of L5. He should clear 20 PR pretty easily tonight.\n\nI know -161 is not that attractive. I'm personally adding Cam Spencer o1.5 3PM to this to get it to -106 and making that bet, but that is not allowed to be a pick on this thread. So take that bit for what you will. Regardless, let's get our bag for 2.5u at -161.\n\nIf you’ve been appreciating and tailing my picks, tips are greatly appreciated! [https://buymeacoffee.com/emupicks](https://buymeacoffee.com/emupicks)",

Hurts averages 27.7 yards on the season and I predict he will hit this line against this weak Bills rushing defense. With the Eagles O-line nursing some injuries and Buffalo's respectable pass rush, Jalen Hurts will be forced to use his legs more than he would like to at this time of the season.

This uncommon flurry of points can be explained by Tony Pollard rushing for 100+ yards both games as well as Cam ward throwing 2tds in each game with NO interceptions. This really makes me think that the Titans will dominate offensively especially when the Saints average giving up 26.1 points per game while away from home. \nAs always only bet what you can afford to lose.

It was between handicap win, total points - over, and player points - funny enough from the Split team (Antonio Jordano over).\nI played all of it, but the spread still seems like the most probable choice.\n\nA month after Coach Obradovic left, Partizan still has the same problems, and the theory that players are not being professional enough and are not aware of the size and the history of the club, or they simply don't care about it, gets more and more backers in the fun base.\n\nThey have the new coach now, Joan Penarroya, and there wasn't any imminent shock therapy since they lost big at home against Maccabi at home. The idea here is that this is going to come two days after and that both the new coach and the players have to make some sort of statement with a big win here and ease the pressure from fans and the public.\n\nThey even managed to get a new player last week, Cameron Payne, 2015s 14. pick and an NBA veteran, who actually had a good debut in the mentioned loss on Friday, and was the only good thing that night.\n\nWhat gives me more confidence in a pick is the fact that Partizan, even through all their problems, managed to have 8-1 in ABA, 4-0 at home.\nSplit, on the other hand, has 0-5 in away games this season.",

Since Harden relies heavily on rim-runners (like John Collins) or kick-outs from the Restricted Area, he is running directly into Detroit's greatest defensive strength.\n\n In his last three games against top-5 assist defenses this season, Harden has averaged only 5.4 assists, failing to clear this 7.5 line in all three contests.",

They're 5-3-0 at home this season, with the most relevant games being: beating Newcastle, beating Bournemouth, drawing Aston Villa, and drawing Arsenal. Sunderland average just shy of 2 goals per match at home while only conceding just under 1. Across all comps this season Sunderland have only gone goalless in 6/18 matches, none of which have been at home. In their last 5 home matches the opposition has scored in 3 (although one of the 2 teams that couldn't score away at Sunderland was Wolves so take that as you will). BTTS has hit in 8/18 matches for Sunderland which isn't great, but 7 of the games it has hit have been at home (out of 10 games). Meaning BTTS hits in 70% of their home matches this season, while them scoring has hit in 100% of home matches this season. \n\nLeeds have been bagging LOTS of goals as of late. In their last 5 matches, Leeds have averaged 2.6 goals scored and 1.8 goals conceded (pretty ridiculous). Across the entire Premier League season Leeds average 1.5 goals per match and concede 1.8. On the road this season they do average a mere 0.88 goals scored and a crazy 2.38 goals conceded per match, but in their last 3 away matches they score 1.33 goals and concede a whopping 2.33. \n\nI've thrown quite a few numbers out there: **the morale of the story is this**: Sunderland haven't gone scoreless at home all season, they have had BTTS hit in 70% of their home games, Leeds have had BTTS hit in 67% of their matches all season (55% hit on the road) and have scored 13 goals in their last 5 matches. Sorry for the somewhat messy write up, doing this a bit frantically and I will be sleeping during this match since it's at 6am my time so wanted to just get the pick out there. Been plotting on this post the entire day but was busy with family stuff. \n\n**NOTE ON UNITS**: I am betting 5 units but would recommend 2-3. While I am confident in this and posting 5 units as that's what I'm betting and what will go towards my record, DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH. Had people mad at me for the Fulham match a few days ago because THEY DIDNT DO THEIR OWN RESEARCH. Bet responsibly!\n\n**BOL!**",

      "text": "Record: 0-0 (0 Units)\n\nGame: Philadelphia Eagles at Buffalo Bills (NFL | 4:25 PM EST)\n\nPick: Philadelphia Eagles ML (+100 | 1 unit)\n\nLong time lurker, first time commenter. Eagles ML bettors are in excellent position to take advantage of this line to pull out a relatively stress free win. \n\nFirst and foremost, the Eagles are extremely healthy right now, and will see both Jalen Carter and Lane Johnson return to the field tomorrow. Meanwhile, the Bills are struggling with injuries on the defensive side of the ball, mainly in their secondary, and are also missing two defensive tackles in Daquan Jones and Jordan Phillips. \n\nWhile the Eagles offense hasn’t been great this year, Kevin Patullo has finally started to incorporate some complexity into his game-plan over the last 3 weeks. The Eagles had led the league in curl routes and overall predictability until they played the Chargers. Since then, the Eagles have averaged around 400 yards of offense a game and have been much more fluid/consistent in general. This unit is up against a Bills defense that is not only banged up, but has let up 30+ points in 2 out of their last 3 games, and let up 20 points in that third game to a terrible Browns offense.\n\nThe real mismatch here is the Eagles defense vs the Bills offense. Cooper Dejean and Quinyon Mitchell have both been playing at a pro bowl level this year and are arguably the best cornerback duo in the league. The Bills simply dont have the firepower they need on the outside to stress this secondary out at all. Also, both Bills TEs Dawson Knox and Daulton Kincaid are still questionable to play in this game. James Cook and Josh Allen are obviously positive offensive factors for the Bills here, but this Eagles defensive unit led by Vic Fangio has faced and conquered tougher challenges than the Bills offense this year.\n\nLastly, the Bills have had one of the easiest schedules in the league so far, racking up wins against teams like the Jets, Dolphins, Browns, Saints, and Bengals. They also lost to the Dolphins and the Falcons in embarrassing fashion. The Eagles on the other hand have had one of the toughest schedules in the league, and despite their early struggles on offense, still managed to beat the Rams, Bucs, Packers, and Lions while keeping games against the Broncos and the Bears close.\n\nBoth teams are playing to win, the Eagles can still snag the second seed if they win out while the Bills are fighting for their division. This line is likely leaning toward the Bills for two reasons, they are at home, and because of Josh Allen’s ability to take over a game. \n\nObviously, anything can happen on any given Sunday, but don’t be surprised if the Eagles win convincingly tomorrow. If their offense continues to gain momentum they will be an incredibly difficult team to beat.\n\nTLDR; The Eagles defense is elite, their offense is gaining momentum, and they are very healthy. The Bills on the other hand have been having somewhat of a down year, dropping games they should have won, and are dealing with a plethora of injuries on both sides of the ball. Despite similar records between these two teams, the Eagles have faced much tougher competition.\n\nBOL",

This is a *gut play*, but I like trendy math. CMC has been **over this line in 4/5 games, with 20+ carries in his last 4 games**. Depending on how you feel about “spotlight guys”, he’s **easily covered this line in his last 3 prime time games**.\n\nI honestly don’t see a *roadblock* as much as a *speed-bump* this game - if Chicago do find a way to clog the middle, he may go back to being more involved in the passing game. His targets are “down” than they have been to start the season, but they have still been above average for a workhorse running back. **He’s has 105 touches the last 4 weeks**, so fatigue for a guy with injury history could be a factor as players try to ease into the playoffs - but I don’t see that here. Too much to play for.\n\nPlus - Chicago have been a **bottom 10 rush D all season**, and have also found themselves caught up in shootouts - that could leave those CMC trademark 10-15 yard runs to become more available to counter the deeper pass options. This game is the **highest total of the weekend**, so I expect alot of drives for us to cover this.\n\n**Last play review:**\n\n*NCAAF - Drew Mestemaker o280.5 PassY (-110) 1u* ❌\n\n(What, a, frustrating loss that was… 20 incompletions, 2 drive killing interceptions, the run game went for 368 yards on 48 carries… the game has ALL the ingredients to cover, but the details to fail.

If you watch how these two teams play, Ginebra is just a nightmare for Converge.\n\nConverge relies heavily on a \"run-and-gun,\" high-pace offense where they try to overwhelm you with speed and volume three-point shooting. The problem is, Ginebra is arguably the most disciplined half-court team in the league. They dictate the tempo better than anyone. They don't let you run; they force you to play their game, which is slower, physical, and executed through efficient set plays.\n\nDefensively, Ginebra has the length on the perimeter to bother Converge’s shooters, and they have the size advantage in the paint to control the boards. When the game slows down in the 4th quarter, Ginebra’s veteran composure usually takes over against a younger Converge squad that tends to panic when their shots aren't falling.\n\nYou also can't ignore the intangible factor of the \"Never Say Die\" crowd. It’s a Sunday game, and the Ginebra fanbase acts like a massive 6th man, especially when they have momentum. Between the crowd energy and Ginebra’s veteran composure in the 4th quarter, I trust Ginebra to control the pace, punish them inside, and cover this spread much more than a young Converge team trying to bounce back.\n\n\nBOL!",

Benfica arrive far more compact and controlled than earlier in the season, showing a consistent ability to neutralise possession-heavy opponents — particularly relevant against a Braga side that leads the league in ball retention but often struggles to convert dominance into control against top opposition. Injury-wise, Benfica travel in a healthier state than in previous months, while Braga have been carefully managing key players with heavy minutes, a concern their coach has publicly acknowledged by stressing the need for “balance” over intensity. From a tactical standpoint, Mourinho has reinforced defensive spacing and transition coverage, allowing Benfica to absorb pressure without losing structure, which naturally reduces defeat risk away from home. Braga’s own coach has admitted that his team must reach an exceptional level to overcome Benfica, underlining the fine margins expected. With Benfica approaching this fixture as a must-not-lose match in the title race, their maturity, organisation and physical condition make avoiding defeat a logical and well-supported outcome rather than a speculative one.",

Bologna have developed into a consistent attacking side, regularly scoring while still allowing chances due to their high-tempo, forward-leaning approach. Sassuolo continue to profile as one of the league’s more reliable BTTS contributors, combining attacking intent with a defence that concedes frequently against teams willing to press and transition quickly. From a data perspective, both sides rank well for shots in the box, xG created, and goals conceded per match, creating a game state that naturally supports goals at both ends. Recent meetings and overall match profiles point toward open phases of play rather than sustained control from either side.",

The Saints have been playing strong along the later stretch of the season. Yes some games have been against weaker teams like the Jets, but those solid divisional wins against Bucs and Panthers (even though they’re not the best teams in the league) have solidified that they’re on somewhat of a hot stretch. Thus, there’s no reason to think they aren’t capable of beating the Titans, a very weak team.",

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 6-15-3 *Well, that fun sure was shortlived as I go back to default settings it seems. In a game of fine margins, it was Benin that came out on top, killing our hopes of a crazy winning run before they even really started. We go again though, and I'll try my best not to notch up 7 losses in a row this time around*\n\n**Last Five:** ❌❌❌✅❌\n\n**Event:** AFCON, Gabon v Mozambique, 7:30 am EST\n\n**POTD:** Mozambique Win or Draw + Under 3.5 goals +124, 3 units\n\n**Write Up:** Gabon might be the favourites on paper, but I feel like the teams are way more evenly matched than the odds suggest and there’s a bunch of reasons for backing Mozambique to get something out of this crucial Group F encounter. Both teams began their AFCON campaigns with narrow 1-0 defeats, with Gabon losing to Cameroon and Mozambique falling to the Ivory Coast.\n\nHistorically, *Gabon do admittedly hold a slight H2H edge, having won more of the previous seven meetings.* However, the numbers aren’t overwhelmingly lopsided and include **two wins for Mozambique and a draw**. That balance alone suggests this matchup isn’t as one-sided as the odds imply and I'm here to take full advantage of that.\n\nMozambique’s tactical setup and squad have strengths that make a win or draw plausible. Players like **Geny Catamo** and **Stanley Ratifo** provide real attacking threat, and the Mambas are likely to adopt a **compact, counter-attacking approach** that's meant to sustain any pressure Gabon might throw at them and even more, suffocate their build-up play before the danger can even occur. In their opening game, Mozambique showed discipline and resilience, completing a high number of passes on both halves of the field and limiting clear chances against the heavyweights in Ivory Coast. There are also question marks over **Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang** and **Mario Lemina's** starts - expect the odds to be tipped even more in Mozambique's favor **if they don't start.**\n\nGabon, while traditionally considered to be the stronger of the two, **struggled to convert their possession and 12 shots** against Cameroon into goals, highlighting an **ongoing finishing issue.** With **Gabon’s recent inconsistency** and Mozambique needing points urgently, I can absolutely sense a tight game with Mozambique holding firm for a draw or even grabbing the win from a counter or Gabon's defensive mishap. The Mambas’ resilience and tactical discipline could easily see them avoid defeat in a potential competitive, low-scoring affair, hence **adding a cheeky Under 3.5 goals** leg to sweeten the odds some more. If you want to lower the match goals to Under 2.5 or take the BTTS Yes instead, I don't mind that either, but ultimately, the pick I feel the most confident in is the one I went with. Feeling pretty good about this one after about an hour and a half's worth of research that primarily went into the underlying data, historical context and tactical configuration, so I'm stacking 3 units on this promising play. I feel like a win here could potentially mark a crucial turning point in my fortunes. BOL and let's have us some more unforgettable AFCON fun y'all ☘️",

The Buffalo defense is one of the worst defenses in the league against the run and Saquon has scored TDs in his last 3 games and has been averaging 4, 6, 3.5, and 6 YPC in his last 4 games. \n\nThe Eagles still have a chance at the 2 seed if they win out, so this is a game that matters for them. I wouldn’t be surprised to see a long run here from Saquon.\n\nFor the Bills, ignoring last week when Judkins got hurt, Trayveon had 148 and 2 TDs, Chase Brown had 2 TDs, and Jaylen Warren had a TD in their last 3 games.\n\nGood Luck",

He had quite a few chances and it's disappointing he didnt convert for us either way. Confused and maybe a touch frustrated, we move on. Sorry friends, we've gone cold. \n\nToday we have a match between two teams promoted this season, both of which have been pleasant surprises, as 7th place Sunderland host 16th place Leeds. Sunderland have picked up many of their points by playing a stingy defense and have actually conceded the 2nd fewest goals this season (tied with Man City). They are also incredibly tough at home, having gone unbeaten thus far with a record of 5-3-0. Theyve conceded 7 goals in these 8 home games as well. Despite all of this, I'm backing a Leeds player to net against them. Here's why:\n\nCalvert-Lewin, the ex-Everton striker, has been in the form of his life. He has scored in 5 consecutive match, scoring 6 goals in theses 5 games. What makes this extra impressive is that only one of these goals was a penalty kick. He also hasn't been scoring against bottom tier competition, he has scored against three of the top 5 teams in the EPL (Liverpool, City, Chelsea), and against three of the top 5 defenses in Palace (2 goals), Chelsea, and away at Man City. \n\nI've been backing Calvert-Lewin over in the soccer thread for the past 3 weeks while he has been on this tear. Our guy is finding the back of the net through any means necessary and I like him here again at good plus money, against a tough defense. I've been cold so tail with caution, BOL to everyone and have a great Sunday.",

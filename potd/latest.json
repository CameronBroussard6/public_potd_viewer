Wolves are already done mentally from this season and Chelsea are sitting in 5th position currently. Wolves will be sitting back mostly, and Chelsea will lead the way with their chances. I do expect a great performance from Chelsea after going out vs Arsenal in the Carabao Cup, where results such as 0-2 and 1-3 are highly likely. Of course Chelsea can turn up and put a higher gear here with bigger scores such as 0-3 or higher, but we will play it safer with only -1,5 handicap here. I’m not impressed by Wolves at all and never saw it coming this season. Chelsea on the other hand keep growing and only turning out better for each season as expected from their younger purchases.\n\n\n\nI also had other games in my mind to bet on, but they didn't impress me as much as this game. They were pretty similar in terms of odds and picking style as well. My goal is to have something around the 3x odds barrier or higher. This one qualified well and we will always aim for long term gains. I will try to post another pick on Sunday as well and I really want this one to go in. But anything can happen in football and good luck everyone.\n\nBookie: **Coolbet** and a **5** unit bet. Gamble responsibly!\n\nAppreciate all the support:\n\n[https://buymeacoffee.com/longterm123](https://buymeacoffee.com/longterm123)\n\n[paypal.me/LongTerm123](http://paypal.me/LongTerm123)\n\n",

After crushing the Argentinian reserves and hitting our Saudi pick, we’re heading back to the main stage of the Liga Profesional with a high-value parlay.\n\n* **Leg 1: Rosario Central DC (vs Aldosivi) - Feb 7, 8PM (GMT)**\nCentral is the current champion and they have a world-class leader in Angel Di María. While Aldosivi is a tough nut to crack at home, Central is clearly the superior side in terms of roster depth and tactical setup. I’m taking the Double Chance (Win or Draw) here to stay safe, as Aldosivi tends to park the bus, but I don't see them winning this one.\n\n* **Leg 2: Belgrano ML (vs Banfield) - Feb 8, 01:15 GMT**\nBelgrano at home is a fortress. They’ve started the season unbeaten against very tough rivals and their attack, led by Zelarayán and Uvita Fernández, is one of the most dangerous in the league right now. They are facing a Banfield side that has struggled defensively, failing to keep a clean sheet in their last 9 matches. The home crowd and the quality gap should be enough for the 3 points.\n\n---\n\n**Support the streak:**\n*Tips are never required but always appreciated*\n[buymeacoffee.com/Francocarde123](http://buymeacoffee.com/Francocarde123)",

AUTUMN BREAK - WIN - $1.95 (Betting 3.5 units)    \n**Write up:** Going with AUTUMN BREAK today, a horse returning for its second prep and is the current second favourite for the country champs. Horse is unbeaten in all 3 runs, and is even unbeaten in trials/jump outs, with its latest one being an impressive 3 length win over a horse called SPARRING who ran quite well yesterday in a stronger race.      \n    \nHighway races can be a little messy, as it’s a big field and a lot of the form is hard to line up with a lot of different angles to compare, however I feel the best way to attack these races are with horses on the up, and catching them the first time they come to a city race. AB draws perfectly here in barrier 5, and has shown great tactical speed in all starts so we will be able to capitalise this good draw and settle in a forward position.     \n      \nAB hasn’t really been fully tested in either of it starts on good ground, and the trainer is adamant that this horse has improved over the last break, so we could see a really good performance here. We’ve also got T Clark on board, who is a natural go forward jockey, so all together I’m fairly confident with today’s pick. GL!",

Will add some personal information in this write-up as well.\n\n• ⁠Model has UNC +5.5 at 51%\n\n• Model has Houston ML at 50% \n\n•I am just going to start this writeup by saying Duke is the better team. Okay, with that said, I like my Tar-heels +10.5 here - I believe Boozer & Wilson will cancel each other out in this game - You will have Dixon on Evans, Trimble on Foster, Young on Sarr, and Veesaar on Ngongba - I really like these matchups for Carolina - I think between Wilson & Veesaar, they will limit Boozer and Ngongba on the boards - Carolina is at Chapel Hill, giving them a edge as always - I’m not saying it’s a crazy edge, but in this rivalry, whoever is home, always has a small edge - the key for the Tarheels in this one, I believe, is Stevenson, Bogavac, and Powell - these 3, if they play to their standards, will make an impact on this game - I expect Hubert to enter this game with his game-plan yet, with a focus on limiting Boozer - Backing the Tarheels in this one due to 3 things - One, they should be able to keep Duke off the boards and win the rebound game, Two, if Carolina can get out into the open floor and have some quick transition, they can control the game, Three, this game is being played at the Dean Smith Center\n\n• Houston is the better team. Houston is playing great ball, BYU is not - Although BYU has the edge at home, they are also 1-4 against ranked teams coming into this one - BYU hasn’t answered many questions this season, and although they do have the firepower, and they are home, I can’t put money on them quite yet - Houston has won 17 out of 19 games this season when they have been the moneyline favorite - In every Houston write-up, the first thing I talk about is their defense - they will be able to stop BYU’s 86.7PPG % - I think Houston’s defense will be able to slow their offense and Dybamtsa down just enough for them to cover our +7.5 - Truly, I think Houston wins this one here, but BYU is way overdue for a good showing and a win - I’m not completely sold on Wright III & Saunders yet either, if those two can put together production more consistently to help AJ out, this team will be very very dangerous - Houston’s defense averages 63 PPG, and it’s hard to not take them in any of their matchups strictly because of this - they grind out their opponents and capitalize on every mistake made \n\nPOTD History: [https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/SoggyDatabase2348-bvjHUn](https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/SoggyDatabase2348-bvjHUn)\n\nBOL!\n\n**POTD: 2 Pick Parlay: NCAAMB: UNC +10.5 vs Duke + Houston +7.5 vs BYU -132 (0.50U TO WIN 0.36U)**\n\nTips are greatly appreciated - Proceeds will be going towards my student loans and my morning cold brews.

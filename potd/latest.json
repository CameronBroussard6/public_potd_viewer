Long time tailer and first time picker with this one.\n\nEvent - NFL, Cardinals/Rams, 2:25 MST\n\nPick - Michael Wilson O5.5 Receptions -106(currently at -148 on FD) 2.5U\n\nGoing to keep my first pick short and to the point.  The cardinals are having an abysmal season and are dealing with a ton of injuries.  Wilson averaged 12.5 receptions a game when MHJ missed 2 games earlier this season, and that was WITH Dorth and Dimercado playing(they are both injured and OUT for this game, Weaver is also questionable with a DNP yesterday, MHJ is OUT).  The card are playing one of the best offenses in the Rams, and i expect them to be playing from behind and throwing the ball a ton like they have all season against lesser offenses.  Someone has to catch the ball besides McBride!\n\nI wish the Sunday picks were up earlier as there has been massive line movement.  I'm laddering this up to 10 receptions personally.  BOL!",

Rodriguez has had 90% of the 1st Quarter RB carries in Washington’s last 2 games. Rodriguez has now had 10+ carries in 3 of his last 4 games, going for 41 yards, 79 yards, & 65 yards. His one miss was when he suffered a shoulder injury vs the Lions. Last week his 41 yard performance was against the Broncos who have a top 5 run defense, allowing just 93.1 rushing yards per game. Now he faces a Minnesota defense that ranks 23rd in rushing yards allowed per game (128.4) & ranks just 20th in EPA run defense. In their past 6 games they’ve allowed:\n\nWalker 13/56, Charbs 14/52\n\nJacob’s 28/107\n\nSwift 21/90\n\nHenry 20/75\n\nMonty 11/40\n\nVidal 23/117\n\nNow they face Washington who has turned to a run first approach offense in the past month. In the first 8 weeks of the season, the Washington’s RB’s averaged 17.4 runs per game. In their past 4 games that number has shot up to 24. This week Washington gets star QB Jayden Daniels back at QB from a dislocated elbow & their offense should be firing on full cylinders. The Commanders enter the game as favorites, vs a struggling Vikings offense that ranks LAST in points per game over their last 3 games averaging just 7.7 points per game. \tMinnesota has the league's worst turnover differential (-15) & ranks LAST in the NFL in EPA pass offense over the last 8 weeks (-67.0). Minnesota does have a great pass defense. Over the last 5 weeks, Minnesota has allowed a 59.6% completion rate (7th), 6.3 yards per pass attempt (9th), & a 2.1% TD rate (3rd). Minnesota leads the NFL in 2 high safety rate (64%), which helps them limit deep passing, allowing just the 4th fewest deep yards per game (21.3) over the past 6 weeks. Their 2 high approach also allows them to limit the sidelines & specifically deeper downfield passes (2nd fewest years per game allowed to 15+ yard targets on sidelines). \n\nWith Daniels coming back from injury, the run game heating up, & Minnesota sucking on offense, Rodriguez is in line for his busiest game of the season & Vegas has not awfully adjusted his rushing props.\n\n*More write-up incoming*\n\n__Chris Rodriguez o41.5 rushing yards__\n\nAppreciate the love!

Hope someone tailed!\n\nPOTD: German Bundesliga II Hertha BSC ML -Magedburg @ 1.8 - 3 Units\n\nThis is my favorite pick of the day! My favorite team is playing, and history is in the making. Hertha are on a **7-game winning streak**, with **6 clean sheets**. Their clean-sheet streak was broken last match by a somewhat lucky long-range shot from Kaiserslautern.\n\nHertha now face Magdeburg, who sit dead last and are playing terribly. Hertha should win this comfortably. The only thing worth noting is that Hertha sometimes tend to play down to weaker opponents, but even with that in mind, I’m very confident. They have the best squad in the league, which is why I’m putting 3 units on this.\n\nAs always, everyone should do their own research and bet according to their own risk tolerance.\n\n**BOL!**",

Brighton put on a spectacle against Villa last weekend, losing 3-4, with them getting a total of 7 shots on target.

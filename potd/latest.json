Vini danced a bit and successfully ragebaited the Benfica players who ended up playing some very bland football for the rest of the match. Oh well, if I could take down Barcelona, I can get one over them eventually. Still more wins than losses in the last 5, so I’ll take this as a positive and move over to the Prem because that’s bound to produce a result for me init*\n\n**Last Five:** ✅❌✅✅❌\n\n**Event:** Premier League, Wolverhampton Wanderers v Arsenal, 3:00 pm EST\n\n**POTD:** Wolverhampton +1.5 Asian Handicap, +100, 1 unit\n\n**Write Up:** Wolves have proven **they can keep games tight** if needed and the earlier meeting of the two sides showed just that. **Arsenal needed the help of not one, but two own goals, to scrape a narrow 2-1 victory in the 94th minute.** The H2H game before this one had ended 1-1. **Away from home,** I expect the game to be even tougher for them and I just can’t see them dispatching Wolves with the way these two teams have been playing as of late. **Gyokeres, Saka and Co. just haven’t clicked** and I don’t expect this will change today. Under 2.5 goals seems like a sound play too. Just the standard unit after yesterday’s bad beat. BOL and let's enjoy Own Goal’s unpredictable magic ☘️🫡",

I expect many goals this game. However Atletico seems to just forfeit LaLiga matches completely. They spanked Betis 5-0 and Barcelona 4-0 in Copa. Rested their players vs Betis 2nd game and the Rayo game. Brugge is in great form and they beat Marseille 3-0 in the last CL game. I think the cup experience of Simeone and the Atletico players will matter more in this tie and they will get a win here. The odds are just way too good to pass up, but tail at your own risk.",

The last 7 H2H games of these 2 went over, and heavily over. Dewa has only 2/5 with under in the last 5, Borneo 3/5, but the logic is that these 2 combined are bound to play an under game, why, because it is going to be a close game. Hopefully without OT.",

Yes Qarabag has had some good displays at home this UCL season but I would say that was mostly because their opponents underestimated them. I do not see Newcastle doing the same here. Newcastle has a very solid defense that rarely gets caught up in counters which is where Qarabag shines. They have showed up against weaker opposition in this years UCL and got the most out of their match. I see them wanting to close this tie from the first leg and so they can try to rest a couple of key players on the second. \n\nArsenal is coming out of a draw against Brentford in the league and they simply cannot drop points here today. Not only because City is 4 points behind but because they are playing the worst team in the league. Not to mention they play Tottenham in the weekend so a victory here is a must. They have the quality to dismantle Wolves, without a doubt and I think they will do that. A loss/draw here might put their all season into shambles and I don’t see that happening.\n\nBOL",

Inter has significantly greater quality than their opponent and is a significantly bigger favorite in this match-up. \nAlthough Bodo/Glimt had several good results against top teams this season in the UCL, they made through the eyes of a needle, claiming 6 of the total 9 points in the last two games. \nThey are not constant in their playing form and they are unexperienced in this phase because they are qualifying for the first time in the UCL knock out stage.\nInter Milan are in a great form since the start of the season with a pick in this moment winning 8 times in the last 9 games.  They are one of the most experienced roster in the UCL at this moment, because of reaching the final 2 times in the last 3 seasons with almost the same squad.\nThey are not under big pressure in the Serie A because they are leading the table with 8 points ahead of AC Milan and they have pretty much easy schedule in the Serie A, so they can easly focus on the Champions League fixtures against the Norwegian runner-up.",

First, apologies to others who may not have this line available, I could only find it at Betano (around -180 other bookies). McDavid walks into the quarterfinals having scored 3 points in each round robin game. Coach Jon Cooper has been experimenting with his lines in practice, and it will be interesting to see if he maintains the Mc-Mac-Mack line or bump Wilson back onto Mcdavid's wing. Regardless, the top guns will all be present on the team Canada power play, attacking against Czechia's measly 57% PK on the tourney. The Czech's are playing their second game in a row after edging out the Danes to qualify, a game they were expected to win comfortably but ended up needing to play their big guns heavy minutes. This Canadian lineup is an all time great lineup that should have no difficulties in winning by 3+ goals tomorrow. Other team Canada plays such as spreads or goalscorers are solid proxies to my POTD, but getting this value compared to other bookies was a smash on McJesus. \n\n  \n[https://buymeacoffee.com/ch1cken](https://buymeacoffee.com/ch1cken)",

This is basically Arsenal in their best years and we might not be able to witness it for a very long time again. They are the favourites for pretty much everything at the moment this year. Arteta has gotten the time and resources to build up this team and its paying off its dividends now.\n\nI suspect that Arteta took of the pedal after that 4-0 score in the first half in their last game, which was against Wigan. They will look fresh to face Wolverhampton here and I honestly expect a thrashing. I do however approach this game with cautioun by \"only going\" -2,5 handicap. My expectations are 1-6, 0-6 or even 0-7. But I do want to cover other scores, such as 0-4 and 1-4 for example. There is always a game somewhere where we see a huge thrashing in the Premier League, and I think it's this game. Too much difference in quality is the reason. Even the bench of Arsenal players would start over the Wolverhampton players. That's the gap which we have at the moment. Wolverhampton must be preparing for the Championship (division 2 level) as their season is already over. They have been playing like a Championship level team this season and they might even struggle there. Another factor that plays here is the fact that Wolves will try to play their game and get severely punished by Arsenal over and over again.\n\nOn the side note: My tactics won’t change by lowering the odds to less than 2. The goal is to find high odds to play here, such as the range of 2,2 to 3,3. I’m trying to keep track of the results in all of the top leagues. We will **always aim for** **long term** gains here and make sure to manage your bankroll. I will try to post another pick in the coming days. Good luck everyone.\n\nBookie: **Coolbet** and a **5** unit bet.

Newcastle finished in 12th place, a few spots outside of the qualifying places. \n\nNewcastle have scored 3 goals or more in 3 of their UCL matches, and those were against the worst defensive teams in their schedule.

Appreciate everyone who tails - its good to finally get the wins into the double digits. Have a wonderful day folks, onto the writeup.\n\nFirstly we go to the Players Championship 2026 for Snooker. Slessor and Xintong faced off once prior in the 2025 World Championship qualifiers and it finished 8-10 in favour of Zhao, both hitting 600 shots! In terms of form they both are coming into this in relatively good form in their last 10 their records are as follows: Zhao with a 8-2 record and Elliott with a 7-3 record. Xintong recently won the World Grand Prix, currently ranked number 7 my bet is that as Slessor (22nd) is also in decent form, and going off their latest matchup we know they both have the quality it takes. A +2.5 handicap is supported by 6/10 last of Xintong's matchups either being losses or within this handicap itself. For Slessor he has 5 wins in his last 6, the loss coming by a deciding set - his confidence is high and with his record his last 10 games have either been wins or within a +2.5 handicap. His recent fixtures include wins against Mark Selby (6th), Wu Yize (12th) and a loss within the handicap to Wu Y., amongst his recent record it shows that he is capable of beating those higher ranked and if he is losing he is keeping it close. +2.5 handicap is my bet here.\n\nAC Milan sit 2nd in the league and Como sit 7th. Since 2025, Milan have won the last 3, all scoring over 2.5 goals. In Como's 11 away games they have a record of 5-3-3, unbeaten in the last 3 in the league although they were at Pisa (19th), Lecce (17th) and Lazio (9th). Before these two away games were games at Roma 1-0 (4th) and Inter 4-0 (1st), both defeats to similar strength teams to AC Milan. As for AC they boast a home record of 7-3-1, unbeaten in their last 10 in the league. For the reverse fixture at Como, Milan came away with the 3 points finishing 3-1 on 15th Jan. AC with the home advantage should claim a draw or take away a win here, it should be a tough game either way but I am backing AC win or draw.\n\n**BOL and always bet what you can afford to lose!**",

Atmane in my opinion is the streakiest player on tour as his all-out-attack style is obviously inconsistent as hell but when it’s firing he can literally be unplayable. We have only really see him play like this once at the top level when he reached the Cincinnatti masters semis from qualifying and has unsurprisingly been playing fairly poorly since. He picked up just his second win in 11 matches against Kypson in round 1. On the other hand Cobolli, similar to last year, is having a disastrous start to the season. In 2025 it was a 1-8 start and 2026 is looking no better having been battered in his three matches so far against players outside the top 100. Not ideal for a player who’s 20th in the world.\n\nCobolli doesn’t like to be rushed (hence why he struggles on the fast courts that he’s been playing on this year) whilst Atmane’s massive swinging is error prone. With the courts being slower, I expect Cobolli to be the small favourite but I feel this match is going to depend on the first set dynamic. If Terence comes out firing in S1 I don’t see Flavio, being completely out of form and confidence, putting up too much of a fight to claw his way back into the game especially if the Frenchman is untouchable on serve. On the other hand, Atmane has a tendency to fully lose his ways when things aren’t going his way and then it gets ugly as the match progresses, hitting error after error similar to a Paire would do (semi-tanking). He only really gives his best when he’s winning and the only reason he stuck around against Tiafoe and Kypson is because he won the first set. Both players see very little long matches because of these profiles, Cobolli has seen U2.5 sets in 12/13 matches (8/8 losing S1) and Atmane in 13 of his last 17 matches (cleared in 9/12 losing S1, exceptions Sinner and Fritz since he typically loves a big game and Vukic in front of his home crowd in Paris) since their match in Cincy. That match did quite literally go the distance but the conditions were different and both players were in quite different form so I strongly doubt that happens again. Flavio hasn’t won a set when losing S1  I would have fairer odds closer to 1.5. BOL !",

The first tournament they added Zweih, they went 4-0 on Mirage, they beat Spirit, Falcons, Aurora and FURIA all without giving up double digits\n* This tournament has been a disaster for PARIVISION on Mirage, they have played the map 3 times and are 0-3 on the map so far this tournament losing each of the last 3 days in one sided fashion. They lost to G2 13-8, FaZe 13-2 and FURIA 13-8, while none of these teams are \"bad\" at Mirage, none of them are top teams/stand outs on the map in my opinion either. They have lost 69% of rounds in the last 3 days on Mirage and yet to win a pistol round on Mirage for the entire tournament, with low 30% winrate on both CT and T side\n* FUT are 86% winrate on 22 maps of Mirage in the L3 months, they are 7-1 in the last month overall. They are just coming off an insane 13 winstreak on this map, they lost to MOUZ today but I think their is a lot they can take from that series to help them here, I think FUT will look back at that game and feel like they beat themselves more then that MOUZ heavily outplayed them. \n* As said FUT were on a 13 map winstreak on Mirage before today, they have beaten multiple teams this tournament already on Mirage including Astralis, FURIA, Aurora, they also beat G2 and Astralis earlier in the month, these are two of the teams that PARIVISION have gotten destroyed by the last two days\n* Think the main two things lacking against MOUZ after they got their 7-2 lead was they got very sloppy/off script on T side, and got antsy on CT side and were trying to make too many plays and get too much info. These are things PARIVISION are great at punishing with Jame's system, so this gives FUT strong footage to review and use. On top of this, PARIVISION were the last game of the day and FUT knew that if PARI lost they would face them tomorrow, so they were watching today map 3 when FURIA and PARIVISION faced on Mirage and watched them get picked apart.

Arsenal are the only prem team playing midweek this week which after dropping points against Brentford would mean they have a quick opportunity to respond. Arsenal are coming into this after a 4-0 attacking display against Wigan and will look to carry that performance on with key players like Saka and Saliba returning from injury. I expect a similar performance to their away game against Leeds.\n\n\\---\n\nWolves are coming off facing 10 shots on target against 17th placed Nottm Forest who literally sacked their manager after the game… I expect home ground to give wolves a boost but this Arsenal side will look to be as clinical as can be and look for an early lead, force wolves to press up, and kill it off with a second. Also Arsenal set peices against relegation teams is just too good.\n\n**---**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t0t25rns15kg1.jpeg?width=1320&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9100002a294c80f44562d1004ac2b556f6ef55d3\n\n**BOL**",

Atletico also seem to be focusing on Copa del Rey, which doesn't mean that they won't try to win here but they've been underperforming in other competitions including CL.",

      "text": "Last 5 POTD : ✅️✅️✅️✅️✅️\n\n**Previous pick**: Switzerland vs Italy under 6.5 goals (+100) (Went exactly like expected, Switzerland put up a lot of shots but their firepower is not the same as Sweden or Finland to blowout the Italians!)\n\n**POTD Record**: 28-21\n\n**Today's Pick:** Finland vs Switzerland 12:10 pm EST (Olympics/Men's Hockey)\n\nFinland Puck line -1.5 (+125)\n\nStill perfect in these Olympics! These odds seems pretty high for a Finland win by 2. Like I said in the previous POTD, Finland has a **full NHL line-up** while Switzerland only have 9 NHL players and the rest of the team plays in the Swiss league. Combine this with the fact that Switzerland played today while the Finland coaching team was watching them and finding ways to exploit their weaknesses it feels like an obvious win for Finland tomorrow. \n\nSwiss goalie Leonardo Genoni will be in net for sure and he's 38 years old. I know he didn't stop too many shots today vs Italy but tomorrow vs Finland it will be way different. There's a big difference between an NHL shot and an Italian player shot and I don't think the old goalie playing both back-to-back games will be ready to stop this Finland offense that destroyed Italy 11-0 and Sweden 4-1. Meanwhile Finland will have Juuse Saros in net, a proven number #1 goalie in the NHL that has played better and better each game and now hasn't allowed a goal in the last 95 minutes he was on the ice.\n\nFor me it goes down to 2 scenarios that could happen. First one is Finland destroys a less skilled team that played the day before and just can't keep up with them. Second one is Switzerland keeps it close but Finland the much better team and greater NHL experience manages to take the lead and then Switzerland pulls out their goalie and Finland ends it in an empty net. I just don't see Switzerland taking the lead tomorrow in any way except maybe in the first period when it's 0-0. Finland is on a 2 win streak where they dominated their opponents so they come with full confidence which will be important in a win or go home situation. They also have big expectations in Finland with the country winning the gold in 2022's Olympics so a quarterfinals loss would be nothing but a big dissapointment for them. (I know it's not the same roster from 2022 but still this roster is definitely confident enough that they can aim for a medal)\n\nBOL!\n\nIf I made you some money during these Olympics and you'd like to tip!\n\n[Buymeacoffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/lordestros)",

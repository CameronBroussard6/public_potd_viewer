Projected minutes sit at \\~34.2 in a core role during a close game according to the spread. His season average is 7.2, and recent form is elevated (10.6 L5), suggesting increased facilitation responsibility.\n\nVariance is relatively tight (std dev ±1.9), and the distribution centers above 6.5 even with a slight negative opponent adjustment (-2.2%). At -145 range, the model indicates value relative to implied probability.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cvfsd90x2zkg1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2ba7fb266ef6c77bcd950c0a76091a9d56e2d0c7",

      "text": "\nPrevious: \n\nRockets @ Knicks OVER 214.5 (-105) ❌\n\nTough one.\nTracked perfectly most of the night — pace was there, shot volume was there, just needed a normal close. Then Houston went completely cold late and it died out.\n\nAbsolute pain… Shamet misses the free throw with 1 second left that would’ve pushed us over. Brutal hook. \n\n\n**Record** : 4–7\n\n**Net Units** : -2.46u\n\n\n\n🎯 **POTD**: \n\nGui Santos OVER 11.5 Points (+105) *Fanatics*\n\n**Units** : 2u\n\nThis is strictly a minutes + role play.\n\nSantos isn’t stuck in that early-season 12–15 minute role anymore. Over this recent stretch he’s consistently seeing high-20s to low-30s minutes, and when he’s getting that kind of run he’s producing like a legit rotation scorer — hovering around 14 PPG and clearing this line regularly.\n\nWhen he hits 26+ minutes, the path is simple. He’s getting enough shot attempts, transition looks, and second-unit usage where 12 points is just a normal night. Warriors have been comfortable keeping him out there in competitive rotations and he’s been aggressive offensively.\n\nThis line still feels priced off his old usage, not what his role looks like right now.\nIf the minutes hold, this projects in that 12–16 range again.\n\nPlus money on a guy trending over with steady run is value I’m taking.",

For those that took just BTTS good choice also, appreciate everyone who tailed - not much we can do about the red card and losing a 3-0 lead. Like I've mentioned its not often I go 0-2 (lets hope I didn't jinx it) so I usually place both in singles to hedge against a total loss! For those who are asking how to get me a coffee or a section where I post my picks, I don't have either as of yet but if there is more traction for either then I will look into making one. Lets keep the ball rolling here for you all - have a wonderful day everyone!\n\nFirst up is German top flight football, with SC Freiburg (8th) hosting Monchengladbach (14th) - this league is made from 18 teams for those who aren't aware. Their head-to-head results are as follows: 4(SC Frei)-5(Draws)-1(Mon), with SC Freiburg unbeaten in the last 9! faceoffs, this however changes when we look at home fixtures for SC Freiburg going 5-5(W/D) with their last 5 fixtures resulting in 4 draws and the LATEST resulting in a win, in 2024 albeit. The reverse fixture away at Monchengladbach was a 0-0 draw. Now whilst those stats don't sound too convincing here lies my main reasoning for this pick: recent forms are that SC Frei are 2-1-2 (W/D/L) in their last 5 and Mon are 0-3-2 (W/D/L) both home and away, Mon are now winless in 6. Moving onto their respective home and away forms it looks like this: SC Frei at home in this league are 4-1-0 in their last 5 and Mon are 0-2-3 in their last 5 away. Even with the two draws for Mon they have come against Bremen (16th) and HSV (11th), with their latest loss coming from 7th place Frankfurt 3-0. Whilst SC Frei beat Bremen a man down 1-0 last home game, as well as their only draw coming against second place Dortmund (albeit with a red card in the 53rd minute). Based off better current form, home advantage that has proved Freiburg are a much different team home and away, as well as Monchengladbach's poor current form, I see Frei taking the needed 3 points to build a lead on the teams below them, especially as their away form is so poor. I've chosen them to win outright purely for the value but for a securer line and something for more of a bankroll builder SC Freiburg or Draw could be the pick for you.\n\nSecond leg is in the Italian top flight where Roma, 4th, are hosting 15th place Cremonese. In their last 5 head-to-heads in all competitions it is 3(Roma)-0 draws-2 Cremonese. Current form is as follows: Roma are 5-2-3 (W/D/L), 2-2-1 in their last 5 - Cremonese are 0-4-6 in their last 10, 0-2-3 in their last 5. Onto current home/away forms: Roma are 4-1-0 at home in their last 5, Cremonese are 0-1-4 in their last 5 away fixtures. Roma themselves are in great current form, Malen in particularly is on fire scoring 5 in his last 5 appearances, scoring 1.15 per 90 minutes he is getting. For a team that is hot form, taking over 2 points per game from their home games against a poor travelling, bottom half team I see Roma seeing this out and continuing their fine home form. Not overthinking this too much - home advantage, players in good form, weak travelling team on a 11 game winless streak should prove too much for Cremonese and Roma seeing this through.\n\nI appreciate the those who tail - those asking how to get me a coffee or if I post other picks elsewhere if more ask for these I'll look into them both. Have an awesome day folks lets keep this streak going!\n\n**BOL and always bet what you can afford to lose!**",

Both teams are banged up, but Palace still has strong weapons in spite of that. I feel confident in Palace to win relatively comfortably.",

In the last game he scored a comfortable 50 and scored our required target of 20 runs in the first three overs . Being the only batsman who played well from the Pakistani side in the previous game i think he will take it slow and be extra cautious in not losing his wicket which will help our bet to be completed.",

After their recent success at BLAST Slam, their coordination in the mid-to-late game remains superior to BetBoom’s often chaotic playstyle. While they drew 1-1 with BetBoom just a few days ago in Group Stage 1, Liquid historically tightens their gameplay as tournaments progress into the second stage. BetBoom is talented but prone to mid-game collapses, expect Liquid's disciplined drafting, superior macro and objective control to secure the series win here.\n\nFalcons looked untouchable in their 2-0 win yesterday, but Aurora is a notorious bracket spoiler. Aurora has a unique, aggressive playstyle that often catches top-tier teams off guard in the opening map. Even if Falcons win the series, Aurora taking just one map is a very high-probability outcome given their recent form and the draft variety they bring to Bo3s.\n\n​BOL.\n\nhttps://buymeacoffee.com/222benz",

Throughout Swiss press this month, coach Gerardo Seoane has publicly expressed frustration with his side’s inconsistent performances and defensive issues, describing the team’s recent displays as uncompetitive and acknowledging clear faults that need fixing – especially discipline and defensive focus – which signals a strong tactical emphasis this week to tighten up and control phases better than in previous matches. That’s important: Seoane isn’t complacent, he is demanding basics be right and pushing his squad to “stop looking upwards and do fundamentals correctly,” a phrase Swiss media reported from players commenting on his messaging. In contrast, FC Sion coach Didier Tholot has stressed steady progress and collective ambition to climb the table into the Top-6, highlighting confidence gained from recent positive results and collective improvement. But Sion’s mindset is one of consolidation and resilience, not outright dominance, and they remain burdened by injuries and suspensions in key defensive areas that restrict how proactive they can be early in games. With Young Boys’ coach publicly pushing for stronger defensive discipline and greater intensity after recent lapses, and Sion still reshuffling due to absences, Young Boys should have the edge in tactical motivation and urgency — a convincing argument for backing them more confidently.\n\n",

If I can get McDavid and MacKinnon together on a discount, I’m going to take it.\n\nThen there is the story of the 2 goalies. Big game Binnington had some excellent saves in the QF game against Czechia (big one in OT) and a couple saves against Finland to keep Canada in the game. I trust the former Stanley Cup winner over Hellebuyck, who has yet to prove he can win the big one. Of course, he certainly has the skills and potential to get it done.

Espero un partido muy disputado, donde la experiencia de Leonessa puede superar a la juventud de Beleza.\n\nHistóricamente, Leonessa es un rival que se le resiste a Beleza, y al cual no ha conseguido batir en los últimos 5 enfrentamientos directos.",

Sanga had a sensational season last year and nobody really expects them to follow up that 3rd place.\n\nAvispa Fukuoka drew 1-1 against Okayama in the opener, before Cerezo beat them 2-0 at home. I have Avsipa to finish last in this West group, there is just very little about this team that inspires anything. They averaged less than a goal a game last year and over the winter they have lost some key players without replacing them with anybody noteworthy. The manager has also left after last season after being accused of power harassing yet again and the replacement hasn’t done anything special before this to inspire confidence. \n\nIt would be really fuckings frustrating if Kyoto Sanga can’t win this game by just scoring a single goal. The guests here really do look clueless and poorly coached. My guess is another 2-0 defeat for Avispa.\n\n",

Arsenal are chasing the Premier League title after 22 years, while Tottenham after a great start of the season now  can't find a way to escape the relegation zone.\nArsenal are in front of the first serious test in the title race after drawing against Wolves. If they don't manage to win at Tottenham, after whole 22 matchweeks there is a big chance for them to lose the first place in the near future because of the tougher schedule rather than Man. City.\nAlthough in this kind of derbies statistics don't matter a lot and the mentality in front of the games is the key, Arsenal dominated in their last Premier League meeting and won in the last 3 Premier League games at Tottenham away.\nIn addition, in Sunday Igor Tudor will make a debut as the new manager of Tottenham.",

Onto the next. \n\nToday’s Pick: Iowa vs Wisconsin/ Wisconsin ML (-148) 4u\n\nWrite up: Part of what makes Vegas so profitable is how reactive the average Gambler is. A lot of gamblers would see Iowa fresh off a win against Nebraska and Wisconsin fresh off of a loss and scratch their head here. Let’s present the facts. Iowa is 3-5 on the road. Iowa is 1-5 against teams ranked in the AP Poll. Iowa’s offense has looked horrible to say the least recently. And what made Iowa win last game was how they schemed against the Huskers offense. It’s easy to prey on a team when you’re on your home court. But I just can’t see the Hawkeyes being able to scheme quite as well on the road. Especially with how potent this Badger offense can be. The only way, and I emphasize only, the Hawkeyes can control this game is if Wisconsin is lousy with the basketball. Otherwise I don’t see a sputtering offense marching in on the road and dismantling a Badgers team in need of a win. Wisconsin is currently a tournament team but nothing is guaranteed. A loss here hurts BAD, and we all know winning on the road is extremely hard to do, ESPECIALLY with a struggling offense. Stirtz is phenomenal, but he’s gonna need a lot of help tomorrow. Thanks to those tailing. Only gamble what you can afford to lose, let’s have a good weekend everyone! \n\n\nIf you’d like to buy me a beer: [Venmo](https://venmo.com/u/Jay-Lawton-1) [CashApp](https://cash.app/$jaylaw930)",

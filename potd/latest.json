That’s the POTD if you have access to FD.\n\nOn DraftKings it’s -251. Vassell has hit this in 8 straight. Let’s rob FanDuel together while the line is there. Best of luck.",

Just got some time before the match starts.\n\nCatanzaro come into this match as slight favorites and their recent results justify that, as they have won 7/9 last matches. However, defensive consistency has been an issue. They’ve conceded in 9 of their last 11 matches, including 7 of the last 9 at home.\n\nCesena arrive in strong overall form and are proving very difficult to beat. They’ve lost just 2 of their last 10 matches, and their attacking reliability stands out, scoring in 15 of 17 matches this season, including 7 of 9 away. Defensively, though, they also show clear weaknesses, having conceded in 8 of their last 9 away matches.\n\nThink the BTTS is a decent shout & expect to see goals in both ends.\n\nHope we continue our wins & BoL",

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 6-6 (L3: ✅❌❌)\n\n**LAST PICK:** AS Monaco vs. Real Madrid **UNDER 174.5** (EuroLeague) ❌\n\n**TODAY'S PICK:** Baskonia -9,5 vs. San Pablo Burgos (ACB)\n\n**ODDS:** 1.74 / -135\n\n# Reasoning:\n\nThis pick is based on structural trends and measurable performance gaps rather than narrative or subjective motivation.\n\nFor context, in the ACB the **Copa del Rey** is played by the **top 8 teams after the first 17 games** of the regular season. Baskonia currently sit in that **5th–8th range**, meaning they are in a direct fight to secure a Copa spot. At this stage of the season, games at home against bottom-tier opponents are especially important, because dropping them can immediately push a team out of the top eight.\n\nLooking at league-wide trends, teams ranked between **5th and 8th** playing **at home** against teams ranked **14th or lower** win roughly **76% of the time**, with an **average winning margin of about +11.8 points**. This shows that spreads around double digits in this matchup profile are not inflated by the market, but reflect how these games typically play out over 40 minutes. With the line set at **-9.5**, the spread is actually below the historical average margin for this exact scenario.\n\nDefensively, the gap between these two teams is clear and quantifiable. Baskonia allow approximately **88.9 points per game**, close to league average, while San Pablo Burgos are conceding **96.8 points per game**, the **second-worst defensive mark in the ACB**. That means Burgos are giving up more than **eight points per game above league average**, a deficit that consistently leads to lopsided results when they face teams with above-average offensive talent, particularly away from home.\n\nDepth is another major separator and one that shows up clearly in the numbers. Baskonia regularly use **nine to ten players** for double-digit minutes, with their bench contributing around **32 points per game**. Burgos, by contrast, rely heavily on a **seven-man rotation** and generate only about **21 points per game from their bench**. That’s an **eleven-point gap in second-unit production**, which becomes critical in games where runs and momentum swings are common.\n\nThis difference in depth is reflected even more strongly in second-half performance. Burgos away from home are outscored by an average of **4.1 points in the first half**, but that deficit expands to **9.3 points in the second half**. Baskonia, meanwhile, tend to **improve their margin at home by roughly 5.6 points after halftime**. That divergence suggests Burgos struggle to sustain defensive intensity and physical output over 40 minutes, while Baskonia are more likely to create separation as the game progresses.\n\nFrom a matchup perspective, Baskonia play at a higher offensive tempo at home and are among the better transition-scoring teams in the league. Burgos have had ongoing issues with defensive balance, close-outs, and containing pace once games speed up. When forced to defend multiple possessions in quick succession, their short rotation and poor defensive metrics tend to show up quickly on the scoreboard.\n\nPutting all of this together, the **-9.5 line at 1.74** aligns well with the underlying data. The historical margin for this matchup tier sits close to +12 points, Burgos’ defensive numbers are among the worst in the league, the bench differential alone approaches double digits, and second-half trends consistently favor Baskonia pulling away rather than managing a narrow lead. This isn’t a play built on vague motivation, but on repeatable statistical patterns.\n\nThe main risk, as with any spread of this size, is late-game variance or an unusually hot shooting night from Burgos, particularly from three-point range. Outside of that scenario, the statistical profile supports Baskonia winning this game by a comfortable margin more often than not. Let's try again, u/alex88-",

He returned earlier than expected (dumb move ) and was clearly on a short leash, playing only 25 minutes against the Knicks.\n The Logic: To clear a 26.5 PRA line, Mobley typically needs 32–34 minutes of action. In his return game, he shot an incredibly efficient 75% (6-of-8) and still only finished with 26 PRA (14 Pts, 9 Reb, 3 Ast), barely missing the under even with a perfect shooting night. Today with a The Houston Rockets have transformed into one of the elite defensive units in the NBA this season. \nTop 3 Defense: Houston currently ranks 3rd in the NBA in Defensive Rating and 3rd in Opponent Points Allowed. They’re also are top-tier at defending the restricted area. Since Mobley scores the vast majority of his points in the paint, he’ll be fighting against Houston’s length and physicality all night. historical & Performance Trends\n Previous Matchup: In their last meeting on November 19, Mobley played 36 minutes (much higher than he will play today) and recorded only 24 PRA (18 Pts, 6 Reb, 0 Ast).\n Efficiency Regression: As mentioned, he shot 75% in his last game. It is highly unlikely he maintains that efficiency against a Houston defense that ranks 10th in Opponent FG%, meaning his scoring total is likely to drop even further today.",

I like riding with these two teams as both of their opponents have very notable opt outs and injuries with both East Carolina and Connecticut playing without their starting quarterbacks so I see these two teams struggling mightily without their starting signal callers suiting up for these bowl games. East Carolina will be without their starting runningback, London Montgomery, wide receiver Yannick Smith, tight end Jayvontay Conner, starting left tackle Jimarion McCrimon and most importantly quarterback Katin Housee so with all of these missing pieces on offense I dont see them being able to move the ball on this Pittsburgh defense that is 8th in the nation in rush defense and allowing less than 25 points per game so I see the Panthers running away with this one. Connecticut is also getting killed by opt outs in this one as they will be without starting left tackle Ben Murawski, starting right tackle, Cartsen Casady, starting right guard, Brady Wayburn, starting tight end Juice Vereen, starting cornerback Cam Chadwick, starting linebacker Oumar Diomande, starting defensive lineman Vincent Carroll-Jackson and most importantly quarterback Joe Fagnano. Army on the other hand does not have a single player opting out or in the transfer portal so I see the continuity of this team being a big plus for Army in this one. As we all know Army runs the ball more than anyone in the nation being a service academy that runs the triple option and this Huskies defense is quite terrible against the run ranking 115th in the nation in yards allowed on the ground per game allowing almost 200 rush yards per game so I see the Black Knights gashing the Huskies on the ground in this one. With all of this into consideration I do not a path to where Pittsburgh and Army lose in their bowl games.\n\nPrediction: 30-17 Pittsburgh, 24-16 Army\n\nLast pick: 🏈Cowboys -3/Lions -3💩Jared Goff got outplayed by Max Brosmer, he deserves coal in his stocking for that Christmas performance.\n\nBest of luck to everyone tailing and remember to bet responsibly!

McBurnie had some good chances, but I think the guy should retire.  All Hull players looked dead, I feel their minds are already in Dubai.\n\nToday's Writeup: Alright let's head to the Scottish Premiership.  Hearts are top of the table this season and have only lost one game all season to Aberdeen, an outlier in my thoughts.  They have beaten both Rangers and Celtic, both away as well: 1-2 at Celtic and a cleansheet 0-2 at Rangers.   They average about 6.5 shots on target in away matches, and have scored in every match this season bar Aberdeen and Motherwell.  In their last 4 matches they have scored 7 goals so they are not goal shy.  Hibs on the other hand are sitting at 5th and have only won 3 out of their 8 home matches this season.  They can score, but coming up against better opposition they dont fare well.  For this reason I am going with the Hearts DC play.  \n\nI will also go with total under 7.5 cards:  This season Hibs have never had more than 3 cards ever in any of their games.  Their last 8 games they have had 1,3,2,2,1,2,1,1 cards for themselves.  Historically this game usually never sees more than 5 cards except for in May 2023, there were 10 yellows and one red, and 9 in 2022 which also had a red.  Let's hope there's no reds tomorrow.\n\nBest of luck.",

The line doesn’t reflect this because Green Bay technically could get home field advantage in the playoffs if they win their next 2 games and a few other outcomes occur. Both teams expected to start their backup QBs, although Raven’s star QB Lamar Jackson is not ruled out just yet. Regardless if Lamar plays, Willis, Packer’s back up did not practice a couple of days ago due to illness and is dealing with a hurt throwing shoulder from an injury last week (Dec 20). Along with that, Josh Jacobs, Packer’s star RB has been playing on an injured knee and was just upgraded to active for tomorrow. With the playoffs just weeks away, surely they won’t give Jacobs a huge work load, thus putting pressure on Willis’ hurt throwing arm to do more work. Ravens probably win out right here, but I’ll take the +3.5 just in case. GG!",

This has hit for Chelsea in 3/5 of their last games and 16/25 matches this season. Given Chelsea aren't the greatest at home this season in the Prem (being 4-2-2, 13th in the league) I can see them wanting a statement game against Villa, especially with Palmer being back to action. They average 1.5 goals per match at home, and allow just short of 1. Only finding 1 win in their last 5 league games, they really need to secure some points to keep their top 4 hopes alive. \n\nVilla on the other hand have been incredible this year. Being 4-2-2 away from home, and averaging 1.5 goals per match away while conceding 1.38. This looks great for the bet we have today. This line has hit in 6/7 of their last away matches across all comps. Most notable in a 2-3 victory over West Ham in their last away match. \n\nTo be completely honest, the reasoning behind this bet is quite simple: both team will indeed score and one of them is leaving with 3 points. I wouldn't be surprised with a 2-2 but the quality of these teams just screams 2-1 either way to me. Sad I couldn't bet the City -1 because that was going to be my pick but we've been cashing with the Villa bets recently. \n\n**BOL!**",

Keegan Murray is the only player the Kings refuse to trade and is currently the face of the kings franchise and is one of the best wing defenders, Keegan has held Bam to low points, held KD to 8-21 from the field, in other words he is a very capable defender. The problem is he is injured, and Cooper flagg is 6,9 at SF and the kings roster has no one that can defend Washington at PF and Cooper Flagg at SF. Furthermore Kings are ranked 11th in Pace and Dallas is ranked 6th in Pace. The real beauty is the Kings being 27th in defensive rating allowing 119.4 PPG so it seems to me that this will be a fast paced game. Not too concerned for a blow out either as the spread is set at -2.5. Considering that Anthony Davis is out, I'm assuming Flagg will be more aggressive and have the green light to chuck up a fair few more shots then usual. We also saw how against Golden State when AD was injured he can take advantage of mismatches and make the right play. \n\nPersonally I have put 2 units due to the fact that his line just seems wrong at 34.5 as it should be probably be more around 35-36.5, Additionally I would not take this if not this original line just due to how Cooper is a pretty bad FT shooter on the road currently. Feel free to say why you don't like this bet either so I can improve as I go on.",

He is over this line in 8 of L10, and one of those misses was due to limited minutes in a blowout against the Kings. \n\nMagic are right in the middle of the league (#16) in terms of 3PM given to opposing point guards, but are worse defensively without Wagner and Suggs, both still injured. And with undersized Wendell Carter guarding Jokic, ORL will be forced to double-team creating more kick-out threes. \n\nFor Denver, With AG, Braun, and now Cam Johnson injured, Murray is taking on more of those shots. \n\nIn their only prior matchup last week with nearly the same active players, Murray went 7/12 from three. I'm not expecting the same level of shooting here but given Murray's confidence, shooting ability, this matchup, and his team's need for him to put up points, getting to at least 3 3PM seems pretty reachable.",

It is the perfect setup because Chelsea loves to push their defense way too high, which is exactly what Villa wants so they can feed Morgan Rogers and Watkins on the counter and just cook them with speed.

Three of us here had the same read and, while I think it was a good read, United went full bus park as soon as they scored their first goal. Cunha had one more great chance but scuffed the open shot. Definitely getting cold as these mid season matches are proving to be volatile. \n\nBut we keep trying. Declan Rice, my favorite Arsenal player to back, has all of the traits I look for in backing a player - he runs hard, crashes the box, likes to shoot from range, and chases everything. We've already cashed with Rice back in November at similar odds, and I really like him here again today. Arsenal are big favorites in this match, will have a lot of the ball, and will hopefully take a lot of shots. \n\nRice has had 1+ SOT in 7 of his last 9 EPL matches. Interestingly enough the two he missed were both away matches. This line has cleared in 5/5 of his last home EPL matches (7/7 if you include Champion's League and cup matches). He has been shooting more frequently lately, averaging over 2 shots per game. While he doesn't take a high volume of shots, he has a high percentage of his shots that hit the target. \n\nI expect Brighton to have a tough time here. They are not a team that parks the bus well and they will feel they need to get some shots in to take something from this game. They will be open to the counter, which is another angle where Rice can hurt them. \n\nBOL everyone, let's start the weekend strong!",

It's Emanuel Wilson time. Packers are still in the hunt for that 2nd seed, needing the bears to lose their next two and for Packers to win out. This week shouldn't be a struggle assuming that Lamar isn't in.\n\nWilson's been crushing it when he needs to, getting 82 yards last week against the bears, and putting up over 100 yards against the Vikings when Jacob's was out. His average is just below this line at 29.2 yards but I believe he's going to get more carries. Again, Josh Jacob's has been playing through injury and was less relied on in the 2nd half versus the bears. Meanwhile, Malik Wilis has been going through some shoulder issues. I'm sure he wouldn't be playing if Clayton Tune wasn't the backup, and if Clayton Tune is the one to start, he'll be heavily relying on his rbs, ala Jacob's n Wilson.\n\nWhile the line is only sitting at -3.5 for the Packers, it's a home game against a mediocre Ravens team with a backup qb. I expect a lot of rushing from both sides with Henry and Wilson being the stars.

Bet 2.5u\n\nWriteup: Betting on the first of the Saturday NFL games and taking Herbert under his passing prop. Frankly, I don’t understand this line at all to the point where I feel like Vegas knows something I don’t. Before looking at this line, I thought for sure this would be under 200 yards. In theory, I would put 5u or more on this, but we’ll lay down half of that for this one. Here’s the thought process.\n\nThe Chargers are coming into this one winning 4 of their last 5 and 7 of their last 8. They have already clinched a playoff spot and still have something to play for to improve their seeding. However, their one glaring weakness is their offensive line. With multiple starting tackles out due to injury, Justin Herbert is getting pressured at the 3rd highest rate in the league and has and has one of the lowest average times in the pocket before pressure in the league. Because of this, his top receiver has had under 45 yards in 5 straight games. \n\nNow let’s look at the opponent. The Houston Texans started off 0-3, but are since then 10-2 and are almost guaranteed a playoff spot. Much of their success has been due to their absolute shut-down defense, with their offense finally starting to string games together. Unfortunately for Justin Herbert, the Texans defense get pressures at top 5 rate in the league. \n\nWe have also already seen this matchup in the playoffs last year. Herbert had no time in the pocket, was sacked 4 times, threw 4 interceptions, and lost 32-12. Herbert did get over 211.5 yards in this game, but this was largely due to game script and having 2 deep bombs to a wide receiver. Besides this, Herbert had nothing.\n\nWith a low over/under of 39.5 and the Chargers still being slightly favored at home, I expect the Chargers to want to establish their run game against a Texans defense that will make Herbert’s life a living hell. This could get really ugly for Herbert, and I don’t see him getting over 212 passing yards in this one.\n\nRemember to only bet what you can afford to lose, and BOL!",

Zimbabwe looked great out there and if anything, deserved to win on the balance of play in the 2nd half. Big thanks to everyone who remained supportive during this atrocious run. Having said that, I'm definitely not getting ahead of myself - after all, a broken clock is still right twice a day, and my mission now is to prove that I'm not just a broken clock. We're sticking to AFCON for this one because surely we can't leave this beautiful tournament after it just served us a winning pick*\n\n**Last Five:** ❌❌❌❌✅\n\n**Event:** AFCON, Benin v Botswana, 7:30 am EST\n\n**POTD:** Botswana Win or Draw + Under 3.5 goals +130, 4 units\n\n**Write Up:** While Benin come into this group stage game as the more established side on paper, I think there are very real reasons to believe Botswana can spoil the party and win, **or at least take a point** from today's matchup. This is the first competitive meeting between the two nations, which immediately removes the usual head-to-head bias that often favors the bigger name. With no historical dominance to lean on, the game becomes far more about current form, match context, and tactical execution, which are all areas where Botswana quietly actually make a strong case.\n\nBotswana’s opening match result might not look encouraging at first glance, but context matters. Against tournament powerhouse Senegal, Botswana were under heavy fire for long periods at a time, yet still showed remarkable defensive resilience and structure. Their goalkeeper, **Goitseone Phoko,** delivered one of the standout individual performances of the tournament so far, notching up an astonishing **14 saves,** the highest tally recorded in a single AFCON match this edition. That performance alone suggests Botswana are capable of frustrating opponents who struggle to convert possession into goals. And here's where Benin's attacking struggles come into play, really making this pick stand out to me.\n\nBenin head to this fixture with **serious attacking concerns**. They've failed to score in **three consecutive matches** across all competitions and have looked anything but decisive in the final third. Even against weaker opposition, Benin have struggled to create clear scoring opportunities, often relying on hopeful crosses or isolated moments of brilliance rather than continuous structured attacking pressure or counter-pressing. Against a disciplined **Botswana side likely to sit deep and protect the box,** that lack of incision could once again be exposed.\n\nFrom a tactical standpoint, Botswana are expected to remain compact, prioritize defensive shape, invite pressure, all the while looking to exploit transitions with their quick runners, as well as utilizing set pieces. This feels exactly like the type of game that tends to unsettle Benin, a team struggling with breaking down low blocks. Players such as **Thabang Sesinyi** and **Tumisang Orebonye** offer physicality and directness with their insane running capabilities, giving Botswana an outlet when they regain possession, but they're also intelligent at covering the space, ensuring no holes are left between the thirds of the pitch that could be exploited by Benin's attack.\n\nCrucially, the **pressure is entirely on Benin**. After a disappointing start to the group, anything less than a win would be viewed as a catastrophic failure, and that expectation can quickly turn into impatience. Botswana, by contrast, have nothing to lose here. Given Benin’s scoring drought, Botswana’s defensive prowess and the psychological dynamics of a must-win AFCON group match, backing **Botswana to win or draw** feels like a well-reasoned value play. In a tournament defined by fine margins, Botswana have more than enough to stay competitive and possibly spring a surprise. Just like yesterday, I'm also sprinkling an Under 3.5 goals on this play *(feeling a cagey 0-0 or 1-1 draw here)* to make the odds even greater (coincidentally the same as yesterday - surely all the signs are there?). After another lengthy research I feel confident of going in with 4 whole units. BOL and let's get a winning streak going ☘️",

I understand why the books have the line at 165.5 because CSUN plays fast (11th in tempo) and Stanford also plays relatively quick (top 100). The fact is that CSUN is a very bad shooting team, especially from 3 where they rank 271st in 3pt FG%. Stanford should have total control over this game.

So to sum it up, 11th in tempo only matters when the game is close, they cannot shoot well enough to comeback. \n\n\n\nBOL",

      "text": "Record: 0-1\n\nNet Units: -1\n\nROI: -100%\n\n**Last 5 (Newest Right):** ❌\n\n**Event:** English Premier League (Soccer) - Arsenal vs Brighton (15:00 GMT)\n\n**Last Pick:** Coventry win + over 1.5 goals ❌\n\n**Todays Pick:** Arsenal win + over 1.5 goals @ 1.57 (1 unit)\n\n**Last Pick Reaction:** Swansea came out and made it a difficult game for Coventry as expected. Coventry grabbed their goal just before half-time and from that point on were the only side that looked like winning. They could easily have scored two or three but wasted a few good chances. Still, we move. **FT: Coventry 1-0 Swansea**\n\n**Write Up:** I was tempted to back Man City today as they face an inconsistent Nottingham Forest side at the City Ground, but that inconsistency is exactly the problem. Forest can get rolled by Brentford one week and then push the league leaders the next, especially at home. Not worth the risk.\n\nInstead, the focus shifts to the Premier League leaders Arsenal as they host 9th‑placed Brighton at the Emirates. Arsenal are unbeaten at home this season, **scoring 20 and conceding just 3** at their North London fortress. Mental defensive numbers and arguably the best in the world right now — especially with Saliba back in the side.\n\nOffensively, Arsenal are averaging **2.5 goals per game** at home while **conceding only 0.38**. Their only two losses this season came away to Liverpool at Anfield (when they still knew how to play football) and late on against Aston Villa at Villa Park (arguably the best team in the league at the moment). What I'm getting at is Arsenal look in excellent shape heading into 2026, and they’ll be determined to maintain their narrow lead over Manchester City and Aston Villa going into the new year.\n\nWhile goals have been a little harder to come by recently, their midweek EFL Cup performance against Crystal Palace was very encouraging—they could easily have scored three or four with better finishing. If they carry that momentum into today’s match, they should have no trouble creating chances against an inconsistent Brighton side. With key players like Rice, Saka, and Raya expected to return after being rested midweek, Arsenal should be close to full strength. Martinelli picked up a knock, but Trossard is more than capable of stepping in.\n\nBrighton, meanwhile, sit 9th and have been the definition of average this season. They’re not bad enough to be dragged into a relegation fight, but they’re also nowhere near showing the quality needed to push for Europe. They’re **winless in four**, and a trip to the Emirates is unlikely to change that. Combine Arsenal’s elite defensive record with Brighton’s modest attacking output—**1.13 goals scored and 1.5 conceded per away game**—and it’s hard to see the visitors causing many problems. Raya already has **nine clean sheets** this season, the most in the league, which shows the size of the task Brighton face. **Welbeck may return from injury, but that remains unconfirmed.**\n\nAs for the over 1.5 goals, the line has hit in **88% of Arsenal’s home matches** and **88% of Brighton’s games both away and overall**. If Arsenal create chances at anything close to their midweek level, this should be a comfortable win with goals on the board in the 3 or 4-0 range, maybe 3-1 if Brighton feel like having a bit of a go. Arsenal beat Brighton today and anything else is a major slip up by the Gunners.\n\nStill getting used to writing these, so feel free to drop any thoughts or suggestions in the comments. Always happy to learn—and best of luck if you decide to tail.\n\n*Edit: Added 'Todays' pick to stop confusion*",

Aston Villa have been in scintillating form with a record 10 wins in a row in all competitions. They are traveling to Stamford Bridge the home of the Blues in what should be a tense and closely fought contest. Chelsea have scored in every home game this season bar the opening fixture whilst Aston Villa have been scoring consistently in their win streak which includes a 2-1 win over league leaders Arsenal (just four matches back). What makes this bet more compelling is the defensive form of both teams - Aston Villa have conceded in each of their last five games whilst Chelsea have conceded in three of their last five and in their last fixture drew 2-2 with Newcastle. The oddsmakers favor Chelsea here but Aston Villa are very live for the upset - taking both teams to score here seems solid. Please bet responsibly.",

Chelsea’s push to stay in the top four has been a recurring theme in Maresca’s recent press conferences, where he has emphasised bravery in possession and quicker vertical play at home, even if that comes at the cost of defensive exposure — something already visible with Colwill and Lavia injured and James regularly stepping out of the double pivot. That aggressive 4-2-3-1 gives Palmer freedom between the lines and has improved their attacking output, but it also leaves space in transition, as seen at Newcastle. Aston Villa arrive with immense confidence and nothing to fear, and Emery has repeatedly stated that he will not abandon his narrow, attacking structure despite conceding chances. Villa have scored multiple goals in every recent match but have also conceded in all of them, a pattern reinforced by Mings’ absence, Martínez’s fitness concerns, and negative underlying xG numbers. With both managers prioritising attacking control over defensive conservatism, elite creators in Palmer and Rogers operating centrally, and key defensive absences limiting in-game containment, the tactical and motivational setup strongly points toward both teams finding the net.",

As we near the end of the 2025 season, both Houston and LAC have been performing towards the under in their respective seasons. So far the Texans have gone under in 64.3% of their games, and the Chargers 57.1%. With a combined average of 36.7 points per game allowed for the 2025 season, this game has the makings of a low scoring and grind it out affair. \n\nHouston's pass rush is elite, while LAC's pass blocking is bottom 5. This matchup alone will provide many problems for the Chargers ability to give Justin Herbert any possibility to take control of the game with his arm. Harbaugh will be forced to approach this game with a ground-and-pound style and attempt to control the tempo with long and methodical drives, something he as a coach excels at with a league leading time of possession per game.\n\nThe Chargers and Texans flex very impressive red zone defenses which will hold scoring touchdowns to a high premium. Through their last 3 games the Chargers have held teams to an average of 0.7 touchdowns in the red zone, while the Texans also boast an impressive 1.3 average over their last 3.\n \nI predict this game not to be as much of a QB deal between Herbert and Stroud than it is to be a kick-off between Fairbairn and Dicker. I believe the defenses will thrive in being able to keep the opposition out of striking distance and force each team to win the game with their legs.\n\nTail or fade BOL to everyone and cheers! 🍻",

At the Emirates they’re aggressive from the start and usually put teams under pressure early.\n\nCity are in full chase mode behind Arsenal and their form speaks for itself. They’re scoring freely, barely conceding, and even with a couple of absences they still have more than enough quality to beat Forest.\n\nNothing fancy here.

We’re moving to the biggest mismatch in pool play. Denmark is downright terrible. They just got thoroughly outplayed by a Finland team that historically doesn’t score much, got outshot by 20 and pretty clearly took their foot off the gas through the game. Denmarks first 3 games since they got to Minnesota have now seen them lose 6-1, 13-2 and 6-2. Every few years there’s a team that makes it into the top division and gets completely demolished game in and game out. Like last year with Kazakhstan and a few years ago with Austria, Denmark will need an absolute miracle to stay with the top dogs.\n\n\n\nThe Czechs on the other hand have brought what could possibly be their best team since they won back to back championships in the early 2000s. They've been a force in this tournament the last few years, they’re deep everywhere and play an up tempo style that focuses on play driving, rush attempts and puck possession. The complete opposite of a Finland team that still managed to put up 6. Just last year we got to see the Czechs put this on display when they played a horrific Kazakhstan team and beat them 14-2. The worst teams in the tournament usually try and limit the damage in these games, they know they have no shot at winning, they’re fine dropping into a trap and getting outshot by 30 as long as they don’t lose by 10. The biggest flaw to this strategy with a team like Denmark is they don’t have a goalie to help make those crucial saves. Expect a gigantic mismatch between two teams trending in different directions tomorrow, the Czechs never miss on an opportunity to pump a teams eyes shut.",

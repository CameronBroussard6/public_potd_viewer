Both premier league teams are facing lower league opponents away from home at the business end of the league cup. \n\nGiven we are into the later rounds and this is realistically the best chance either of these sides have at silverware, I expect strong lineups from both.\n\nExpect both to have too much class and a 2-0 win in both wouldn‚Äôt be a suprise.\n\n\nAs always BOL to those tailing and see you on the other side ü´°ü´°",

In other circumstances it would have been extremely funny to me to see a QB throw a complete bonehead pick6 on the second play of the drive right after his defense had two goal line stands following a 17 play 91 yards Bucs drive.\n\n**Event:** NBA Clippers @ Warriors **Time**: 11:00pm (EST)\n\n**POTD:**¬†Total over 224.5 points (@1.90 Decimal / -110 American) 2U to win 1.8U\n\n**Write Up:**¬†\n\nShort write-up, the Warriors are averaging 126.5 points on offense in their first 4 games of the season, while their defense has not looked good. Every contest so far has hit the over.\n\nThe Clippers are doing Clippers things as they got blown out on the road by the Jazz and followed it up by two rather convincing wins at home. During their games so far, they average 117.0 points on offense. Their games hit the over in 2/3 contests.\n\nThe Clippers played solid defense in their two wins as, and the Warriors may be load managing their old roster to some degree, but to be honest I haven‚Äôt quite figured out why the line for the total points of this game is this low, if someone here knows, feel free to enlighten me. From what I see, the bookies only gave 4 games a line lower than 224.5 so far this season.\n\nEven though the total lines have been adjusted the last couple of days, after we saw an offense heavy start to the NBA season the over hit still in 34 of 53 games this season. The public is still all over it and especially for this game I saw that 96% of the bets are on the over so far, which can be seen as something bad. But I still want to see it, before betting consistent on the under of games.\n\nI also like the over on some other matchups, but this looks like the best bet.",

Considering the opponent's baseline average, it's quite natural for that total to exceed 30. In the same table, Atalanta's 160 cross attempts in 8 matches (\\~20/match) also demonstrate their extensive use of the wing, a profile that increases the frequency of the ball going off the line.\n\n\n\nAtalanta ‚Äì Lazio (October 19, 2025): 22 + 15 = 37 throw-ins.\n\nMilan ‚Äì Fiorentina (October 19, 2025): 20 + 24 = 44 throw-ins.\n\nParma ‚Äì Atalanta (August 30, 2025): 17 + 17 = 34 throw-ins.\n\nUdinese - Milan (September 20, 2025) 14 + 18 = 32 throw-ins.\n\nAtalanta - Lecce (September 14, 2025) 14 + 18 = 32 throw-ins.\n\nThese current examples show that the 30 bar is frequently exceeded.\n\nWhile rare, there are matches that stay below 30. For example, last season's Milan-Atalanta match (April 20, 2025) saw a total of 27 throw-ins (14+13). However, this season's recent patterns, along with Atalanta's own average of \\~16.4 throw-ins per game, still make it highly likely that today's match will stay above 30. Atalanta has had 131 throw-ins in 8 matches this season (‚âà16.4/match); in the last two league matches, the total throw-ins are 37 (ATA‚ÄìLAZ) and 44 (MIL‚ÄìFIO).\n\n\n\n***Pick: Throw-ins Total Over 29.5 Odd: 1.66 1XBET***",

      "text": "Record: 6-1 \n\nNet Units: +4.09U\n\nTotal Staked: 7U Total Returned: 11.09U\n\nNBA 76ers v Wizards \n\nPick: 1U Joel Embiid O4.5P 1Q @ $1.86 (-116 American odds), B365 \n\nWrite Up: With Maxey FTA line going to 7.5 up from 5.5, and Reaves/Pritchard not playing, got to look elsewhere. \n\nNow, I said in a previous POTD (with Wemby O26.5) that I felt a bit square because the line seemed too easy. This again is the case here, I feel almost silly - but also, potentially like Wemby, the books haven‚Äôt adjusted also and are being cautious with limited minutes. \n\nWhy am I taking a prop on such an injury prone player? Yes, he is on a minutes restriction, but he played a lot better when his court time was extended, essentially on for 3x7 minute periods v the Hornets compared to 4x5 v the Celtics. This means he gets time to work into the 1st quarter even if his first couple of shots don‚Äôt fall. \n\nV the Hornets, he played 7 minutes in the 1st quarter, he had 6 field goal attempts - on 2 of them he was fouled and went to the FT line (going 3-4), and he went 2-4 from the field otherwise, with both FG made being 3-pointers, clearing this line with 9 points which is more of what we expect from him, compared to his first outing v the Celtics. Embiid having his 3 point shot going basically means we need 1x3 & 1x free throw trip to clear this, and he‚Äôs likely to take 6-8 shots again. \nHe was rested today with Maxey, Oubre & Edgecombe averaging 40 minutes each so I‚Äôm hoping early in the piece they delegate to Embiid. \n\nMatch-up wise, Embiid has never played on Sarr, who is a good defender with plenty of size for his age, and who can block shots. However, Embiid is a master at drawing fouls. Way back in 2022-23 when he was the best scorer in the league, he was the 2nd leading player for FTA while shooting them @ 85%, and was 3rd highest for FGM. We aren‚Äôt going to see that for 35 minutes, but I think against a player 3 games into his 2nd season, we can see that shrewd foul-baiting and FG shooting for 7 minutes. Sarr has a foul rate of 2.7 fouls per 36 minutes, so he‚Äôs definitely able to be drawn in, and he just lacks the experience of Embiid. I really think Embiid will bring his post game for 7 minutes and show Sarr how it‚Äôs done with a couple of easy fouls drawn. \n\nAgainst this pick are if Slowel Embiid shows up again like game 1 - I doubt it but it‚Äôs not impossible. If he doesn‚Äôt get good early shots he may be rested earlier in the quarter while the 76ers get their game going, as the team may be more cohesive without him right now. Maxey, Edgecombe & Oubre could again play big minutes and take bulk of the usage, limiting Embiid, and also he might only take 3 pt attempts and easy enough to go 0-4 for example.",

Dude just threw a shutout with 10 Ks and hit 3 dingers in the NLCS, then followed it with 2 more dingers last night in that 18-inning war. \n\nHis confidence is obviously through the roof. Arm‚Äôs fresh, command is nasty, and he‚Äôs facing a Toronto lineup that‚Äôs been whiffing at 22.4% against lefties all postseason. He‚Äôs punched out 25 Jays in 19 career innings‚Äî11.8 K/9. \n\nHis main line is a bit lower than I‚Äôd expect at 6.5 because I think he‚Äôll go at least 6 innings, maybe* more with how brutal last game was on the pens.

Dodgers used 8 arms, Jays 7. Both teams will want their starters to go deep tonight. That‚Äôs a massive edge for LA with the better pitcher who can actually go 6+ and rack Ks while doing it.

With a 2-0 lead at HT after Diabate had another 2 goal contributions they needed to hold on in the second half. They didn't create much themselves but managed to get it over the line.\n\n**Today's Pick:** ***Valletta to win @ 1.66 -- 2 units***\n\n**Write up:**\n\nFor today there's lots of cup football which nearly made me skip today's pick as I do not like the unpredictability of the cup matches. But then I found this match in Malta. Valletta is having a good season this year as they are second with 21 points out of 9 matches. They've already won against the 1st and 2nd team but drew against sides that are known to play European football in Malta. So they've had a difficult schedule but still managed to sit in second place.   \n\n\nNow the value here is because on paper the Away team Gzira seem to be picking up form. Gzira are sitting in 8th (out of 12). This looks quite alright but I've looked deeper into their matches. They are currently on 9 points, with 6 of those being in the 2 most recent matches. If we look at their opponents in these matches, it are both the teams that are sitting at the bottom of the league. And even those matches weren't won with Gzira playing well, in one of them the opponent picked up an early red card in the first half. The other match ended in 4-3... Not convincing wins at all. Against bottom of the league. If you leave those two matches out they would only be on 3 points. Not good enough to beat Valletta here I dont think. Let's get another win on the board today!\n\n**Best of luck if tailing!** üçÄ\n\n**PS:** If you want you can check my entire record and units won on [https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/OliveCritical5134-qXXxJZ](https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/OliveCritical5134-qXXxJZ)",

Napoli are on fire going forward, but let‚Äôs be real, their defense isn‚Äôt exactly air tight, so Lecce might sneak one past them, especially with the home ‚Äúadvantage‚Äù and crowd support. Lecce themselves aren‚Äôt shy about having a go, they‚Äôve scored in most of their matches, even if they end up losing most of them. So, you‚Äôve got the perfect mix, an attacking Napoli who‚Äôll likely (hopefully) leave gaps, due to attacking focus, and a scrappy Lecce side that loves to poke the giants and maybe make it look dramatic. Basically, expect goals, a bit of chaos, and maybe someone flinging a few cheeky comments in excitement if it hits, both teams to score is the fun and value play, not to mention the stats of these teams back this pick.

But the Suns are full of streaky players, Booker, Allen, and Williams all putting in their effort in making it a close game. In the fourth quarter the Jazz were up by 10 and I had turned the game off, after I came back to check, it was in overtime and I decided to double down on the Jazz.

      "text": "**POTD Record 36-33-1**\n\nEasy easy dub. Cavs came out hot, and game went even better in our favor than I expected. Feeling momentum this NBA season, as I am already up almost 10 units personally so far this season, while being 2-1 on my POTDs. I am seeing the board right now, and feel a streak on its way. \n\nOne of the benifits of being 6 hours behind the east coast, is that I get to stare at lines, re watch games on league pass and hammer early lines all while being in bed before 9pm. Tonight, while i was going through my normal routine, this game just jumped out at me, and went ahead and bet it and figured I may as well share it with everyone on here. I'm fading a team I bet several days ago.\n\n**Miami Heat - 6**\n\nOkay, so Miami‚Äôs roster is extremely balanced offensively. In the young season the Heat already feature seven players averaging double‚Äëdigit points: Norman Powell (24), Bam (19), Jaime Jaquez (15), Fontecchio (13),  Wiggins (12), Jovic (11) and Kel‚Äôel Ware (10). That depth means Miami can roll out many different scoring options and defenders can‚Äôt key on just one or two players. On the other side, Charlotte currently relies heavily on a few stars. LaMelo Ball is leading the Hornets with 28PPG and 10APG, and Miles Bridges adds about 20PPG himself. Beyond those two, Charlotte‚Äôs bench production is spotty. Without additional reliable scorers, Miami‚Äôs more even attack should exploit the Hornets‚Äô defensive rotations. I am not going to lie i really love Kon Knueppel. Sexton and Kalkbrenner are also really good palyers, but outside of them and Bridges, I really don't think anyone else is to worry about tomorrow.\n\nErik Spoelstra remains one of the NBA‚Äôs top coaches. In a recent NBA GM poll he was voted the league‚Äôs ‚Äúbest head coach‚Äù by a wide margin, highlighting his ability to get the most out of role players and game plans. Spoelstra‚Äôs Heat culture, which emphasizes team play, defense, and conditioning, helps a deep roster click together. Contrast that with Charlotte‚Äôs situation.... Despite improvements, and a team I am generally hight on this season, the Hornets are still a work in progress. In this matchup Miller will be out so Charlotte is already hamstrung. Spoelstra‚Äôs track record suggests Miami will have a large tactical edge to exploit their weaknesses. \n\nLosing Miller‚Äôs scoring and playmaking forces Charlotte to lean even harder on Ball and Bridges. In addition, Charlotte just finished a road trip and has only one day off for travel. This one day of travel in a city like Miami, really catches my attention. I am not usually someone who bets based off of hypotheticals, however I already like Miami in this matchup based on how they have looked so far, but I also really like fading a young team traveling to Miami with a rest day in between. Specifically a young team like Charlotte, whose 2 best players are young guys who have been known to be labeled by media as immature. I am in no way shape or form making a character judgement on these two players (I think Ball has really made a jump in his professionalism personally, and Bridges seems to have his shit together minus the suspension awhile back) but rather just stating it is normal for young multi millionaires to enjoy themselves in a city like Miami, with a day of rest in between. \n\nOkay back to basketball. Miami‚Äôs bench  is a huge piece to this play. On recent box scores, reserve players like Jovic and Ware are contributing double figures (Jovic started one game, and ware started 2), and solid role players like Jaquez, Fontecchio, Jose Alvarado, Dru Smith and honestly a few others (Larsson gets buckets when he plays) are providing defense and occasional scoring. By contrast, even with Charlotte‚Äôs offseason bench upgrades, there‚Äôs still a drop‚Äëoff. This year‚Äôs bench is better on paper, but the Heat‚Äôs bench should still outplay it, by a large margin. \n\nMiami‚Äôs multi-pronged attack and excellent coaching give them a clear efficiency advantage, while Charlotte will more than likely scramble without Miller. The Heat outscore opponents by a large margin (they averaged 127PPG in three games so far and rarely rely on any single player to carry the load. \n\nPS: also bet Philly -5.5 tomorrow. I know every gave me major shit for the shaq comparison to embiid (I WAS BEING DRAMATIC), however my other angle in that play was that I did not think Edgecombe could sustain what he did in the first game, but oh boy was I wrong. This guy is legit. Also Wash is IMO one of the worst teams in the league.",

Knight has cleared the 64.5 yard threshold in 6 of 7 games this year posting 151 (Georgia Southern), 111 (Louisiana), 89 (Weber State & Liberty), 85 (Georgia State), 74 (Old Dominion) and 12 (on 5 carries against Louisville). Knight leads the Dukes with 611 rushing yards, averaging over 120 yards per game, making the 64.5 line appear quite generous.\n\nThe matchup couldn't be better for Knight's continued success. Texas State's defense ranks 97th in the nation in rushing defense, allowing 162.7 yards per game, while JMU boasts the 8th ranked rushing attack in the country. I watched Robert Henry Jr. and UTSA run all over Texas St a few weeks back posting 17 carries for 159 and 2 touchdowns (RHJ). I am fully expecting a similar showing out of Knight and this JMU squad. \n\nBeing on the east coast myself with some wind and rain I ended up checking the weather chances for both games. Kennesaw could see some late rain so it made my decision even easier. San Marcos will be pleasant in the low 50s, however wind gusts are expected to reach 28-35 mph throughout the game. This could induce an even larger workload for Wayne. With everything pointing to Knight having another big day and I think we have a high chance to surpass 64.5 yards.\n\nExpected outcome: Wayne Knight 19 carries, 126 yards, and 1 touchdown",

Shapovalov is a head case who, seemingly, basically rage quit in their Basel match. That‚Äôs not a good sign for the rematch just days later. He also had 9 double faults and was losing it with errors at the end before retiring. He may hampered by something physically (there was some mention of back issues), but certainly mentally and either way that‚Äôs an advantage for Jao who should beat him again either way.\n\nLamelo averaging 9.7 assists per game with no less than 8 in each game so far.

The bucks have let guards/forwards eat on the glass giving up the 12th most to forwards and 5th most to two guards. Hart plays 2-4 when he‚Äôs out there so that bodes we‚Äôll for his rebounds and he‚Äôs one of the best at his position. For the assists he‚Äôs been able to collect 5 and 3 with limited minutes so I at least expect 3 and his rebounds sit at over 6.5 at (-155) while the assists are at 3.5 at (-175 so I love taking a stab at RA at plus money at 11.5.

      "text": "**Pick:** Denis Shapovalov +1.5 games (-120) vs Jo√£o Fonseca  \n**Event:** ATP \\[Paris Masters 1000\\], \\[7:30am EST\\]  \n**Units:** 2\n\n**Record:** 0-0\n\nShapovalov +1.5 games is my pick of the day. While Fonseca‚Äôs rise has been impressive, this line undervalues Shapovalov‚Äôs recent form and experience. He‚Äôs been showing flashes of his top-20 level again‚Äîserving big, dictating points, and cleaning up his unforced errors. He also has a 9-2 record on indoor hard courts which makes me think the match will be competitive. Fonseca‚Äôs raw athleticism and power can cause problems, but over a full match, Shapo‚Äôs lefty serve and variety should keep him in every set. Even if Fonseca takes one, the +1.5 spread provides strong coverage given Shapo‚Äôs ability to hold serve and force tight sets. At -120, this number has solid value on a player who‚Äôs rediscovering his rhythm and competing hard on tour again. Fonseca is also coming off a title win in Basel so fatigue could play a factor especially due to it being near the end of the season. Good luck!",

The crazy amount of red zone targets and targets per route run from Rice‚Äôs debut last week, along with Washington‚Äôs major struggles against slot receivers, made the ATTD an appealing option despite the inherent high variance. I don‚Äôt usually go for ATTD for a WR, but the stats told me it was a very good idea here. Took until the 4th quarter, but it happened. Mariota scrambled quite a bit as I predicted, and the Chiefs rush yards allowed to QBs track record proved to be a successful indicator. \n\nI started off with a +200 pick and I‚Äôm going to go right back to another +200 pick now. Why not eh.\n\n**Pick** - Jaume Munar ML vs Daniil Medvedev (+200) 2 units\n\n**Paris 7:10AM EST**\n\nI like this based on value for a few reasons. \n\nMunar is having his best year on hard courts, and has done well on indoor hard (6-2). He performed great in Basel, beating Shelton and FAA ‚Äî top players known for their prowess on the surface. He was also very good in Shanghai earlier this month.\n\nThe courts in Paris are reportedly playing slow which I think should be an advantage for Munar. Munar is a clay specialist foremost, and slower hard courts can feel closer to clay and are favorable for him. \n\nMunar defeated Medvedev earlier this year in Miami which is one of the slower hard court tournaments on circuit as well. This was during a relative slump for Medvedev, and I don‚Äôt expect another easy two set win for Munar, but it demonstrates that he can defeat him on hard courts. \n\nMedvedev is notorious for his disdain for slow-playing hard courts. He‚Äôs called them a disgrace in the past, and his game is generally better suited to faster courts. He has a poor record in Paris too, never having advanced past the 2nd round of this tournament.\n\nMedvedev has played pretty well in the past month, so I‚Äôll only go with 2 units on this, but the value is there.",

Their stats speak for themselves which will show below.\n* Overall paiN aren't a BAD mirage team, they have had moments of being very good/strong on the map overall, but I think they are just wildly inconsistent on the map, especially since picking up DGT, which is shown with recent losses on the map to FUT and Virtus Pro, they beat GM 13-10, but GM are 20% winrate on Mirage\n\n**Mirage Stats:**\n\n* paiN are 50% winrate on 6 maps of Mirage, 13-13 record in 2025 on the map\n* B8 are 80% winrate on 10 maps of Mirage, 40-12 record in 2025 on the map\n* B8 are on a 4 map winstreak and have won 8 of their last 10, despite being a tier two team, they have beaten some huge names on Mirage recently including Astralis, FaZe, FURIA, and G2. Similarly when they played GM on Mirage (the team paiN won 13-10 against), they won it 13-3\n* Overall keep it simple, NPL is an absolute monster on Mirage, best player in the series on his best map",

      "text": "Record: 151-134, -6.83 units\n\nLast Pick: Patrick Zahraj ML vs Thai-Son Kwiatkowski (-125, 2 units): Win\n\nTennis | Charlottesville Challenger | 6:00 PM EST (estimated)\n\nToday's Pick: Rafael J√≥dar vs Murphy Cassone | **J√≥dar to win 2-0 at +125. 1 unit.** \n\nWrite-up: I felt like that was a solid pick, as Zahraj closed at -215. The first set was pretty up-and-down, as Zahraj had to fend off a set point on his serve, but he ended up closing it out and then winning the second in fairly straightforward fashion.\n\nToday, I'm going with Rafael Jodar to take down Murphy Cassone in straight sets. Jodar is probably the strongest college tennis player right now, and has already improved his ranking to the point where making Australian Open qualifying is all but guaranteed, leading many to suspect that he may not return to Virginia in the spring. Even with AO qualies locked in, Jodar still has plenty of reason to improve his ranking right now and try to sneak into some ATP events next year. \n\nThis summer, Rafa has already captured two Challenger titles (including one indoors) and made an additional two semifinals. He should be intimately familiar with the setting, as this tournament is actually hosted at Virginia's tennis facility, and I have no doubts that he'll attract the bulk of the crowd support. I feel that his game suits indoor conditions very well, as he plays with quite an aggressive style and loves to dominate with the forehand.\n\nMeanwhile, Murphy Cassone, another former college standout, isn't coming into this tournament with nearly as much confidence. He had a decent start to the year, but his form has dipped dramatically, with his most recent match being a concerning straight-sets loss to Mats Rosenkranz in Sioux Falls (5.43 performance rating). I honestly don't view Cassone as having a very high ceiling game - he doesn't do anything particularly poorly, but also doesn't really have weapons at this level. He's comfortable enough indoors, but his recent performances simply have not been confidence-inspiring. Jodar was recently priced around the same odds against Patrick Kypson in Sioux Falls, but there's a pretty big gap in form between Kypson and Cassone right now, making me feel that these odds are a bit mispriced. Sure, Rafa lost that match (6.17 performance rating), but that shouldn't be such a big factor in how the market is pricing this match. \n\nFor all of those reasons, I like Jodar to take care of this one in straight sets at plus money. \n\nNote: The [POTD Capper Tracker](https://potd.lol), which you may remember from its Google Sheet days, is finally back in a cleaner, more robust website format!

Copa Del Rey round one's always have some mismatches. Let's talk about Sociedad first. I took Under 8 goals Total for the value of it. Sociedad are having a bad season and currently sit 17th in La Liga. They are having an alright season when it comes to home games winning 2 and drawing 1 but when it comes to away form they aren't doing well at all. They have lost 3 and drawn 2. Playing away against Negreira I do expect them to win but I don't think their form has shown any reason to think by more than 7. Personally i think it'll be 4-0. Playing on a worse pitch than they are used to, without their home support and while being in bad form it will be tough for them. \n\nNow onto Sevilla. Sevilla to win by 3 or more goals against a team from the 5th division of Spanish football is more than possible with the form Sevilla are in. Having a pretty decent season so far with the highlight by far being 4-1 against Barcelona. They are averaging 1.7 goals per game in La Liga. You might think Sevilla away would be similar to Sociedad having struggles and when it comes to the pitch this would be correct but when it comes to the league. If the league was just based on away games, Sevilla would sit in 4th. That's a big difference from 11th so their away form is great, winning 3 out of 5 games. I think Sevilla will easily clear this line.",

It‚Äôs early days but could this finally be their year? It‚Äôs not the prettiest football but is undeniably effective and limiting a giants slayer like Palace to just 1 SOT is impressive and has been the tale of their season. Time will tell. Anyways on the cards front not only did Crystal Palace not get carded but there were simply no bookings all match. Mr. Bramall once again proving to be extremely lenient on them as one or two challenges could‚Äôve definitely be sanctioned but I‚Äôm definitely not complaining.\n\nNapoli are sitting at the top of the league but it‚Äôs pretty close with just 3 points separating them from fourth to Inter Milan. They secured a big win against the Nerazzurri, needing to bounce back from their hefty 6-2 defeat against PSV mid-week. Lecce meanwhile sit just above the relegation zone in 16th counting just one win all season. Their goal this season will be to survive the drop once again having avoided relegation by the skin of their teeth last season. On the corners front, Lecce has averaged 5.3 corners and conceded 5 at home whilst Napoli has averaged 4 corners and conceded 4.6 on the road. In terms of playing styles that may alter the numbers, Lecce have been playing with width since appointing Di Francesco with crossing being a key part of their playing style - leading to more corners. Meanwhile Napoli like to control possession and attack through the middle which leads to less corners, especially with KDB‚Äôs absence which will lead to a big loss in creativity. Nevertheless I apply some pressure on Lecce‚Äôs numbers as Napoli are simply the better team. Using all factors I get a mean of 5 corners for Lecce and 4.5 for Napoli.\n\nThat gives this play an estimated 83% of winning which is exceptional value as I literally predict Lecce to have more corners (though the margins are tight). In fact, last season in this exact fixture the Giallorossi had 5 corners to Napoli‚Äôs 2 to crush the line.

His serve doesn‚Äôt have the same pop and he‚Äôs been off-rhythm in rallies. he scraped by Majchrzak, then got handled easily by Munar and didnt look like he is at 100%. On a fast indoor court maybe the market makes sense, but here? Totally different story.\n\nCobolli‚Äôs game just fits better right now: great defense, makes a ton of balls, and forces opponents to overhit. He just beat Machac again playing confident, clean tennis and even pushed Sinner hard for a set. Momentum‚Äôs on his side.\n\nGiven the surface, the matchup, and Shelton‚Äôs form, I honestly think this should be closer in favor of Cobolli. The market opened with 2.2 for Cobolli and it keeps dropping. With long rallies expected and Shelton still rusty, Cobolli has a real shot to grind this out.\n\nGL on your bets",

Militello came to KSU, reuniting with head coach Jerry Mack, after 4 seasons on the offensive staff at Tennessee working closely under UT‚Äôs HC Josh Heupel, specifically with Vols‚Äô QB‚Äôs. Last year‚Äôs horrible KSU team ran an option offense. Militello came in & immediately made an impact. implementing a Veer & Shoot offense. __KSU‚Äôs has their #1 offense in CUSA in EPA, the only one with a positive EPA. This new offense ranks 44th nationally in EPA & 27th nationally in EPA/Pass.__ Their offense very balanced with the pass & run, as evident in last week‚Äôs win where they produced 284 passing yards & 214 rushing yards They were on fire averaging 5.2 yards per carry & a whopping 16.7 yards per pass. Their offense is led by Wofford transfer Amari Odom. __Odom is a dual threat QB who ranks Top 10 in the NCAA in Completion percentage (70.8%). Odom is the best QB in CUSA with the highest QB Rating (69.1) & the 43rd ranked in the NCAA.__ Odom has excelled in the Veer & Shoot offense with 5 pass TD‚Äôs & 3 rush TD‚Äôs on just 1 INT this year. Odom popped up on the injury report this week & is considered day to day. Ever if he can‚Äôt go Tuesday night, they won't miss a beat with Senior dual-threat QB Dexter Williams under center. Dexter Williams has also been solid in substantial playing time, completing with 605 yards, 5 TD‚Äôs & 1 INT, while also adding two scores on the ground. A lot of their offensive success is due to a great offensive line. __KSU‚Äôs OLine has only given up 1.2 sacks per game, 22nd best in the NCAA.__ Out at WR they are led by 2 Senior studs. They have a lightning speed guy in Senior Gabriel Bernard. __Bernard has the most receiving yards in all of CUSA (495 yds).__ They also have a 6-3 monster in Christian Moss who‚Äôs averaging 15.9 yards per catch. They face a UTEP defense that refuses to get turnovers. __UTEP‚Äôs defense ranks T126th among FBS teams for INT‚Äôs this season with only 2. They are -8 in turnover margin 130th.__ They also can‚Äôt get any stops on 3rd down. __UTEP ranks 129th among FBS teams for 3rd down conversion percentage this season (31.4).__ Their defense struggles majorly against the pass. __UTSA ranks 120th in EPA/Pass allowed.__ KSU wins in the trenches & this team‚Äôs balanced offense that has scored 27 points in 4 of their last 5 games against better defense is going to keep it going this week. KSU‚Äôs defense has been hot as well.\n\nUTEP saw success against a brutal Sam Houston State defense last week, but I don‚Äôt expect that to continue against a stout Kennesaw State defense. __If you take away the outlier game where KSU played an unfair game vs Indiana, they have allowed just 15.5 points per game. That would rank 11th in the NCAA. On the season, UTEP averages 21.0 points per game, ranking around 122nd nationally.__ They are one of the worst offenses in the country. __UTEP‚Äôs offense ranking 133rd out of 136 in EPA offense. They have 9 turnovers in their past 3 games (worst in NCAA).__ This is an offense that can‚Äôt pass or run the ball. __UTEP‚Äôs 1.8 INT‚Äôs per game is the worst in the NCAA. Their 5.9 passing yards per game is the 129th in NCAA. Their 3.1 yards per rush is 127th in NCAA.__ They also can‚Äôt convert on third downs. __They only convert 30.43% of their 3rd down plays.__ They did make the change to QB Skylar Locklear 2 games ago. He did decent last week vs an 0-7 Sam Houston. But he already has 4 INT‚Äôs in just 9 quarters with just 3 TD‚Äôs. The week before he only had 9 completions for 90 yards. UTEP‚Äôs new offensive coordinator Mark Cala is not doing well in his first coordinator role. I‚Äôm running out of room, just know UTSA offense = bad. KSU defense = good\n\nKSU #1 in CUSA in EPA (59th in NCAA) & is the only team in CUSA with a + EPA margin (+0.037). UTEP is 2nd worst in EPA in CUSA, #131 in NCAA (-0.319). __KSU has covered 4 straight games, and the Owls seem to be getting better with each passing week.__\n\nKSU gets the biggest win in program history becoming bowl eligible and covers. \n\n__Kennesaw State -9.5__\n\nAppreciate the love!

      "text": "Record: 14-7\n\nLast Five Predictions (Old - New): ‚úÖ‚ùå‚úÖ‚úÖ‚ùå\n\nNet Units: +19.88\n\nYesterday's Pick: Moreirense v Porto. Porto (-1.0 &-1.5) Asian Handicap. 3u @ $1.54 ‚ùå /‚úÖ¬†\n\nLost half the initial stake as the first bet (-1) pushed, and the other (-1.5) lost. Unsure exactly how to write that on the ledger, but counting it as a loss because I walked away with less money than I put in.¬†\n\nPorto dominated possession but didn't create that many chances from it. Moreirense scored within 20 minutes, which wasn't ideal. Porto equalised just before halftime.¬†\n\nIn the second half, Porto dominated again, but didn't get the winner until the 88th minute. From there, it was unlikely they'd push the issue for a third.¬†\n\nToday's Pick: Thun v Winterthur. Thun (-1.0 &-1.5) Asian Handicap. 3u @ $1.87\n\nPick: Going with the Asian Hanidap again on Thun.¬†\n\nNewly promoted, but currently in first place, Thun hosts last-place Winterthur in the Swiss Super League.¬†\n\nThe Swiss Super League has started tight, with every team losing at least two of their opening ten games. Thun's two losses so far have been to Young Boys and Basel, who are two of the best teams in the league.¬†\n\nThun's two goals a game is the second-best in the league, and their 1.3 goals against are the third-best in the league.¬†\n\nWhile I don't expect them to win the league in their first season back in the top flight, they've looked good so far.¬†\n\nMeanwhile, Winterthur are 0-1-4 in their five away games in the league, copping seventeen goals in those games. In fact, in Winterthur's ten league games, they've conceded 30 goals, which is the worst in the league by 11 goals.\n\nI like Thun at home in this match.¬†",

Morrison, the Scottish fourth, has played very poorly so far at this event and despite their first win on Sunday, it looks like that may continue here. On the other side, Lacedelli has been incredibly sharp as the lead for the Italian rink and has set her team up nicely. The wrong team is favoured here, great dog play.",

Going with what I'm sure will be the chalkiest pick on the day. I think this could clear in the first half if I'm being honest. Should be a high-total shootout between these two middling teams. 49ers are second in passing yards per game and the Panthers are tied for the 6th lowest in EPA/Pass with some of the crummiest teams in the NFL. I also like Christian McCaffreys lines here, but with Brock Purdy back and the way The Panthers run their zone coverage, we should see more action to Kittle.\n\n**Take Kittle over 56.5 receiving yards**\n\n*Please tail at your own risk and only ever wager what you can afford to lose.

They’ve gotten 10 points from 15 available on the road, including wins at Kasimpasa (1–0) and Karagümrük (4–3), plus a draw at Galatasaray, who have been one of the most impressive teams in the world this year. They’ve also scored in four straight meetings against Basaksehir, winning all four with clean sheets. Even in their last match before the break, they created enough to score early before giving up a late equalizer.  \nBasaksehir’s defense was solid for a stretch, but that run has been broken, with them conceding in two straight matches. They’ve also only won one out of five home league matches this season. With how well Trabzonspor travel, and with Onuachu currently tied as the league’s top scorer, I like them to find at least one here.\n\nComo also set up nicely to score. They’re on a 10-game unbeaten run across all competitions, and while their home form has been elite, they’ve also been competitive in recent away matches. They’ve drawn three of their last four on the road, including an impressive performance against Napoli. They’ve shown they can create chances regardless of venue, and Torino will be without their top scorer Giovanni Simeone, which could tilt the flow of the game a bit more open for Como in transition.  \nComo have also shown real attacking quality this season with players like Nico Paz supporting Morata or Douvikas. I expect Morata to start up top tomorrow and he and Nico should be able to spark some attacking quality. Given Como’s form, confidence, and their ability to generate chances even in tough away fixtures, I like them to find at least one goal in this spot.\n\nBoth teams are playing well, both have consistent attacking threats, and neither leg requires anything more than a single goal. Trying to get back on track after two close losses back-to-back.\n\nBOL and God bless.",

Just shows how unpredictable betting is, Bulls were favourites pre game and books set a spread of 2.5 yet we get a 36 point blowout win by the Heat. Would’ve without a doubt reached close to 10 assists with normal minutes in a competitive game, was never gonna go over in 24 minutes. Awful beat but we move\n\nRunning back Mathurin who’s been amazing so far this season dropping 20+ points in all 5 games he’s played so far this season, including one against the Pistons where he had 25 points & 16 FGA. I talked about the upside of taking his points with his ability to get to the line and shoot free throws, had 14 FTA last game against the Pistons where he only made 8 so room for improvement there. \n\nOver in 5/5 games this season avg 26.4 PPG with his minutes ramping up from 27 & 25 minutes to playing 34 & 37 his last two games. Only needed 25 minutes against the Pistons to drop 25 points so with more minutes I like our chances even more, looks like he’s back to playing his normal minutes now so expecting 30+ minutes again.\n\nNot overthinking it, Pacers need his production offensively and he’s yet to fail on this line with the upside of more minutes this time around. Playing at home too hopefully makes the game more competitive.\n\nCool with 20.5 but decent odds for 20+ (ALT) so that’s my play.",

      "text": "Record: 164-137, +3.58 units\n\nLast Pick: Juan Pablo Varillas ML vs Murkel Dellien (-147, 1 unit): Win\n\nTennis | Athens Challenger | 5:50 AM EST (estimated)\n\nToday's Pick: Oleg Prihodko vs Bernabe Zapata Miralles | **Prihodko ML at -193 (DK). 1 unit.**\n\nWrite-up: Didn't get CLV there, so maybe not the best play. Regardless, Varillas actually won the first ten games of the match and looked like he might  double-bagel before Dellien started playing a bit better. \n\nBernabe Zapata Miralles comes into this match in horrific form. Zapata Miralles has lost his last 13 matches (17 if you count a Bundesliga interclub tournament) dating back to June of this year. In that span, he has won just four sets and been forced to retire twice. Now, he moves from clay to hard courts, a surface where he has never been very successful.\n\nSimilarly to Zapata Miralles, Prihodko tends to be much more comfortable on clay courts. However, the crucial difference here is that Oleg is not on a 17-match losing streak, and actually put in a decent performance on indoor hard in Bergamo last week. In the second round of that tournament, he was only priced at around +120 against Buvaysar Gadamauri, who has been playing much more tennis on hard courts and was a small underdog himself against eventual champion Francesco Maestrelli. Looking at Zapata Miralles's recent pricing, the market has understandably started to like him less and less. In Montemar last week, he was only around -250 against a mid-tier ITF player in Giuseppe La Vela, and still lost it in straight sets. In his most recent hard court match, meanwhile, Bernabe closed as an underdog against a doubles specalist in Trey Hilderbrand, going on to lose that one in straights as well. \n\nAll of this is to say that I think Prihodko should be an even bigger favorite here. Both players hit with heavy topspin and prefer clay courts, but Prihodko's vastly superior serve should give him the edge. In my experience, someone who has been losing left and right at the end of the year is probably going to start looking towards the next, and I don't expect BZM to be especially motivated to turn things around here. While the opening odds of -143 would have made this a 2-unit play for me, I still believe that there's 1-unit value here. \n\nNote: The [POTD Capper Tracker](https://potd.lol), which you may remember from its Google Sheet days, is finally back in a cleaner, more robust website format!

Rice came through for us less than 3 minutes into the game, couldn't have drawn it up any better myself. A great weekend all around - I very much appreciate all the love and hearing about the wins!  \n\nToday we head back north to Manchester. Where we have 10th place Man United hosting 13th place Everton. A win here for Everton puts them at 10th and a win for Man U puts them all the way up to 5th in the table. Man U has really turned a corner over the last 5 matches, unbeaten in that stretch and winning 3 of 5. Interestingly enough though, they've only kept 1 clean sheet all season (Sunderland), tend to give up a lot of shots, and don't hold possession very well. \n\nEverton are a mixed bag, going 2-1-2 over their last 5 and sitting precariously near the bottom of the table. Pretty much all of their attacking goes through their wingers, Grealish and Ndiaye. With Ndiaye taking more shots on his own and Grealish looking for passes. Ndiaye has started every EPL match for Everton this season and tends to get most of the game, although a late sub is not uncommon. Everton gets a lot of Friday/Monday matches so I've seen a good bit of their play this year, snd stats aside Ndiaye has been the brighr spot of this team, the kid can ball. \n\nStat wise, Ndiaye has hit at least 1 SOT in 5 of his last 6 EPL matches, he picked up a bit of a knock before the break so this did not hit in his last match. He's back to 100% and I expect him to pick up where he left off - I love this play at plus money and don't hate a sprinkle on ATGS as well. \n\nBOL if tailing, have a great Monday!",

Just two weeks ago their entire fanbase was ready to give up on Bryce Young after losing a crucial game to the Saints but then he just played the best game of his career vs the Falcons last Sunday and threw for 448 yards. I'm looking for him to come back down to earth this week and maybe its suddenly clicked for him but I am definitely not expecting anything near that in todays game.\n\nThe Panthers just simply don't look convincing to me on paper, they look like a team that is able to feed off the bottom of the league but as soon as they play anyone decent they start losing by wide margins. Their wins this year are against the Falcons (x2), Cowboys, Jets, Packers, and Dolphins. Now aside from the Packers all these teams that they've won against have negative records and sit near the bottom of their divisions, but even the Packers have not really been convincing this year outside of their win vs the Lions in week 1. The best teams the Panthers have played this year in their losses are the Patriots, Bills, and Jaguars and in those 3 games they lost by an average of 25.3 ppg. Riding with the 49ers at home coming off a convincing win vs the Cardinals last week with Brock Purdy back from injury. BOL and bet responsibly.",

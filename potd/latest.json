Both power plays sit near the top of the league, and with defensive injuries plus some volatility expected in net, this sets up as a high-tempo game where scoring can come in bunches.\n\nMy projection model (built using EdgeHawk) has this total hitting around 56% of the time. Edmonton’s home scoring pace and Dallas’s transition game bump the scoring floor higher than the current line suggests, plus money makes it worth the play.\n\nModel Source / Full Breakdown:\n👉 https://app.edgehawk.ai/public/chat/b13856c3-18b0-4b91-98f6-2acd5d296689",

I’m more than positive I’m ending my dry spell with this next pick though*\n\n**Event:** UEFA Women’s U19 Championship Qualification, Israel W U19 v Kazakhstan W U19, 8:30 am EST\n\n**POTD:** Kazakhstan U19 +2.0, +2.5 Asian Handicap -125, 1 unit\n\n**Write Up:** Once again the stakes have been pitted against an underdog too harshly. Kazakhstan U19 is a very respectable team that **doesn’t concede much** and should be absolutely fine at the proposed Asian handicap. They’ve **not lost by more than 2 goals in almost TWO years,** when they played a very strong Slovakia side. **They’ve also scored in L3/4,** showing they can nab a goal if they really want to. Some of their most notable recent results include **a 7-0 thrashing of Liechtenstein, a 5-1 dismantling of a talented Georgia side, a surprising 0-0 draw with Romania,** and a narrow 2-1 defeat at the hands of Kosovo, despite being a player down. Especially in the Euro U19 qualifiers, lower ranked teams tend to lock their opponents pretty well, not allowing a whole lot of goals. We don’t chase losses here so I’m going with just the standard unit today. The match starts in half an hour and I don’t have much time to complete the write up so BOL if you do tail, and let's get this comeback started fr 🫡\n\nEdit: *Didn’t realize the odds have slightly dropped since I placed my bet. I’ve updated the odds since that’s what most people are going to see and I think that’s only fair. The current odds are -125 and I’d take this play up to -133*",

They have 8 straight wins, not all with big difference, their last 3 wins in the league were small difference, Jahorina and Leotar 3 and 4, and Donji Vakuf at home also by 3.\n\nGuests are in a terrible shape, and also, at this point, it is clear, without enough quality, for this level of competition. Siroki coach said in a statement that Mrkonjic made some changes and does not expect an easy game, but it's probably just a common courtesy. The big losses against Sloboda and Jahorina, the other 2 top teams, which are not out good as Siroki, show me that this should go in 30+ won direction.",

We are getting a great price here on Team Epping because they are coming off of a loss last night but this is a gross overreaction. Team Epping have played much better than their record, McMillan in particular has been very precise with their guard setup. Part of this bet comes from the struggles of Gallant. He has been missing a lot of the runbacks that he would typically make which has made the back end work for Team Jacobs much more difficult. My rating system has these teams at just about a coin flip so we have incredible value at 2.99. These teams are 4-4 head-to-head over the last two seasons.",

Moving on. Yes, Embiid may not play. Yes, this may be another void. But if he does play, 17.5 is just such a low line for him. Hit it every game since his stinker season opener - 20-25-20-20-29 in his last 5 averaging 24 minutes. \n\nI think if he bothers to play he’ll be 20-21 minutes, more than enough time for him to get 18 points. He is listed as “questionable” but with Oubre and Edgecombe ruled out, and PG still finding his way back, Embiid will get plenty of chances if he plays. Genuinely doesn’t worry me if he doesn’t. Just want to jump on the odds early as if he is confirmed to play I think they’ll come in. \n\nAlso thought about the O4.5 1Q points @ $2.10 but might start a bit rusty is my thinking.",

Main reason why Im taking this is because this line shouldnt even be offered and has dipped a little.

Plus, the Lakers are without their best rebounder, Deandre Ayton, which will give more chances for Zubac to obtain more rebounds. Aside from Ayton, there aren’t really any more Centers that pose a threat in the post to Zubac, in terms of rebounding and in general.",

One I am personally very excited for that not many others probably are is actually this match between LV and The Huns. Both teams dropped to the 0-2 bracket and are now one b03 away from ellimination.\n\n* The Huns were a widely speculated name to go 0-3 at this tournament so their losses aren't suprising, however I will say if their is such a thing as a good loss, they have had two of them. They went up 6-1 on T side Mirage against PARIVISION who were 100% winrate on Mirage and on a 10+ map winstreak, they did choke and end up losing 13-8 but played a hard fought and very competitive game. Then faced B8 and narrowly lost 13-11 on Ancient, another map that B8 is very strong on. While these are both tier two teams, they are arguably two of the biggest/hyped tier two teams at the tournament and Huns have been scrappy and looking good so far. Lynn Vision were once looking on the rise as the next big team out of Asia besides MongolZ in the early-mid summer 2025. Their last couple months outside of Asian competition has been AWFUL. In the L3 months they are now 2-10 against tier 1/1.5 competition in matches. So far this tournament they have gotten absolutely dominated in back to back games by FaZe and NIP. While on paper this is better competition, I don't think it is a massive gap between the teams right now and while Huns put up 21 rounds, LV put up 7 total\n\n**Player Stats:**\n\n* Sk0r is averaging a .82 KPR in the L3 months with a .83 KPR in 2025 as a whole\n* Starry is averaging a .70 KPR in the L3 months with a .70 KPR in 2025 as a whole\n* Starry is the second best player on LV behind Z4kr, Sk0r is the clear star of The Huns roster\n\n**Projected Veto:**\n\n* The Huns ban Train, Lynn Vision ban Mirage\n* **The Huns pick Nuke**\n\n**Nuke Stats:**\n\n* The Huns are 75% winrate on 16 maps of Nuke in the L3 months\n* Lynn Vision are 29% winrate on 7 maps of Nuke in the L3 months (against better competition)\n* Despite Lynn Vision dominating the h2h lifetime 12-7, all of their maps have been extremely close, most recently they face in August 2025, both games went 21+ rounds, the time before that, they went 24/23 rounds, \n* Huns core roster is 2-1 on Nuke h2h against Lynn Vision despite a 7-12 record overall in individual maps\n* Starry is averaging a .66 KPR on Nuke in the L3 months, one of his worst maps in the pool\n* Sk0r is averaging a .82 KPR on Nuke in the L3 months",

This team has already been battle tested against the likes of Houston and they took care of business against an Oregon team that although I stated in my Auburn write up if u saw is a little bit underwhelming yes. However I think Michigan is the most overrated team in college basketball at the moment. I don’t think Elliot cadeau is all that good either. My power ratings makes this Auburn -1.

And cashed our bet. \n\nFor today's POTD i am once again going with my boy Lamine yamal to get 1.5 shots on target against chelsea. I previously picked this against PSG at home and Lamine didn't even get 1 shot on target. But things have changed. Since that real madrid lose he has learned a few different things. Before real madrid loss this season lamine was asking to take penalties and after scoring a goal he was crowning himself in celebration. But after that real madrid loss and backlash from fans he is celebrating with the fans and Kissing the BADGE. In last match against Bilbao. He was once again back to giving trivela assists and they looked absolutely beautiful. And i may sound dumb for saying this but that girl niki Nicole was a bad influence. He broke up with her after that madrid loss and is back in form. Now it might be a coincidence but i don't think so. \n\n\n**|**In champions league lamine yamal is averaging 1.42 shots on target per 90 . Which makes it a bad bet . But most of those matches were before real madrid loss.  After that against brugge Lamine had 3 shots on target . **|**\n\nWith Lewandowski and raphinha back . Lamine will try to assist more which might result into him getting less shots on target. Lamine yamal to assist is another great bet i would be taking which is also the same odds.  \n\n\nDo whatever you think is best. \n\n\nBUT\n\n\nAlways bet responsibly .\n\n\nBOL if tailing \n\nBOL if fading",

The Bowling Green Falcons are facing off against who I believe is the worst FBS football team this year as the Minutemen have been blown out in every single game they have played and with a 0-11 record they have not even beat an FCS team as they lost to FCS Bryant on their home field. This Minutemn team is bad on both sides of the ball as they rank second to last in the FBS in scoring offense with only 10 points per game and bottom five in scoring defense allowing 38 points per game. The rush game on offense and defense is what really kills this Minutemen team as they only average 83 rushing yards per game while giving up over 216 rushing yards per game. I believe this huge weakness on defense plays into the Falcons game plan well as they are a run first team so I expect them to pound the rock a lot in this one and find success doing so. I also like the Western Michigan Broncos in this one as they have a lot to play for in this one as if they win this game they are heading to the MAC championship as well as taking home the Michigan MAC rivalry trophy. This Broncos team has one of the best rushing attacks in the conference averaging over 180 rush yards a game and they face a rush defense that is even rated worse than the Minutemen giving up over 225 rushing yards per game so I think dual threat quarterback Broc Lowry and runningback Jalen Buckley will find success running through this Eagles defense. In contrast, the Broncos have a great defense and is one of the best defenses in the conference and even the nation in passing defense as they rank eighth in the nation with just 160 pass yards allowed on average per game and 16th in FBS in scoring allowing just 18 points per game. Western Michigan has been great in conference play this year winning seven out of their past eight games and I am even impressed about the game this team played earlier on in the year against North Texas where they played a great offensive game against a very solid ranked North Texas team and lost a close one in overtime. On the other hand, this eastern Michigan squad has not played well at all against teams at .500 or better with losses in every game against all of those teams and they even have a loss against FCS Long Island so I believe that the Broncos team outmatches this Eagles team.\n\nPrediction: 28-17 Falcons, 30-24 Broncos\n\nLast pick:🏈Vanderbilt ML/Texas ML💰Love a good no sweat winner like that!!\n\nBest of luck to everyone tailing and remember to bet responsibly!

      "text": "Record: 165-137, +4.1 units\n\nLast Pick: Oleg Prihodko ML vs Bernabe Zapata Miralles (-193, 1 unit): Win\n\nTennis | Bogotá Challenger | 2:10 PM EST (estimated)\n\nToday's Pick: Sebastian Gima vs Nicolas Mejia | **Mejia to win 2-0 at +100 (DK). 1 unit.**\n\nWrite-up: I can't even say what the closing line was on that pick, because pretty much every book took it down before the match. Not sure if there's any sort of suspicious betting activity around those players, but it was quite a strange sight. Either way, Prihodko was able to come back from a tough first set and finish the match with a 6-0 third set. \n\nToday, I'm moving over to the Bogotá Challenger, one of two clay-court events in the final week of the CH season. The city sits at over 3000 meters of elevation, meaning that these courts play a bit faster than your average clay, and players who can handle altitude will have a significant advantage. \n\nNicolas Mejía comes into this tournament as the No. 2 seed and highest-ranked home player in the draw. He will be making his sixth appearance here in Bogota (though all of those events were held at different times in the year); meanwhile, this is Gima's first time playing in the city. Mejia is a bit of an altitude specialist, with two of his six CH finals and one of his two titles coming at over 3000 meters of elevation. He also won a title on green clay, which tends to play a bit faster than usual (similar to altitude clay), earlier this year. Mejia will be coming into this event with two full weeks of rest, while Gima makes the trek from Guayaquil, Ecuador (which sits at just 13 m). \n\nHow much tread a player has on their tires is super important at this time of year, and I believe that Mejia, who has only played three indoor hard events in the US in the past month, should be better situated in that regard. While he didn't perform especially well in those events, he did at least take a set off Murphy Cassone in Knoxville, and will be happy to return to his favorite surface. Gima may benefit to some degree from all the clay-court tennis he's been playing, but he hasn't exactly been performing well in those events, as he took just three games off Andres Andrade in his most recent outing. To be fair, Andrade was a -455 favorite, but that brings up the question of why Mejia's ML should only be at -260 here. I believe that Mejia and Andrade are playing at similar levels right now, and both closed at similar odds against Juan Bautista Torres in Cali.\n\nIn terms of playing style, Gima possesses an aggressive lefty game, but I believe that Mejia has the more stable backhand and superior serve. Mejia also has been solid against lefties on clay this year, with two wins and one three-set loss (close to even money in all three matches). Overall, I'm happy to back the home favorite to come through without much trouble against a slumping clay-courter with much less altitude experience. \n\nNote: The [POTD Capper Tracker](https://potd.lol), which you may remember from its Google Sheet days, is finally back in a cleaner, more robust website format!

A 13 minute red card for an Everton player slapping his own teammate. Obviously this really gutted our chances as Ndiaye shifted to a quasi-right back and Everton saw very little of the ball. Bummer too because he had a great chance early and was looking sharp. Fun fact, that was the 3rd time in Premier league history a player has been sent off for hitting a teammate. 3 times in 33 years. Anyways enough harping on that, on to the next. \n\nIn other news...guys...they're giving us Enzo 1+ SOT at plus money again. We've cashed this twice already in the last month and all of the same stats/data/feelings apply. \n\nOff we go back to London where Chelsea hosts Barcelona in the Champions League match of the week. As you all know, Barcelona is a great team. However, they have been leaky defensively over the last few matches, particularly in UCL, notably conceding 3 goals (6 SOT) to Brugge in their last CL match and 7 SOT to an injury ridden PSG. Both teams will want a win here, but I like Chelsea to show up here in front of their home crowd. \n\nThe caveat here is that **there is a non-zero chance that coach rotates some players** around for this mid week match as he has been known to do, but I really can't see him leaving out Enzo for a match this big. Even if he does come in as a sub, he will want to make an impact quickly and go for goal. \n\nIn case you want more #s, this has hit in his last 2/2 UCL matches (including the last match where he came on as a sub) and in his last 6/6 EPL matches (averaging 3 shots per game, just under 2 on target). \n\n**UCL and Europa matches are tough to predict**, squads get rotated, flukes happen, so mind your units. But I like our guy here again in this huge match, and I'm riding the Enzo train until the wheels fall off. BOL if tailing!",

But let's not get depressed because of that and I got another one coming here. Here is the reasoning for my pick: \n\nIf we look at the stats, this matchup is in Galatasaray’s favour. Their great attacking, strong defensive team play in past couple of weeks and UNBEATEN home record give them a clear edge. Union SG’s defensive unreliability, combined with their inconsistent away form, increases the difficulty of their mission to win or take points in Istanbul.\n\nGalatasaray are currently one of the hottest home sides across Europe - unbeaten in nine straight matches - and they are well-positioned to extend their Champions League winning streak to FOUR consecutive games.\n\nFew reasons why I expect that Galatasaray Will win:\n\nGalatasaray has three consecutive wins in last 3 rounds of UCL and are still unbeaten on home soil this whole season, with a record of NINE MATCHES WITHOUT A DEFEAT ACROSS ALL COMPETITIONS! Thats a crazy stat IMO! Also to add, USG has three back to back losses on UCL this season.\n\n**Pick: Galatasaray to Win.**\n\n\nBOL, let,s turn the record to 1-1! \n\nps. sorry if the text is not perfect in english, english is not my native language.",

He’ll be super motivated to continue his great form into this challenger tournament with more ranking points and prize money as incentive.\n\nJames Story. 24 year old British ITF hard court farmer. Better doubles player than he is a singles player. He’ll be playing doubles here too so he’s got a built in fall-back mentally (and financially) knowing he has a doubles game the following day. He does ok farming low level M25 hard court tourneys but He’s only played *TWO* challenger level singles this year on hard courts beating Silvestre as a -10000 favourite and then loses the next game to Sakellaridis as a -500 favourite… He’ll be exposed tomorrow and Caniato will show levels on the outdoor harcourts of Athens 2.\n\nRide with the hottest capper in this subreddit and come see why they NVS🌟\n\n*If I’ve made you money and want to tip*: [BMAC☕️](https://buymeacoffee.com/nvsbets) or [BTC](https://pastebin.com/0Lf0mHqu) [ETH](https://pastebin.com/D2QRi3Bx)",

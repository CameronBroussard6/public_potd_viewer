      "text": "Record 6-1-1\n\nNet: 6.82u\n\nPast Pick: VJ Edgecombe 22+ PA\n\nRecap: Wow what a fucking sweat once again. The start of the game Nick Nurse decided he no longer wanted to play with Edgecombe. Despite Edgecombe having been the win condition against the Celtics originally, it seemed like the 76ers didn’t want them in their main offense and elected to favor the 2 man between Maxey and Embiid. Once the game started to look lost, Edgecombe found his footing and brought them quickly back into the game. Overall, I liked the pick, but didn’t think he would be shifted to the corner as much as he did in this matchup given the history previously./\n\n\n\nGame: Rockets @ Celtics 8:00pm EST\n\nPick: KD o24.5 pts, -115, 2u -> 3.74u\n\nReasoning: The Celtics are coming off a brutal game against the 76ers. For example, near the end, the exhaustion on Jaylen Brown was very evident. The expected main defenders tasked on KD will be JB or Minott. Jaylen Brown has had to shoulder a lot of the offensive load this season and has taken a step back defensively as a cause of this. Minott is having a “breakout” season of sorts. While the data on him is a bit sparse, defensively a good comparison is Kris Dunn, where Kevin Durant has done a decent job scoring on a more veteran defender. Minott will likely not be used to the shifty nature of KD as this isn’t a player archetype that is super common.\n\n\n\nAnother factor to consider here is that Queta, the Celtic’s center has historically posed issues on Sengun’s scoring output. This means that more of the load will be placed on KD’s shoulders. And so I suspect KD will have a big game and crush this 25 point line.",

      "text": "**POTD Record 37-35-1**\n\nWell cannot get a streak going, and last nights loss stung. Philly had 2 chances to win it in the final 30 seconds of the game down 1 point, and failed to create a good look. I feel like I was pretty spot on with the game overall, however Boston's 13 point lead in the 1st Q, really hurt Philly, as they outscored Boston every quarter from there, and lost the game by 1. I will say hopefully some of you got the closing line of +1.5, in which you covered.\n\nAnyways, back at it again today, and targeting a team I have targeted 2 times already, and was a loser in both.\n\n**Rockets -5.5**\n\nOkay, I know this may seem like a stubborn bet, attacking the same team that beat me yesterday, as well as my cavs earlier this week (bet Cleveland also) but as much as i tried to avoid making this my play, I just like the bet so much...... I know the numbers don't back me up, but I just do not think this Boston team will be good long term this season, even though they are hot right now, and their bad shooting so far this season makes it look like they have more upside, I just do not think that. \n\nHouston started the season 0-2, playing two of the top teams in the league, losing down the stretch, however this team is building momentum. The Rockets have won their last two games in blowout fashion (137–109 vs. Brooklyn and 139–121 vs. Toronto) and are averaging a league-best 127.8 PPG so far. In fact, Houston’s offense ranks 3rd in the NBA in scoring (50% FG). In short, Houston’s form is clicking they’ve outscored opponents by 25+ in their wins while Boston has looked good, but aside from Cleveland there are no games they have had this season that I am super impressed with.\n\nHouston is deep. In the 137–109 win over Brooklyn, seven Rockets scored in double figures, Eason (22 points) and Şengun (21 points), Reed Sheppard added 15 and Thompson chipped in 12 points and 8 assists. This balanced attack (57.6% shooting, 16-of-32 from 3PT) shows Houston’s depth beyond Durant is a high level nine-man rotation.\n\nBoston lacks that firepower behind its starters. Sam Hauser and Simmons led the reserves. Hauser had 21 points against CLE and last night Simons had 19 (7-21 shooting though...) and 25 vs NO, but aside from those (and Garza had a 16pt game vs NOP) nobody else on the bench has been a consistent scorer. With Tatum out this season, Boston’s offense falls heavily on Brown (30 points vs CLE & 32 vs Philly) and Derrick White (yet to have a high scoring game 19 vs CLE, and 25 vs Philly in game 1, which was his highest so far this season), while role players have yet to fill the gap. Overall, Houston’s deep roster and hot bench play give it a clear advantage in keeping fresh legs and second-unit scoring throughout the game, especially with Boston on a B2B in a game that game down to the final play.\n\nHouston is 3-1 ATS, and 2-0 ATS so far on the road, and with them having two days of rest since routing Toronto, and Boston on a B2B, I expect Houston to come ready to play against a sluggish Boston team tonight. Early markets agree that Houston is the sharper side. The line opened HOU –4 and has already ticked to –4.5; smart money is clearly leaning on the Rockets covering. Interestingly, public tickets are split, a slight 51% lean to Boston likely because Boston is at home. Again I know Boston's numbers look good, but I have watched their last 5 games, and I genuinely just don't see it. Going with my eyes in this game, and expect a Houston ass kicking.\n\nPS: Orlando -8.5 was another bet I really liked today, as I think they are about to come into form after starting the season 1-4 (4 straight losses), I really liked what I saw out of them at Charlotte the other night, and believe Washington is a perfect team to build off of that.",

      "text": "Record: 45-40\n\nThe odds were opened incorrectly, I said yesterday that Trefl should be the favorite. 0-3 🎯\n\n**Napoli - Como ⚽** Serie A ⏳ 45 Minutes\n\nPick: **Nico Paz Fouls Over 1.5** @ 1.75\n\nComo, under Cesc Fàbregas, deploys Paz as a \"number 10\" in a 4-2-3-1 formation; a hybrid midfielder-forward who both receives the first press and intercepts passes. This role naturally increases the risk of \"tactical fouls,\" especially against opposing numbers six and eight. In 2025/26 Serie A, Paz's average foul rate is 2.58/90 mins. This bare-bones data suggests a reasonable threshold of \"2 fouls.\" Conte's Napoli are aggressive centrally in a 4-3-3 this season, attempting to create one-on-ones on the wings. Their potential starting lineup includes a strong, contact-loving trio of Anguissa, Gilmour, and McMominay in the center. As the primary pressing/trigger player, Paz is likely to call a foul on this trio frequently. Wingers like Politano and Neres, who draw fouls off the dribble, also force Como's block to be squeezed in, forcing Paz to connect on his back-to-back runs. Last season, when the two teams met at this stadium (October 4, 2024), Paz committed three fouls.\n\n\n\nNico Paz's away fouls (2025/26 Serie A, as of November 1, 2025)\n\nBologna 1–0 Como (August 30): 3 fouls.\n\nFiorentina 1–2 Como (September 21): 2 fouls.\n\nAtalanta 1–1 Como (October 4): 4 fouls.\n\nParma 0–0 Como (October 25): 3 fouls.\n\nTotal (away): 12 fouls (4 games) Average: 3.0 fouls/away game\n\n\n\n**Note**: Luca Zufferli, the referee for today's match, has called an average of 28.6 fouls in his 5 Serie A matches this season; he has a relatively high foul rate for a referee.",

Last season he also lead the league with an average of 13.9RPG as he has been dominant on the boards consistently, ranking first for two consecutive seasons.\n\nGiannis is questionable with his left knee so if he is out this correlates for more opportunities for Sabonis to grab. Even if he does play I expect some limitations on Giannis rebounding efforts with his knee soreness. \n\nSabonis has beat Miles Turner h2h on the glass he’s averaging just 6.8RPG. In games Giannis is out dating back to last season Turner has averaged just 7RPG while playing with the Pacers, not an elite rebounder with Giannis absence. Even last game Bucks starting PG Rollins scrapped out more than double the amount of rebs than Turner.\n\nWith Sabonis elite rebounding consistency, Turner’s weakness on the glass, and the potential Giannis absence creating a vacuum on the boards, this is a great opportunity to expect to hit the over.\n\nIf tailing, only risk what you can afford to lose.

Guirassy scored a nice goal in the 37th but honestly both teams looked really flat which turned the match into a borefest. Anyways Dortmund ended on just 3 corners.\n\nFollowing an insane 23/24 season where Leverkusen won the league undefeated 17 points clear and one loss in all competitions, their purple patch has dried up. It’s not really a surprise with all the departures and that level being unsustainable in the long-run but they still finished a respectable second last year. This year they find themselves in 5th spot 3 points from second but following Ten Hag’s dismal stint things are slightly looking up with Hjulmand at the wheel and just 1 loss in ten (against PSG).  Meanwhile Bayern have won all 14 of their games with Kompany’s style finally starting to click, being rewarded with a contract extension. Despite this domination, Die Roten doesn’t actually average that many corners with 5.3 won at home over their last 10 and 4.3 conceded. Leverkusen on the other hand have won 4.6 and conceded 4.5 on average away from home. Even by adjusting for more pressure on Bayer 04 (since they are the worse team) I get a mean of 5.1 corners for Bayern and 4.3 for Leverkusen.\n\nThat gives this play an 81% win probability. Opponents (including way inferior opposition) have covered this line in 9/10 matches at the Allianz and Leverkusen in 7/10 on the road. The one factor that does play against the play is that this fixture last year saw 6 Bayern corners to Leverkusen’s 1 but nevertheless I still really like the value and the line does surprise me.

They are very inconsistent and are unable to control matches like they used to. This results in open matches and plenty of chances for opponents to score. Their shaky form also gives teams the feeling that a result is possible against Ajax, even on their home turf in the Amsterdam Arena. The pressure is mounting for trainer **Johnny Heitinga**, who must know that every match can be his last match. He recently changed goalkeepers in order to solidify his defence, but I think **Remko Pasveer** is getting too old to perform well at this level. He does however know how to coach the defenders and improve the defensive line in that way. **Wout Weghorst** and **Oskar Gloukh** are the top scorers for the team, so I expect at least one of them will score today. They normally perform well against Heerenveen (9 wins / 1 loss in the last 10 matches), but for me the ML is a bit too risky today.\n\nAfter a disappointing start of the season, SC Heerenveen has been playing very well recently. I find this unsurprising, as I believe they have a very decent team with good players. They weren’t outplayed in the beginning of the season, but mostly lost point due to unlucky moments. The most dangerous player at this moment in my opinion is **Jacob Trenskow**; he creates lots of chances and also scored 5 goals himself. Their main striker, **Dylan Vente**, is the top scorer of the team with 6 goals, so I wouldn’t be surprised if he manages to get one in today. Their defensive line hasn’t been great so far this season and they haven’t had a single clean sheet so far. I also don’t expect them to get their first clean sheet of the season today playing against Ajax.\n\nAll in all two teams with good attacking skills and shaky defences will face each other today, so I expect an open match with goals from both sides.\n\nBOL to everyone who is tailing!",

Mississippi state has been knocking on the door of a win in the sec all fucking year (yes I know Arkansas has too). But this miss state team has now been winless in the sec dating back to the 2023 season. This team is angry and their coach said “We've got a pissed off football team,” Mississippi State coach Jeff Lebby, who is still looking for his first conference win at any level of football as a head coach, said on Monday. “(This team) isn't hanging their head and is not feeling sorry for themselves. This is a football team that is ready to go prove that we're a good football team.” Miss state can actually sling it and I’m gonna tell u what, I don’t care if Arkansas can score (they can) they cannot stop ANYBODY. 103rd in passing yards allowed per game and 128th in rushing yards per game. This is gonna be a fun one, I’m not overthinking this, I’m taking the points with a team that arguably is better and on top of that shouldn’t be getting anything over 3 in this game.

Now it may sound weird to hear that a team impressed me in two games they lost this year but this Cougars team stood out out to me in their losses against #7 ranked Ole Miss and #15 ranked Virginia. In both road games across the country for the Cougars they lost these two games by a combined 5 points and they had amazing defensive performances in both games. The Cougars held the Ole Miss Rebels high powered offense to a season low of 24 points and they ran the ball well on the Rebels as running back Kirby Vorhees averaged 8.8 yards per carry and a touchdown against Ole Miss. The Cougars have wins against Idaho, San Diego State, Colorado State and Toledo while the Beavers of Oregon State only has one win against a FCS Lafayette squad in a game where they were losing at halftime in. This Oregon State defense is one of the worst in division one FBS as they rank 121st in passing yards allowed per game, 83rd in rushing yards allowed per game and 119th in points allowed per game so I think this Cougars offense will find success moving the ball against this Oregon State defense.\n\nPrediction: 27-21 Cougars\n\nLast pick:🏈Tulane ML/Ravens ML💩Tulane shit the bed.

Cirstea once again had 5 break opportunities, but only converted 1 of them this time instead of all 5, and it was a straightforward (6-4), (6-4) affair.\n\nMarkkanen has the Suns number for scoring this year, with 33 points midway through the 4th last I checked . He put up 51 points last game in a OT win vs them. They’re going to lose this time around, but he still showed up to make this a very sweat-free win for us. \n\n——————————————————\n\n**Today’s Pick** - **Fernandez ML vs Mboko and Over 21.5 games** (**+200**) bet365 **2 units** ❌\n\n——————————————————\n\n**Hong Kong WTA 3:30AM EST** starts in approximately 3 hours\n\n——————————————————\n\nI’m going back to Hong Kong and sticking with Leylah again. I linked the write up to my previous pick above, if you want to read my analysis prognosticating her match vs Cirstea. \n\nIn this one, we have a clash of countrywomen, with Canada’s rising phenom Victoria Mboko facing Canadian #1 Leylah Fernandez. This is their first meeting, so there’s no data on that front, but there’s plenty else to analyze and try to infer upon.\n\nSo far in Hong Kong, Fernandez has annihilated every opponent, winning all three matches in clean straight sets.\n\nShe plays very well historically in this tournament, winning it in 2023 and reaching the semifinals last year.\n\nI watched Leylah’s match against Cirstea, and it’s clear that she’s in excellent form. Her return was excellent and she used it to absolutely punish Cirstea’s second serve — winning 71% of those points.\n\nComparing this match to their last match in Osaka this month, something that stands out is that Fernandez won 74.4% of her first serve points this time versus only 57.9% in Osaka. \n\nShe’s been incredibly consistent in that area, winning 75.9% vs her first round opponent Wang and 77.4% vs Lys in the 2nd round. \n\nHer serve is dialed in right now and I don’t see that changing against Mboko.\n\nMboko has been good too, but hasn’t had as clean of a run to the semifinals, needing 3 sets to beat World #134 Gibson and #51 Eala along the way. She had a nice win against #35 Kalinskaya, last round, although she retired in the second set.\n\nEala is a lefty like Fernandez and similar in some regards, albeit an inferior player, and gave Mboko some trouble.\n\nMboko has a good serve, particularly her first serve, putting up good 1st in and similar 1st win percentages to Leylah. \n\nHer second serve can be susceptible, as evidenced by her recent match against Rybakina in which she only won 18% of her second serves.\n\nA similar story to what happened to Cirstea against Fernandez.\n\nLeylah has significantly more consistent 2nd serve win percentages over the season, and I think that it’s plausible that might separate them and decide the match. \n\nBoth players will want to win this match and prove themselves the best Canadian. I expect this to be tightly contested, but Leylah’s brilliant form and her experience edge over the young Mboko will carry her to victory in 3 sets. \n\nThe over 21.5 games also covers a close two set win: (7-6, 6-4/3) and (7-5, 6-4). \n\nDon’t bet more than you can afford, and keep in mind that it is a long odds pick, keeping with my strategy. Not every pick will hit, and I only need 45-50% to make solid profit in the long run.\n\nBOL",

In one corner we have Vanderbilt, led by senior Diego Pavia. The Commodores are ranked inside the top ten for the first time since the 1940s with him under center, and their lone loss on the season was against Bama. Vandy has been taking care of business in conference play so far this season, and they’re coming off of a close win against a ranked Missouri squad.\n\nIn the other corner we have Texas. Led by future commercial actor Arch Manning, the longhorns strike me as the ultimate paper tiger. Sure they dominated rival Oklahoma, but that performance was preceded by an ugly loss to Florida and followed up with 2 narrow wins against SEC bottom dwellers Kentucky and Mississippi State. To make matters worse, Arch Manning is dealing with a concussion he suffered last week and yet he has been cleared to play.\n\nThis is a must win for both teams and the pressure will be palpable. I think this will ultimately come down to which QB executes better, and my money isn’t on Arch. Between the injury troubles and high expectations at home, I’m picking the Commodores to continue their last hurrah season with Pavia by getting a win in Austin. BOL to those who tail.

Always feels good to win early.\n\nAlright, to the next one. Rutgers heads to Champaign, and while the number looks tempting for an over, the math — and the vibes — say otherwise.\n\nLet’s start with the Scarlet Knights. On the road this year, Rutgers have only hit the over once in three tries — and that was the emotional game for Athan Kaliakmanis’s first trip back to his old stadium against his old team. Outside of that anomaly? The Rutgers stay pretty tamed on the road. They’re averaging just 25 points on the road while giving up 31.\n\nFlip it to Illinois: They have hit the over just once in their four home games. They’re averaging 35 points at home while holding opponents to a tidy 17 on average. That defense has taken some serious hits and has given up an average of 39.5 points per game over the last 6 weeks. And yes, I agree, it looks bad. However, I expect some serious adjustments — and a bit of pride — to kick in for Saturday's matchup.\n\nIllinois is also staring down back-to-back losses for the first time this season. They haven’t dropped three straight since 2022, so you know they’re coming in focused. I don’t see them turning this into a track meet — more like a grind-it-out, Big Ten-style “get-right” game. Expect clock control, methodical drives, and a few stalled red-zone trips.\n\nCould it get high scoring? Sure. But a shootout? Nah. Not with these trends, not with this motivation.\n\nI’m buying up a few points and hammering Under 65.5.

My wife has been looking forward to the 69% I’ve planned a present. Vanderbilt is one of the most surprising teams in the NCAA as they come in at 7-1 on the season, including 3-1 in the SEC. The Texas Longhorns come in off a 45-38 OT win on the road against Mississippi State to move to 6-2 on the year, including 3-1 within the SEC. Vandy has been the talk of the town & all eyes will be on them this weekend. It’s an elimination game as the loser will most likely be eliminated from the playoffs.\n\n\nHeisman hopeful Vandy QB Diego Pavia may be the star of the show, but Vandy’s offense is built around its run game. Vandy’s strategy, especially vs teams that are good, is to run the ball & control the clock. __This has resulted in Vandy ranking 133rd in pace of play, allowing them to wear down opposing defenses.__ The strategy works because Vandy’s OLine is elite, one of the best run blocking units in the nation. Vandy has strong side & quick side OL. This scheme puts players in a better position to highlight their strengths, the quick guard will be in a position to be the pulling guard more frequently. It took a little bit for Vandy to get the scheme working. But in the 2nd year of the offense, it’s running well & it gives them a huge edge in the run game in this matchup. __Vandy’s OL leads the NCAA in opponent adjusted yards before contact. A huge turnaround for an OL that ranked 130th by the same metric last year.__ As for the run game matchup Vandy is clearly superior. Since Vandy leans on heavier formations that stack the box, defenses don’t respect Pavia’s arm, & Vandy sees stacked boxes at a high rate. __Vandy RB’s have ran into a stacked box (7+ defenders) 77% of the time, 3rd highest rate in NCAA. When running into a stacked box, Vandy RB’s are averaging an absurd 7.3 yards per rush, most the nation. To provide some context, Ashton Jeanty averaged 6.2 yards per attempt into a stacked box.__ Pavia is a critical part of the Vandy offense due to his legs, he’s averaging 64.3 ypg on the ground, excluding sacks. __A QB always willing to chase big plays, Pavia generates an EPA of 1.0 or higher on 24% of his dropbacks vs pressure, ranked 15th. They also excel in 3rd & long avoidance rate, ranking 5th at 15%.__ Their defense has been on point as well which will be huge vs a big Texas offense.\n\nTexas has leaned on a slightly pass heavy offense this year under Manning QB Arch Manning. __Texas has thrown the ball at a rate 3.5% above expected based on situational data.__ But Manning’s availability is up in the air after a concussion vs Mississsippi St last week. If Manning can’t suit up, his backup, Matthew Caldwell, would likely take over. \nCaldwell is a redshirt-senior in his 1st year with Texas, having previously played at Jacksonville State, Gardner Webb, & Troy. \nIt’s hard to imagine Steve Sarkisian trusting Caldwell, who began the 2024 season as the backup at Troy, to execute Texas’s typical game plan. __Unfortunately Texas doesn’t have much of a rushing attack & will be at a disadvantage on the ground based on these opponent-adjusted numbers:__\n\nTexas: ranks 89th in yards after contact\n\nVandy: ranks 20th in yards after contact allowed\n\nVandy should have an edge vs a Steve Sarkisian spread offense, which typically creates light boxes. __Here are the stats vs small boxes with 6 or less defenders in the box, which accounts for 59% of Texas’ handoffs:__\n\nTexas: 4.4 yards per attempt, ranked 104th\n\nVanderbilt: 5.4 yards per attempt allowed, ranked 67th\n\nIf Texas has to throw the ball with Caldwell, they will need a conservative attack due to his issues as a downfield passer. __Last year at Troy, Caldwell’s 49% on target rate on throws of 10 or more yards downfield ranked 130th. \nEven if Manning starts he has 51% on target rate which doesn’t inspire confidence either.__ Surprisingly, Texas has been an aggressive downfield passing team. __Outside the red zone, 30% of Texas’ pass attempts have been 15+ yards downfield, the 8th highest rate in the NCAA.__ One of the reasons Texas’ commitment to the downfield attack has been so confusing is their struggling OL. __Here is how the Texas has done this year:__\n\n__Texas: ranked 113th in pressure rate allowed__\n__Vandy: ranks 70th in pressure rate generated__\n\nAlthough neither line is very strong, Vandy will likely mess them up. __Manning has taken a traditional dropback 63% of his passes, l 20th highest rate in the NCAA, which invites more pressure.__ Vandy’s pressure rate on traditional dropbacks vs quick dropbacks (zero/one step dropbacks & RPOs) is a big difference:\n\nTraditional dropbacks: 46%, ranks 35th\n\nQuick dropbacks: 21%, ranked 73rd\n\nVandy has a disruptive DLine that can affect Texas’s style of play. If Caldwell starts, there’s a chance Texas could focus on quick dropbacks, he took a quick dropback 44% of the time last year at Troy, but it would be a significant change in Sark’s approach. __Texas’s 19.9% quick dropback rate ranks 123rd in the NCAA, & on those plays, they are only gaining 6.0 yards per attempt, ranked 91st.__\n\n__Vanderbilt +3__\n\nAppreciate the love!

However, I don't necessarily think it was the best play, because Rosenkranz was definitely the better player, and I feel that I should have known that he would succeed in that matchup. \n\nToday, I'm going with Henry Bernet to beat Thiago Agustin Tirante in the first round of Athens qualifying. This is the first year that this event is being hosted in Greece (moved from Belgrade, Serbia after last year), so it's hard to know exactly how the conditions will play. However, it can be expected that they will be reasonably fast, as with most indoor events around this time of year (with the notable exception of Paris. 18-year-old Henry Bernet is one of the top Swiss prospects right now, having won the Australian Open Juniors at the beginning of the year and drawn comparisons to Roger Federer with his one-handed backhand. Injuries have significantly affected his schedule this year, meaning he hasn't made a ton of noise on the pro tour yet, but that doesn't matter too much to me after the match he played against Jakub Mensik in Basel. Bernet's serve and forehand were firing in that match (8 and 7.8 shot quality ratings), and he was able to pull off some really nice shots with the backhand as well, even if it remains inconsistent. I understand why Tirante is favored as the much more proven and well-rounded player, but two big things would concern me about backing the Argentinian here. First, he's never really been an indoor player, even if his fast-court game might be slightly underrated. Second, he's had a pretty packed schedule recently, switching from clay to indoor hard last week and coming here with just a day of rest after losing to Lajal in Bratislava. The odds movement on this play has been a bit weird, as Bernet moved down to 2.24 from an opening price of 2.48 before swinging all the way back to this price. However, my prediction is that this is the highest you'll see him, and these odds present 1 unit of value to me. \n\nNote: The [POTD Capper Tracker](https://potd.lol), which you may remember from its Google Sheet days, is finally back in a cleaner, more robust website format!

William Saliba and Gabriel are one of the best defensive partnerships in the Premier League, and David Raya in goal has been making excellent saves, meaning Arsenal almost never concede goals at home or away. Burnley are sitting 16th in the league with only 10 points from 9 games and have struggled badly to score, especially when playing against big teams like Arsenal. Scott Parker's team is very defensive and they have missing several key attacking players who are injured for a long time. Arsenal are the league leaders and are hungry to keep winning, so they will control the game completely and not let Burnley have any chances to score. With Arsenal in their best defensive form of the season and Burnley struggling to score against anyone, this is one of the safe picks for today. \n\n\nIf you found these picks helpful, tips or donations are greatly appreciated as they support the time and effort I put into creating them: [buy me a beer🍻](https://buymeacoffee.com/hercules.son.of.zeus)",

Also being afraid to cop a corner or foul someone changes the way you defend too. \n\nBurnley probably look like the most likely club to go down at the moment, but they have been a lot better at home and have only conceded two goals in four home games. \n\nIn fact their 4 home games have only had a total of 8 goals.\n\nGranted, Burnley have played the other two promoted teams at home, but they've also had Liverpool and Forest. And while those sides aren't as good as they were last season, they'd still expect to beat Burnley.\n\nIn Arsenal's four away games they're 3-0-1, with that loss being the crazy Liverpool free kick.\n\nArsenal 4 away games have only had a total of 6 goals so far. \n\nI think Burnley are going to sit deep, keep things very tight but it won't be enough. \n\nI like the u3.5 goals instead of the 2.5 for a few reasons... But at these odds I like having an extra goal up my sleeve. \n\nAlso, Gabriel is $3.60 to have a shot on target which I think is great value as he's a beast at corners.",

Though loss last time, Mbappé failed the penalty, then the goal offside and the endless chances where both teams could've scored on the second half. \n\n\n\n\n\nEPL Combo Pick: Brentford Over 0.5 + Liverpool vs Aston Villa BTTS\n\nCrystal Palace versus Brentford is a matchup that historically screams goals. Looking at the last six meetings between these sides, all six have seen both teams find the net, with the average fixture producing 1.56 goals from Brentford and 1.33 from Palace. This isn't by accident, it's the nature of how these two play.\n\nWhat's most compelling about Brentford right now is the quality they're bringing to every attack. Over the 2024-25 season, the Bees recorded the highest xG-per-shot in the entire Premier League at 0.15, bettering even champions Liverpool who sat at 0.14. They've been clinical, efficient, and prolific throughout the campaign, averaging 1.28 xG per match while taking a sharp 10.67 shots per game. Igor Thiago, Daamsgard and Kevin Schade have formed a genuinely destructive attacking unit that has blown away most defences they've faced. At Selhurst Park, Brentford are conceding goals at a higher rate away from home at 75 percent compared to Crystal Palace's 75 percent at home, creating the ideal environment for a goalfest. I'm backing Brentford to score at least once, they've been too good to ignore in the final third.\n\nLiverpool versus Aston Villa is where the real story unfolds. Liverpool's defensive issues are becoming increasingly difficult to ignore, and Villa possess the attacking prowess to exploit them comprehensively. In their last 10 meetings, both sides have scored in nine of those matches, delivering consistent BTTS outcomes. Looking at the broader picture, Liverpool are conceding at an alarming 63 percent rate this season, while the Reds themselves maintain a 97 percent scoring rate across all competitions. Aston Villa, having won four in a row heading into this fixture, have shown they can trouble elite defences. Liverpool's home record against Villa specifically shows BTTS landing in 75 percent of matches, with the Reds scoring in every single game at Anfield in their current data set while Villa managed to put the ball past them in 50 percent of away visits. Both teams averaging 1.8 and 1.4 goals respectively over their recent runs means the 3.5 goal line feels realistic. Liverpool will score because they always do at home, but Villa have the tools and form to breach Liverpool's backline and make this interesting. Expect both teams to get on the scoresheet.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's cash it!\n\n\n\n\nPS: Glad to hear so many of you are enjoying the write-ups and making profits from the tips!

His career match-win rate of ~55.7% and frame-win rate over 53% indicate that he is consistently stronger than a break-even player. Meanwhile, Wells hovers just above 50% for both match and frame wins, suggesting Ford has a higher ceiling in head-to-head play. Adding to that, Ford’s strong performance in opening matches (winning ~61.5% of his first-in-tournament matches) gives him a psychological and practical advantage when starting a fresh event like the International Championship.\n\nFurthermore, Ford’s recent dominance over Wells…including two convincing wins in 2025…suggests he understands how to exploit Wells’s game under pressure. If Ford brings the same tactical discipline and capitalizes on early frames, he’s well-positioned to control the match rhythm and come out on top. \n\nAs always, BOL and stick to the unit system, snooker can be a silly sport but Tom Ford is a solid veteran that I think can pull through in this match.

They don’t park the bus; they press, they open spaces, and when they fall behind, the game turns chaotic fast.\n\nEstrela are just as wild. They can look compact one week and then explode into a shoot-out the next (see their 2.6 xG home blitz against AVS). They give up big looks on the road — over 2 xG conceded away to Gil Vicente — and they’ll probably try to trade punches again here.\n\nAdd both together and you get two teams who live around the 2.5–3.0 expected-goal range most weeks. Neither has the back line to kill tempo, and both have forwards who shoot on sight.\n\nThe market still prices this like a slow, low-scoring grind. It isn’t.

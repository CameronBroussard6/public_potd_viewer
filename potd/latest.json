Here’s what I’m playing today. Appreciate the picks as always, you guys do the dirty work!",

They have won their last 5 T20 games and have won the last 5 head-to-heads against Sri Lanka, with SL only winning 1/5 T20 matches. Going off player form and recent results I don't see why England can't sweep Sri Lanka here and given the odds I don't mind confidently putting them into my two lay today. \n\nSecondly we go to the Scottish Premiership, Hearts sit at the top of the league with St Mirren in 10th, winning none of their last 5 fixtures. I almost went with under 2.5 goals as the home team of St Mirren have only scored 7 and conceded 10 from their 14 home games, the game earlier in the season did go over but that is an exception being one of two to do so. Carrying on with the analysis, Hearts are currently 16-6-2 (W-D-L) with Mirren going 4-8-11; Mirren have an alright record against Hearts but in current form I do not see them being able to keep their opponents out of their net. However it must be said that Hearts have only won 1 out of their last 5 away at St Mirren, despite this the reverse fixture finished 2-0 to Hearts; Mirrens home form is 3-5-4 with Hearts away form being 8-2-2. With Hearts having harder fixtures to come and not wanting to drop any points here I think they secure the win over Mirren to take all 3 points. \n\nBOL and always bet what you can afford to lose!",

      "text": "Record: 11W-6L\n\nStreak: ✅✅✅✅\n\nFootball | KNVB Cup | 19:00 (GMT)\n\nGame: AZ Alkmaar vs FC Twente\n\nPick: AZ over 0.5 goals + AZ over 3 corners - 1.75 (Bet365)\n\n*Recap:  Mallorca hit their stride in the 2nd half and easily brought it home.*\n\nWrite Up:\n\nThese two Dutch sides are no strangers to goals. They score and concede regularly with 74% of their h2h games having over 2.5 goals.\n\nToday, I'll back AZ to score because they have a great record of scoring at home with almost a 100% hit rate. Also, though Twente has won every KNVB Cup game so far, they've also conceded in every game including games against both a 2nd and 4th division team. I expect AZ to put in at least 1 goal today.\n\n  \nFor the corners, it's a similar story. AZ has an almost 100% hit rate for over 3.5 corners at home. I expect an end-to-end game with plenty of shots, saves and tackles so hopefully this hits very easily. There is a good chance it hits in the first half.\n\n  \nGood luck if you tail! 🍀",

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 11-9\n\n**Last:** Zion Williamson o30.5 pra (-119) DraftKings 3u ❌\n\n**Event:** NBA: Lakers @ Nets 7:30 pm EST\n\n**Today’s POTD:** Michael Porter Jr. o24.5 pts (-105) BetMGM MAXBET 5u\n\n**Write-up:** Porter just keeps getting disrespected on his lines. I’m happy to keep taking them, though. This season, Porter is 24/38 on this line, and at home, this is 12/19. He is going to be rested for this game since he didn’t play Sunday and will have three days of rest. He has covered this line back to Dec 1 when he’s had three. Plus, we have everybody playing tonight, which should relieve some of the pressure off of Porter and allow him to not get doubled as soon as he touches the ball.\n\nThe Lakers rank 30th in points allowed to small forwards this season and 28th in threes made to small forwards. In the last two weeks, they rank 28th in points and 25th in threes allowed. In the last week, 29th in points and 29th in threes allowed. \n\nPorter has been carrying this offense all season and is averaging 20 FGA and 10 3PA…so 50% of his shots. Porter is getting the rest of his buckets inside the restricted area, where the Lakers rank 21st on the season and 27th in the last week. Against teams that defend the restricted area weakly, Porter is covering at an insane 80%. The Lakers are playing at a mediocre pace. Versus middle-of-the-pack teams in terms of pace, Porter is also covering well. Porter’s main shot is a catch-and-shoot, where he is coming off a set of screens into a three. The Lakers are struggling to contain C&S players, ranking 20ish in their last 5/10/15 games. Versus teams that rank 15-25, Porter is covering around 79%. In January he didn’t cover just five times. Two by blowout, and three versus LAC, Phoenix, and New Orleans, who were ranking top 10 against small forwards last month. Lakers ranked 26th.\n\nThe last three picks have been rough, man. Good reads, but then KD, Brooks, and Zion all shoot 30% and STILL ALMOST cover. Realistically, we should be 14-6, since I feel like the reads were correct. As I said, you cannot predict a bad shooting night. Just gotta take some licks and keep moving. Hopefully, Porter comes into this game lights out, I don’t know if I can take another 30% shooting night from the field 😭.\n\nGoing max bet here as well. Probably a little too risky, but I’ve been high on Porter all year, and he’s been a consistent hit for the most part. Nets also stick around the spread better at home and shouldn’t get blown out.",

Stay with me. \n\nThe difference here is on the road games with Denver. They are ranked 1st in adjusted net efficiency and have the proven consistency in their play. As for Detroit, they are ranked 5th in adjusted net efficiency and are less consistent in comparison to Denver.\n\nDenver lost to OKC yesterday, which was literally a Shai and Cason Wallace out of this world night. \nAlso, Jokic was abysmal during that game, which would be more surprising to see him not bounce back against Detroit. \n\nDetroit is not as dominant against west conference teams (13-6), unlike with east conference teams (23-6). \n\nNo significant injury report for both teams (besides Denver’s players that were already injured from the beginning of the season)\n\nLet’s get this bag!!!",

      "text": "**POTD Record**: 4-2-2 (+3.15u) [All 1 Unit Plays]\n\n**Event**: EFL Championship - 19:45 GMT+0\n\n**Pick**: Portsmouth DNB First Half @2.75\n\n**Write Up**: We're targeting Ipswich's struggles on the road a bit here. While Ipswich have imposed themselves as one of the top sides in the division at home, they have not commanded as much respect away from home. Only collecting four wins from thirteen games. And conversely, Portsmouth are awful away which leaves them 22nd in the league but at home they are a tough side to beat. Only losing 5 times from 15. The problem for them has been with finding goals but with a 3-0 dismantling of West Brom over the weekend with goals coming from local lad Conor Chaplin and new signings Millenic Alli and Ebou Adams. Maybe they have found their shooting boots. They are undefeated now in four games. Ipswich have won just one of their last five away games including a 2-1 loss to struggling Sheffield United in their last outing.\n\nNow all of that is only semi-relevant as we don't care about the full time result here and only the half time one. See, Ipswich with their problems on the road, have only been ahead at half time once in thirteen games. They've been losing in six and drawing in six. Their one half time lead came at Swansea eight games ago and since then haven't scored one goal away from home in the first half. Compare that to Portsmouth who have been leading at home heading into half time in six out of fifteen occassions. A fourty percent rate. Four draws, five losses. The problem as I mentioned previously is goals as they have just four goals in their last ten home games during the first half. But after two first half goals in their last game, we are betting that those days are behind them.\n\nFrom the Portsmouth side this bet landed (so far) 40% of the time, pushes 27% of the time and loses 33% of the time. While with Ipswich (if you bet on whoever they played to be winning at half time) would land 46% of the time, push 46% of the time and lose just 8% of the time. It's worth a shot for me.\n\n**Additional Thoughts**: Getting my nerve back a bit after a break from a couple losses that hurt me. Hopefully this returns us to winning ways but another push wouldn't be unexpected honestly.",

Washington is 30th in rebounding \\[6.2\\] and 29th in defensive efficiency. Hart has cleared this in 4 of his last 5 against DC, averaging 10.8 RPG.\n\nThe 5-Scenario Analysis Scenario A (The Track Meet): The game stays close and fast. Washington misses their usual 55% of shots. Hart plays 38+ minutes. Result: 11-13 Rebounds.\n\nScenario B (The KAT Dominance): Karl-Anthony Towns stays in the paint and snags the first 10 boards. Hart stays active on the perimeter. Result: 8-9 Rebounds (The Sweat Zone).\n\nScenario C (The Mike Brown Blowout): Knicks are up by 25 in the 3rd. Bench clears early. Result: 7 Rebounds aka (The Heartbreaker).\n\nScenario D (The White Flag 🏳️): Washington shoots an unsustainable 60% from the field (highly unlikely). No rebounds available for anyone. Resulting with 4-5 Rebounds.\n\nScenario E (Cold Night): Hart gets into early foul trouble or the referee crew (Pat Fraher's crew) calls a tight game, slowing the pace to a crawl. Result: 6 Rebounds.\n\nScenario Proof: Washington allows 47.5 rebounds per game (29th in NBA). With Bilal Coulibaly out, their wing rebounding is non-existent. Hart is the \"vulture\" king; he doesn't need plays called for him to produce.",

He went over the 2.5 line for 5 games in a row now and he's crushing that line easily with a 7 shot performance last game and 2 of those games where he got 5 shots. He also hit that line in 8 of his last 10 games! He's feeling confident in his shot lately and it pays off with now a goal in 4 games in a row!

Hull is 3rd place in the league, 16W5D8L with a 48:40 goals ratio and has won 4 matches in a row. Watford is in 10th place with 11W10D8L and 39:35 goal ratio. At home, Hull has 8W2D4L while Watford is pretty poor away with 3W5D5L. Watford did win the last two H2H but both times Watford was at home, Watford is much worse while away so I think Hull will at least get a draw here.\n\nBayer Leverkusen to win: Bayer Leverkusen is hosting St Pauli.

That lack of match fitness should have an impact when facing a team that already has much better game rhythm.\n\nTigres are the current runners-up in their domestic league and have only one loss in the tournament, in a match they should have clearly won. They have strong attacking players, fast transitions, and create a lot of danger down the wings. This will definitely be a huge challenge for Forge’s defense, especially after more than two months without competitive matches, to contain Tigres’ attackers.\n\nI expect a clear win for Tigres, even if they decide to rotate and use some backup players in attack for this match.",

In Serie A they have only seen 1 win from their last 10… And they didn’t even have the best Xg in that match. At home they have four defeats and a draw from their last five. AC Milan have been much better than last year's disaster class and currently find themselves in 2nd place with an opportunity to put themselves seven points deep into the top 4 after Roma and Como dropped points this round.  \n\nThe reason we are getting such good odds on Milan is the guests' injury situation. No Pulisic Saelemakers or Leao… That will obviously impact their ability to score goals. Fullkrug is also not 100% (Shocker).

Oxford United unsurprisingly  sits in the relegation zone with their 23rd place. THey recently made a manager change that saw three games unbeaten, before losing 2-0 at home last round. They also only scored in one of those four games.\n\nSheffield United have won 5 of their last 6 at home in the Championship, scoring a massive 17 goals in these games. Oxford United doesn’t really have the money or have the willingness to spend to compete in this division and when you also have the injury problems they have now, it obviously isn’t going to be easy to stay up. \n\nThe Blades haven’t been very reliable this season, but they have had some very strong home performances. I mean the only draw on the mentioned run of six home games, came against Norwich whose goal was an own-goal and Sheffield had an xG of over 3(!).",

We have the Seattle Kraken coming to Anaheim to face the Ducks. In net for the Ducks is Lukas Dostal who has been solid this season. On the year, Dostal has a save percentage of .897 alongside a 2.81 goals against average. On the other side for the Kraken is Philipp Grubauer who has been lights. This season, Grubauer has a very impressive .919 save percentage, and just a 2.19 goals against average. Both teams are pretty unimpressive on offense, with the Kraken ranking 22nd in goals this season. They are also nearing the bottom of the league in shots on goal, being ranked at 30th. Ducks aren’t anything outstanding either, ranking 14th in goals this season. With both teams being pretty unimpressive offensively and having a decent goalie in Dostal and an amazing goalie in Grubauer, this one will be a relatively low scoring game maybe ending 3-2 or 4-2.\n\nTake The Under 6.5 Goals!",

Duke is on an absolute tear winning its last 9 games in convincing fashion.  Duke is loaded with stars and NBA prospects as usual, Boozer is dominant in the college ranks and leads his team in points, rebounds, and assists.  While Duke's pace of play is not especially quick but their offensive efficiency is tremendous scoring 127 points per 100 possessions.  Duke's scoring at 85.0 ppg.  Boston College is struggling 9-12 overall and 2-6 in ACC.  BC has a similar pace of play as Duke, BC is lead in scoring by Fred Payne at 15.2 ppg, he's an great shooter boasting a 41% FG% but only stands '6\"1.  Duke's defense is excellent ranking 4th overall per KenPom, the team's leading players getting minutes are all at least '6\"5 posing a challenge for BCs strongest scorer.  Payne in mediocre from the FT line at 76% but BC overall shoots only 65% from FT line.  BC has the deck stacked against them, Duke should continue their domination in ACC play and have their way with BC.  BC will struggle to score and Cameron indoor will only make those difficulties worse.  Duke should have opportunities to get backups in the game late.  26.5 is a large spread, so I prefer Duke total team score o82.5.",

Their performances have lacked attacking sharpness, and recent matches have often drifted without much sustained pressure, which leaves them vulnerable against stronger sides. Hearts arrive with more confidence, built on control and efficiency. Their recent league form shows a team comfortable managing games patiently before taking charge, especially as matches progress.\n\nSt Mirren’s recent league form shows clear struggles going forward. A goalless draw with Dundee FC and a 1-1 draw at Livingston offered some stability, but those results came after defeats including a 2-0 loss away to Hearts and 2-0 defeats against Falkirk and Motherwell. Goals have been hard to find, with just one scored across their last four league matches. Defensively, they tend to stay competitive early, but once they fall behind, matches often drift away rather than opening up. Their approach has been cautious, and attacking moves frequently lack support, leaving them dependent on isolated moments instead of sustained pressure.\n\nHearts head into this fixture as clear favourites. Manager Derek McInnes, appointed in the summer, went unbeaten in his first 12 Scottish Premiership matches in charge, an impressive run that included nine wins and three draws. While there was a small dip in form during November and early December, with three draws and one defeat in four matches, Hearts responded strongly. They bounced back with three consecutive wins, highlighted by crucial victories over Celtic and Rangers.\n\nHearts will be keen to carry this momentum into the final months of the season and will be looking to repeat their 2-0 win over St Mirren from mid-January. That said, despite their strong campaign overall, Hearts have found trips to St Mirren difficult in recent years, winning just one of their last seven away league meetings with the Saints. While Hearts should still be well placed to win this fixture, it’s an important trend to keep in mind.\n\nOverall, Hearts arrive in better form, with greater control and far more attacking reliability than a St Mirren side still struggling for goals. While past trips to this ground have been tricky, Hearts’ current momentum and quality should give them the edge.\n\n**NOTE: Please only stake what you can afford to lose; know that no picks are 100% guaranteed to hit. Stake Responsibly.**",

Risacher can score cutting in transition, line drives, and catch and shoot.

Previous to that though, 3DMAX dominated their opening two matches against BC Game/FaZe, they won 4-0 in maps winning with a combined score of 52-16 in rounds\n* Falcons have looked very off to the eye test this tournament, their T sides have looked terrible, they seem lost, poorly coached, bad discipline, maybe the sub/role swap with the sub messed some of them up and readjusting? Not sure, but they lost their opener to Aurora 2-1, then as MASSIVE favorites, nearly got eliminated by NRG today after winning Map 1 13-5, they were down 9-0 at one point map 2 and 7-2 map 3\n\n**Previous h2h:**\n\n* 3DMAX have faced Falcons twice in 2025, with a 1-1 record overall and 3-3 in maps\n* 3DMAX won on March 9th 2-1, lost on October 10th 2-1,\n* 3DMAX won their map pick in both h2h matches on Inferno 13-11/13-9\n\n**Projected Veto:**\n\n* 3DMAX perma ban Mirage, Falcons perma ban Overpass\n* 3DMAX pick **Anubis (**or Inferno)\n\n**Anubis Stats:**\n\n* 3DMAX are 100% win rate on 2 maps of Anubis, they beat FUT 16-13, and BC Game 13-4\n* Falcons are 0% Win rate on 2 maps of Anubis, they lost to Vitality 13-4, and Aurora 13-7\n* 3DMAX on paper would pick Inferno, and I still think this pick is solid value if they do, however Falcons Inferno has been rapidly improving and imo is one of their better maps now, they are coming off a 11-1 CT side domination against NRG on Inferno and 3DMAX are coming off a loss to Vitality\n* Falcons worst map by far is Anubis, most important thing about Anubis, it is the most T sided map in the map pool, you need to be able to win rounds on offense especially on this map, and so far Falcons have been awful at it, with a 29.3% win rate on T side Anubis\n* As said in previous writeup, Falcons used to perma ban this map, lack reps on it and both IGL/coach struggle with ideas on it, this map more then any really requires reps/good fundamentals/T sides for executes/taking space on the map which Falcons have really struggled with\n* Their were some decently significant map changes, but the map is still Anubis at the end of the day. 3DMAX in 2024 were a very strong/dominant Anubis team, with a 45-28 record in 2024 with 4/5 of the same roster. Bodyy/Lucky have been insanely good on this map, Maka historically loves Anubis and Graviti is having a great tournament,",

SIU Edwardsville defeated Lindenwood in a 66-62 game where they showed the strength of their defense and Nevada manhandled Boise State in a 81-66 victory killing the Broncos in transition. Nevada ranks higher than Boise State in RPI rating, NET rank, and KenPom rating. Nevada has an edge over the Broncos in points allowed per game, three point percentage, three point defense, offensive rebounding, steals, blocks and turnovers allowed per game. I think its also worth noting that Boise State lost to a division two squad that is Hawaii-Pacific earlier this year. SIU Edwardsville has the 13th best ranked defense in terms of points allowed per game and they are coming off another great defensive performance allowing only 46 points in their last contest. They face Lindenwood who has a terrible turnover problem ranking in the bottom 10% of teams in turnovers allowed. Lindenwood hasnt lost a conference game by more than 6 points all year and their only 2 losses by more than 13 came against a Big Ten and Mountain West squad so I think covering 13 points is an easy number for them. I think both of these squads have close games against teams they have already defeated before this year.\n\nPrediction: 68-65 Lindenwood, 77-76 Nevada\n\nLast pick:🏀Lipscomb ML/SEMO ML💩Lipscomb decided to lock in a little too late in that one.\n\nBest of luck to everyone tailing and remember to bet responsibly!

He has 6+ boards in ALL of his last 10 games at home vs the Eastern Conference. He’s over in 8/10 games without Kristaps Porzingis averaging 7.7 per game. He’s had double digit chances in every single one of those games & when he plays 30+ mins in them he’s over in 8/9 games. He had 9 rebounds earlier this year vs them even with KP playing & having 8 rebounds. The Heat allow the MOST Rebounds to guards this year. Allowing 7.23 to PG’s (Most) & 7.33 to SG’s. Their recent numbers have been just as bad, allowing 15.31 rebounds to PG/SG’s in their last 15 games. Last year when he faced the Heat he averaged 8.5 rebounds, in 4 games he put up 10, 8, 5, & 11. Miami has averaged 116+ points in 4 straight games scoring. They are 2nd in points per game this season (120.0). They average the most points per game in the league at home this year (122.2). They rank #1 in Pace, with an average of 108 possessions per game. In their last 3 they’ve average 111.9, most in the league. Vs an Atlanta team that ranks 4th at 105.8. There should be plenty of rebound chances for Daniels, especially since the Hawks best rebounder Onyeka Okongwu has been ruled out which is huge for Daniels’ rebound total. Okongwu lost a few teeth during Wednesday’s win over the Celtics, as he took a Jaylen Brown elbow to the mouth. After undergoing dental surgery the following day, the Hawks’ center is looking at an extended absence as he recovers. Christian Koloko moved into the starting lineup. Without Okongwu in the lineup, Daniels has gone 4/4 over his rebound total & has had had 13+ rebound chances in all 4 games without Okongwu. Which is HUGE as Daniels is over this line in 15/20 with 13+ chances. The Hawks traded guard Vit Krejci  to the Blaxers for an injured Duop Reath & 2 second rounders. Krejci averaged 2.2 3-pointers made per game on 42.3% shooting, which ranks top 20 in the NBA. This results in more playing time for Daniels. Offensively he’s been off this season but he’s one of the best defenders in the leagues. He averaged a league leading 3 steals per game last year. He pressures opposing ball handlers & has a phenomenal natural instincts jumping passing lanes. He creates chaos in the perimeter. This will be key in an intradivisional matchup vs a Miami team that ranks in the bottom 10 in rebounding rate at home (49.2%). \n\nThe Heat also give up the 5th most assists to PG’s in the NBA this season allowing 9.41 per game.\n\n__Dyson Daniels over o13.5 R&A__\n\nAppreciate the love!

Unfortunately officially it is a loss, and we are still in major fade zone guys.\n\nBut we're back with a play that has done us well many times before. I love this play for all of the same reasons I normally do. Arsenal host Chelsea in the 2nd leg of the Carabao Cup semifinals. Arsenal are up 3-2 on aggregate, meaning they essentially start this game with a 1-0 lead, which is huge for Arsenal and their stingy defense. This will change the dynamic slightly, as Chelsea will need to play more aggressively and try to make up that one goal difference. While I do not believe Arsenal will park the bus with only a 1 goal lead, they will be content giving Chelsea some possession and playing more defensively than normal. \n\nEnzo has had 1 SOT in both matches he has played vs Arsenal this year - the first leg of this match at home a few weeks ago and in the EPL at home back in November. I can see Palmer getting a rest here after playing the full 90 over the weekend, which may pull Enzo forward into the #10 role. Even if not, I still see him playing far forward and box crashing as usual.\n\n**Reminder - cup games are weird, lineups may change. Feel free to wait for lineups before taking this pick.**\n\nBOL!",

The Guadalajara game in an even earlier round followed much of the same script, with Barca needing two late goals for a measly 2-0 win. Besides that, they also have some **key absences** and are going to be slightly **fatigued** following their packed schedule.\n\nBased on the fact the Barca team is run into the ground, has some key absences, and will likely be rotated for today's match, I expect Albacete to cover the AH. BTTS Yes is also another angle if you'd want to take that. Make no mistake, Barca are the heavy favorites here and are most likely going to progress, I just can't see them dismantling their opponent. Feeling pretty confident in this pick and a Barcelona fade deserves 4 units. BOL and let's enjoy some cup magic together ☘️🫡",

Bet 2.5u\n\nWriteup: Going against the public as I believe Xavier can cover their normal spread. Love rooting for UConn but they have not been themselves as of late. UConn’s 25th ranked offense should feel pretty comfortable against Xavier’s 85th ranked defense. The defense may be able to generate some turnovers, but Xavier is not the best at scoring on 2nd chance opportunities. Still, I think Xavier’s ability to cover will come from their offense without transition against UConn’s defense. UConn will have the rebounding advantage, but beyond this, I see it as being a pretty equal battle. Xavier does a great job limiting turnovers on offense, and they should find some success shooting from mid range. Our biggest driver here is a similar process as our Providence bet against UConn - these teams have opposing playing styles with Xavier being the more up tempo team, the more consistent team, the team with more momentum, and the team far better as an away team vs UConn as a home team. I still don’t feel comfortable taking UConn as a massive home favorite yet, so give me Xavier to keep it within 24.\n\nSDSU should be able to handle Wyoming well. They are the better team on every part of the court beyond defensive rebounding. SDSU is borderline top 10 in defensive efficiency, whereas Wyoming is well outside the top 100 on offense. I also expect turnovers to be generated for SDSU, who are also a top 50 team in transition offense. Wyoming likes to shoot from the inside, but SDSU is softer on the outside. There are a lot of little things here that simply add up to SDSU being too much for Wyoming to handle. The 2 key things for me here are that SDSU should find good success on defense, and that SDSU is playing some of the best ball in the country relative to any other team’s average play. These teams do have opposite play styles, but neither side is on the extreme. SDSU should take care of business and win by 5.\n\nRemember to only bet what you can afford to lose, and BOL!",

Trailing 3–2 on aggregate forces Liam Rosenior to adopt proactive attacking intent from kickoff — he’s openly acknowledged the difficulty of overturning Arsenal’s lead, but insists his side will go “as deep as we can” and bring intensity and urgency to the Emirates. With one goal needed just to level the tie and two to lead outright, Chelsea are highly likely to press high, push full-backs up and attack in waves down the wings, naturally generating corners as they attempt to stretch Arsenal’s defense. Many of Rosenior’s recent games under this framework have seen multiple corners, and his side’s willingness to play on the front foot even when behind bodes well for over corner output.\n\n\\- On the injury front, Chelsea’s offensive unit — including dynamic wide players like Garnacho and Neto — remain available and motivated to exploit transitions, while Arsenal’s slight defensive rotation due to knocks and squad demands may blunt their ability to defend wide pressure as robustly as usual. Opposed to that, Arteta’s Arsenal are expected to cautiously manage the game, controlling possession and avoiding excessive risk as they protect their aggregate advantage — a setup that often concedes territory to opponents and results in defensive blocks and repeated attacks from wide areas. In sum, Chelsea’s need to attack from the start, Rosenior’s encouraging attacking intent and tactical emphasis on width and high positions, plus the likelihood of Arsenal sitting deeper with less aggressive pressing, create conditions highly conducive to Chelsea winning four or more corners.",

After that clean 3-1 from Gimnasia, we’re finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nNote on Timing: For those in the US/Europe, this match kicks off late Tuesday night in Argentina (21:15 local time), but it shows up as Wednesday GMT. Don’t get confused.\n\nWe’re heading to Mendoza. Independiente Rivadavia has been doing things right lately. They’ve built a solid identity at home, playing with a high-pressure style that usually suffocates visitors. They’re not world-beaters, but they are disciplined and tough to crack in front of their fans.\n\nOn the other hand, Sarmiento is a frequent inhabitant of the bottom of the table. Their away record is consistently poor, often traveling just to park the bus and hope for a 0-0. Given Independiente's current form and home advantage, 1.90 is a very solid price.

That “disappointing” run has been turned on its head with the winner, ASAKURA, looking like one out of the box with an almost 3 length romp in its next start over some quality city gallopers. To frank the form even further, the 3rd place getter LOUD CHARLIE has come out a won a metro maiden by a lengthy, so the run was definitely not disappointing.     \n      \nWe get a great set up here drawing barrier 4, and there’s a bit of natural pace engaged, so we should be one or two pairs back on the outside. A mid prep trial over 900m has kept us ticking along and it was a nice piece of work under no pressure. The step up to 1300m also is a plus, as I think this horse is a more gradual type than a sit sprinter.     \n      \nThe second favourite BEAST FIGHTER has drawn barrier 1 however I think that’s absolutely awful for this horse. In both its trials it’s completely bombed the start, and from barrier 1 that just spells disaster. Being barrier 1, it’ll be loaded first and I’m prepared to completely pen his chances. ZEPHYR ZONG was a good run in town, but I reckon we could have the perch on it, and I trust our form a lot more.     \n     \nGL!",

First off, look at their head-to-head lately. These two don't exactly light up the scoreboard when they meet. Recent games have been super low-scoring:\n\n\n‎One ended 2-0 . Then straight 0-0 draws in both directions like 0-0 at Constantine and another 0-0. **Average goals in their direct matches? Around 0.67 to maybe 1-1.5 per game across the last few**. Basically, they've played out a bunch of cagey, low-event football. Draws and clean sheets are the norm, not fireworks.\n\n\n‎On top of that, check the recent form for both sides. Constantine's been solid at home but not banging in goals their last bunch of games have a ton of unders, like **5 out of 6 or more staying under 2.5**. They keep things tight defensively, especially against teams that aren't flying.\n\n\n‎Mostaganem? They're struggling big time bottom half of the table, poor away record ***(0 wins in their last 8 road games or close to it)***, and they've been involved in low-goal slogs too. Their attack is blunt on the road, they don't create much, and they concede without conceding a ton either. **Lots of 0-0s, 1-0s, 1-1s in their recent meetings**.\n\n‎For Al Khalidiya Head-to-head is straight up domination for them. **They've played 13 times recently, and Al Khalidiya has won 9 of them, with Al Hala scraping just 1 win and a few draws**. More importantly, in those matches, **Khalidiya averages 2.3-2.6 goals per game against them** that's not fluke stuff. They've dropped bags like 6-2 in one recent one, and even in tighter games, they usually find 2+. Check the scores: ***plenty of 2-0s, 3-0s, 4-0s from Khalidiya in past meetings***. Al Hala just can't handle them their defense leaks when facing this side. Khalidiya racks up the shots and finishes, while Al Hala parks it but still gets picked apart.\n\n\n\n\n\n‎Lets Get back to winning ways !!\n\n\n‎",

Jay Friend is one of the top college players in the country, but he also established himself on the pro tour last year with a title run from qualifying at the Fairfield Challenger. He had a solid outing at the ITF Winston-Salem a couple weeks, eventually losing to Mitsui in the third round, but he’s also been playing well in college duals, defeating World. No 488 Edward Winter in straight sets. \n\nIn comparison, Perot was also a college player who graduated from Texas A&M a couple years ago and has plenty of experience in American hard courts. However, I don’t see him in the same tier of ability as Friend, and he has started the season with three losses in winnable matches against Smith, Rottgering, and Dostanic. Looking at how these players have been priced, Friend was a -175 favorite against Mitsui, but Keegan Smith was actually around the same price against Perot, and a very slight dog against Mitsui. These odds don’t quite match up, and I think Friend should be a bigger favorite in this one. Perot is a solid grinder, but Friend has the serve and attacking game to take over this matchup on indoor courts.",

That’s because after appearing all but dead in the water following a four-game skid, the team has responded by winning each of its next three contests. That includes an impressive 72-67 victory over then-No. 12 Purdue last Tuesday night. \n\nStill, I can understand the hesitancy to trust a Hoosiers (14-7) squad that is just 2-6 against Quad 1 opponents. \n\nWhile the shortcomings against quality opponents is most definitely concerning, a closer look at the matchup against USC provides quite a bit of optimism. Through 22 games, the Trojans (16-6) rank just 130th in offensive efficiency (1.078) and 97th in defensive efficiency (1.017). Now consider this: in 12 games against opponents ranked outside of the Top 100 in offensive efficiency, the Indiana defense concedes an average of 62.8 points on a  porous 37.4% shooting (26.6% from beyond the arc). Furthermore, the unit held 11 of those opponents to 42% shooting or less while limiting all but three to 33% or less from the perimeter. Not to mention, the Hoosiers were 11-1 in those contests, with each win coming by eight or more points and all but one by 17+. \n\nThe same improvement can be seen on the other end of the floor.\n\nWhile the Indiana offense has been pretty good overall—37th in offensive efficiency (1.156), 57th in scoring (81.5 PPG), 68th in field-goal percentage (47.0%) and 85th in three-point shooting (35.7%)—the unit takes it to another level against poor competition. In 12 games against opponents who rank outside of the Top 75 in defensive efficiency, the Hoosiers have averaged 88.8 points on a blistering 51.1% shooting from the field (39.2% from beyond the arc). While Lamar Wilkerson (19.4 PPG) and Tucker DeVries (14.3 PPG) should once again pace the team, its been the recent play of junior Nick Dorn (9.7 PPG) that has been played a major role in Indiana’s recent run of success—20.2 points per game over his last four games. They should have no issue penetrating a USC defense that hasn’t held an opponent under 69 points since Dec. 14. \n\nTurnovers should prove to be the difference in this one.\n\nOn the year, neither team has made a habit of forcing opponents into mistakes, with the Trojans ranking 135th in turnovers forced (12.3 per game), 180th in turnovers forced per possession (16.5%) and 240th in steals (6.0) while the Hoosiers enter ranked 239th in turnovers forced (11.0), 243rd in turnovers forced per possession (15.7%) and 312th in steals (5.4). However, while Indiana has done a great job playing clean basketball on the offensive end—56th in turnovers per possession (14.7%), 57th in opponent steals (5.7) and 58th in turnovers (10.4)—the same can’t be said about USC, which ranks 200th in turnovers per possession (17.0%), 265th in opponent steals (7.2), 268th in turnovers (12.7). If the Hoosiers can take advantage here, that could very well be the X factor.\n\nKeep the points, trust Indiana to win this one outright. \n\nBOL if tailing, and as always, please do so responsibly. One bet should not have you crashing out all over Reddit.\n\nTracker link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P5YErUwS5fI-JqVXGYOP96Zr7TsHgaZaJq6tV8tDaGk/edit?usp=sharing",

      "text": "__POTD Record:__ 52-24-1 (+60.0u)\n\n__NFL Record:__ 36-12 (+55.91u) 75% W/L\n\n__Previous Pick:__ [✅ Christian Watson o38.5 rec yards (-115), 2.4u](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/s/03slhXpfsS)\n\n__Event:__ NFL: Jets @ Patriots 8:15pm EST\n\n__POTD:__ Treyveon Henderson o76.5 rushing yards (-115), 3u to win 2.61u\n\n__Write Up:__ The (2-7) New York Jets are traveling to Gillette Stadium to take on the (8-2) New England Patriots in an AFC East clash on Thursday Night Football. The Jets began the season 0-7, but they are coming off 2 straight wins vs the Bengals & most recently the Browns. Yes, 2 very bad teams. __This was after New York traded their 2 best defensive players at the trade deadline, DT Quinnen Williams & CB Sauce Gardner. And now they will be without star WR Garrett Wilson being out the next few weeks with a knee injury.__ They’re down to crumbs. As for the Patriots, they started the season 1-2 after 3 games & have not lost since, looking for their 8th straight win. They are now 1.5 games ahead of the Bills in the AFC East Standings. __The Patriots have covered the spread in 5 of their last 6 games.__ This is mostly due to Drake Maye playing some good football at QB, but the run game exploded last week as well.\n\nPats QB Drake Maye has been a beast this year. __The 23 year old QB has 250+ passing yards in 5 of his last 6 games, throwing for 270 yards last week.__ He has 2555 passing yards on the year, with a 19 to 5 TD to INT ratio. Nate has been the most accurate passer in the league so far this season. __Maye ranks #1 in the NFL in Catchable Ball Thrown Rate at 83%. His completion pct on 10+ yard throws is 63.7% this season, 2nd in the NFL. He’s 2nd in the league in 20+ yard passes (35), 30+ yard passes (14), 40 yard passes (6), & leads the league in 50+ yarders (5).__ He’s been able to do so because he has been reading defenses at an extremely elite level, even when coverages are hidden. __Maye leads the NFL with 700 pass yds & 6 pass TD against disguised coverages this season.__ This is key because the Jets run disguises coverages more than any team in the league. __They use a base scheme that leans zone (67% of snaps), but they frequently switch to man after snap (33% 8th most in NFL), especially in key situations. Against man coverage, Maye is averaging 9.7 yards per pass (2nd). He also has a league high 14% scramble rate against man coverage, which will be a problem for a weak Jets DL.__ The Jets have struggled to pressure opposing QB’s, even moreso now after trading their best DLineman. __The Jets are 31st in pressure rate (28.9%) & do not have a single INT this season. When Maye is not pressured he has a 78.6% completion pct (4th) for 9.0 yards per pass (3rd), & a 7.3% TD rate (7th).__ Why does all of this matter? Because the Patriots are going to torch them early, then feed Treyveon. __The Patriots have led at halftime in 7 straight games. They dominate in the 2nd Quarter with a +35 point differential (3rd in NFL). Now they face a Jets team that has a point differential of -50 in the 2nd Quarter (2nd worst) & -28 in the 1st (5th worst).__ Maye is going to do some damage, take a big lead, & make the defense focus on him. Then it’s going to be Rookie 2nd round pick, Treyveon Henderson time…\n\n__*More write-up incoming*__\n\nAppreciate the love!

Even if they don't take the map outright, I think we see a much closer game overall. Of TYLOO's recent 4 Nuke games, they have upsets against Vitality/FaZe and a 13-11 loss against 3DMAX who are another fantastic Nuke team, I think they are a better Nuke team then they showed against paiN\n* DGT has struggled on Nuke heavily, especially recently, DGT is averaging a .54 KPR last month on Nuke, a .59 KPR L3 months, and a .64 KPR since joining paiN overall. Solid drop off especilly considering the strong results paiN have showed on this map, meaning the drop is even more substantial\n* Jamyoung has maintained strong Nuke stats throughout the last year despite TYLOO's struggles on it as a team. He is averaging a .71 KPR L3 months on the map, a .81 KPR L6 months and a .81 KPR in the last year as well on the map\n* DGT will start on T side, since joining paiN he has had solid T side numbers compared to most players but still weaker then on CT side by a slight margin averaging a .63 KPR average on T side Nuke\n* JamYoung will start on CT side, in the last year he has averaged very strong CT side numbers averaging a .80 KPR on CT side, but is quite good on T side as well giving him a strong balance overall\n* Last time they faced h2h, DGT beat Jamyoung on Nuke 11-9 in kills, this was despite a paiN 13-6 win. On top of this, Jamyoung has played 21 maps of Nuke in the last 12 months, against paiN was the only map he has ever dropped single digit kills",

In his last two international windows (3 games) he's scored three and assisted two. \n\nOne of those goals was the away game vs Ukraine. \n\nMbappe is also the penalty taker, so that will be another way he can score. Always nice to have the pen taker when picking a scorer. \n\nLike I said before, it's an important game for France... There is only 3 points separation between France and Ukraine and a five-goal difference... So a loss can really make things tight, where a win can secure qualification.\n\nFrance won't want to mess about here.\n\nIf the $1.57 isn't to your liking, I also don't hate Mbappe and Olise both to score or assist at $2. ",

His average sits lower than the line at 32.2, but since week 5, he's been seeing more usage, averaging 1.8 targets with 1.4 receptions weeks 1-5, meanwhile weeks 6-10 having 4.8 targets with 3.8 receptions. While his target share has been low at only \\~12% in 2025, Kayshon Boutte has been ruled out, along with TE2 Austin Hooper, which will pump his numbers up, with the potential to be WR2 behind Stephon Diggs\n\nWhile Hollins is versatile and can play generally well in both, he tends to do better in zone coverage which is what Jets run about 2/3rds of the time. Not only that but the Jets do worse against outside receivers  Jets also allow 8 yards per target to opposing receivers. Another thing to note is that outside Cornerback Azaraeye'h Thomas has been ruled out for this game, allowing for easier matchups for our outside receivers, and makes it less intimidating as the jets hold the 8th best pass defense.\n\nThe last bit of info i'd like to add is that this is a Thursday night divisional game, if I was superstitious, i'd say something about the last 3 snooze fest primetime games. The lines are heavily in Patriots favor, yet recently (post Tom Brady Patriots), Jets mostly have been able to keep the game within 1 score, with November 24th of 2021 being the last time Jets lost by more than that 1 score. If this is potentially a trap game, there could be a larger chance for more passes, and more to our boy Hollins.\n\nBOL to anyone tailing!\n\n[Tips Greatly Appreciated ☕](https://buymeacoffee.com/pefpef)",

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 2-0\n\n**Previous Pick:** Morgan Gibbs White 1+ SOT (-110) ✅️\n\n**Today's Event:** UEFA World Cup Quals | England vs Serbia (11:45 AM PST)\n\n**Pick:** Elliot Anderson 1+ SOT (+110), 1 unit to win 1.1 units\n\n**Write Up:** Hello again friends! We're back after a few days break with some world cup qualifier action where we're into the last two games of the group stage. In case you can't tell by now, I love SOT plays. They're quite fun to root for while watching a match. Our first two plays both hit within the first 3 minutes of their respective games, great start to POTD! I was waffling here between this pick and England 3+ goals, but landed here because this one could be a slog. England have qualified for the world cup, so this is technically a meaningless game for them. But England boss Thomas Tuchel wants his side to continue to gel and build momentum. He also loves himself some Elliot Anderson. Anderson has played nearly every minute for England since his first cap with the senior squad in September. Anderson also fits the mold for my favorite kind of player to back, scrappy hard working midfielders who like to take long shots. We're getting good odds here because Anderson has only recorded a SOT for England in 1 of 4 matches. But in his last match against Latvia, he took 5 shots. While none of those found the target, the uptick in shot attempts are promising as his confidence builds and he cements himself in England's midfield. \n\nNow to Serbia. They currently sit 3rd in the group, 1 point behind Albania. Serbia needs a point here to stay alive in qualifiers. I expect them to park the bus and invite shots from a distance, as they won't win a high goal shootout with England. This is Anderson's shooting range and I fully expect him to find the target here, if not the back of the net. \n\nBOL!",

Moldova at home though to get just 2 corners, when they got 6 in the reverse matchup seems great, so far with 6 games played Moldova covered this in all but 1 game away vs Norway. At home, Moldova got 6 vs Norway. Moldova have also previously gotten at least 2 vs Romania in a friendly very recently and vs Poland. Italy have given up 2 or more corners in 5/6 games during the group stage. Simply expect the home side to show a respectable performance and get at least 2 corners here.",

Maye has been leaning on short and middle reads, especially to his TE which Henry already averages about 3.8 receptions and 44.9 yards per game with him.\n\n\nAustin Hooper’s absence removes the team’s TE2 and a reliable underneath target. That means Henry should get nearly all tight end snaps.\n\n\nKayshon Boutte missing will hurt their WR core, so the Patriots may funnel more targets toward Henry . Also The Jets this season allow tight ends to average about 42.6 receiving yards per game when being targeted. ",

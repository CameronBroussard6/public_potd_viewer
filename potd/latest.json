      "text": "Record: 2-2\n\nNet units: -0.97\n\nLast pick: Mauricio Ruffy ML vs Rafael Fiziev ✅\n\nFeels good to get two in a row! Also felt like we had a nearly perfect read on the Ruffy vs Fiziev bout.\n\nToday’s event: UFC Fight Night - Strickland vs Hernandez | Dan Ige vs Melquizael Costa\n\nToday’s pick: Dan Ige ML | +185 on DK | 1u here\n\nWrite up: If I was to come up with my own line for this fight I would either have it as a pick ‘em or I would have Ige as the slight favorite. However, with the books having Ige as a significant underdog, it almost has me second guessing myself as it feels like there must be something I’m missing. Yes, Ige is coming off of a poor performance against an older Pitbull, and Costa is coming off a stunning head kick KO against a young Frenchman, but I don’t think either of those outcomes can be used to predict this upcoming fight as it is completely different stylistically. So we’re going to try our best to stick with our gut here and thank the books for giving us such a live underdog. \n\nThis matchup will most likely take place entirely on the feet, with Costa using a rangy kickboxing style and Ige using a high-guard boxing style (which honestly to me resembles a Walmart Topuria). \n\nI think Ige’s style will turn out to be Costa’s kryptonite. Ige, having a fluid, high-guard boxing style where he always has good balance and head movement, is able to rip off powerful counters when his opponents over extend themselves. Costa, on the other hand, hangs out at range a lot, but then will crash in super messily with his chin in the air and his feet completely square. This is unlike an O’Malley or Ruffy who only enter range for a strike or two with head movement and footwork before exiting range to safety. I think we could very likely see Ige take Costa’s head off during a sloppy exchange in the pocket, which is why I’ll definitely sprinkle some on his KO prop. \n\nIge has been through a murderers row of opponents - dropping fights to good grapplers, a Diego Lopes who he took the third round from on like 4 hours notice, and a Pitbull who is completely different from Costa and probably the worst style for a guy like Ige. \n\nCosta, on the other hand, has yet to go up against an opponent who can take advantage of his poor defense on the feet, and I think that becomes apparent upon the outcome of this fight. \n\nBOL to everyone.",

In UVA’s last 5 home games, they have covered this line 4 out of 5 games. In those 5 games their average halftime margin is +8.4. In those 5 games UVA has scored over 38 points in 4 out of 5 and allowed less than 35 in all 5 outings. UVA starts fast and dictates the tempo early at JPJ. Miami has started somewhat slow on the road and against good teams, they have been down significantly (vs. NC State -5 at half, vs. Clemson -9 at half). UVA’s defense and offensive creation set them up nice for a solid first half lead vs. Miami. UVA will continue to pad their resume against a good Miami team to home.",

When both teams played the same opponents this season, Clemson came out better more often, including key spots where FSU got blown out and Clemson either won or stayed competitive.

But because DeAaron Fox and Stephon Castle exist, he doesn’t get that many minutes. But he still has reached this number in three straight games. (He is a deceptively good rebounder as well as a scorer).\n\nThe Spurs have been giving Harper more playing time in blowouts - putting him in 4th quarter lineups with the end-of-the-bench players along with his regular minutes, where he is an important contributor. While the Spurs have played down to their opponents’ level for much of the season, eking out wins against bad teams, that hasn’t been the case lately - and this one should be over early (Spurs are 18.5 point favorites). Harper will get more scoring opportunities in these lineups where he is clearly the top option, and he can get to the rim against anyone, so the Kings’ (one of worst defensive teams) late game reserves will part like butter. I look for him to get close to his season high tonight.",

Hive were down 2 points going into the 4th but Mitchell went off scoring 11 points. I'm almost done digging out of my POTD hole. I had a rough initial POTD run and pre-2026 record is (13-19-2) with -7.76 net units and -15.17% ROI. It's been better in 2026 primarily betting on Unrivaled and 1 NFL pick. My 2026 record is 12-5-0 with +5.78 units and 28.90% ROI.  \n\n\\*\\*\\*Track my sports betting picks on \\[POTD.LOL\\](https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/planetICE-rV9abv?utm\\_source=mdembed&utm\\_campaign=planetICE) (since 09/01/25).\\*\\*\\* \n\n**Today's Pick:** Lunar Owls vs Mist o140.5 points || 1.0u at -115 on BetMGM || 3v3 Unrivaled Basketball 8:15pm ET\n\nBoth teams enter into this game with some offensive momentum. Mist (7-4) won their last matchup 90-64 and lead Unrivaled with 75 PPG. In their last 4 games, total points were 154 / 154 / 129 / 151. Mist rebound well but are middle of the pack defensively. They allow opponents 70 PPG and opponent FG% at 46.72%, which ranks 4th and 5th in this 8 team Unrivaled league. \n\nLunar Owls (3-8) have looked better in the 2nd half of this season. They won their last matchup against Breeze 75-70 but still have averaged 67.6 PPG this season. In their last 4 matchups, total points were 145 / 145 / 108 / 160. Similar to yesterday's line in Hive vs Rose, heavy ML favor on Mist (-325) but keeping spread at -6.5 points doesn't indicate a blowout. Lunar Owls have offensive weapons with Mabrey and Edwards who are 1st and 4th in player PPG. Defensively though Lunar Owls allow 3rd highest opponent PPG at 74.6 and 3rd highest opponent FG% at 48.91%\n\nI'm liking the over in the game that features solid offenses but middle of the pack defenses. If the Mist really clamp down on defense and force a cold streak for Lunar Owls, the over play could be in jeopardy. But Mist did run the score in their last game despite getting a lead. I've seen couple other books have this line at 141.5 or 142.5. I think that's still playable being just a 1 shot difference than Bet MGMs line. BOL",

This game will be played at Dayton but I think we will see another classic. These teams match up very close on the stat sheet. Common opponents also had very similar outcomes. \n\nDuquesne is coming off five straight wins and will look to continue that momentum tonight. \n\nAs for the Knicks, they are coming off a tough loss to Detroit.

      "text": "Record: 4-1\n\nToday’s Pick:  NCAAM San Diego State @ Colorado State 1st half points over 63.5 (-115) 6pm eastern. \n\nAll picks are one unit \n\nLast pick: NCAAW - Charleston(W) @ Towson (W) under 130.5 ❌\n\nWrite-up:  Looks to be a great game - San Diego State is near the top of the league, and Colorado State is on a 4-0 streak.\n\nHome court dynamics and altitude will figure big in today’s game. At home, Colorado State shows stronger confidence and shot selection. Altitude matters but more often than not it causes a slow down later in the game not the first half. \n\nBoth offenses are built on efficiency. SDSU is averaging 79.1 points per game on 47.7% shooting, while Colorado State is scoring 76.5 per game on 49.4% from the field (25th nationally).\n\nThe defensive matchup is mixed. SDSU remains solid, holding opponents to 39.3% shooting, but Colorado State’s defense is a lot weaker, allowing 45.3% from the floor. They sit in the lower third nationally in opponent efficiency.  This opens up scoring, especially for SDSU. \n\nThe model projects an offensive blend of 118.4 and a blended pace of 33.1. So the projection isn’t driven by extreme possessions. It assumes average tempo and both teams converting near season averages. In other words, no first half grind. \n\nRisks:  blowout, altitude effects hitting earlier than assumed, and SDSU imposing itself defensively early, creating long half-court possessions with slower scoring. \n\nBut both teams have strong shooting profiles and SDSU should be able to exploit Colorado State’s defense, pushing the first half over.",

Against Liverpool, they were careless in their attacks, they did not take advantage of the few opportunities that were presented to them and they left Anfield defeated 3-0. Finally, the Cup, where in the previous round they had eliminated Manchester United, the attention of the \"seagulls\" is now turned to the championship.\n\nWhere after the three points in the first match for 2026 against Burnley with 2-0, they ignore the three points in six consecutive matches. In their last match in history, they had a good image at home to Aston Villa, they could have avoided defeat, in the end they were left empty-handed when in the 86th minute Mings' header found the head of Heselwood, resulting in the final score being 0-1.\n\nA big problem has arisen in the offensive efficiency. Although he creates phases, he is unable to send the ball into the net, he has been without a goal in the three most recent matches he has played. He is descending dangerously, he fell to 14th place, seven points away from the relegation line. The last away victory for the Premier League was 2-0 against Nottingham at the City Ground with 2-0. Since then 0-2-4.\n\nIf the 40-year-old midfielder James Milner plays, he will reach 654 appearances, surpassing Gareth Barry and becoming the record holder for appearances in the Premier League.\n\nBrentford are coming off impressive results, but a closer look shows that they are not the definition of stability. They will find a team in front of them that will seek a return to success by playing dynamically at the back and hitting the counterattacks. The \"Seagulls\" are not an easy opponent, if they show consistency in the overall blocking function and do not leave space for Thiago and the sante, then they are lucky. With the surprise.\n\n\nBol",

Cade is the NBA's 2nd-leading assist man (9.7 APG). Even if the Bulls double-team him to stop a \"cold night\" scoring outburst, he simply exploits the mismatch by finding open shooters. Cade’s usage as the sole initiator goes through the roof.\n\nScenario A:(The Libra Masterclass): The game stays competitive. Cade carves up the Bulls' drop coverage, hitting on lobs and shooters in the corners. He clears 10 assists by the middle of the 3rd quarter.\n\nScenario B:(The Blowout): Detroit goes up by 20. However, Detroit’s bench (Sasser/Holland) are high-percentage finishers. Cade often racks up 3-4 \"easy\" assists in transition before sitting the final 5 minutes.\n\nScenario C:(The Harden Ghost): Cade’s teammates go cold and miss wide-open looks. This is the only way this misses Chicago’s defense is so porous that the looks will be there; the shooters just have to sink them.\n\nScenario D: The white flag 🏳️ Cade’s minor wrist tweak flares up and he plays limited minutes. (Current reports say he’s a full go after a 42-point masterpiece vs. NYK).\n\nScenario E: Cold night Cade shoots 4/18 from the field. Good. As a Libra, when his shot isn't falling, he balances the scales by becoming a pure floor general. A cold shooting night often boosts his assist numbers.\n\nScenario Proof\n\nMatchup- Bulls allow the highest Opponent FG% in the league over the last 2 weeks. History- Cade dropped 13 assists on the Knicks (a much better defense) just 48 hours ago. Vibe -Libra energy. He’s averaging 10.2 AST on the road this month\n\nBOL? nah *if you hate me,fade me* new matra (fade the machine)\n\nsources -Gemini (ai obviously) -Tony’s picks(youtube) -pick dawgs (youtube) -sportsgambler.com (website) -props.cash(for me to double-check)",

Today we’re taking advantage of a mispriced line (imo).\n\nMark Williams has hit this rebound line in 4/L5 games, with that one miss being against OKC where he played only 16 min and had 1 rebound. Not sure what was up that game but was for sure a one off with an early exit. Williams is averaging 8.1 boards this season while over the last 30 days ORL has been allowing an avg of 14.8 rebounds to opposing centers. On Thursday’s game against the Kings, Maxine Raynaud grabbed 14 rebounds, who has a season average of 6.8 boards.\n\nI chop this up to a similar reasoning that I used yesterday, Orlando has guys that just love shooting. Their starting lineup of Suggs, Anthony Black, Desmond Bane, Banchero all are attempting an average of 6+ threes a game while most of the time only scoring 2-3 of them. It’s a very hungry, offensive lineup where Williams will have more than enough opportunities to cash this line for us.\n\nHonestly this is the first game of the day I was checking out for a pick and when I saw they had this line priced at +112 I had to slam it. Of course I am also laddering this one a little heavy at 10+ rebounds (+154) (1u) and 12+ rebounds (+360) (0.5u). Let me know if I’m tripping thinking this line shouldn’t be this high or of any questions or concerns. Let’s take advantage of the books’ mistakes wherever we can.\n\nBest of luck",

They have been playing better team defense overall and have recently found their starting lineup after constant changes throughout the season. \n\nMinnesota just lost one of their best players in Crocker-Johnson; and have dealt with injuries all season. Crocker Johnson was Minnesota's best rebounder and their second best scorer. They are down pretty much a six man rotation at this point. Minnesota is 1-2 without him, a bad home loss to Maryland (who Rutgers just beat handily) a loss at Washington, and a win at Oregon. Minnesota did not score over 62 points in any of these games which I believe highlights the significance of losing Crocker-Johnson. They have struggled to score without him. \n\nOverall I think that these teams are very evenly matched. While I do think Minnesota is a capable team; the loss of their best all around players looms large. In an early 12ET game, I believe it will come down to the wire, taking the 8.5 points here with Rutgers is a good play. ",

Projected minutes sit at \\~32.7 in a core role.

For Canada, we saw more of what we've seen all week from them: struggling to score big with hammer. They barely squeaked into the semis to begin with. The key matchup here is at the second position. Miskew has really struggled all week and her misses on take-outs this week have not allowed Canada to capitalize with big ends with hammer like they typically do. USA already have quite a few wins over elite teams this season and they've proven here at the Olympics that they can hang with anyone so I was quite surprised to see this line where it is. USA won the round robin matchup between these two teams and I think there's a good chance we see a repeat here for bronze.",

Nardi reached the quarters here in Dubai last year beating regular ATP players like Fucsovics and Bergs in straight sets so clearly enjoys the faster conditions of Dubai. He reached the quarters in Montpellier, losing to Damm, easily dispatching the likes of Basilashvili and Cobolli 2-0 just a week after a finals run to the Manama challenger final where he straight setted Mendez, Kjaer, Blanchet, Virtanen before losing to Jacquet in the final (all players I consider better than the Argentine). The Italian’s aggressive game, taking the ball early, should win him points a lot easier than Trungelliti’s grinding play style being more of a clay courter in these faster conditions. He’s lost his last four hard court matches, three of them in straight sets including against Chung and Kwon who are outside the top 300. I don’t see Marco really having the tools to compete and Nardi’s last 21/24 HC wins have been 2-0 scores, with the exceptions of Shapovalov, Fucsovics and Ofner who are all levels above the Argentine. Trungelliti has been straight setted in 8/9 hard court matches against top 100 opposition and honestly even at his peak I would’ve probably backed this same play. I know qualis can pull out some really strange results but Nardi needs to qualify to defend last year’s points so he should be playing at 100% and even adjusting for qualifying tax BOL !",

Thanks to those who tailed!\n\nToday’s Pick: Tennessee vs Vanderbilt/ Vanderbilt -2 (-130) 2u\n\nWrite up: Absolutely love the commodores here. As many of you may remember, Vandy started off 16-0 and looked extremely dangerous. I still have high hopes for this team and think this game will kick off a potential perfect ending to their conference schedule. Vandy comes in at number 12 in the Kenpom rankings, which for those that don’t know, is a more valuable ranking than the AP Poll. To add to that, Vandy has 3 very good scorers, and another 2 that can make key contributions. They shoot better on all 3 levels than Tennessee does, and they log more steals and blocks a game than Tennessee. I get that doesn’t make them the better defensive team necessarily, but making those plays in a game like this can give all the energy they need. Tennessee is also very live or die off of the backs of Ament and Gillespie. Even with heroic efforts by those guys I still like Vandy’s spot right now. Statistically they’re better across the board, and they get to host a team they don’t like on their own home court. I expect this line to move so grab it quick everyone. And as always I deeply appreciate all the support you guys give me! If you’re tailing let me know!!

They are 8-2 in their L10 matches, most strong beating ex-RUBY today, who are rank 58. They have won 7 of their 8 matches this week, while going 14-3 in individual maps. They have been very dominant especially on their map picks as of late.\n* SPARTA are in a weird spot, they took a long break 9 weeks ago, and just started back up playing, they've quietly added Norwi/Krad to roster without any official announcements, the team looked great out of the break with back to back 2-0s against TNT and Alliance, Alliance were pretty strong favorites and arguably one of the tournament favorites, but today they lost 2-0 in both games losing to TDK 2-0, and Illwill 2-0\n* Both teams are very top heavy with the fire power, SPARTA have Djon8, star rifler, and AWPer yuramyata. WW have star rifler Ct0m and awper Deko, who is a huge talent that played in tier two and even had tier one offers but abruptly retired from competitive CS. Deko is averaging a .86  KPR L3 months leading the match\n\n**Veto:**\n\n* WW are projected to pick their map 1st, as SPARTA are the higher seeded team and should pick their map 2nd. SPARTA have slept thru a veto one time before so this isn't a guarantee but highly likely\n* WW ban Ancient, SPARTA ban Inferno\n* **WW pick Dust 2**\n\n**Dust 2 Stats:**\n\n* WW are 81% winrate on 16 maps of Dust 2 in the L3 months, they are 8-1 in their L9 Dust 2 games, and are coming off a win against ex-RUBY who are a very strong D2 team\n* WW despite rising from tier three and playing some bad teams have some very impressive Dust 2 matches, beating ex-RUBY 16-14 today who are a very strong Dust 2 team, beating FORZE Reload 13-4, GUN5 twice 13-6/13-8, Nemesis 13-4 and ARCRED 13-9\n* SPARTA are 14% winrate on 7 maps of Dust 2 in the L3 months, they have lost 3 straight and have only put up more then 8 rounds in 2/7 of those games\n* SPARTA struggled on Dust 2 in 2025 as well, their 2nd lowest winrate map at 14-22 in 2025. They ended 2025 off with a 3-12 record on Dust 2, losing multiple bad blowouts, with 10/12 of their losses being very one sided putting up 8 rounds or less. In 2026 so far they are 0-1 losing to illwill today 13-11\n* One of SPARTA's worst losses actually wasn't an HLTV match, but losing 13-11 to a ESEA Main team who is completely unranked (an entire division below them which in CS is a big gap going from int>main>advanced).",

All I have to do is **forget** about it and move on to this game! Today we got a Leipzig who is eyeing the top 4 for direct qualification to the Champions League. Dortmund on the other hand can afford losing, as their main aim will be staying top 3 this season. It's basically impossible to win the Bundesliga, unless they beat Bayern Munich first and then go on a hot streak until the end. Which is most likely not happening. So their goal is to focus on the Champions League here, by **resting** **key players** for this game. They have all of their attention on Atalanta, which they beat 2-0 in the first leg. Playing away against them will take away all of their strength and energy.\n\nIf I was a coach I would easily forgive my bench players to lose this game against Leipzig, who is by no means a bad team. They are even the favourites to win this game and I buy it even more, because of the rotation happening for Dortmund. I do however think that Leipzig will win it with more than 1 goal difference. Therefore applying an Asian handicap. The odds are also looking juicy as we get value for our money. I also feel that I discovered a hidden gem in this case, and expect the odds to drop alot before the start of this game!\n\nOn the side note: My tactics won’t change by lowering the odds to less than 2. The goal is to find high odds to play here, such as the range of 2,2 to 3,3. I’m trying to keep track of the results in all of the top leagues. We will **always aim for** **long term** gains here and make sure to manage your bankroll. I will try to post another pick in the coming days.

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 19-43-5 *Another win, and this one was about as sweat-free as it gets! Finland had shockingly gone 2-0 up before Canada completed a historic comeback with seconds left on the clock, but the +2.5 spread was never really in danger. The under 5.5 goals also hit, if anyone added that to the play for plus odds. What a game though!! Smart challenge by the Finns in the end, literal fractions in that onside call. Canadians might want to frame that if y'all end up winning the gold. 100% hockey POTD hit rate achieved, and I doubt anyone can take that away from me as I'm going right back to football for the weekend. From one tense matchup and in great form, we're moving back to the team that had caused me so much grief. It'd be magical to clinch that 20th win by fading... the good old* ***REAL MADRID*** *and I think they're there for the taking this weekend. Let's get to it!*\n\n**Last Five:** ✅❌✅❌✅\n\n**Event:** LaLiga, CA Osasuna v Real Madrid, 12:30 pm EST\n\n**POTD:** Osasuna, +0.5, +1.0 Asian Handicap, +100, 5 units\n\n**Write Up:** Osasuna are perfectly midtable: 10th place, but their form is picking up. They're on a streak of **5 games without a defeat (3W, 2D).** On the other side, *Real Madrid's league form is downright frightening,* but if Barcelona could lose against the likes of Girona and Real Sociedad, surely Osasuna are capable of taking a point (or more) off the **visitors.**\n\nOsasuna are very balanced, with a passable attack and a **strong defence,** having only **conceded 28 goals across 24 LaLiga matches** this season. For illustration, that's one less than 5th placed Real Betis, only one more than 3rd placed Villarreal and just two more than 2nd ranked FC Barcelona. They've also shown they can absolutely trouble Real Madrid on their day, as **the corresponding game last season ended in a draw.**\n\nThen there's another angle: **fatigue and injuries.** Real Madrid players were involved in a very draining (both physically and mentally) Champions League match over the week against Benfica, and the sheer number of **injuries in key areas (Militao, Alaba, Bellingham, Rodrygo)** means Arbeloa can't rotate the team as much as he'd probably want to. Meanwhile, the in-form Endrick is out on loan, so that right side of the pitch is looking dire at the moment.\n\nConfidence is sky high, and I truly believe today's the day I crush this Madrid curse for good. Going in with another max unit play. *To be clear, I don't necessarily think Osasuna are winning this, but they should have enough in their tank to get out with at least a draw.* Feeling a big game from Budimir and Munoz incoming. BOL and let's enjoy another heated Spanish matchup that gives me the 20th win on the board ☘️🫡",

West Ham United’s recent 2-2 meeting with AFC Bournemouth — heavily analysed by UK broadcasters — exposed exactly why this matchup produces chances: Bournemouth’s high press created repeated high-quality openings, while West Ham were dangerous in transition but vulnerable when defending crosses and second phases. Nuno Espírito Santo has since spoken in UK interviews about the need for a “mentality change” and being more proactive in the relegation fight, effectively signalling that sitting deep is not the plan — especially at home, where they must chase wins rather than settle. However, that front-foot approach has come with defensive instability, as they continue to concede from wide areas and quick counters. On the other side, Andoni Iraola has never deviated from his aggressive identity — his side press high, push full-backs forward and commit numbers into the box, which raises the tempo and stretches games. Bournemouth are also chasing a European push, meaning there is no incentive to play cautiously away from home. With West Ham needing points urgently and Bournemouth refusing to compromise their attacking structure, this shapes up tactically as an open, high-intensity contest with space at both ends — conditions that strongly favour Over 2.50 goals.\n\n",

However, they picked themselves back in the next round and beat Sagamihara 4-0 at home. Sure, I expected them to win that and their opponent got a player sent off, but things looked more right in that game. \n\nHachinohe is a team I have been very down on and have no faith in their ability to stay in J2. They finished 2nd in J3 last season, despite being top for a long time, as they won none of their last six rounds and scoring only three goals. Since last season they have lost their manager as well, and there is almost no money to recruit players to keep them in the league.\n\nI’m not sure how good Shonan will be this season, their relegation from J1 comes as little surprise last season as they kept selling off their best players, but Hachinohe is just not J2 quality really.  ",

The line creeped up to +125 before kickoff so hopefully some of you got it at even higher odds than I posted as well! Europa is usually tricky, but pleased the day went so well. We also swept with 4/4 plays and two big parlays in the soccer thread, if you're not already following along there as well. Let's carry that momentum into the weekend. \n\nWe're back for a Premier League weekend and I'm playing two of my favorite SOT players in this POTD. These plays individually are around -150, which is much lower than I typically like to take for a straight play. But feel free to take either individually if you prefer. \n\nLet's start with Enzo. We've cashed with an Enzo SOT 9 times now, and many of you who follow my plays already know why I back him so frequently. He has hit an SOT in each of his last 4 matches, including 2 goals in that span. Today he faces Burnley, the team that concedes the most SOTs in the EPL by a wide margin, in front of the home crowd. He also scored a goal in the reverse fixture earlier in the season\nI love him in this spot. \n\nNow for Rogers. Very similar story here. Rogers has hit an SOT in each of his last 6 EPL matches. He has averaged over 3 shots per game in this stretch. He's also playing at home against a Leeds team that is bottom 5 defensively. Rogers also scored 2 goals in ths reverse fixture earlier in the year, I think he'll fancy another one in this match. \n\nBOL and happy weekend!",

Sean has the exact style necessary to not only weather the take down storm of Fluffy Hernandez but also operates his offense with teeps and jabs which have caused Hernandez trouble in the past. Hernandez has almost been finished multiple times to body work from kicks and also Kevin Holland was able to finish him with precise strikes to the head--this is how Sean fights. Perhaps Hernandez has gotten that much better but I just dont see him winning minutes after the 2nd round. Give me Sean to pull off the upset.",

Olympic rink is also smaller and NHL players aren't used to it so less space to make plays so the name of the game right now with these games is to control the neutral zone. Finland has proven that they can shutdown teams pretty well by doing exactly that. Except for the game against Italy, Finland went under that line in **all of their games in the Olympics**. Meanwhile Slovakia has proven that they can put up a fight against others teams in the tournament so I expect them to give Finland a good fight and not let this become a blow-out. Both teams also played the day before so more mistakes and broken passes combined with more fatigue which is a perfect storm for a low-scoring game in a do or die game where a medal is on the line. \n\nEdit: Forgot to add in my write up that they played before in the tournament and Slovakia won 4-1 so for me it feels like Finland will be more wary of Slovakia's offense and won't let them take control of the game like they did in their previous game. Also even after that loss vs Slovakia, the Fins are still favorites to win the game (-290 ML).\n\n \nBOL!\n\n[Buymeacoffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/lordestros)",

All of their last 5 home games ended in draws, and every single one of those matches was goalless (2 goals 3 times, 0 goals 2 times).\n\nGalatasaray, on the other hand, have won their last 4 league matches, scoring at least 3 goals in each of them. In the Champions League, they defeated Juventus 5-2 to gain a huge advantage. Ahead of the return leg, there will be some rotation in this match, and an important detail is that Osimhen is not in the squad (He's being rested for the Juventus game.) Still, we can say Galatasaray can easily produce goals with names like Mauro Icardi, Leroy Sané, and Barış Alper Yılmaz.\n\nLooking at the head-to-head stats, Galatasaray's clear superiority is obvious.

Mensik ended up not only covering, but winning outright as a huge underdog! En\n\nThe organizers of this tournament reportedly paid $1.2 million each for Alcaraz and Sinner to appear at this tournament, but ended up getting only one of them in the final. Alcaraz stated before this tournament that he still sees weaknesses in his game that he wants to improve and planned to take things \"match by match.\" In many ways, it's been a \"match by match\" tournament for him in that he has had at least some struggles in all of his matches (with 3/4 opponents covering this spread), but has still managed to get over the line in each of them. Now, he faces a familiar face for the title in Arthur Fils, who pushed him extremely hard in the quarterfinals of Monte-Carlo on clay last year. Fils is one of the most talented players in the Alcaraz/Sinner generation, and seemed to be on a really nice trajectory in 2024 and 2025 before a back injury halted his progress and forced him off the tour for the back half of the 2025 season. He's slowly been working his way back into things, though, and now seems to be at full strength three tournaments into his comeback. Here in Doha, Fils has posted excellent performance ratings (7.0, 8.11, 8.53, 8.3). There's been a clear upward trajectory in his level, and his most impressive match was probably the semifinal against Mensik, who had just scored a massive upset over Sinner a round earlier. Fils is best known for his incredible forehand, which allowed him to dominate Mensik from the baseline by targeting that exchange. However, he has also been serving well (7.2, 8.3, 7.7, 8.2), which will be key in covering this handicap. Alcaraz's return, meanwhile, was a bit off against the biggest server he played in Arthur Rinderknech (6.6), though he's since rebounded (8.3, 8.5, 8.4). This isn't quite the same as the Mensik handicap, as I do think Fils is going to need to break serve at least once to cover here. However, I also think he has a solid chance of competing with Carlos from the baseline. The easiest way to lose quickly to Carlos is not being able to compete with him off the forehand. However, Fils obviously has that shot, and we've already seen Carlos struggle a bit with the powerful forehands of Khachanov and Rublev. Fils also hits his forehand with a lot more spin and margin than either of those players, meaning it's less likely to randomly be off for a game or two. It will be a bit tougher for him to keep up on the backhand, but the hope is that he can run around it given that these aren't the fastest courts. The weather in Doha tomorrow is expected to be quite nice, as it has been all week, so I don't expect the wind or humidity to affect this matchup. Fils's match finished later than Alcaraz's, so he'll have slightly less time to recover, but this one doesn't start until 9:00 PM local time, so both players should be fine in that regard. Alcaraz has also historically struggled a bit more at night than during the day, as the ball bounces lower, limiting his ability to tee off and increasing the amount of patience required in rallies. Overall, I expect this to be a close match, and I think this handicap is a bit too wide. \n\nNote: The [POTD Capper Tracker](https://potd.lol), which you may remember from its Google Sheet days, is finally back in a cleaner, more robust website format!

Translated with AI. Please understand.*\n\n**Lore:**\n\nWe are heading to the London Stadium for the match between West Ham and Bournemouth, corresponding to Matchday 27 of the Premier League. What we are looking for in this opportunity is both teams to score and at least 3 goals in total on the scoreboard.\n\nI like this pick because we have an attractive odd of -133 (1,75 decimal) for a scenario that the statistics strongly support. Nuno Espírito Santo's West Ham arrives in a compromised situation (18th in the table), which forces them to be proactive, but their defensive fragility is alarming: they have conceded goals in their last 18 home league matches. The \"Hammers\" average 1.23 goals scored and a worrying 1.88 conceded, which almost always guarantees action in both boxes. In fact, in 5 of their last 6 Premier League games, the \"BTTS\" has been hit.\n\nOn Bournemouth's side, Andoni Iraola's men are having a remarkable campaign (9th) and arrive with significant momentum after beating Everton. They are a vertical and brave team, with an average of **1.65 goals scored** and **1.73 conceded**. Their xG (expected goals) of 37.62 compared to the 43 goals actually scored shows they are clinical, especially with figures like Rayan and the young Kroupi on a scoring streak. Furthermore, the recent head-to-head record is telling: the last five direct matches between the two ended in score draws (1-1, 2-2).\n\nRegarding team news, West Ham recovers Jean-Clair Todibo in defense, which improves their buildup, but the absence of Freddie Potts due to suspension weakens the midfield balance. Bournemouth, although having doubts over Tavernier, keeps its offensive core intact. With the hosts' urgency to escape the relegation zone and the \"Cherries'\" offensive fluidity, a high-scoring exchange of blows seems inevitable.\n\n*Did you win some money?

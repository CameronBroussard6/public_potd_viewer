      "text": "Record: 68 - 59\n\nTorino - Udinese ⚽ Italy - Serie A UTC: 19.45\n\nPick: Udinese Fouls Over (12.5) @ 1.75\n\nThe clearest argument supporting the \"Udinese over 12.5 fouls\" option is that Udinese has shifted to a more \"reactive/contactful\" style of play this season, especially away from home, increasing their foul count: averaging around 14 fouls per game on the road naturally makes the 12.5 mark achievable. Udinese appears to have committed 253 fouls in 18 Serie A games this season, averaging approximately 14.1 fouls per game. Against teams like Torino, who favor tackling and frequently play aggressively in midfield, Udinese's need for defensive actions and tactical fouls aimed at \"stopping the transition\" increases; these types of fouls become even more frequent when the score remains level for a long time (0-0, 1-1, one-goal difference). Furthermore, referee Maresca has a high foul standard, averaging 26.63 fouls per game in his Serie A career.\n\n|Date|Away Match|Udinese Fouls|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|August 31, 2025|Internazionale – Udinese|5|\n|September 14, 2025|Pisa – Udinese|15|\n|September 28, 2025|Sassuolo – Udinese|22|\n|October 20, 2025|Cremonese – Udinese|14|\n|October 29, 2025|Juventus – Udinese|13|\n|November 9, 2025|Roma – Udinese|14|\n|November 29, 2025|Parma – Udinese|19|\n|December 21, 2025|Fiorentina – Udinese|8|\n|January 3, 2026|Como – Udinese|15|",

I think he scores 15+ points, which makes the combo with points better one this time.\n\nThe only danger is that Oklahoma leads by 30+ early on and that his minutes are reduced, but with Oklahoma's recent games, I don't think that happens.",

Burnley have struggled against teams that press high and control possession, and that’s exactly where United are strongest right now in my opinion. I expect United to dominate the tempo, create more clear chances, and eventually break Burnley down. With the quality gap and current momentum, a one goal win looks very realistic, and there’s strong value on them to cover the -0.75 line if they push for a second late in the game.\n\nGood Luck! ✌️",

      "text": "Record: 27-21-2\n\nNet units: (+2.83 units)\n\nLast pick: Jalen Brunson Higher 28.5 Points ❌ (Brutal \"Chess Move\"  Brunson got trapped early and deferred, proving that even a star's volume can be erased by a specific defensive script.)\n\nPick of the Day: Houston Rockets vs. Portland Trail Blazers — OVER 225 Total Points (-110)\n\nReasoning:\nThis play leans into the \"Usage Vacuum\" and \"Identity Shift\" we’ve been tracking. Houston is missing their primary defensive anchor and half-court engine (Alperen Sengun), while Portland's defense has been a total sieve lately. When two teams play with questionable interior defense and high-volume offensive rebounders, the game naturally speeds up, creating more \"easy\" scoring opportunities.\n\nScenario A: The \"Sengun-less\" Track Meet\nWithout Sengun to dump the ball to in the post, Houston’s pace is forced to increase. They shift from a \"grind\" team to a transition-heavy team. Since Portland ranks 28th in transition defense, Houston will get a high volume of layups and dunks before the defense can set up, pushing the score over early.\n\nScenario B: The Clingan Rebound Feast\nAs you predicted, Donovan Clingan is a monster on the glass (17 boards last game). Without Sengun or Steven Adams to box him out, Clingan will create a massive amount of \"Second Chance Points.\" Put-backs are the fastest way to kill an \"Under\" because they occur in less than 3 seconds of shot-clock time.\n\nScenario C: Portland’s Home Hot Streak\nPortland is averaging 137 points in their last home outing and has hit the Over in 54% of their games this season. With Deni Avdija and Shaedon Sharpe both scoring near 30 recently, they have the perimeter firepower to exploit a Rockets team that is currently allowing 40% from three over the last two weeks.\n\nScenario D: The White Flag 🏳️\nThe only danger here is a Houston Shooting Drought. If the Rockets miss their threes and can't get out in transition, the game could stall. However, Portland’s defense is so poor (giving up 119.6 PPG) that even a \"bad\" Houston shooting night should still see them flirting with 110+ points.\n\nScenario Proof:\n Efficiency Gap: Expert models project this game at 233.4 total points, giving us nearly a 9-point cushion over the current 224.5 line.\n\n Trend Logic: Portland has hit the Over in 20 of 37 games this season, and Houston's defensive rating has dropped significantly since Sengun's injury.\n\n Stat Correlation: Houston is the #1 rebounding team, and Portland is a top-10 pace team when playing at home; more rebounds + more possessions = more points.",

Sporting CP were up 1-0 in the 90th minute, had 2 big chances minutes earlier. Everything looked great. Then disaster struck as Vitoria scored twice to not only deny us our win but also win the game 1-2\n\nI actually don't mind the heartbreak losses because it only makes the next nailbiter wins even better\n\n**Write Up:**\n\nFirst 3U play of the year. I bet 1-5 units normally so keep an eye out for those bigger ones\n\nToday I am siding with Barcelona. Winners of last years Super Cup\n\nThey've won against Athletic 4-0 this season and also won against them in last years Super Cup 2-0\n\nTechnically both teams are away from home so let's look at away records\n\nBarcelona are 7-1-2 away from home with a 25-15 goal difference. Compare this to Athletic who are 2-2-5 away from home with a 7-14 goal difference and you'll see why I favor Barcelona\n\nI combine it with Napoli at home vs Hellas\n\nNapoli are 6-1-0 at home with a 14-6 goal difference\n\nHellas are 1-3-5 away from home with a 5-16 goal difference\n\nNapoli are the in form team with 4 wins out of their last 5 matches. Including winning the Super Cup. They've only conceded 1 goal in the L5 too which makes this an excellent addition to our bet\n\nHellas Verona is 2-0-3 in their last 5 with wins against Atalanta at home and Fiorentina away. You could argue they are in decent form but Atalanta have a 2-3-3 away record and Fiorentina have a 2-2-5 home record\n\nMeanwhile Hellas Verona lost 3-0 vs AC Milan and Torino in their last 2 games. I expect Napoli to do the same to Hellas\n\nI absolutely love this play today. Hence why the 3U bet\n\nBOL everyone! Maybe it is time to fade me but time will tell (I hope not)",

This one just barely makes the odds requirements, but I think it’s still worth it. Barcelona is at home hosting Bilboa. Barca has won 8 matches in a row and won their last 4 H2H, including three times last year. This is the Super Cup, but in La Liga, Barca is in first place (16W1D2L, 53:20) while Bilboa are 8th (7W3D9L, 17:25). I know these odds are nothing special, but I think Barcelona will win here much more frequently than lose or draw, so I think the odds are worth a bet. BOL!",

McVeigh started the season off really well crashing the defensive and offensive glass clearing this line at a high rate. But since the return of forward/center Waardenburg, he has only cleared this line 1/5 games. This is due to Cairns running a double big lineup, pushing McVeigh away from any rebounding opportunities, which really limits his ability to go over this line. Simply put, his rebounding duties have taken a back seat since Waardenburgs return and I’m happy to back his unders which have hit L4/4.\n\nBOL!",

That is very important as I will explain below.\n\nMiles Mcbride has been on fire and also has an out which is ideal. Now what I mean by that is Mike Brown is a very contributing guy where every player must fight and gain their minutes. For example he gave Tyler Kolek minutes which Tibs refused to do and is willing to still play Clarkson and Mcbride depending on who is performing the best. Now with Shamet being injured as well as Hart, this opens the door for more players to soak up these minutes. McBride in his last 5 games has hit this line. However when he plays 25 minutes or more he has also hit this line at 14/16 games making this 87.5%. The slate is also decent, Miles McBride when the Knicks win he also shoots a higher clip, The Knicks are favoured in this match, furthermore at home his shooting clip increases as well.",

Kamil has been very competitive outside of that against top 100 players in the last few months and has always played relatively well for his ranking in Australian conditions. \n\n  \nOpelka has slowly added to his game but remains a serve bot.  Given Kamil's ability to handle big servers (look at his performances against Altmaier, Shelton, Royer, etc), he has the ability to neutralise that serve. Kamil's got a solid serve himself, so it this comes down to a game of second serves and who has the ability to move the other around the court, I'm taking Kamil all day. He was able to produce 5 break point opportunities against Halys and even though Opelka has a bigger serve, he's less mobile. So as long as Kamil can keep serves in play - and the stats say he can -  this should be a solid play. \n\nBOL",

I expect Fordham to play well at home here to atleast cover this number.  After giving up almost 70% 3 point shooting against Richmond in their last loss, I expect their coach to really be focusing on that 3 point defense in this game.  We're getting George Mason here on a weird in between schedule where they played home on Dec 28th, road 31st, home on the 3rd, and now back on the road.

The market is very slightly favouring the BTTS when it should be slightly favouring the BTTS-NO. Expecting a 1-0 or 2-0 win from Lazio.

And having a troll of a goalkeeper like Emi Martinez, the guy just likes to waste time.  We were already at 8 corners by the 75th minute, but I knew after that third goal they were cooked.  \n\nBarcelona arrive in outstanding form, riding a **5-game winning streak** and performing well above league averages on both ends of the pitch. Over their last five matches they are scoring **2.0 goals per game** (rising to **2.5 gpg over the last 10**) while conceding just **0.2 gpg** recently (**0.9 gpg over 10**), numbers that clearly point to dominance rather than narrow wins. Their underlying metrics back this up, generating around **2.1 xG** per match and controlling territory for long stretches.\n\nAthletic Club, on the other hand, continue to struggle in attack, managing only **0.6 goals per game** across both recent windows, while conceding **1.0–1.2 gpg**. That combination of limited attacking output and a leaky defence is a bad recipe against a Barcelona side that scores first in roughly **80% of matches** and averages **1.8 second-half goals**, making it more likely they extend leads rather than protect slim ones.\n\nWith a **69.8% modelled home win probability**, high goal expectancy (Over **2.5 goals ~66%**), low BTTS likelihood (~**51%**), and Athletic’s tendency to concede under sustained pressure, the data supports a comfortable Barcelona win more often than a narrow one. This isn’t a blowout chase — it’s a controlled margin play with protection built in.\n\nBest of luck.",

But all things come to and end, good and bad. And I think the Cherries are going to get their win here today. Spurs are in poor form and have picked up just one win in their last five, a smash and grab away to a Palace side look to have run out of energy. The Thomas Frank experiment doesn't seem to have worked, he has quality players in every position but they look like strangers on the pitch, they have 3 strikers they've paid £50m for and none of them are scoring. The fans are on his back and it seems like his fate is sort of inevitable at this point. Bournemouth, depsite their misfortune so far are ever positive. Taking on teams, playing positive football, working for each other while keeping fan support in a couple bad months. They feel like total opposites at the moment. Bournemouth sit 15th currently while Tottenham are 13th, 4 point separate them. But on the xPTS table, Tottenham are 12th showing that they are almost exactly where they deserve to be, while Bournemouth are 7th, showing they are underperforming their metrics. This Bournemouth side has always had a problem with seeing out results.\n\nOther smaller things to note are Tottenham's history of giving teams on bad runs points. So much so over the past couple years the 'Dr Tottenham will see you now' meme has emerged. It shows frailties in Tottenhams ability to beating the teaems they 'should' be beating given quality discrepancies. And it is also Antoine Semenyo's last game for Bournemouth. He will be joining Manchester City after this game so his performance could really effect the result in whether he wants to 'leave it all out there' or be conservative to avoid hurting himself and jeapordising his big move.\n\n**Additional Thoughts**: Big Result from Forest to take us to 3-1. Bit lucky with a late penalty but I feel I deserve the luck after that City/Chelsea game. I'm getting a bit cocky with my betting right now. I've doubled my bankroll in the past week and I'm buzzing so watch out for me losing my head! But no, seriously, I'm confident on this one. Bournemouth are due, they won the earlier fixture away from home and Spurs are just going through the motions.",

They are playing with growing confidence, especially in attack, scoring 10 goals in their last four league games. This includes an impressive 4–1 win at home against Bournemouth and a lively 4–2 away victory over Everton. Even in tougher matches, Brentford have looked solid and organised, as shown by their controlled 0–0 draw with Tottenham. Sunderland, on the other hand, arrive with resilience rather than rhythm. They have gone through a long run of draws, showing they are hard to beat but sometimes lack fluency going forward.\n\nAt home, Brentford tend to start fast and put teams under pressure early, as seen in their win over Bournemouth where attacks came one after another. While they have still shown some defensive weaknesses, conceding goals in three of their last five matches, they usually respond quickly. With a place in the top five within reach with a win in this upcoming game, Brentford will be confident going into the game, backed by a strong home record of four wins and two draws from their last six matches, and just one home defeat so far in the 2025–26 season.\n\nSunderland come into this match with a very different style. Four draws in their last five games show how hard they are to beat, but also highlight their lack of attacking threat. They have scored only three goals in that run, with several low-scoring results like 0–0 and 1–1 reflecting their cautious approach. Away from home, Sunderland focus on staying compact and waiting for counter-attacking chances. This was clear in their draws against Brighton and Tottenham. While this makes them competitive, it leaves little room for mistakes, especially against a team like Brentford that can apply pressure for long periods.\n\nBrentford’s recent attacking form stands out when compared to Sunderland’s struggles in front of goal, and playing at home only strengthens their case. Brentford have shown they can control games and turn that control into goals, while Sunderland’s run of draws could be exposed by a team that presses consistently. Brentford’s strong home record suggests they will be tough to beat.\n\nSunderland arrive unbeaten in five matches, but their lack of attacking threat could be an issue against a confident Brentford side. This looks like a close game, but with home advantage and better recent form, Brentford seem to have the edge. Sunderland are a solid team, yet they can look flat away from home. With Igor Thiago in good form, Brentford should have enough to edge a narrow win.\n\n**NOTE: Please only stake what you can afford to lose; know that no picks are 100% guaranteed to hit. Stake Responsibly.**",

For all the same reasons and a few more. \n\nThe 2nd half under their new interim coach last week was night and day to the first. The tactic changed and Enzo was back to his box crashing self. I expect Chelsea to start the game this way against Fulham, as they're not a team you park the bus against. The second reason is that their new manager, Liam Rosenior, will be in the stands watching. The players will want to impress their new coach, so I see Chelsea coming out strong. \n\n**Please wait for lineups if your book does not void for players who don't start.** I warn this a lot, and while I fully expect Enzo to start, we've been burned by stranger coaching subs. These guys are playing a game every 3 days, and so eventually coaches will rotate players.

I said that I was slightly worried about Liaoning’s form heading into this one and they ended up losing 25-12, 25-19, 25-12 to miss by 6 points. Regardless I still find the line was way too low so I can’t beat myself up for it and it did in fact end up moving to 126.5.\n\nYou know what my New Year’s resolution is? To go 365-0 on this thread. Well actually 358-0 because I’ve been testing my models. Today is day one of that. To recap the year it was alright with some ups (getting 10 wins in a row) and downs (towards the end was abysmal, sorry tailers). I do want to highlight I did win a pick that u/sigmabale tailed on 12/17/25 which is by far my biggest achievement in life. Really stop-start recently, the trends analyses weren’t working unfortunately. Variance? Maybe, but I’ll be focusing on my double faults plays now that the tennis season is back that brought me so much success + maybe the occasional prop I like. Tried something new in the off-season and it didn’t pay off, so be it that’s what betting is all about.\n\nI missed the thread being posted (sorry) but there’s about 2 hours to tail this so I’ll make it very quick. Sakkari has averaged a 5.3% double fault rate over the past year on hard courts. Using both players’ serving/returning stats + ELO differences I get an estimated 3.9 double faults for Maria across 21 games, anchoring it to the market line. That gives this play an estimated 72% chance of winning. She’s covered the line in 6/8 HC matches against the American though I will say that she didn’t DF the last time both played which I’m not worried about considering she’d committed 6 the week before that against Gauff last year. I actually think it’ll be a longer match than that which is good for the play because the Greek has looked very good in her opening two United Cup matches over strong opposition whilst Gauff was terrible against JBM.

Hear me out.\n\nBarcelona’s current *eight game winning streak and domestic superiority* sure sound impressive, but most of those victories have been **anything but smooth sailing.** Even in their latest game (against Espanyol) they were under heavy fire for the majority of the match and only a generational performance by Joan Garcia saved them from a potential embarrassment. We've seen this time and time again, and I just don't think Barcelona can survive playing like this for much longer. On the other side we have Athletic, on a very mixed run of form, but a team that is **more than solid in cup competitions.** They have **more Copa del Rey titles than Real Madrid,** for example, and have **won the Super Cup three times,** with the most recent win coming in 2021 (against Barca as well), but they've also reached the final the following year. In fact, they've **beaten Barcelona 3 times in the last 8** matches, suggesting that making life harder for the Catalan giant isn't a one-off occurence and that the play absolutely holds value at these scrumptious odds of +105.\n\nAthletic Bilbao are set up for a season of mediocrity, being somewhat disappointing in LaLiga and the Copa del Rey *(getting a narrow win against Ourense)* so far, as well as having an abysmal time in the Champions League, and that's why they're going to put **all their focus towards this competition** as it's realistically the only way they could collect some silverware come the end of the season.\n\nI also like the fact **Raphinha seemed completely ineffective** in the most recent game, showing that he hasn't quite shaken off his knock, while **Rashford seems to be on a crazy downtrend,** looking more and more of a ghost with each passing game *(bro thinks he's secured that contract).* **Yamal is also operating at about 80%,** trying to adapt to a new playing style. Meanwhile, in the midfield, **Frenkie de Jong often fails to control the game's tempo,** needlessly holding on to the ball and always making the most uncreative decision. **Pedri is also questionable because of the recent injury** (and ONLY because of that, as he's otherwise absolutely brilliant; without a doubt one of the best midfielders in the world). I don't think their **defence** needs much of an introduction, they're **all shakey** and only have Joan Garcia to thank for keeping the scorelines respectable. The team as a whole **keeps relying on Lewandowski's magic** off the bench, as well as **random moments of brilliance** from Yamal, Ferran Torres, Fermin and Olmo, but that's just not going to reliably happen. Joan was extra hyped up to deliver a cracking performance against Espanyol as that was his former club that now hates him for switching to their rivals, I can't see him have a performance at the same level again.\n\nOverall, everything is setting itself up nicely for a game, which Athletic Bilbao can definitely get something out of. They're a solid team that can always cause troubles to even the most elite clubs, as they're **hard to break down** and have the amazingly talented **Nico Williams** always ready to blow past the opposing defenders. *They do have a few absences of their own, but I don't think they matter as much in the grand scheme of things.*\n\nBear in mind, this is a knockout where tactics tend to be more cautious and even **small mistakes are punished,** that's why I can absolutely see Athletic Bilbao nab a cheeky win *(feeling a 2-1 here honestly)* or a draw *(which still wouldn't be disastrous all things considered).* I love the look of this matchup, been excited for it since the start of the year, so I'm going in with 3 whole units. If Flick fields Ferran in the starting XI, I'm loving these odds even more. I also like the BTTS Yes and the Under 3.5 goals angle, if you want to take those instead. Either way, BOL y'all and let's enjoy some Spanish Super Cup madness, the Espanyol match certainly did not disappoint and this one has all the signs of a classic ☘️🫡",

Struff wasn't able to get the break back in the first set from 15-40, and ended up losing the match in three sets. While that pick wasn't the best, I'm still happy with my overall form (17-3 L20), and am looking forward to today's play. \n\nRafa Jodar has seen an incredible rise over the past few years, to the point where he has now viewed as the top young prospect in a highly talented Spanish crop. He recently chose to forgo his remaining three years of college tennis eligibility, which wasn't a huge surprise after he earned a spot in Australian Open qualifying and defeated ATP #26 Learner Tien at the Next Gen Finals in Jeddah. This should allow him to focus his energy on breaking onto the main tour in 2026, and this isn't the first time a player has used the Canberra Challenger as a starting point. Last year, we saw Brazilian sensation Joao Fonseca capture the title; the year before, Jakub Mensik made a run to the final to start an excellent 2024 campaign. Jodar has already won two qualifying matches (including one on center court, where he'll be playing today), and one main draw match (defeated big server Nicolas Jarry 3 & 4). Last year, Jodar played primarily on hard courts, which allowed him to develop an aggressive game that perfectly suits the surface.\n\nThere's no doubt that Jaime Faria is a nice talent in his own right. Faria rose to prominence at last year's Australian Open, where he took a set off Djokovic, but injuries ended up significantly disrupting his 2025 campaign. He was able to defeat Elmer Moller easily in the first round, but Moller is pretty much a clay specialist right now, and Faria was only priced at even money. This should be a much bigger test of whether he's back to his old form, and I don't see him on the same level as Jodar regardless. Faria does have a big serve and forehand, but Jodar isn't a serve-dominant player, and I don't expect this to turn into a servebotting fest. These are some really nice odds for this play, but I would take this up to around -150.",

Anyway, the new manager bounce effect is real even with the current one just being an interim.\n\nThis could also not have been against a better suiting side since Burnley are currently on the worst run in the prem with an 11 game winless streak which they have drawn just 2 of. In my books United have improved A LOT and Amorim fixed a lot of things like the xG and discipline of the squad, they have been way more cohesive since his appointment. The interim manager who is the manager of United U18s have managed that youth team to a 2nd place this season, let’s see if he can carry his tactics to the men’s team.\n\nOn the H2H side United are 7-2-1 in their last 10 recent meetings with Burnley and when playing at Burnley they are an overall 6-2-1 against them where they are on a streak of 8 games unbeaten at Burnley. Of course lots of things have changed and this United squad is very different, but it is still worth mentioning.",

They’re on a seven-game winless streak and have lost four of their last five league matches.

Their coach is being linked with the Manchester United job after Amorim was sacked this week, and situations like that rarely help a struggling squad.

I'll post couple of links (images) from my profile to prove I did send it. Think it's the issue with this profile being new. I checked this sub for a while, but decided to post from New Year and made a new profile for that.

The reason I guess is her left quadriceps/thigh was heavily taped in yesterday match against Aiava. She asked for a MTO at 6-7 2-1 for leg problems, but it didn't seem to bother her too much later as she went on to turn the match around and win 6-7 6-3 6-3. It was her R1 match after two impressive wins in Q against Wei and Shibahara. She is a young Russian with a complete game who had a breakthrough 2025. and will try to establish herself on Tour in 2026. I really like her in a matchup against Garland who is one of my favorite fades in WTA. Classic brainless ballbasher who reaches highest highs and lowest lows in same match. Iatcenko has a pretty consistent gamestyle, placing heavy balls deep into court, moving opponents and will make Garland hit on the run. It's a gamble since Iatcenko condition is not fully known, but given I consider her a favorite here I just can't miss her at these odds. H2H is 1-0 for Garland, 6-2 6-1 in 2024., but a lot changed since.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Any donations would be greatly appreciated:*\n\n[https://buymeacoffee.com/kumpir](https://buymeacoffee.com/kumpir)",

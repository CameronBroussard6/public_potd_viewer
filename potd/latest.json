Braga have won 4 of their last 5 games in all competitions.\n\nNice has allowed 14 goals in their last 5 games and has only scored 3 goals in those matches.

Haaland (and the rest of City) executed pretty much as expected,  cashing our play in the first half and ending with 3 SOTs and a goal. Good to be back with more plays!\n\nToday we head to Switzerland to revisit one of our favorite picks, Donyell Malen in the Europa League. After winning Aston Villa's November player of the month, primarily due to his Europa performances, our guy should be starting here either up front with Watkins resting or next to him. In his last two Europa matches, the only two he has started, Malen has cleared this line with 3 shots (3 SOT, 2 goals), and 6 shots (4 SOT, 1 goal). This line doesn't make a lot of sense, given his ATGS line is lower than 2+ SOTs, and Watkins is the inverse of that (ATGS better odds than 2+ SOT). Again, I think Malen should start here, but I was expecting his 2+ SOT line to be around the +110 mark which is where Watkins is at. \n\nFC Basel play tough at home, winning both of their Europa matches at home thisnfar. However, they have not really played EPL level competition and have given up an average of 6.5 SOTs per Europa match. \n\nWhile this play has actually hit with Malen coming off the bench a week ago, I obviously am banking on him starting the match here. As always, **please feel free to wait for lineups if youre worried about players not starting**. I prefer to take the risk of the players not starting, as we tend to get better odds that way. But coaches do weird things and my reads aren't perfect, so please be wary that there's always a chance Malen does not start. \n\nBOL!",

Basel sit in 3rd place in the Swiss Super League (8W3D5L, goals 25:18) and they are pretty strong at home. In the Europa League however, they are pretty mid, with 2W0D3L, sitting at 24th place (goal ratio 7:7). \n\nAston Villa are in pretty good form, sitting in 3rd place in the Premier League with 9W3D3L, beating Arsenal(!!) this weekend and having also recently beat Brighton, Wolves, Leeds and Bournemouth. In the Europa League they are in 3rd place with 4W0D1L, recently beating Young Boys and Maccabi Tel Aviv.\n\nBasel can be a tough nut to crack at home and Aston Villa might rotate some players, but I still think they will comfortably win this one.",

Those boys made a statement with the win over the badgers to open up their big ten season. Let’s go 😤\n\nEvent: Trail Balzers @ Pelicans (NBA) (7pm central)\n\nPOTD: Over 238.5 (-115) (1U) \n\n(Bet to win unit size) \n\nWrite up:\n\nI believe we have a recipe for an over in tomorrows matchup between the blazers and pelicans. The blazers will be without Clingan and Holiday while Rob Williams remains questionable. This will throw a wrench into an already shaky defense that has allowed an average of 119 ppg to opponents over their last 5 games. The pelicans have been atrocious defensively, ranking 29th in defensive efficiency over their last 5 games and allowing an average of 132 ppg over that same span. However, offensively both of these teams have shown life and have some players that can still put the ball in the hoop. What I think is interesting is the pelicans have been 12th in offensive efficiency over their last 5 and 14th over their last 10. And although the blazers haven’t been great offensively over their last 5-10 games, it will be a lot easier going up against this pelicans defense and guys like Shaedon sharpe and avdija who love to push the pace will thrive in a matchup like this. The blazers and pelicans are both 1st and 3rd respectively in pace over their last 5 games and 6th and 7th respectively in their last 10. Without the presence of clingan down low tomorrow I expect queen to have another big game after dropping 33 in his last game and I expect the guards from Portland to be able to score at will in a fast paced game down in New Orleans. I expect both teams to flirt with 120+ and cash this over. As always, cheers 🍻",

Gonna be trying my luck at a $400-$10000 challenge (my unit size is $400), aiming for five straight wins to get to that magic $10k mark. Switching it up a bit this time - I'm a massive Pels fan (tough life trust me), and I know this team inside out, so for this run I’m only betting on Pelicans games. Hopefully we nail the five wins straight off the bat, but either way I’m grinding until we hit that $10k.\n\n**Win Streak**: ❌ ✅ ✅ ❌\n\nThe worst loss I've ever seen. Fears ends with 19 PRA (1 short), shot 4/16 from the field and missed a free throw to put us over the line. Absolutely shocking. Back in the lab tho.\n\n**Wager:** $400 (Day 1)\n\n**Pick:** New Orleans Pelicans v Portland Trailblazers | Derik Queen O 25.5 PRA @ 1.86\n\nKeeping it extremely simple. After Queen's historic triple double last game, and that absolutely ridiculous third quarter when he shot 10/10 from the field, I am absolutely convinced the Pels will finally run the offence through him again. They did for a few games (in which Queen averaged about 35 PRA), then switched it over to Bey and Fears. That little experiment didn't work too well, and after that performance they will almost certainly switch back to a DQ-based offence.\n\nExpecting extremely high usage, and overall should be a comfortable cover. Not much else to add tbh. Let's get back on track (still so mad about that last beat, but it's all good).\n\nBOL if tailing!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jdw0ra675j6g1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5297d5765d58a7f391def3eefa727e9e00ee134b",

Hopefully the Bucs coaching staff is smart enough to force them to throw the ball downfield as they should and this would eliminate that threat. I’m not banking on it though as common sense seems to be gone in most NFL and college coaching 😂.\n\nI really like the value on this pick none the less",

The Bucs are getting back both Mike Evans and Jalen McMillan from injury for this game, meaning they now have Mike Evans, Chris Godwin, Emeka Egbuka, Jalen McMillan, and Bucky Irving all on the field. If this team stayed healthy I would make an argument that they are a top 3 team in the NFC behind the Rams and Seahawks. The Falcons have two defensive threats in cornerback AJ Terrell as well as safety Jessie Bates, and Mike Evans will be getting a lot of attention from them in this one. Even if Terrell doesn’t shadow Evans, the Bucs simply have too many offensive weapons for the two of them to handle for 60 minutes. Earlier in the season I would take Egbuka in this spot, but his efficiency has absolutely fallen off a cliff over the like 5 or so weeks. Chris Godwin has re-cemented himself as the WR2 in this unit, so I’m liking him to get 25 receiving yards or more in this one.\n\nNow for the other side of things. The Bucs rush defense has been solid this season, but are averaging over 100 yards given up per game and got slashed by Saints backup running back Devin Neal and QB Tyler Shough last week. The Falcons have Bijan Robinson, a top 5 RB in the league. He will be getting a lot of attention in this game as the Falcons do not have their starting QB nor their top WR in this game, and there really isn’t much talent left on that offense besides Kyle Pitts (shoutout Mr Ingles) and Bijan. However, the Bucs passing defense has been one of the worst in the league this season. Bijan is also a passing catching running back, meaning both he and Pitts are going to to have the respect of the Bucs defense, and they’ll have to cover for the pass even without the Falcons starting QB and WR. Given this info, I like having their backup RB, Tyler Allgeier, to have opportunities to run as the Bucs still need to respect the passing game. There will be running lanes opening for the Falcons, even against this Bucs rushing defense. Allgeier has hit this number in 3 straight games, is averaging over 3 yards a carry, and received double digit carries last week. Interestingly enough, the last 2 teams that the Falcons played who had higher caliber defenses, Allgeier got double digit carries in both games and went for 45 yards on average. He should get 15 or more rushing yards in this one.\n\nRemember to only bet what you can afford to lose, and BOL!",

However, it also just so happens to be the mantra for this season’s Iowa State men’s basketball team.\n\nOkay, I lied. I have no idea if it is, but if it isn’t, it most certainly should be. \n\nThat’s because these undefeated Cyclones (9-0) can inflict damage in every area of the court.\n\nYou want offense? Through nine contests, Iowa State ranks 1st in offensive efficiency (1.279), 1st in field-goal percentage (54.9%), 3rd in three-point shooting (43.8%) and 4th in scoring (94.6 PPG). Surprisingly, the team has been even better as of late, averaging 102.7 points on 61.5% shooting from the field (57.5% from beyond the arc) over its last three games. Furthermore, the Cyclones have topped 78 points in each of their games, including topping the 90-point mark in six of those. \n\nAnd if you want defense…well, just ask Purdue.\n\nThe former top-ranked team in the country found life miserable against this Iowa State defense. The unit was suffocating, holding the Boilermakers to just 24-of-59 (40.7%) from the field and 4-of-18 (22.2%) from the perimeter in an 81-58 victory on the road. It snapped a 36-game win streak in home non-conference matchups for Purdue. Not surprisingly, Iowa State finds themselves among the best in the country across the board, ranking 9th in defensive efficiency (0.873), 13th in scoring defense (64.6 PPGA), 89th in opponent field-goal percentage (41.9%) and 180th in opponent three-point shooting (33.0%). \n\nThat doesn’t bode well for an over-achieving Iowa offense on Thursday night.\n\nThus far, the Hawkeyes (8-1) rank 14th in field-goal percentage (51.7%), 16th in offensive efficiency (1.212), 41st in three-point shooting (37.7%) and 100th in scoring (79.9 PPG). However, the unit has struggled as of late, averaging just 64.7 points on 45.2% shooting from the field over its last three. That includes a 71-52 defeat at then-No. 7 Michigan State last Tuesday, a game in which Iowa was held to just 17-of-45 (37.7%) from the field. In fact, in the only matchup against a defense that ranks Top 100 in defensive efficiency—74th-ranked Ole Miss—the Hawkeyes shot just 24-of-56 (42.8%) from the field in squeaking out a 74-69 victory. \n\nConversely, the defense has yet to be truly tested either.\n\nThrough nine games, Iowa ranks 10th in scoring defense (62.6 PPGA), 43rd in defensive efficiency (0.949), 121st in opponent three-point shooting (31.7%) and 146th in opponent field-goal percentage (43.6%). However, the team has faced just one offense ranked in the Top 20 in offensive efficiency—77th ranked Michigan State—and the unit allowed the Spartans to shoot 23-of-46 (50%) from the field in a 19-point loss. \n\nMeanwhile, the Cyclones have beaten five power conference opponents, including four of them by double-digit. \n\nTrust the experience and athleticism on both ends of the court to allow Iowa State to cruise in this one.\n\nBOL if tailing, and as always, please do so responsibly. One bet should not lead to a crash out.",

Luke Littler is on absolute fire right now leading the PDC in every major stat category and coming off a win at the Players Championship Finals. However, Littler tends to start out slow in tournaments, especially against lower ranked opponents. Labanauskas is ranked 95th, where Littler will look to win this match quickly in straight sets.

At the World Grand Slam he faced Sedlacek in the first round and threw 0 108’s in 6 legs.

It was a sweat-free pick as well that cashed around the 30th minute with Dobson ending the match on 4 tackles (2 won) before being hooked at the 68th minute. Wrexham were pegged back for large portions of the game eventually losing 2-0 and to make matters worse Moore missed an equalising pen but Hull thoroughly deserved it.\n\nGenerally don’t love to bet on European matches due to the small sample size of stats but I like the value here so I’ve gone for it. Peretz started off as a more defensive player playing deep in midfield but has moved up the pitch in the past few years, now playing as the attacking mid of the team. He’s their top scorer this year with 7 goals and even scored a brace against Italy with his country. I’m not going to use domestic league stats for Peretz because of how weak the Israeli league is.\n\nIn European matches, Peretz has averaged 2.4 shots per match over the last 15, clearing the line in 12 of those (80%), 9/11 in Europa league since last year (82%). In away games he’s had 2+ shots in 7/7. This campaign has seen him average 2.5 shots and cleared the line in all four matches. He’s recorded 2+ shots over some very good teams in that run including the current top three of Europa this year Lyon, Midtjylland and Villa away (insane that they had to play them back-to-back). Last year saw him cover against Ajax, Besiktas, Braga so he does pull off shots even against tough teams despite how awful Maccabi look, sitting in 35th out of 36. I watched their matches against Aston Villa and Lyon and he looked like the only player who could cause any sort of danger so if they want any chance coming into this it’ll be coming through him. Stuttgart have been conceding 3 shots per game against attacking mids and 2.4 at home this season. Yes the German team will control possession which is a concern but I still back Dor Peretz to get the job done as he’s done so often in these tough matches. BOL !\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yu2r0s273h6g1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b1e2f46de16cb6c728b77dfefce795be3999d86e",

I normally avoid betting on their games but it’s Thursday Night Football & this play looked nice. The (4-9) Atlanta Falcons travel to Tampa Bay to take on the (7-6) Buccaneers in an important inner divisional NFC South showdown. After starting the season off on a tear with a 5-1 record at the top of the NFC South, the Bucs went on to lose 5 of their last 7 games & are now tied for 1st with the Panthers in the division. They’re coming off a 24-20 loss last week at home to New Orleans, in a game where they led 10-7 at halftime & 17-14 in the 3rd quarter, but only scored 3 points the rest of the game for the loss. The Falcons on the other hand have been absolutely miserable after starting the season 3-2. They come into this game having lost 7 of their last 8 games, & they don’t have much to play for at this point in the year. Not even a draft pick. They don’t have their 1st round pick in the 2026 NFL Draft after trading it in the 2025 draft to the Rams to move up to get DE James Pierce. They’re going to be trying their best to win, especially with head coach Raheem Morris in the hot seat. A little over a month ago Atlanta lost their young starting QB Michael Penis Jr to a season ending ACL injury that required surgery, with good ol 87 year old Kirk Cousins filling in as his replacement. They’ve also been without Drake London who has been out with a PCL injury, he will miss this game as well. They’re player who has benefited the most from this injury is the Falcons 25 year old Tight End.\n\nLast week the Falcons did what every Atlanta team has done to me being an Atlanta sports fan my entire life, build your hopes up & just when you have a glimpse of hope they castrate you, leaving you hopeless & nutless. They played the Seahawks well all 1st half, it was tied 6-6 at Half. Then the Seahawks outscored them 31-3 in the 2nd half & it was back to the old days, better than 28-3 I guess. But there was a little slither of hope. Kyle Pitts might have finally arrived after all these years. In 2021 the Falcons selected him with the 4th overall pick in the draft making him the highest drafted Tight End ever. He has not lived up to expectations to say the least. But with the recent injury to QB Penis Jr, Kirk Cousins may have brought Pitts back to life. Pitts had 7 catches for 82 yards against the Jets 2 weeks ago, then followed it up with 6 catches for 90 yards vs the Seahawks last week. __In Cousins 4 starts this season, Pitts has 32 targets. The next closest player is Darnell Mooney with 16.__ It has helped Pitts even more that Drake London has been injured. __In Pitts last 4 games with London, he has went (starting with most recent):__\n\n6 rec, 90 yards\n\n7 rec, 82 yards\n\n2 rec, 25 yards\n\n9 rec, 59 yards\n\nKirk has been targeting the hell out of him & he has become Cousins favorite weapon. __Cousins has targeted him 18 times the past 2 games. In the 4 games that London has missed, Pitts has received 30%, 25%, 25.8%, & 35.7% of the team’s targets. On those 137 routes, Pitts was targeted on 25.5% of his routes for 2.0 yards per route. That target rate/route would rank 1st among Tight Ends over the entire season & the yards/route would rank 3rd. Pitts also has a 34% first read target share over the past 3 games, higher than even Trey McBride the best TE in the league. He leads all Tight End’s in air yards with a 37% share.__ Now he faces a Bucs defense that runs a ton of zone. __Bucs head coach Todd Bowles is a defensive minded coach that loves his zone. __The Bucs run Zone coverage on 76.2% of their plays, 8th most in the league. Last week Pitts shredded the Seahawks defense (6/90 yds) that run zone 79.4% of their plays, highest in the league.__ Zone defenses, specifically the Bucs’ defense, naturally funnels passes to tight ends & running backs. It’s the only place to throw the ball. They will give you the underneath & sidelines gaps between the zones all day. __The Bucs allow 112.4 yards per game on short sideline passes 3rd most in the league, & 53.5 yards per game to intermediate sideline passes 4th most in the league. The Falcons average 108.2 yards per game on short sideline passes (7th most) & 57.7 on intermediate sideline passes (3rd most).__ This is where Kyle Pitts does his damage & he should eat the Bucs alive like he has done in the past. __Pitts has hit over this line in all 3 of his games vs the Bucs dating back to last season:__\n\n9/7/25: 7 rec, 59 yards\n\n10/27/24: 4 rec, 91 yards\n\n10/3/24: 7 rec, 88 yards \n\nAnother reason Kirk Cousins has targeted Pitts is he is just 31 of 64 (48.4%) for 320 yards (5.0 Y/A) with a 72.4 rating when targeting wide receivers this season. Pitts is his lord & savior. __Also the Bucs D allows the 4th most yards per pass attempt & has been lit up by opposing TE’s lately: Saints TE’s: 5/54, McBride: 8/82 1 TD, & Rams: 7/70 1 TD.__ Kirk should connect a ton with Pitts here.\n\n5 of Atlanta’s last 6 games have gone over the total & the Bucs have been vulnerable to downfield passing attacks. With Bowles as the head coach of Tampa Bay, the Bucs are 1-8 against the spread when hosting division opponents. They’re also just 1-10 ATS when playing at home after playing a home game the previous week. On top of that, the Falcons are 5-0 ATS when playing away from home after a game in which they allowed 30 or more points under Raheem Morris. Sunday’s contest was played in heavy rain, leaving Tampa’s turf in poor condition heading into this week’s matchup. If the field conditions are less than ideal, that typically helps offenses over defenses, with DL losing footing & DB’s having issues mirroring WR’s routes. Tampa Bay’s defense in particular has had trouble this year in these situations.\n\nI think it’s a shootout & Pitts is the biggest beneficiary for the Falcons. \n\n__Kyle Pitts o58.5 receiving yards__\n\nAppreciate the love!

I am factoring this in but still think both lines are disrespectfully too high given the circumstances**\n\n**Career U 5.5 Deaths Map 1**:\n\n* So far at Kespa Damwon are 4-0 at the tournament, Career is averaging 3.3 DPG with 0/4 hit rate on over\n* Overall 89/101 hitrate (88.1%), and 49/53 of his teams wins (92.4%) in 2025\n* While this is the riskier of the two since Career was previously an academy player and lacks LCK experience, I really think he is a very talented support, led the LCK CL in lowest deaths per game on support both in 2025 and in Summer Season, he plays very smart and disciplined and I really like DKia bot lane in this one. DKia are -200 favorites and will get side choice to start blue side in this series\n\n**Keria U 5.5 Deaths Map 1:**\n\n* Keria is averaging 2.7 deaths per game at Kespa Cup so far with a 3/3 under hitrate so far\n* At worlds, Keria had a 20/20 hitrate on U 5.5 deaths averaging exactly 3 deaths per game, 14/14 in wins\n* Overall Keria has a 92% hitrate last year in Spring/Summer/MSI/Worlds, with a 97.6% hitrate on the under in his teams wins,\n\nKeria line is just way too high to me, he covers so often even in losses on this line, T1 are a slow paced team that play macro and don't scrap a lot for no reason, this match means something to the players as well and this line is  just way too high (Delight is set to 3.5 deaths).\n\nCareer slightly scarier because less data against LCK, however line is still way too high in my opinion again massive hit rate most of times significantly under, and Career is a -200 favorite, where he has covered in 92.4% of games and most misses being on troll picks that we won't see. Model heavily favors in both unders even when accounting for the projected kill lines per map as opposed to their normal data",

X**\n\nPSG played ass couldn't score their chances, bad read from me.\n\nToday's pick: Feyenoord and Aston Villa to win. 2,75 4 units.\n\nFeyenoord just played Stuttgart, Villa and Celtic in the Europa League. Those are all top sides in this competition, and the level is way higher than what they face now. FCSB are sitting tenth in the Romanian league and they’ve only won one Europa League game, the same as Feyenoord, but the difference in quality is huge. Feyenoord competes for the Dutch title, they play a much faster and attacking, and they absolutely need this win to stay in Europe. This should be a game where the difference in tempo and intensity shows immediately. For me, Feyenoord should handle this.\n\nThen you have Aston Villa. They’re second in the Premier League, playing top football every week, and even though they’re not as dominant in the Europa League, they’re still winning and sitting third in the group. Villa create chances and they move the ball well. When Malen plays, he’s been in great form too. The numbers are there. Villa attack at a high pace: almost fourteen shots per game, six on target, creating close to four big chances every match. With that amount of pressure, they eventually break teams down.\n\nBasel, on the other hand, look shaky. They only kept one clean sheet. They allow one point four goals per game, they make a lot of fouls that lead to shots, and they lose the ball over 130 times per match. Their defensive numbers tell the whole story. They clear the ball a lot because they get pinned back, and their duel success isn’t high enough to stop teams that attack constantly.\n\nVilla usually dominate possession, with over sixty percent on average and almost nine out of ten passes completed. That kind of control is exactly what Basel struggles against. Most of the game will be played in Basel’s half, and the shot volume from Villa should be too much for them to hold out.\n\nSo for me, both picks line up. Feyenoord have more quality, more urgency and a way higher level of competition behind them. Villa are simply the better team and the stats back it up. But I do like them single as well.\n\nBOL!",

I like how Vegas’ shot share and expected-goals share are both slightly above 50% on the season, especially since they have deeper forward depth. \n \nI don’t like that the Flyers heavily on Konecny to create offense.

Over the course of three weeks, 128 of the best darts players on the planet will compete on the Ally Pally stage for a piece of the $5 million prize fund. \n\nFor the first day of action, I very much like backing the darts vereran & Latvian #1 player - Madars “Latvian Razmatazz” Razma to defeat Jamai van den Herik. \n\nRazma, current world #46, has been on the PDC Tour since 2017, steadily climbing the rankings to achieve a current career-best within the top 50. Razma has won matches at the World Championships in each of the last two world championships, and he also reached a QF of the 2022 World Grand Prix, a major tournament on the darts tour. \n\nThe opponent & current world #115 van den Herik, is a much lesser-known and inexperienced commodity than Razma. The 22-year-old van den Herik has amassed $42k in his brief career, with most of that $$ being earned on the Modus Super Series, a lesser, secondary professional tour in the sport of darts 🎯. \n\nVan den Herik has not won a PDC rated match since October 1, 2025, and he’s lost his last 6 matches in the final PDC Players Championships to close out his 2025 PDC Tour. In contrast, Razma won 7 PDC ranked matches in each of those same PDC Players Championship events where van den Herik went winless. \n\nWhile there are never easy victories when it comes to the World Championships, I think experience, form, and overall ability all favor the 37-year old 🇱🇻 Madars Razma — so I am Locking him in to win on day 1, while also eyeing a potential upset coming up on day 2.",

Sure Irving is back, Same with Evans and McMillan, therefore White's volume is going down. But, he's still seeing plenty usage. While he did only have two carries against the Cardinals, he saw 11 against the Saints. I believe this line at 15.5 is too low even with so many weapons being back. In fact, getting those weapons may cause a wide enough lead to incentivize 2nd half rushing.\n\nAtlanta's rush defense has been bad these past few weeks. They've been allowing the 12th most fantasy points to rbs in that stretch. Not to mention they're ranked 24th in rushing defense in the league giving up 131.0 average rushing a game. This is juxtaposed to their 9th ranked passing defense. Buccaneers are going to utilize their rb room\n\nLooking at White's rushing average those 6 games (w1-4 and w13/14) when Bucky is playing, he's averaging 6 carries a game for 28 yards, still plenty of volume, White's been averaging 3.8 YPC, and the Falcons have been allowing around 4.5 YPC this season. I can see him getting at least 4 touches which would hit if he follows these averages.\n\nTampa bay holds a solid o-line currently, a useful tool needed for rushing. As it stands right now, the Bucs are favorites playing at home, with a -4.5 spread and -238 ML. Falcons offense has been rather inconsistent, most of the time looking bad and then showing up where they have no business to. Unless Kirko Chains unleashes another 500 yard game, I can see the Bucs getting a nice lead, further utilizing the run and diversity in who gets the ball (ie less Irving concentrated carries).\n\nBOL everyone who tails!",

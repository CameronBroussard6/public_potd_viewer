      "text": "💎POTD: 🏈 New Mexico ML\nOdds: +102 on FanDuel\nWager: 1.5 units\n\n👀 MY POTD MAPLE LEAFS ML WON THE OTHER DAY (Got a lot of criticism for the last POTD lol🤫🤣) \n\nCFB🏈 New Mexico vs Minnesota Commanders, 4:30 pm ET 12/26/25\n\nRecord: 9-10\nNet Units: -3.96 Units\n\nExplanation: I think New Mexico can beat Minnesota tomorrow because New Mexico should be able to control most of  the game. They run a balanced offense and their run defense is much improved over the season, only allowing 113.4 rushing yards per game, and that’s good in this matchup since Minnesota’s run game is struggling barely topping 100 rushing yards per game. \n\nNew Mexico is hot on 6 game winning streak and set a school record of 484.5 total yards per game. I foresee and conclude too many things that can go right for New Mexico , and too many things that can go wrong for Minnesota.",

If anybody's been around, we’ve been on a roll the past few years and looking to continue with more of the same. It’s a pretty even split this year as far as the playing field goes. A clear top 5, a Slovakia team that can be a little scrappy and the last 4 fighting to stay out of relegation.\n\nWith that being said, we’re going to start the slate off with the US covering against the Germans. The Americans have the Germans number in this tournament, routinely dominating them year in and year out. The US didn’t bring a gold favorite to the tournament like last year, but they should still comfortably fight for a medal. The Germans on the other hand will be fighting to stay in the top division for another year.\n\nWe only have a few pretournament games to go off of for both teams, but luckily for us they already played eachother 4 days ago, with the Americans winning by 8. Germany did start their backup in this game, but it wouldn't have mattered much. USA also sat a few of their returnees to get some looks at depth players before the final round of cuts. Expect a pretty big mismatch between a gold medal hopeful and a team trying to just stay afloat to start us off",

Ending 0-0.\n\n\nToday's pick:\n \nPremier League \n\nManchester United Vs Newcastle \n\nMatheus Chuna 2 or more shots on target.\n\n(2.10) 2.5 units \n\nBoth teams come into this game with a good portion of missing players, United missing some key attackers, Newcastle missing a lot of key players in defense.\n\nWith so many players on international duty or out with injuries, Chuna should get the full 90 minutes here to find these shots on target. He's been in good form as of late coming back from an injury, 2 goals and an assist in his last 3 games.\n\nShot wise his breakdown is as followed for the past few games.\n\nAston villa away: **6 shots 3 on target**\n\nBournemouth at home: **8 shots 3 on target**\n\nWolves away **8 shots 2 on target**\n\nNewcastle are also a team that really struggles to perform well away from home , they average about 7 shots on target conceded away from home if you take out the derby game against Sunderland last away game, which was a hard watch, constant fouls as it was a fierce rivalry match,  which meant there was very few chances for either side.\n\nChuna is a very direct player, great at picking up the ball from deep and going on a run and getting shots away, he should again get plenty of shooting opportunities to cover this line again like he has been for the past few weeks and for the price were getting it's too good for me to pass up a bet on this.\n\n\n\n\n\n**BOL and only bet what you can afford to lose!**",

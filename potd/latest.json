Starting off I like the Fighting Irish for many reasons. This Notre Dame team has won seven straight games after dropping their first two games against really good teams Miami and Texas A&M. They have crushed the teams they have beat in their seven straight wins with a win margin of over 26 points across those games. This Irish team runs the ball particularly well as they average 195 rushing yards per game and they have efficient quarterback play as quarterback CJ Carr averages over 250 passing yards a game, over 10 yards per pass attempt, 19 passing touchdowns to just 4 interceptions and 2 rushing touchdowns. The Irish are also paired with a stout defense that only allows 18 points per game which is 17th nationally. I also like the Georgia Bulldogs over the Texas Longhorns at home in this one. These teams have similar competition playing in the SEC and there are 3 teams both of these teams have played so far and Georgia has performed much better against all three of those teams. Both of these teams played Kentucky and Texas barely scraped by winning a 16-13 overtime game while Georgia completely dominated Kentucky 35-14. Similarly both of these teams played Mississippi State and Texas pulled off a late comeback forcing overtime beating Mississippi State 45-38 while Georgia blew out Mississippi State 41-21 in a game that was over by halftime. Lastly Texas played Florida and got handed an embarrassing loss 29-21 to the Gators while the Bulldogs beat the Gators 24-20 and couldve put more points on the board if they didnt kneel the game out at the Florida one yard line. Also Arch Mannings quarterback play has been inconsistent this year along with the run game struggling especially in conference play this year. They face off against a solid Georgia defense who excels at stopping the run so I think they will force the Longhorns into passing down and force Arch Manning to turn the ball over in this one. Another factor in this one is that Georgia has the home field advantage in this one and it is extremely hard to beat Georgia in Sanford Stadium in front of a sell out crowd in a night game. With all of this being said I like Notre Dame and Georgia to handle business in their contests this Saturday.\n\nPrediction: 34-23 Notre Dame, 20-16 Georgia\n\nLast pick:🏈Panthers ML/Bills ML💩Stinky shitty.\n\nBest of luck to everyone tailing and remember to bet responsibly lets have a great Saturday!!🍀💜🐉\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jkbyxieomc1g1.jpeg?width=1112&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3a599dc824b957f1fa08f47ac281b52e3e523b14",

Anyone who put those in with the AB to win (the total price would have been over the $3 threshold) collected easily too.\n\nToday's Pick: Grimsby Town to score o1.5 vs Chesterfield. 3u @ 2.02\n\nGrimsby are the best attacking side in the league, and even more so at home. They've also got great underlying numbers; best expected goals for, and best expected points total.\n\n- Grimsby average over 2 goals at home this league season, and 1.9 in all games. \n- They've scored o1.5 in 71% of home games in the league and 80% of total games \n- Over the season, Grimsby's xG ratio (how much of the xG pie they get per game) is a league leading 63.5%\n- Chesterfield are a much worse team on the road, with 8 points on the road compared to 16 at home.\n- Chesterfield are conceding about 1.5 xG per game over their last ten.\n- They've have only kept one clean sheet away from home all season, which was against relegation candidates, and IMO, worst team in the league, Cheltenham\n\nI love Grimsby to win this, I've got a bunch of bets with variations of this with the win - but I like the odds to score o1.5 too much considering. \n\n--------------------------------\n\nSide note, extra bet. \n\nBosnia play Romania in a WCQ game. I like backing them ML or double chance as a hedge because.... Well, basically to cut a long story short. \n\n- Romania (3rd in their group) are 3 points behind Bosnia (2nd in their group) with two games left for each. \n- Romania's last game is vs San Marino \n- Due to some convoluted rule regarding Nations League impacting WCQ, San Marino can actually be bottom of their group and playoff for a World Cup spot if Romania come second in the group",

Also brings up a 5 game winning streak for us!\n\n \n\nNext Pick: **Toronto Raptors -5.5 vs Indiana Pacers @ 1.93**. 3U play.\n\nWe bet on the Raptors recently against the Nets and will return to them back here. They have won 6 out of 7 games (both SU and ATS), their latest win against the Cavs yesterday. Their starting 5 are fit and have played a few games together now, with different guys stepping up each night. The Pacers are missing so many players through injury, they’re 1-11 for the season and have lost 5 in a row ATS. The difference in quality is just too high, and this game could be a very lopsided affair.  No need to overthink it here, let's just back this Raptors team that is on a solid run!\n\n*This line is available on FD, i'd play it to -7.0. Also, if you've made some money over this run, feel free to leave a tip:* [buymeacoffee.com/TheBrat](http://buymeacoffee.com/TheBrat)",

The league games are a lot easier and reliable to analyse so it was a mistake on my end to go for this play. England dominated the game as they’ve been doing under Tuchel, taking the lead through Saka in the first half before an Eze goal buried the Eagles late in the second. Kostić got booked late for a foul but that was the only fight Serbia really showed, as if they didn’t realise they’re out of the race to the World Cup.\n\nRecife were promoted to the Serie A this year following a 3rd place finish in the second division. This season has been a disaster though, sitting with just 2 wins after 32 games and a tragic 17 points amidst financial difficulty. They’re basically relegated (not yet mathematically but it would require them to win their last 6 the three teams in front of them to lose all so you get the point) so have nothing to lose. Flamengo are neck-and-neck with Palmeiras at the top of the league, only being second as Brazil implements a most wins system to settle points ties. Flamengo impressed at the Club World Cup (which was in the middle of their season) where they beat Chelsea and lost to Bayern in the RO16 in a pretty tight game.\n\nDespite Recife’s awful form, at home they’ve averaged 5.8 corners won + 4.4 conceded this season compared to Flamengo’s 5.5 won + 4.3 conceded on average in their last 20 on the road. Using recent form and all things considered I get an expected 5.2 Recife corners and 5 from the away team. That gives this play a 76% chance of winning. Yes the Mengão should control possession which is a concern for corners but remember this is Brazilian football, teams don’t just park the bus they’re constantly attacking. These two faced off just 2 weeks ago at the Maracaña and the line was cleared (9-8) despite the 3-0 win. Recife have also covered the line in 14/16 home matches this year (even having more corners than Palmeiras, Bahia and Mirassol who are make up the other 3 of the top 4), whilst opponents have in 14/20 against Flamengo at home so I really like this spot. BOL !\n\nI’m raising money for Movember, ALL proceeds will be going to a good cause. Donations aren’t expected but very much appreciated so if you have profited from my picks please do consider donating, a little goes a long way.

Prates comes into the fight following a highlight reel finish over Geoff Neal this last August and is riding a wave of momentum. Leon Edwards is on the other side of the coin after losing his belt last year and then getting dominated in March by Sean Brady. \n\nLeon Edwards has never been knocked out in the UFC but he’s never faced a striker like Prates in his lengthy career. Carlos Prates is a finisher who in every fight is looking to put his opponents lights out. In this week’s press conference leading up to the event, Prates vowed to be the first man to finish Edwards, As he did Neal in the summer. \n\nThese men are on different career trajectory’s and I expect the Brazilian to pressure Edwards and find the kill shot.

With a family & friends that are filled with UGA fans I’ve watched every game this season, so I went back & watched all of Texas games. As for the implications of this game for the playoffs & SEC Championship. If Alabama & Texas A&M win out, that's the SEC Championship. As for UGA, this game is huge because if Bama loses to Oklahoma (game will be finishing up while UGA vs Texas is starting), or they lose to Auburn, then UGA goes to the SEC ship if they win this. For the playoffs, if they win this they’re in. For Texas, they have to win out to be assured of a spot in the playoffs. One of the biggest games of the year.\n\nThe #10 Texas Longhorns (7-2) are traveling to Athens, GA for the first time ever to take on the #5 Georgia Bulldogs (8-1). Texas is coming off a bye week & are riding into the game on a 5 game win streak after winning 2 close games vs Vanderbilt & Mississippi St. Every Texas game feels like they are trying to invent new ways to come as close as possible to losing, without blowing it. As for UGA they are coming off a 41-21 road win @ Mississippi St (same team Texas went to OT with). Their only loss came to #4 Alabama on the season (by 3 points) & they have been on a tear. Mostly due to the late season surge of Junior QB Gunner Stockton.\n\nUGA QB Gunner Stockton has played some elite football lately. __In his last 3 games Gunner has thrown for 9 TD’s (most in SEC), 776 yards, with a 72% completion percentage.__ He also has showed up majorly in big games this season. In his 3 games vs ranked teams he threw for 62/82, 75.6% completion pct, 723 yards, 8.8 yards per pass, 7 TDs, & 0 INTs.__ He’s barely being mentioned in any Heisman conversation despite is elite stats. __He ranks 3rd in QBRating in the NCAA (89.4) & 2nd in the NCAA in QB EPA. He has only been intercepted twice this entire season.__ Where Gunner has excelled the most this season is on quick passes. __49% of his throws have been 5 yards or less. On those throws, UGA averages 7.0 yards per pass, 6th in NCAA.__ Huge upgrade from their 5.6 yards under Carson Beck last year. Texas sucks at defending short passes. On throws 5 yards or less Texas has allowed 5.4 yards per pass (74th).__ One of Texas’s strengths is their DLine & their ability to rush the QB. __Texas ranks 19th in opponent adjusted pressure rate. But they struggle generating pressure vs quick passes, ranking 70th in pressure.__ The Longhorns have been torched through the air their last 2 games. __The last 2 QB’s vs Texas: \n\n__Diego Pavia (Vandy): 27-38, 365 yards & 3 TD’s (He set his CAREER HIGH vs Texas in yards & completions)__\n\n__Blake Shapen (Miss St): 26/42, 381 yards & 4 TD’s (CAREER HIGHS for the 13th/16 rated QB in the SEC)__\n\nUGA Offensive Coordinator Mike Bobo has ran a balanced offense all season, but he most likely will lean on Gunner’s arm as Texas has a pretty good run defense. __Texas’s run d ranks 5th in yards before contact allowed & 13th in yards after contact allowed. UGA RB’s ranks 53rd in yards before contact & 29th in yards after contact.__ Gunner is going sling it. On the other side of the ball is Peyton & Eli’s cousin.\n\n*More write-up coming*\n\nAppreciate the love!

I avoided fading them last week mainly because I felt that the books started to inflate their spread too much as the line had gotten up to -21.5 for Oregon State to cover. Sam Houston State ended up sneaking a win out here in one of the weirdest games I've seen this year. Oregon State was up 17-0 at one point with the potential to go up 24-0 right before the half until they threw an interception with 1:20 to go in the 2nd quarter and Sam Houston was able to go into the half 7-17. Oregon State then proceeded to not score at all with a disaster class from their special teams allowing a punt return touchdown as well as blocked punt touchdown and the game ended 21-17 with Sam Houston State winning. Oregon State had 28 total first downs to Sam Houston's 8 first downs and Oregon State also had well over 300 more total offensive yards combined than them. Needless to say it's a miracle that Sam Houston managed to pick up their first win last week and I don't think Delaware will make the same mistakes as Oregon State. The only worry here is it kind of seems like Delaware plays much better at home as their only win on the road is against FIU but we only need the ML here and aren't on the -10.5 spread.\n\nFor the next leg we head to probably the best UFC card and title fight of the year. Islam Makhachev will face off against Jack Della Maddalena in Madison Square Garden. I'm gonna be honest since we haven't seen Islam at Welterweight before it's hard to gauge how he will do vs a guy who slightly bigger than him but off pure skill I will take Islam here. Jack is a high level striker but in my opinion I would take the wrestler over the striker most of the time. Jack managed to defend Belal's takedowns well in his last fight and force him to strike with him but I just think Islam is way more of a threat than Belal and will definitely manage to get him down and hold him down unlike Belal and actually be a submission threat. Islam also has more motivation here as a win here would help him secure double champ and set up a potential superfight vs Topuria. Not gonna overthink it and go with the guy who was pound for pound #1 before Topuria knocked out 3 legends in a row, BOL and bet responsibly.",

Injuries are manageable: the Gills are without Glen Morris, Conor Masterson and Armani Little, but their opponents Crawley Town are in far worse shape. Crawley arrive seriously undermanned, missing key players Danny Cashman, Harry McKirdy, Harvey Davies and captain Scott Malone, with an additional squad member away on international duty. Tactically, Gillingham’s physical and direct approach — especially at Priestfield — is well suited to exploiting Crawley’s weakened lineup and poor away record, with the visitors having taken only four points on the road. With higher motivation, clearer structure and the opposition stretched thin, Gillingham look the solid choice to take all three points.",

Their starting five hardly has any real minutes together this season, so the chemistry just isn’t there. Also plagued by injuries to key players (LaMelo, Green, Grant Williams, etc.). That weakens their offensive core.\n\n\nOKC is just the better team right now. Their rotation is solid, everyone knows their role, and they don’t really have any major chemistry issues. Hornets? Kinda the opposite. They’ve got injuries everywhere, their main lineup barely plays together, and the bench has to do way too much.\n\n\nStat-wise, OKC has the stronger defense and usually wins this matchup by a good margin. Hornets struggles to score consistently, especially without their full squad.\n\n\nBOTTOM LINE IS :\n\n\nOKC with extra rest has the stronger track record, better defense, offense , and way more lineup stability.

Kvaratskhelia plays his club soccer with PSG and wound up with a goal in his last match before this break. In his last 4 competitive matches with Georgia, he has two goals and is averaging 3 shots with 1 on target. Kvaratskhelia will chase any ball kicked his way and will With Georgia's main striker out injured, I see our guy taking a few shots, especially on counter attacks. \n\nNow to Spain. They've been nothing short of dominant in this World Cup Qualifier and have not yet conceded a goal. However, if one can fault them anywhere, they are giving their opponents opportunities on the road. With Turkiye firing off 13 shots (3 on target) and a very poor Bulgaria team taking 4 shots (2 on target),  Spain is not bulletproof on the road. Georgia also plays tough at home, having not been shut out since October 2024. \n\nMake no mistake, Spain should dominate this game. But I like rooting for underdogs and I like our guy Kvaratskhelia to land a shot on target (and maybe even find the back of the net) in front of the home crowd. \n\nBOL!",

Turkey are a very prolific team, Spain arguably held back a bit vs Bulgaria however when Turkey start scoring they don't stop - so far they beat Georgia 4-1, 3-2, Bulgaria 6-1 and lost to Spain 0-6. Nothing really noticeable here that shows how another high scoring game won't occur, with score difference being very important as well.",

They went into half time 1-0 down and came out in the second half and had chance after chance but just kept wasting them. They managed to get one back but it just wasn't enough in the end. England U21 had a penalty in the first half and didn't convert it and then went into half time 0-0. In the second half they got another penalty and this time they converted it and then didn't really do much until the 91st minute where they scored again to make it 2-0. Gonna take a break from soccer and go back to basketball for this next pick.\n\n***POTD6***  \n***-*** *Melbourne United -15*  \n***-*** *Brisbane Bullets Team Total Under 90.5*  \n***Odds:*** *2.00*  \n***Units:*** *3*\n\n***Sport:*** *Basketball 🏀*  \n***Teams:*** *Melbourne United v Brisbane Bullets*  \n***⏰:*** *4:30PM AEST (7 hours and 40mins from time of posting)*\n\n***Reasoning:***  \n***-*** *In their last game Brisbane Bullets lost their best scorer and player Casey Prather.

They have played one more game but 60 points won't be made up in that game*  \n***-*** *Brisbane are 8th (10 sides in NBL Top 6 make finals) and have really struggled lately. In their last game they lost by 29 points against 9th place, they won against 7th place but it was 83-81 so they were the winner out of two bad sides and before that they lost by 37 to 2nd place*  \n***-*** *The last time these two sides met Melbourne won 95-86, Melbourne played a really bad game and still won by 9. Two players on Melbourne shot 14% and 10% who are both just below 50% average scorers*  \n***-*** *10/13 games Brisbane haven't scored 90 and that's including a game against bottom of the league Cairns who have 9/13 of their games having 90+ scored against them*  \n***-*** *Melbourne have only let the opposition score 90+ 3/12 times and that was against top 6 teams and two games where someone scored 30+ points*  \n***-*** *Casey Prather usually scores about 30% of Brisbane's points, they have played one game without him this season and they scored 82*",

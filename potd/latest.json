Not much else to say on this besides the books on this one heavily overvalued the return of Tampa's WRs despite the consistency of Cade. \n\n**Write up:** Onto our next pick we stay in the NFL and head up north to Pittsburg in a divisional rivalry match between the Ravens and the Steelers. This is a must win game for both teams as the winner advances to the playoffs. With Lamar not fully healthy, this game will be won based off how well Henry can run the ball. I expect with playoff implications on the line for Henry to clear this line which he has been relatively consistent with this season besides the stint on October/November. To top it off, Henry exceed this line the last time they played the Steelers on the 7th. I expect heavy usage out of Henry to keep control of the clock in an attempt to make the playoffs.",

Interim boss Calum McFarlane is expected to prioritise compactness and damage limitation against Manchester City, especially with Moisés Caicedo suspended — a huge loss given his role in screening the defence and controlling tempo. Without him, Chelsea are likely to spend long spells without the ball, defending deep and reacting rather than dictating, which historically drives up foul counts against Guardiola sides. Reece James, whether deployed centrally or at right-back, faces constant isolation against City’s rotating wide threats, a scenario that often leads to late challenges and tactical fouls. The appointment of Michael Oliver further sharpens the disciplinary angle: Oliver is among the Premier League referees most willing to punish persistent infringement and tactical fouling, particularly in matches involving high-possession sides where the defending team repeatedly breaks transitions. With Chelsea highly motivated to stay competitive, emotionally fragile after managerial upheaval, and structurally stretched in midfield, the conditions strongly point toward sustained defensive pressure and multiple booking scenarios.",

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 2-0\n\n**Previous Pick:** **QPR vs Norwich - BTTS YES** (1.83) ✅\n\nWe win it on the last kick of the game. Shouldn't have been so hard to hit but we take it tho.\n\n**POTD**: Soccer/Football, Premier League, **Leeds vs Manchester Utd - O2.5G & BTTS YES** (2.05) 1u, 13:30 pm CET\n\n**Reasoning**:\n\nNow, for this pick i've been thinking a lot whether to choose o2.5G & btts yes or just btts yes. As i'm going to show you, the stats for btts are just better but the odds are just a bit lower from what i like (1.61) so i've decided to take a bit of a risk and put o2.5g because if both teams are able to score i can totally see it happening tbh. By far, both of these teams are two of the best teams to bet on having lots of goals in a game in the Premier League, especially in this situation. BUT, if you want to play it safer choose the btts yes pick. Now these are the stats backing up this pick:\n\nFor the btts:\n\nLeeds at home has seen btts in 7/9. (78%)\n\nMan Utd away from home has seen btts in 8/9. (89%)\n\nin the last 8 games (home/away) Leeds has seen btts in 7/8. (88%)\n\nin the last 8 games (home/away) Man Utd has seen btts in 6/8. (75%)\n\nLeeds at home hasn't had a clean sheet in 7/9 and only failed to score in 1 game.\n\nMan utd away from home hasn't had a clean sheet the entire season and only failed to score in 1 game\n\nBoth teams have lower than 20% on clean sheets and failed to score stats in the last 8 games.\n\nFor O2.5G:\n\nLeeds at home has seen O2.5G in 7/9. (78%)\n\nMan Utd away from home has seen O2.5G in 8/9. (89%)\n\nThis season, the average of goals for both teams is over 3 goals for both. More especifically, Leeds at home has an average of  3.22g and Man Utd away from home has an average of 3.44g.\n\nNow here comes the tricky part:\n\nin the last 8 games (home/away) Leeds has seen o2.5G in 5/8. (62%)\n\nin the last 8 games (home/away) Man Utd has seen o2.5G in 4/8. (50%)\n\nSo since this stats are not great i've checked it up and i saw that **when Leeds are playing at home and Utd is playing away from home in the last 5 games both of them have seen o2.5G and btts in 5/5**, it's just when its the other way around (Utd at home and Leeds away from home) when it doesn't work. So i'm going to take the risk and trust that my read on these stats its correct. Also, seems like Bruno Fernandes is injured and won't play so yeah that kinda sucks since he is very important for Utd but i mean, when you've got these stats you just have to jump on it honestly and Utd has other good players like Cunha, Mbeumo, Casemiro, Diallo that can score so yeah i'm taking the risk. Again guys, if you want to play it safer just take btts yes or o1.5g which is even safer. Good luck to anyone that joins me on this bet, let's make it three in a row.",

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 6-22-3 *The Catalan derby certainly didn't disappoint. I swear some of the things that happened yesterday hadn't even been invented, like Joan Garcia pushing his own defender to the ground to make him block a shot. Don't get me started on the Barca defenders tackling each other, leaving the Espanyol attacker 1 on 1 with the keeper who damn near defied gravity to push the ball away after seemingly being dribbled already, or the goal line clearance. I don't even know how Barcelona survived all those attacks. Even then with the score being 0-0 deep into the second half, the bet looked safe. Except it really wasn't, as the footballing gods decided the fun wasn't quite over yet and allowed not one, but* ***two*** *late Barcelona goals, with the final fluke-ish Lewandowski shot coming in the (yep, you've guessed it) 90th minute, to win the game 2-0 and slap another loss on my record*\n\n**Last Five:** ❌❌❌❌❌\n\n**Event:** LaLiga, Real Madrid v Real Betis, 10:15 am EST\n\n**POTD:** Real Betis +1.0, +1.5 Asian Handicap -122, 1.5 units\n\n**Write Up:** While Real Madrid sit second in LaLiga, their **form has been patchy at best,** and downright worrying at worst. Not only are their results very hot and cold, their gameplay is dull, constantly failing to break down the opposing defences by playing uncreative, recycled football. They have **multiple players occupying the same position in attack** and applying **wrong profiles** to certain positions (like forcing Arda Guler to stay deep or Jude Bellingham to be the main creative outlet, which really doesn't play to their strengths). Xabi's substitutions and tactical tweaks don't make sense half the time either *(who thought it'd be a good idea to play Fran Garcia on the wing and to push Carreras into the center?).* All in all, they just don't play pleasing, nor effective football atm *(at least they could grind out results under Ancelotti).* To make matters worse, they head into this clash without several key players, including **Dani Carvajal, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Eder Militao and the influential Kylian Mbappé**, weakening both defence and attack. These are not minor absences, they disrupt the already questionable Madrid’s spine and reduce their ability to exploit organised defences, such as the one of their very next opponent.\n\nReal Betis, meanwhile, arrive in **good form,** having ended 2025 with a banging 4-0 win over tricky Getafe (that caused a lot of issues to Real Madrid even with just 9 men on the field) and **three wins in their last four matches across competitions.** Their only real issue this season has been too many draws *(oh would I take that today),* not poor performances, with **Betis losing just three LaLiga games all season long.** That resilience is precisely why the +1.0, +1.5 Asian Handicap, where even a narrow defeat still gives us the dub makes sense.\n\nThe H2H also supports this angle. **Betis actually beat Madrid 2-1 in March 2025 and four of their last seven league meetings have ended in draws.** Add to that Betis’ ability to stay compact and hard to break down and the chances of Real Madrid winning comfortably reduce greatly. Now add to that the leaky Madrid defence that's more than capable of the occasional error, especially when physicality is involved (we saw how Atletico, Liverpool, and Celta bullied them) and Betis grabbing a couple goals and shutting Madrid out doesn't seem like a far fetched scenario. And this time, Madrid won't have Mbappe bailing them out.\n\nBetis are a good team, they're **pushing for a Champions League spot** and they'll be looking to take advantage of the shakey Madrid side without Mbappe. I unsuccessfully faded one of the El Clasico sides yesterday, but I really believe I'll have more luck with the other one. BOL and let's enjoy some more LaLiga madness ☘️🫡",

I just didn't feel like handicapping ITFs in December, but tour-level tennis has now returned with ATP and WTA events already starting Down Under. \n\nIt's always hard to predict how Frances Tiafoe will look after some time off from the tour, but he's undoubtedly the more talented player in this matchup. Tiafoe chose to end his season in early October after losing to Yannick Hanfmann in Shanghai, which might give him a small rest advantage over Vukic (who played up until the last ATP events of the year). During this time, Tiafoe shook up his team and played a couple exhibitions to stay in tennis shape, as he looks to get off to a strong start in 2026. Vukic is one of those guys who hung around the bottom of the ATP Tour in 2025, and while he performed quite well in Australia last year, I'm not sure he can replicate it this time around. I feel that Tiafoe is a bit underrated in Australia, as his powerful serve and high-spin forehand can do a lot of damage in these lively conditions. Sure, he's always had more success on American hard courts, but the motivation really seems to be there for him this year. Both players tend to drive their backhands flat, but Tiafoe has a greater ability to place the ball off that wing. It's true that Vukic's serve might keep this close on the scoreboard, but this handicap is most likely too small for him to cover just by holding serve.",

Units: 1.50 \n\nPick: Winner halftime/final (excluding OT) Bills / Bills || 2u at -145 on Bet MGM || NY Jets at Buffalo Bills 4:25pm ET \n\nEven by Jet standards, this current NYJ roster is grim. Breece Hall is out and the defense has gone 16 games without forcing an interception. The Jets have the opportunity to be the only team to go an entire season without an interception. The defense is getting gashed on the ground allowing 135.0 rushing yards per game. They allow the 3rd highest points against per game at 29.3 points, and that's not to be outdone by offense averaging the 5th worst points scored per game at 18.3 points. The fact that the Jets don't have the worst record in the league is an insult to sports. Here's the last 4 losses and spread against the Jets:\n\n- NE -13 at Jets (Final score: 42-10)\n- Jets at NO -6.5 (Final score: 29-6)\n- Jets at JAX -14 (Final score: 48-20)\n- MIA -2.5 at Jets (Final score: 34-10)\n\nAFC playoff picture is far from set and the Buffalo Bills are locked into wild card tie with LA Chargers (4:25pm ET vs Broncos) and Houston Texans (1:00pm ET vs IND Colts). If the Bills lose, they will stay in 7th but can move up to 6th or 5th place with LA or HOU losses. Buffalo will be looking to win and build momentum ahead of the playoffs. Expect the starters and a few serious offensive drives from the Bills, but it's a real possibility they pull starters in the 2nd half. Either due to a lead against the Jets, or due to the results from HOU game at 1pm and LA game at 4:45pm. This makes me weary of player props. Buffalo's defensive weakness is allowing 140.4 rushing yards per game but without Breece Hall, I doubt the Jets put together a ton of offense. The Bill's passing defense does allow a league low 163.4 passing yards per game. Bills have had slow starts and only led once at halftime in the last 4 weeks. But the Jets tell another story, losing at half the last 4 weeks:\n\n- NE 35-3 NYJ \n- NO 9-6 NYJ\n- JAX 31-10 NYJ\n- MIA 24-7 NYJ\n\nI'm seeing lower odds on FD and DK for this. Could parlay 1H winner with Buffalo spread for higher payout. BOL",

Odds were +180 at the time I placed it, already down to +155. \nLe Havre are scraping by in 15th place with the worst attack in the league; team is in a brutal form right now: they haven t scored a single goal in the last four league games, and have been winless going way back. (Not to mention some of their players are  missing the match due to participation in the AFCON)\n\nAngers, meanwhile, are 10th and have been proper hot lately – 4 wins in the last 5 league matches, including a solid 1-0 away against struggling Nice and 4-1 domination against Nantes right before the break. A few players missing there due to AFCON too, but still - Angers have shown real depth during this streak and look way more organized and threatening on the counter and honestly, that’s just the stronger side in the matchup and it would be criminal not to back them. The double chance is a nice alternative (-120) as well. I’m also backing Amine Sbai to have 1+ SOT at even odds. \n\nP.S. Doubt anyone's tailing my first few picks, but I'll keep posting these for a bit and hopefully build some momentum 😀",

Should not have backed this West Ham team, should have stuck with the original Villa -1 play I had in the soccer thread. We move on. \n\nHuge slate today and we're targeting the biggest games of the week as 3rd place Man City host 5th place Chelsea. City need a bounce back to stay in the title race and Chelsea are in a bit of turmoil after having sacked their coach a few days ago. This chaos brings risk and opportunity. \n\nYou guys already know how much I love this play. We've cashed it 4 times here, pretty much every time we've played it (other than one where he did not start randomly and most got voided). With Caicedo suspended for this game, I don't see him being left off the pitch. He should start in midfield next to Reece James, who likes to play further back in defense, which opens up Enzo to crash the box as he does so well. \n\nEnzo has had a SOT in his last 10/12 where he started, two of those were without Caicedo on the pitch. I took a bit of a break in playing this while Palmer came back to the team and lineups adjusted, but am feeling great that Enzo is back to his shooting form, after scoring a goal last week vs Bournemouth. \n\nWe are getting such good odds here because Man City give up the 2nd fewest SOTs in the EPL behind Arsenal at just over 3 per game. That combined with the instability and new coach create the risk. However, Chelsea average almost 5 SOTs per game and control possession much better than most teams. I do not expect the new coach to change much in the playstyle just yet, he hasn't had enough time. I really dont think City will stop then from getting shots off, and I expect this game to have a fair few goals. \n\nBOL and have a great Sunday!",

And just like I said it wouldn't surprise me if they manage to win vs a weak West Ham \n\nArsenal managed to win their game. It was a bit closer than I would have preferred but I never doubted this Arsenal squad \n\n**Write Up:** \n\nVery similar bet as yesterday \n\nFulham love to score 1+ goals at home. Scoring in 8/9 home games this season, only failing to do so versus league leaders Arsenal. They've scored 5/5 times in the L5 games and also scoring 4 at home vs Man City \n\nLiverpool have played away from home 9 times so far, conceding in 7 of those games. Only managing to keep a clean sheet against Burnley & West Ham who both are bottom three as home teams this season \n\nI don't like to take historic records into account as it isn't that relevant in my opinion. But for those who do prefer it, Liverpool last kept a clean sheet away at Fulham in 2009. In the last 11 home games Fulham managed to score at least once against Liverpool. Including last year where Fulham won 3-2 against the eventual champions. An upset win by Fulham tomorrow wouldn't be the craziest thought either \n\nChelsea have just parted ways with their coach, which is not the best way to start the year. They'll also miss Caicedo due to disciplinary points and possibly Cucurella to a hamstring strain. They do have depth in the squad but these players will definitely be missed \n\nMan City has won 8 straight home games since losing to Spurs at the very start of the season and I don't see how that should change. Last 5 home games in the league they have scored 15 times and conceded 3 times \n\nPep Guardiola also has some injuries and unavailabilities within the squad to deal with but the depth of his squad more than makes up for the absentees \n\nAgain, not my cup of tea but H2H Man City is also 4-1-0 at home vs Chelsea in recent years. Including a 3-1 victory in january 2025 \n\nAlso not extremely relevant but a fun extra stat: Michael Oliver being the referee could have a minor impact too. Since 20/21 he has refereed 13 Chelsea away games of which they have lost 6. He has refereed 14 Man City home games of which they have won 11 \n\nBOL everyone!",

Atlético Madrid sit 4th in La Liga with 11 wins, 4 draws, and 3 losses, demonstrating consistent form against both top and mid-table opponents. Real Sociedad are struggling in 16th place with 4 wins, 5 draws, and 8 losses, including several narrow defeats at home, highlighting inconsistency and vulnerability against stronger sides. Atlético have scored an average of 1.83 goals per match while conceding just 0.89, reflecting a well-balanced combination of offensive efficiency and defensive discipline. Sociedad average 1.24 goals scored per match and concede 1.47, indicating defensive weaknesses that are amplified by recent absences.\n\nInjuries and suspensions heavily impact Sociedad’s lineup: key players out include defenders Iñaki Rupérez, Clément Lenglet, suspended Igor Zubeldia and Jon Gorrotxategi, while midfielders Yangel Herrera and Ander Barrenetxea are also unavailable. Nicolás González is doubtful, further reducing attacking options. This significantly weakens Sociedad’s ability to maintain structure and transition into attack. Atlético, in contrast, appear fully fit and benefit from tactical stability under Simeone, particularly in away matches where they prioritize defensive solidity while exploiting counter-attacks.\n\nHome advantage for Sociedad is mitigated by Atlético’s strong away form. Sociedad’s home record this season includes wins over Mallorca and Sevilla, but losses to Girona and Villarreal, highlighting inconsistency even at home. Atlético Madrid have consistently scored in almost every away match while conceding very few goals, maintaining disciplined defensive lines. Historical head-to-head also favors Atlético, who have dominated Sociedad in recent La Liga encounters.\n\nConsidering form, injuries, tactical discipline, defensive efficiency, and historical data, the projected outcome heavily favors Atlético Madrid. Realistic scorelines cluster between 1-0 and 2-1, with Atlético controlling the pace and exploiting Sociedad’s weakened defense. This makes Atlético Madrid the strongest, most data-backed pick, representing a disciplined, high-probability play rather than chasing a volatile result\n\n🍺 **If this one cashes, a beer is always appreciated:** [1 beer for a day](http://buymeacoffee.com/willjack)\n\n**BOL!!

I love you John Calipari and Acuff Jr. Close game until Acuff said enough was enough. \n\nEvent: NFL Cowboys @ Giants 12 pm CT \n\nPick: Cowboys -3.5 (-110) 2u\n\nDon’t you love watching two underperforming teams play football? Well I do and I love to bet em even more. Both of these teams are out of the playoffs already this year so there is no real benefit for the Cowboys to win this game. However, Dak Prescott made it very clear him and the team were gonna play for pride as the season has been a disappointment. \n\nMotivators for Dallas: \nWith a win, Dallas would bring their record to an overall .500, the team has not finished under .500 since 2000-2002 stretch. Jerry Jones is a prideful man, he is probably doing everything he can to continue that. Also, Dallas would finish 5-1 in the division with this win. Which would be a huge confidence boost going into next season. Eberflus (DC coordinator) is basically coaching for his job in this one. He was a disappointment in Chicago as the HC and has been terrible calling this defense this year. He will be pulling out everything he has to have a respectable end of the season. Just in case he has to plead his case for another team to hire him if the cowboys let him go. \n\nReasons for NYG to lose: \nI mean come on, it’s pretty obvious. They sit at the 2nd best chance to get the #1 pick going into Sunday (Behind the raiders of course). They are tied with 3 other teams with a 3-13 record. And due to their strength of schedule they would claim a higher pick than all of those teams in a tiebreaker. The players/coaches are preaching that everyone will be playing and going all out. Do you really believe that? The owner would be crucified by fans for winning a pointless game and ruining their chances for the 1st or 2nd pick. I believe NY will play hard to get quality reps heading into next season but I do not believe they are prioritizing a win in this matchup. \n\nThe Cowboys have won the last 9 matchups between these two teams. In the last 9 matchups, the cowboys have an average win margin of 15.67 points. They absolutely dominate this team on a regular basis. BOL",

In the previous H2H matchup against the Colts, Fairbairn was 2-2. In the previous 7 vs the Colts, he has hit this line 5 times. He averages 3 FGA per game this year. Texans head coach DeMeco Ryans has already stated he plans to play all of his starters tomorrow. The Colts will be starting rookie QB Riley Leonard tomorrow, so I expect the Texans defense to make him see ghosts, which in turn leads to more posessions for the Texans on offense. If Fairbairn attempts only 2 field goals, he should make them. Tomorrow's game will also be played inside NRG Stadium which is a dome. NFL kickers historically have better FG% indoors than outdoors. Additionally, kickers have made 2+ field goals against the Colts in 6 straight. BOL\n\n*This bet may also be listed as Houston Texans Over 1.5 Made Field Goals.*",

The Rams have lost 2 games in a row & have dropped out of the race to win the 1st round bye in the NFC. They will finish as either the 5 or 6 seed in the NFC Playoffs. If the Seahawks beat the 49ers on Saturday night then the Rams can finish 5th if they win this game. But regardless of the outcome there is potential the Rams bring in their 2nd stringers. As for the Cardinals, they have lost 8 games in a row & are obviously out of the playoffs. Having been down every game, Arizona has been slinging it & that should continue this week. \n\nArizona has lost 8 straight games with a league worst -126 point differential over that span. This has led to Cardinals QB Jacoby Brissett throwing the ball more than any other team in the league. __Brissett is averaging 41.2 passes per game.__ This week he will be without his WR1 Marvin Harrison Jr who the Cardinals just placed on IR. Harrison has missed 4 games this season.

The Bowling Green Falcons are facing off against who I believe is the worst FBS football team this year as the Minutemen have been blown out in every single game they have played and with a 0-11 record they have not even beat an FCS team as they lost to FCS Bryant on their home field. This Minutemn team is bad on both sides of the ball as they rank second to last in the FBS in scoring offense with only 10 points per game and bottom five in scoring defense allowing 38 points per game. The rush game on offense and defense is what really kills this Minutemen team as they only average 83 rushing yards per game while giving up over 216 rushing yards per game. I believe this huge weakness on defense plays into the Falcons game plan well as they are a run first team so I expect them to pound the rock a lot in this one and find success doing so. I also like the Western Michigan Broncos in this one as they have a lot to play for in this one as if they win this game they are heading to the MAC championship as well as taking home the Michigan MAC rivalry trophy. This Broncos team has one of the best rushing attacks in the conference averaging over 180 rush yards a game and they face a rush defense that is even rated worse than the Minutemen giving up over 225 rushing yards per game so I think dual threat quarterback Broc Lowry and runningback Jalen Buckley will find success running through this Eagles defense. In contrast, the Broncos have a great defense and is one of the best defenses in the conference and even the nation in passing defense as they rank eighth in the nation with just 160 pass yards allowed on average per game and 16th in FBS in scoring allowing just 18 points per game. Western Michigan has been great in conference play this year winning seven out of their past eight games and I am even impressed about the game this team played earlier on in the year against North Texas where they played a great offensive game against a very solid ranked North Texas team and lost a close one in overtime. On the other hand, this eastern Michigan squad has not played well at all against teams at .500 or better with losses in every game against all of those teams and they even have a loss against FCS Long Island so I believe that the Broncos team outmatches this Eagles team.\n\nPrediction: 28-17 Falcons, 30-24 Broncos\n\nLast pick:🏈Vanderbilt ML/Texas ML💰Love a good no sweat winner like that!!\n\nBest of luck to everyone tailing and remember to bet responsibly! Lets get this Thanksgiving holiday week started off nice with some MACtion!! 🍀💜🐲\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ty3u4f3otb3g1.jpeg?width=1053&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5d27fd7e9b1f4c557d93e18531195ef3d6e5f6e0",

In 9 competitive matches at home this season, they've won 7 and drawn 2. In both home Champions League matches they won, including a surprise 1-0 upset over Liverpool. Yes they are missing star striker Victor Osimhen, but this team has more than enough firepower to create chances and score goals. I expect them to score 2+ and continue to cruise in home matches.

IF TENNESSEE CAN WEATHER A SLOW, PHYSICAL WAR AND MAKE A FEW BIG PLAYS LATE, THEY’RE WELL POSITIONED TO STAY WITHIN 3 TO 4 POINTS.

      "text": "Record: 165-137, +4.1 units\n\nLast Pick: Oleg Prihodko ML vs Bernabe Zapata Miralles (-193, 1 unit): Win\n\nTennis | Bogotá Challenger | 2:10 PM EST (estimated)\n\nToday's Pick: Sebastian Gima vs Nicolas Mejia | **Mejia to win 2-0 at +100 (DK). 1 unit.**\n\nWrite-up: I can't even say what the closing line was on that pick, because pretty much every book took it down before the match. Not sure if there's any sort of suspicious betting activity around those players, but it was quite a strange sight. Either way, Prihodko was able to come back from a tough first set and finish the match with a 6-0 third set. \n\nToday, I'm moving over to the Bogotá Challenger, one of two clay-court events in the final week of the CH season. The city sits at over 3000 meters of elevation, meaning that these courts play a bit faster than your average clay, and players who can handle altitude will have a significant advantage. \n\nNicolas Mejía comes into this tournament as the No. 2 seed and highest-ranked home player in the draw. He will be making his sixth appearance here in Bogota (though all of those events were held at different times in the year); meanwhile, this is Gima's first time playing in the city. Mejia is a bit of an altitude specialist, with two of his six CH finals and one of his two titles coming at over 3000 meters of elevation. He also won a title on green clay, which tends to play a bit faster than usual (similar to altitude clay), earlier this year. Mejia will be coming into this event with two full weeks of rest, while Gima makes the trek from Guayaquil, Ecuador (which sits at just 13 m). \n\nHow much tread a player has on their tires is super important at this time of year, and I believe that Mejia, who has only played three indoor hard events in the US in the past month, should be better situated in that regard. While he didn't perform especially well in those events, he did at least take a set off Murphy Cassone in Knoxville, and will be happy to return to his favorite surface. Gima may benefit to some degree from all the clay-court tennis he's been playing, but he hasn't exactly been performing well in those events, as he took just three games off Andres Andrade in his most recent outing. To be fair, Andrade was a -455 favorite, but that brings up the question of why Mejia's ML should only be at -260 here. I believe that Mejia and Andrade are playing at similar levels right now, and both closed at similar odds against Juan Bautista Torres in Cali.\n\nIn terms of playing style, Gima possesses an aggressive lefty game, but I believe that Mejia has the more stable backhand and superior serve. Mejia also has been solid against lefties on clay this year, with two wins and one three-set loss (close to even money in all three matches). Overall, I'm happy to back the home favorite to come through without much trouble against a slumping clay-courter with much less altitude experience. \n\nNote: The [POTD Capper Tracker](https://potd.lol), which you may remember from its Google Sheet days, is finally back in a cleaner, more robust website format!

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 7-4 (Avg Odds +113)\n\n**Previous Pick:** Iliman Ndiaye 1+ SOT (+105) ❌️\n\n**Today's Event:** UEFA Champions League | Chelsea vs Barcelona (12:00 PM PST)\n\n**Pick:** Enzo Fernandez 1+ SOT (+100) 1 unit to win 1 units\n\n**Write Up:** So I've never seen that before. A 13 minute red card for an Everton player slapping his own teammate. Obviously this really gutted our chances as Ndiaye shifted to a quasi-right back and Everton saw very little of the ball. Bummer too because he had a great chance early and was looking sharp. Fun fact, that was the 3rd time in Premier league history a player has been sent off for hitting a teammate. 3 times in 33 years. Anyways enough harping on that, on to the next. \n\nIn other news...guys...they're giving us Enzo 1+ SOT at plus money again. We've cashed this twice already in the last month and all of the same stats/data/feelings apply. \n\nOff we go back to London where Chelsea hosts Barcelona in the Champions League match of the week. As you all know, Barcelona is a great team. However, they have been leaky defensively over the last few matches, particularly in UCL, notably conceding 3 goals (6 SOT) to Brugge in their last CL match and 7 SOT to an injury ridden PSG. Both teams will want a win here, but I like Chelsea to show up here in front of their home crowd. \n\nThe caveat here is that **there is a non-zero chance that coach rotates some players** around for this mid week match as he has been known to do, but I really can't see him leaving out Enzo for a match this big. Even if he does come in as a sub, he will want to make an impact quickly and go for goal. \n\nIn case you want more #s, this has hit in his last 2/2 UCL matches (including the last match where he came on as a sub) and in his last 6/6 EPL matches (averaging 3 shots per game, just under 2 on target). \n\n**UCL and Europa matches are tough to predict**, squads get rotated, flukes happen, so mind your units. But I like our guy here again in this huge match, and I'm riding the Enzo train until the wheels fall off. BOL if tailing!",

But let's not get depressed because of that and I got another one coming here. Here is the reasoning for my pick: \n\nIf we look at the stats, this matchup is in Galatasaray’s favour. Their great attacking, strong defensive team play in past couple of weeks and UNBEATEN home record give them a clear edge. Union SG’s defensive unreliability, combined with their inconsistent away form, increases the difficulty of their mission to win or take points in Istanbul.\n\nGalatasaray are currently one of the hottest home sides across Europe - unbeaten in nine straight matches - and they are well-positioned to extend their Champions League winning streak to FOUR consecutive games.\n\nFew reasons why I expect that Galatasaray Will win:\n\nGalatasaray has three consecutive wins in last 3 rounds of UCL and are still unbeaten on home soil this whole season, with a record of NINE MATCHES WITHOUT A DEFEAT ACROSS ALL COMPETITIONS! Thats a crazy stat IMO! Also to add, USG has three back to back losses on UCL this season.\n\n**Pick: Galatasaray to Win.**\n\n\nBOL, let,s turn the record to 1-1! \n\nps. sorry if the text is not perfect in english, english is not my native language.",

Just a brutal lack of concentration and effort.\n\n**New Event:**  UCL Man City vs Leverkusen & Marseille vs Newcastle\n\n**Pick:**  Man City -1 Asian Handicap  & Newcastle Double Chance @ 1.80 (Usual 3 units)\n\n**WARNING:**  DO NOT TAIL ME.  I am on 3 game losing streak on POTD. \n\n**Leg 1 :  Manchester City -1 Asian Handicap vs Leverkusen**\n\n* City lost to Newcastle this past weekend by 2-1 in a fantastic match and are looking to bounce back strong and with good reason.\n* City are 23-0 home games without defeat in the Champions League league phase/group stage - winning 20 of them.\n* City have found the back of the net at least twice in each of their seven straight wins at the Etihad.\n* Earlier this month City beat Dortmund by 4-1 in a match with similar circumstances.\n* Leverkusen’s team is riddled with injuries and suspensions making this a lopsided affair favoring City.\n* Erling Haaland faced Leverkusen 4 times during his Dortmund days and scored 4 goals against them.\n\n**Leg 2 – Newcastle Double Chance vs Marseille**\n\n* Newcastle are riding high off a tremendous win against City this past weekend.\n* Newcastle have lost only twice in their last 13 Champions League away matches.\n* Marseille have not won a single match of their last 12 matches against English teams. \n* Marseille have many injuries and one suspension whereas Newcastle’s starting 11 against Man City should take the field.\n\nOnce again, all I can do is take the teams in better form and with higher probabilities of giving us a win.  It seems is has not been happening for me lately but fortune has not been kind to many others on POTD either.\n\nGamble responsibly please and enjoy yourselves. ",

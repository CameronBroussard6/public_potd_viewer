Roma double chance (win or draw)\n\nToday’s Pick: Tottenham Most Corners v Sunderland \n\nSport: Premier League \n\nReasoning: Tottenham average 5.2 corners per game vs Sunderland’s 3.5, and they also edge possession (50.6% vs 42.1%), which drives territory and pressure. At home against a low-block Sunderland side, that edge usually converts into a higher corner count rather than goals.\n\nOdds: 8/13\n\nUnits: 2-4\n\n[Beers appreciated 🍺](https://www.paypal.com/ncp/payment/833MDWKA7GUVA)",

Chelsea have shown improvement but remain vulnerable defensively against elite sides, especially away from home. City’s depth, pressing intensity, and ability to score in bunches make them well suited to cover a one goal handicap here. With motivation high and quality across every line, I expect City to dictate the tempo and win by a clear margin.\n\nGood Luck! ✌️",

Definitely could've hit 11 vs 11 but we move. FT Lille 0-2 Rennes\n\n**Event**: EPL (Soccer) - Man City vs Chelsea (17:30 GMT)\n\n**Today's Pick:** Man City win + over 2.5 goals @ 2.00 (1 unit)\n\n**Write Up:** Today we are picking the biggest game of the day in the Premier League as **3rd place Manchester City host 5th place and now managerless Chelsea**. Following Enzo Marseca's dismissal on January 1st, Chelsea will now travel to the Etihad with their assistant manager at the helm who has **never managed a game before** and is up against **Pep who has managed over 1000**. There is always a chance Chelsea show up today with a point to prove but with talk about discontent over the sacking of Maresca I can't see today being one of those days.\n\nThis one was already a daunting trip for Chelsea as they face a Man City team who are out for blood specifically that of Arsenal who they are chasing in 1st place to reclaim their Premier League title having lost it to Liverpool last year. **City are the most in form team in the league** at the moment **winning 5 of their last 6** and only drawing last time out to a determined Sunderland outfit away at the Stadium of Light. The Blue side of Manchester also have a formidable home record which is **3rd best in the league** as they have **won 8 of the 9** games they have played there only losing back in August to their bogey team Spurs. Across these games they have **scored 25 goals** and **conceded only 6** at their home ground, numbers bettered only by Arsenal. Overall City are **scoring 2.39 goals** per game and **conceding 0.94** with these numbers rising and dropping respectively to **2.78 and 0.67** when playing on home turf. They've also **scored 17 goals in their last 6 games** and are finding the net for fun at the moment, scoring **3+ goals in 7 of their 8 wins** at home this season only missing that stat in one game where they **scored 2**.\n\nChelsea will be looking for any kind of positive heading to Manchester today as they have only picked up **6 points from their last 6 games**, being **winless in 3** and only recording **1 win in their last 7** in the league. Their away form is something to cling to as they have **won 3 of their last 6 away games** although these were the first 3 of these last 6 games, having drawn and lost the most recent 3. Overall though this season the Blues are the **6th best travelers** in the Premier League and they have had some tough away days having travelled to Old Trafford, Elland Road, The City Ground and St James Park. Despite this, they have fared ok having only **lost twice**, to Manchester United and Leeds. The Etihad should however be a massive step up in the quality of opposition they will be facing. Away from home this season Chelsea are **scoring 1.68 per gam**e and **conceding 1.11**. Another huge miss today for Chelsea is Caicedo who is suspended following a yellow card against Bournemouth last time out.\n\nAs for the goals, Man City have hit over 2.5 goals by themselves in **7/9 of their home games** and over 2.5 has hit in **67% of Chelsea's away games**. I don't see a managerless Chelsea outfit being able to withstand the City pressure at the Etihad and I'm expecting a scoreline around 3-0 or 3-1 as the Cityzens continue their pursuit of Arsenal knowing that a slip today will be incredibly damaging to their title hopes.\n\nBOL if you're tailing and BOL with all of your other bets today.",

Coming back in style with this play as I see huge value on this odds. Anton Stach averages 1.7 fouls per 90 this season and has hit this mark against most of the top teams (Chelsea, Liverpool, Arsenal etc) and has hit 3 of the last 6 games. Leeds vs Man Utd is one of the biggest rivalries in the UK, and I expect both teams to be on the front foot and play semi-aggressively. Expect Stach to pick up at least 2 fouls in this game as he is up against the likes of Cunha who gets fouled 1.9 pr game on avg. \n\nMax bet as my comeback bet. GL and BOL if tailing.",

City has always been a bogey team for Chelsea and with their main coach being fired things are not looking good. I've seen that the U21 coach of Chelsea will take over for the meantime, this will be nowhere near the tactics of Guardiola.\n\nOnto the stats. City started the season slow but have picked up the pace since. On the road they have not looked well but at Etihad they are on a crazy run. At home they are #3 with a 8-0-1 record and a 25:6 goal diff. Chelsea on the road are 6th but 4-3-2 with a 17:10. On the H2H side City are 8-2-0 in their last 10 meetings w Chelsea.\n\nWhat makes me more confident for this pick is that Caicedo is suspended, again... x) I rate him as one of the best midfielders in the prem and without him Chelsea will have the ball significantly less. Difficult game for Chelsea here.",

      "text": "POTD Record: 0-0-0 (W/L/P)\n\nPlay:\nSevilla ML + Morocco ML & Morocco Over 1.5 Team Goals (+143, Bet365)\n\nSevilla ML\nSevilla have dominated this matchup, winning all five recent H2H meetings, including a 3-2 away win and a 5-3 home win in the last two. They rank 6th in the league for goals scored and face a Levante side plagued by defensive issues, having conceded 29 goals this season. Levante are also without their top scorer Eyong, which further tilts the matchup in Sevilla’s favor. It’s hard to see any outcome here other than a Sevilla win here\n\nMorocco ML / Over 1.5 Team Goals\nMorocco are among the AFCON favorites and have consistently dominated this opponent, with recent results of 1-0, 2-0, 3-0, and 2-0. They boast the best defense in the tournament and typically control possession with a well organized disciplined setup. Tanzania have conceded in nine straight matches, and once Morocco break through, the game should open up. Tanzania will be forced to push forward, leaving space to be punished by Morocco’s relentless attacking waves\n\nBOL 🤞",

Levante allow the second most number of goals per game in the league and I would expect Sevilla to score at least twice here, while Levante most likely remains scoreless. Sevilla has a massive H2H advantage here (W8 and D1 in the last 9), as well as the fact that Levante are winless in their last 8 games, Sevilla should dominate this one.",

      "text": "Record : 26-20-2\n\nNet units:(+ 1.09 units)\n\nLast pick: Dylan Harper Over 13.5 Points (-110) Hard Rock Bet❌ \n💀💀💀2-12, I’ve should’ve went with castle 7.5 ast or even Donovan clingan P+R , overthinking will always be my enemy. that’s why confidence is KEY 🔑  treat every L as a lesson \nI finally understand that sport gambling feels like math + chess at the same time ( don’t overthink that)\n\n BIG TEST I’m doing with this (you guys can tail one or both or avoid both of them of are kinda inconsistent ) ,I’m going for underdog streak to $1,000 with my “yugi+atem strategy “  you need to two props to enter \n\nPick of the day : Michael Porter Jr. Over 25.5 Points (-115)  + Paolo Banchero Over 26.5 Points (-115) \n\n\nReason • : The Indiana Pacers are currently on an 11-game losing streak and have the 29th-ranked scoring defense in the league (allowing 119.3 PPG). With Franz Wagner still sidelined, Paolo’s usage rate is at a career high, and he is coming off back-to-back performances of 29 and 31 points. Indiana lacks the size to stop his \"bully-ball\" style in the paint.\n\nScenario A. The \"Bully-Ball\" Domination\nIndiana’s defense is exhausted from their losing streak. Paolo gets to the free-throw line 10+ times and scores at least 15 points in the first half. He cruises past 27 points midway through the 4th quarter as the Magic play keep-away to secure the win.\n\nScenario B: The Blowout Protector\nOrlando jumps out to a 20-point lead early. Paolo is the engine behind that lead, scoring 22 points in the first three quarters. Even if he sits the final 6 minutes of the 4th, his aggressive start against a depleted Indiana frontcourt (missing Obi Toppin) gets him over the line.\n\nScenario C The \"Chess\" Trap (Pacers Adjust)\nIndiana throws double-teams at Paolo early or poor shooting ,Instead of forcing shots, he racks up assists (Scenarios where he might go \"Under\"). However, because Indiana is so weak at the rim, even a \"bad\" shooting night for Paolo usually ends with 24-25 points, putting us right at the hook.\n\n\n-\nHead-to-Head: Paolo dropped 29 on Indiana exactly 4 days ago.\nVolume: He is averaging 30 PPG over his last 20 games without Franz Wagner.\n Math: Indiana allows the 4th most points to starting Power Forwards this season.\n\nProp 2: Michael Porter Jr. Over 25.5 Points\n\nReason: MPJ is averaging 25.8 PPG as the Nets' primary scoring option and has cleared this line in 80% of his last five games. Facing his former team (Nuggets) for the first time—who are currently playing without Jokic—gives him both the motivation and the defensive mismatch to go nuclear.\n\nScenario A (The Revenge Masterclass):\nMPJ comes out aggressive, hitting three triples in the first quarter. Denver’s perimeter defenders (Peyton Watson/Christian Braun) struggle to contest his high release. He finishes with 30+ points in a highly emotional performance.\n\nScenario B (The Volume Grind):\nIt’s a close, back-and-forth game. Because the Nets lack other elite scorers, MPJ takes 20+ shots. Even if he shoots poorly, his sheer volume of attempts and trips to the free-throw line against a Jokic-less paint gets him to 26 late in the game.\n\nScenario C (The Overthinker's Trap):\nDenver's coach David adelman , knows MPJ's game perfectly and sends aggressive double-teams to get the ball out of his hands. (This is the only way he stays under, but with Denver's current depth issues, they may not have the personnel to execute this for 48 minutes).\n\n\n * Season Avg: 25.8 PPG (Higher than the 25.5 line).\n * Last 5: Over in 4 out of 5 games.\n * Opponent: Denver is bottom-10 in points allowed without their starting center.\n\nA pondering thought i had is cam Thomas is back but he was off the bench,interesting…\nCam Thomas is a massive part of the \"Chess\" match here. Dat boi Cam has been coming off the bench recently. Since returning from his hamstring injury on December 27th, he has played three games, all as a reserve. Even though he’s technically a \"bench\" player right now, his impact is still starter-level , The Stagger (The Coach's Chess Move) the nets coach Jordi Fernandez has been staggering their minutes. Typically, MPJ starts and plays heavy minutes with the first unit. Cam Thomas comes in to lead the second unit. This means they aren't always competing for the ball at the same time.\nThe Defensive Focus: When they are on the floor together, Cam Thomas is such a dangerous isolation scorer that the defense has to respect him. This often leaves MPJ—who is a much taller, \"catch-and-shoot\" threat—with more wide-open looks.",

We are going back to the beginning of the journey for pick number 20, with a Steelers +/u combo.\n\nThese are wars between these coaches, and with both having their jobs potentially on the line, we are going to lean into their history a bit: **The underdog is 25-7-3 ATS when Mike Tomlin takes on John Harbaugh**, & specifically from our perspective, **as an underdog against the Ravens, Mike Tomlin is 14-4-2 ATS**.\n\nTo add to this, (since 2015) **17/22 games between these two has had a final margin of 7 or less points** I know we are playing +5.5, but that’s because a few of the games in that history skew the range.\n\nI like the under 49.5 points - In the last 11 meetings dating back to December 2020, **the under is 9-2 in those matchups**.\n\n*Despite it going over last game*, there **hasn’t been consecutive games go over the total in the same season since 2019**. Even the last two were 49 and 51 points alone in an anomaly of form. **Prior to that, no game cleared 40 points in 9/10.**\n\nThese teams study film. There’s gonna be a lot of running the ball, and an emphasis on short passing in this game: ***Rodgers is old, Lamar is hurt.***\n\nThere’s a *roadblock* but it’s quickly quashed. Under John Harbaugh, *the Ravens are 45-23 SU and 37-29-2 ATS when playing a game on any extended prep time* - BUT. when they have faced the Steelers in that span, **they are just 1-7 SU and 3-5 ATS in those games, including 0-5 SU since 2020**.\n\nSteelers +5.5 seems insanely safe for this reason alone.\n\nLamar Jackson has struggled vs. Pittsburgh in his career. **He is 3-5 SU and 2-6 ATS vs. Baltimore**, with just 11 pass TD and 10 INT in 10 games. In the regular season, Lamar is completing 57.4% of his passes vs. Steelers, **his lowest for any opponent with at least 3 games played**.\n\n*We figure this game will rely a lot on Derek Henry (who is in vintage form)*, but not having Lamar be able to play to full capacity potentially will impact Baltimore. **Pittsburgh have the 12th best run D by yards, but over the last 3 games they have a league best 52 yards allowed per game.**\n\nAnd, we don’t think Aaron Rodgers is gonna go down without a fight. Love him or hate him there’s a certain pride about him, *not having much of a receiving game will mean his decision making will be crucial*. I can’t see him making any mistakes he can control, which means a lot of trust on guys like Warren, Gainwell & Freiermuth. Rodgers has always had a certain swagger for prime time games, and with this potentially being his last, I expect him to rise to the occasion.\n\nLast play review:\n\nSan Francisco +2.5 (-110) 1.1u\n\n(Piss poor all around by the Niners, but the Seahawks D was fantastic… we’ve been on a bit of a cooler - even the wins have been a bit lucky the last few picks - I should have read the room when Vegas moved it from 1.5 to 2.5, Williams & Pearsall were dupes and I bit, but we move on!)\n\n***BOL if you’re tailing, and if not BOL in general.***",

I'd disagree. City have been doing well to secure results in games where the opposition has posed threat. We seen where they were this time last year. And if you want to mention form, have a look at Chelsea. They only have 2 wins in their last 8. To Everton and Cardiff, not exactly inspiring for a team who many had as title challengers after their CWC win. Now their manager has been sacked, there's a lot of confusion as to what is going on and you can only imagine how this would affect their players. They look to have their U21 manager Calum McFarlane in charge. And sorry if this is a bit presumptious. But I just cannot see Pep Guardiola losing to a first time interim manager. \n\nCaicedo and Cucurella are key players who will be missed for Chelsea while City will potentially have Rodri starting for the first time since October. Chelsea have had problems with an ever changing front line and between Delap, Pedro, Estevao, Neto, Garnacho there is no idea who will start never mind score. Palmer hasn't returned to his best. Compared to City who have discovered a fairly consistent threat in Cherki, Foden and Haaland. Doku looked very lively against Sunderland too. Chelsea have also not won in their last 11 meetings with City. That is 9 wins for City, 2 draws. There's only one winner here for me. City take another win to continue their title challenge.\n\n**Additional Thoughts**: From a high odds bet to a relatively low one. But hopefully the same result!",

This season has been a major disappointment for Detroit, eliminated from playoff contention after last season’s 15-2 finish. But there is no shortage of pride for this team, and they will be playing their starters with the intention to play spoiler against their division rival - a team they beat 52-21 earlier this season.\n\nThis is also a Chicago team that has Ben Johnson at the helm - Detroit’s offensive coordinator from last year. Dan Campbell has seen his former OC leave & thrive, elevating the Bears from misery to taking the reins at the top of NFC North. They’re playing with the 2 seed in the NFC up for grabs, currently tied with Philadelphia (Chicago has the tiebreaker so they win, it’s theirs). \n\nIn a lost season for Detroit, the championship aspirations still reside with the core in place & I have every reason to believe Dan Campbell is coaching these guys up like this is their Super Bowl. To finish above .500, prevent their all-too familiar foe from better seeding, & prove their core is worth retaining as murmurs of an offseason reset get louder - In my eyes, this is more than enough incentive. It also doesn’t hurt that the public is heavily in bed with Chicago for this game, & if anything has been consistent in this unpredictable season it’s that fading the public is a boon. Give me the pride of Campbell’s petty Lions with the +3.5. \n\nBut of course, what do I know?",

Joker is out, and the Nuggets have struggled without him, with that said, Denver can overcome his absence with their depth, Murray(GTD) can lead the scoring and playmaking, Gordon(GTD) handles rebounding and defense, and role players like Braun(GTD), and Peyton Watson have stepped up in past absences, helping maintain a positive net rating in some lineups. Against a Nets team on a three game losing streak, the Nuggets' overall talent should still shine through to win and cover.",

They have nothing to play for, but the Bears REALLY want to win this game to play the Packers in the first round of the playoffs. \n\n\nAdditionally, beyond just motivation and not trusting that the Lions will risk their stars' health, the Lions have absolutely fallen apart to end the year, losing 5/7 amd barely beating the horrendous Giants in overtime. While the Bears have been relying quite a bit on last minute miracles to win, they have been winning. With more to play for and lots of momentum, I think they handle the Lions at home. Maybe Campbell will put pride first and play his starters all out, in which case this will be a lot closer game than I expect; but even then, the Bears are playing much better football amd should clear the Lions by more than a field goal. ",

Hard to distinguish between conviction and degeneracy. This seemed too obvious for so many reasons and it paid off for many folks on POTD. Glad to help out as always, just wish I could help myself by making a sizable bet on my own convictions. However, the positive comments are enough.\n\n**New Event:**  EPL – Manchester City vs Chelsea & NFL – Browns vs Bengals\n\n**Pick:**  Manchester City ML (1.63) & Bengals ML (1.26) @ 2.04 (Usual 3 units)\n\n**Leg 1 – Man City to win vs Chelsea**\n\nCity host Chelsea in an incredibly important matchup since midweek they failed to win away at Sunderland in a goalless encounter. Meanwhile league leaders Chelsea pulled away with a win and now City must win this fixture to keep pace if they wish to make a run for the EPL title. City are well equipped to win as Doku should be making a return and otherwise have a strong healthy top squad.\n\nMeanwhile Chelsea have parted ways with their manager Maresca, who has only 2 wins in the last 7 EPL matches. Just not good enough for the top job at the prestigious club. Etihad Stadium, Man City's home turf, is not where anyone would want to head if they are winless in three league away games, but interim boss Calum McFarlane will be hoping for a miracle.  He has no choice.\n\nChelsea are ripe for the taking and City will surely not waste this chance. I am confident they will get the job done.\n\n**Leg 2 : Cincinnati Bengals to win vs Cleveland Browns**\n\nBoth teams are playing for nothing this postseason. On one hand the Browns just beat their arch rivals Pittsburgh Steelers last week and can end the season on that major positive note. On the other hand, the Bengals had much higher expectations for this season, but an injury to their starting QB Burrow, thwarted those plans.\n\nSince the return of Burrow a couple of weeks ago the team has looked incredibly capable. They are playing with confidence and will want to end the season on a positive note by beating their Ohio neighbors, the Browns, in the final game of the season in what should be a fun game to watch. These two teams can be expected to play carefree football, ProBowl style, in which case the more talented passing team, the Bengals should easily prevail as they have the better QB and receivers.\n\nThe spread is Bengals -7.5 but we are simply taking them at the Moneyline to boost our 1.63 return from the City pick.",

I expect with playoff implications on the line for Henry to clear this line which he has been relatively consistent with this season besides the stint on October/November.

Interim boss Calum McFarlane is expected to prioritise compactness and damage limitation against Manchester City, especially with Moisés Caicedo suspended — a huge loss given his role in screening the defence and controlling tempo. Without him, Chelsea are likely to spend long spells without the ball, defending deep and reacting rather than dictating, which historically drives up foul counts against Guardiola sides. Reece James, whether deployed centrally or at right-back, faces constant isolation against City’s rotating wide threats, a scenario that often leads to late challenges and tactical fouls. The appointment of Michael Oliver further sharpens the disciplinary angle: Oliver is among the Premier League referees most willing to punish persistent infringement and tactical fouling, particularly in matches involving high-possession sides where the defending team repeatedly breaks transitions. With Chelsea highly motivated to stay competitive, emotionally fragile after managerial upheaval, and structurally stretched in midfield, the conditions strongly point toward sustained defensive pressure and multiple booking scenarios.",

Shouldn't have been so hard to hit but we take it tho.\n\n**POTD**: Soccer/Football, Premier League, **Leeds vs Manchester Utd - O2.5G & BTTS YES** (2.05) 1u, 13:30 pm CET\n\n**Reasoning**:\n\nNow, for this pick i've been thinking a lot whether to choose o2.5G & btts yes or just btts yes. As i'm going to show you, the stats for btts are just better but the odds are just a bit lower from what i like (1.61) so i've decided to take a bit of a risk and put o2.5g because if both teams are able to score i can totally see it happening tbh. By far, both of these teams are two of the best teams to bet on having lots of goals in a game in the Premier League, especially in this situation. BUT, if you want to play it safer choose the btts yes pick. Now these are the stats backing up this pick:\n\nFor the btts:\n\nLeeds at home has seen btts in 7/9. (78%)\n\nMan Utd away from home has seen btts in 8/9. (89%)\n\nin the last 8 games (home/away) Leeds has seen btts in 7/8. (88%)\n\nin the last 8 games (home/away) Man Utd has seen btts in 6/8. (75%)\n\nLeeds at home hasn't had a clean sheet in 7/9 and only failed to score in 1 game.\n\nMan utd away from home hasn't had a clean sheet the entire season and only failed to score in 1 game\n\nBoth teams have lower than 20% on clean sheets and failed to score stats in the last 8 games.\n\nFor O2.5G:\n\nLeeds at home has seen O2.5G in 7/9. (78%)\n\nMan Utd away from home has seen O2.5G in 8/9. (89%)\n\nThis season, the average of goals for both teams is over 3 goals for both. More especifically, Leeds at home has an average of  3.22g and Man Utd away from home has an average of 3.44g.\n\nNow here comes the tricky part:\n\nin the last 8 games (home/away) Leeds has seen o2.5G in 5/8. (62%)\n\nin the last 8 games (home/away) Man Utd has seen o2.5G in 4/8. (50%)\n\nSo since this stats are not great i've checked it up and i saw that **when Leeds are playing at home and Utd is playing away from home in the last 5 games both of them have seen o2.5G and btts in 5/5**, **it's just when its the other way around (Utd at home and Leeds away from home) when it doesn't work.** So i'm going to take the risk and trust that my read on these stats its correct. Also, seems like Bruno Fernandes is injured and won't play so yeah that kinda sucks since he is very important for Utd but i mean, when you've got these stats you just have to jump on it honestly and Utd has other good players like Cunha, Mbeumo, Casemiro, Diallo that can score so yeah i'm taking the risk. So yeah, o2.5G & btts it's the pick. Again guys, if you want to play it safer just take btts yes or o1.5g which is even safer. Good luck to anyone that joins me on this bet, let's make it three in a row.",

I swear some of the things that happened yesterday hadn't even been invented, like Joan Garcia pushing his own defender to the ground to make him block a shot. Don't get me started on the Barca defenders tackling each other, leaving the Espanyol attacker 1 on 1 with the keeper who damn near defied gravity to push the ball away after seemingly being dribbled already, or the goal line clearance. I don't even know how Barcelona survived all those attacks. Even then with the score being 0-0 deep into the second half, the bet looked safe. Except it really wasn't, as the footballing gods decided the fun wasn't quite over yet and allowed not one, but* ***two*** *late Barcelona goals, with the final fluke-ish Lewandowski shot coming in the (yep, you've guessed it) 90th minute, to win the game 2-0 and slap another loss on my record*\n\n**Last Five:** ❌❌❌❌❌\n\n**Event:** LaLiga, Real Madrid v Real Betis, 10:15 am EST\n\n**POTD:** Real Betis +1.0, +1.5 Asian Handicap -122, 1.5 units\n\n**Write Up:** While Real Madrid sit second in LaLiga, their **form has been patchy at best,** and downright worrying at worst. Not only are their results very hot and cold, their gameplay is dull, constantly failing to break down the opposing defences by playing uncreative, recycled football. They have **multiple players occupying the same position in attack** and apply **wrong profiles** to certain positions (like forcing Arda Guler to stay deep or Jude Bellingham to be the main creative outlet, which really doesn't play to their strengths). Xabi's substitutions and tactical tweaks don't make sense half the time either *(who thought it'd be a good idea to play Fran Garcia on the wing and to push Carreras into the center?).* All in all, they just don't play pleasing, nor effective football atm *(at least they could grind out results under Ancelotti).* To make matters worse, they head into this clash without several key players, including **Dani Carvajal, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Eder Militao and the influential Kylian Mbappé**, weakening both defence and attack. These are not minor absences, they disrupt the already questionable Madrid’s spine and reduce their ability to exploit organised defences, such as the one of their very next opponent.\n\nReal Betis, meanwhile, arrive in **good form,** having ended 2025 with a banging 4-0 win over tricky Getafe (that caused a lot of issues to Real Madrid even with just 9 men on the field) and **three wins in their last four matches across competitions.** Their only real issue this season has been too many draws *(oh would I take that today),* not poor performances, with **Betis losing just three LaLiga games all season long.** That resilience is precisely why the +1.0, +1.5 Asian Handicap, where even a narrow defeat still gives us the dub makes sense.\n\nThe H2H also supports this angle. **Betis actually beat Madrid 2-1 in March 2025 and four of their last seven league meetings have ended in draws.** Add to that Betis’ ability to stay compact and hard to break down and the chances of Real Madrid winning comfortably reduce greatly. Now add to that the leaky Madrid defence that's more than capable of the occasional error, especially when physicality is involved (we saw how Atletico, Liverpool, and Celta bullied them) and Betis grabbing a couple goals and shutting Madrid out doesn't seem like a far fetched scenario. And this time, Madrid won't have Mbappe bailing them out.\n\nBetis are a good team, they're **pushing for a Champions League spot** and they'll be looking to take advantage of the shakey Madrid side without Mbappe. I unsuccessfully faded one of the El Clasico sides yesterday, but I really believe I'll have more luck with the other one. BOL and let's enjoy some more LaLiga madness ☘️🫡",

I just didn't feel like handicapping ITFs in December, but tour-level tennis has now returned with ATP and WTA events already starting Down Under. \n\nIt's always hard to predict how Frances Tiafoe will look after some time off from the tour, but he's undoubtedly the more talented player in this matchup. Tiafoe chose to end his season in early October after losing to Yannick Hanfmann in Shanghai, which might give him a small rest advantage over Vukic (who played up until the last ATP events of the year). During this time, Tiafoe shook up his team and played a couple exhibitions to stay in tennis shape, as he looks to get off to a strong start in 2026. Vukic is one of those guys who hung around the bottom of the ATP Tour in 2025, and while he performed quite well in Australia last year, I'm not sure he can replicate it this time around. I feel that Tiafoe is a bit underrated in Australia, as his powerful serve and high-spin forehand can do a lot of damage in these lively conditions. Sure, he's always had more success on American hard courts, but the motivation really seems to be there for him this year. Both players tend to drive their backhands flat, but Tiafoe has a greater ability to place the ball off that wing. It's true that Vukic's serve might keep this close on the scoreboard, but this handicap is most likely too small for him to cover just by holding serve.",

Units: 1.50 \n\nPick: Winner halftime/final (excluding OT) Bills / Bills || 2u at -145 on Bet MGM || NY Jets at Buffalo Bills 4:25pm ET \n\nEven by Jet standards, this current NYJ roster is grim. Breece Hall is out and the defense has gone 16 games without forcing an interception. The Jets have the opportunity to be the only team to go an entire season without an interception. The defense is getting gashed on the ground allowing 135.0 rushing yards per game. They allow the 3rd highest points against per game at 29.3 points, and that's not to be outdone by offense averaging the 5th worst points scored per game at 18.3 points. The fact that the Jets don't have the worst record in the league is an insult to sports. Here's the last 4 losses and spread against the Jets:\n\n- NE -13 at Jets (Final score: 42-10)\n- Jets at NO -6.5 (Final score: 29-6)\n- Jets at JAX -14 (Final score: 48-20)\n- MIA -2.5 at Jets (Final score: 34-10)\n\nAFC playoff picture is far from set and the Buffalo Bills are locked into wild card tie with LA Chargers (4:25pm ET vs Broncos) and Houston Texans (1:00pm ET vs IND Colts). If the Bills lose, they will stay in 7th but can move up to 6th or 5th place with LA or HOU losses. Buffalo will be looking to win and build momentum ahead of the playoffs. Expect the starters and a few serious offensive drives from the Bills, but it's a real possibility they pull starters in the 2nd half. Either due to a lead against the Jets, or due to the results from HOU game at 1pm and LA game at 4:45pm. This makes me weary of player props. Buffalo's defensive weakness is allowing 140.4 rushing yards per game but without Breece Hall, I doubt the Jets put together a ton of offense. The Bill's passing defense does allow a league low 163.4 passing yards per game. Bills have had slow starts and only led once at halftime in the last 4 weeks. But the Jets tell another story, losing at half the last 4 weeks:\n\n- NE 35-3 NYJ \n- NO 9-6 NYJ\n- JAX 31-10 NYJ\n- MIA 24-7 NYJ\n\nI'm seeing lower odds on FD and DK for this. Could parlay 1H winner with Buffalo spread for higher payout. BOL",

Odds were +180 at the time I placed it, already down to +155. \nLe Havre are scraping by in 15th place with the worst attack in the league; team is in a brutal form right now: they haven t scored a single goal in the last four league games, and have been winless going way back. (Not to mention some of their players are  missing the match due to participation in the AFCON)\n\nAngers, meanwhile, are 10th and have been proper hot lately – 4 wins in the last 5 league matches, including a solid 1-0 away against struggling Nice and 4-1 domination against Nantes right before the break. A few players missing there due to AFCON too, but still - Angers have shown real depth during this streak and look way more organized and threatening on the counter and honestly, that’s just the stronger side in the matchup and it would be criminal not to back them. The double chance is a nice alternative (-120) as well. I’m also backing Amine Sbai to have 1+ SOT at even odds. \n\nP.S. Doubt anyone's tailing my first few picks, but I'll keep posting these for a bit and hopefully build some momentum 😀",

Should not have backed this West Ham team, should have stuck with the original Villa -1 play I had in the soccer thread. We move on. \n\nHuge slate today and we're targeting the biggest games of the week as 3rd place Man City host 5th place Chelsea. City need a bounce back to stay in the title race and Chelsea are in a bit of turmoil after having sacked their coach a few days ago. This chaos brings risk and opportunity. \n\nYou guys already know how much I love this play. We've cashed it 4 times here, pretty much every time we've played it (other than one where he did not start randomly and most got voided). With Caicedo suspended for this game, I don't see him being left off the pitch. He should start in midfield next to Reece James, who likes to play further back in defense, which opens up Enzo to crash the box as he does so well. \n\nEnzo has had a SOT in his last 10/12 where he started, two of those were without Caicedo on the pitch. I took a bit of a break in playing this while Palmer came back to the team and lineups adjusted, but am feeling great that Enzo is back to his shooting form, after scoring a goal last week vs Bournemouth. \n\nWe are getting such good odds here because Man City give up the 2nd fewest SOTs in the EPL behind Arsenal at just over 3 per game. That combined with the instability and new coach create the risk. However, Chelsea average almost 5 SOTs per game and control possession much better than most teams. I do not expect the new coach to change much in the playstyle just yet, he hasn't had enough time. I really dont think City will stop then from getting shots off, and I expect this game to have a fair few goals. \n\nBOL and have a great Sunday!",

It was a bit closer than I would have preferred but I never doubted this Arsenal squad \n\n**Write Up:** \n\nVery similar bet as yesterday \n\nFulham love to score 1+ goals at home. Scoring in 8/9 home games this season, only failing to do so versus league leaders Arsenal. They've scored 5/5 times in the L5 games and also scoring 4 at home vs Man City \n\nLiverpool have played away from home 9 times so far, conceding in 7 of those games. Only managing to keep a clean sheet against Burnley & West Ham who both are bottom three as home teams this season \n\nI don't like to take historic records into account as it isn't that relevant in my opinion. But for those who do prefer it, Liverpool last kept a clean sheet away at Fulham in 2009. In the last 11 home games Fulham managed to score at least once against Liverpool. Including last year where Fulham won 3-2 against the eventual champions. An upset win by Fulham tomorrow wouldn't be the craziest thought either \n\nChelsea have just parted ways with their coach, which is not the best way to start the year. They'll also miss Caicedo due to disciplinary points and possibly Cucurella to a hamstring strain. They do have depth in the squad but these players will definitely be missed \n\nMan City has won 8 straight home games since losing to Spurs at the very start of the season and I don't see how that should change. Last 5 home games in the league they have scored 15 times and conceded 3 times \n\nPep Guardiola also has some injuries and unavailabilities within the squad to deal with but the depth of his squad more than makes up for the absentees \n\nAgain, not my cup of tea but H2H Man City is also 4-1-0 at home vs Chelsea in recent years. Including a 3-1 victory in january 2025 \n\nAlso not extremely relevant but a fun extra stat: Michael Oliver being the referee could have a minor impact too.

Atlético Madrid sit 4th in La Liga with 11 wins, 4 draws, and 3 losses, demonstrating consistent form against both top and mid-table opponents. Real Sociedad are struggling in 16th place with 4 wins, 5 draws, and 8 losses, including several narrow defeats at home, highlighting inconsistency and vulnerability against stronger sides. Atlético have scored an average of 1.83 goals per match while conceding just 0.89, reflecting a well-balanced combination of offensive efficiency and defensive discipline. Sociedad average 1.24 goals scored per match and concede 1.47, indicating defensive weaknesses that are amplified by recent absences.\n\nInjuries and suspensions heavily impact Sociedad’s lineup: key players out include defenders Iñaki Rupérez, Clément Lenglet, suspended Igor Zubeldia and Jon Gorrotxategi, while midfielders Yangel Herrera and Ander Barrenetxea are also unavailable. Nicolás González is doubtful, further reducing attacking options. This significantly weakens Sociedad’s ability to maintain structure and transition into attack. Atlético, in contrast, appear fully fit and benefit from tactical stability under Simeone, particularly in away matches where they prioritize defensive solidity while exploiting counter-attacks.\n\nHome advantage for Sociedad is mitigated by Atlético’s strong away form. Sociedad’s home record this season includes wins over Mallorca and Sevilla, but losses to Girona and Villarreal, highlighting inconsistency even at home. Atlético Madrid have consistently scored in almost every away match while conceding very few goals, maintaining disciplined defensive lines. Historical head-to-head also favors Atlético, who have dominated Sociedad in recent La Liga encounters.\n\nConsidering form, injuries, tactical discipline, defensive efficiency, and historical data, the projected outcome heavily favors Atlético Madrid. Realistic scorelines cluster between 1-0 and 2-1, with Atlético controlling the pace and exploiting Sociedad’s weakened defense. This makes Atlético Madrid the strongest, most data-backed pick, representing a disciplined, high-probability play rather than chasing a volatile result\n\n🍺 **If this one cashes, a beer is always appreciated:** [1 beer for a day](http://buymeacoffee.com/willjack)\n\n**BOL!!

Well I do and I love to bet em even more. Both of these teams are out of the playoffs already this year so there is no real benefit for the Cowboys to win this game. However, Dak Prescott made it very clear him and the team were gonna play for pride as the season has been a disappointment. \n\nMotivators for Dallas: \nWith a win, Dallas would bring their record to an overall .500, the team has not finished under .500 since 2000-2002 stretch. Jerry Jones is a prideful man, he is probably doing everything he can to continue that. Also, Dallas would finish 5-1 in the division with this win. Which would be a huge confidence boost going into next season. Eberflus (DC coordinator) is basically coaching for his job in this one. He was a disappointment in Chicago as the HC and has been terrible calling this defense this year. He will be pulling out everything he has to have a respectable end of the season. Just in case he has to plead his case for another team to hire him if the cowboys let him go. \n\nReasons for NYG to lose: \nI mean come on, it’s pretty obvious. They sit at the 2nd best chance to get the #1 pick going into Sunday (Behind the raiders of course). They are tied with 3 other teams with a 3-13 record. And due to their strength of schedule they would claim a higher pick than all of those teams in a tiebreaker. The players/coaches are preaching that everyone will be playing and going all out. Do you really believe that? The owner would be crucified by fans for winning a pointless game and ruining their chances for the 1st or 2nd pick. I believe NY will play hard to get quality reps heading into next season but I do not believe they are prioritizing a win in this matchup. \n\nThe Cowboys have won the last 9 matchups between these two teams. In the last 9 matchups, the cowboys have an average win margin of 15.67 points. They absolutely dominate this team on a regular basis. BOL",

In the previous H2H matchup against the Colts, Fairbairn was 2-2. In the previous 7 vs the Colts, he has hit this line 5 times. He averages 3 FGA per game this year. Texans head coach DeMeco Ryans has already stated he plans to play all of his starters tomorrow. The Colts will be starting rookie QB Riley Leonard tomorrow, so I expect the Texans defense to make him see ghosts, which in turn leads to more posessions for the Texans on offense. If Fairbairn attempts only 2 field goals, he should make them. Tomorrow's game will also be played inside NRG Stadium which is a dome. NFL kickers historically have better FG% indoors than outdoors. Additionally, kickers have made 2+ field goals against the Colts in 6 straight. BOL\n\n*This bet may also be listed as Houston Texans Over 1.5 Made Field Goals.*",

The Rams have lost 2 games in a row & have dropped out of the race to win the 1st round bye in the NFC. They will finish as either the 5 or 6 seed in the NFC Playoffs. If the Seahawks beat the 49ers on Saturday night then the Rams can finish 5th if they win this game. But regardless of the outcome there is potential the Rams bring in their 2nd stringers. As for the Cardinals, they have lost 8 games in a row & are obviously out of the playoffs. Having been down every game, Arizona has been slinging it & that should continue this week. \n\nArizona has lost 8 straight games with a league worst -126 point differential over that span. This has led to Cardinals QB Jacoby Brissett throwing the ball more than any other team in the league. __Brissett is averaging 41.2 passes per game.__ This week he will be without his WR1 Marvin Harrison Jr who the Cardinals just placed on IR. Harrison has missed 4 games this season. In those 4 games Michael Wilson has been a star. __Michael Wilson’s averages without MHJ (4 games):__\n\n15 targets\n\n10.3 receptions\n\n124.8 receiving yards\n\n0.8 TD’s\n\n__Without Marvin Harrison Jr, Wilson has been targeted on 29% of his routes averaging 2.35 yards per route run, both top 10 in the league. He had 11+ targets in all 4 games.__ That should continue this week, especially with what Wilson has on the line. __Wilson currently has 907 receiving yards & is 93 yards away from his first 1,000 yard season. Wilson is 93 yards away from 1,000 on the season.__ The Cardinals & Brissett will do all they can to get Wilson his yards, with nothing else to play for. Wilson also torched the Rams the last time they face each other just a month ago. __In Week 14 Wilson had 11 receptions for 142 yards & 2 TD’s, with 16 targets.__  The have also been getting torched through the air lately, allowing the 9th most receiving yards to WRs & 6th most receptions. Here are some recent stat lines by opposing WR’s:\n\nJSN: 8 rec 96 yds, 1 TD\n\nAmon-Ra: 13/164 2 TD’s, Jamo: 7/134 1 TD\n\nWilson: 11/142 2 TD’s\n\nCoker: 4/74 1 TD\n\nJSN: 9/105 \n\nWilson should be able to hit this easily, I think he breaks 100 this Sunday afternoon.\n\n__Michael Wilson o66.5 rec yards (-110), 4.4u__\n\nAppreciate the love!

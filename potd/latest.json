Kuol is a suffocating defender who'll force the ball out of Cotton's hands, and in the 2 H2H matches this season Cotton has had a season low 7pts and 25pts (Kuol had early foul trouble). Cotton will know this matchup is heading his way, and will be smart enough to use it to his teams advantage, so think he'll be dishing assists rather than forcing shots over a defensive system in place to limit him.\n\nBOL!",

      "text": "Did well with tennis last year so gonna start tracking my best pick of the day here. \n\nRecord: 0-0\n\nEvent: United Cup (Tsitsipas vs Mochizuki) \n\nPick: Over 21.5 games (-145 via HardRock) 1.45 units to win 1 unit \n\nReasoning: generally I don’t like betting over unders but I really like this line at the this price. Tsitsipas is the superior player but has not played an ATP match (with the exception of Davis cup) since the US Open due to back injury issues. Tsitsipas had been getting very poor results. Since grass court season he is 5-11. His opponent Mochizuki does best on hard courts but is ranked 99 so definitely not an elite player. Last year on hard courts won sets against both Ruud and Michelsen and took Khachanov to 5 sets in Wimbledon. Given Stefanos current form and Mochizuki being a competent top 100 player I’m expecting a close match and think this goes 3 sets.",

He's pissed and wants to prove to team USA that they made the wrong choice especially to his own coach who will be the head coach for team USA in Milan. He has points in seven consecutive games (12 points btw which is insane for a defenseman) so you're damn sure he's gonna try to keep his streak alive to shove it in team USA's management face. The game is outside but the last outdoor game Fox played he got 2 assists so it's not a factor for him.\n\nBOL!",

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 6-20-3 *Starting the new year with a milestone - the 20th loss. Not exactly the start I had in mind but once again, I picked a match between two pretty evenly matched teams and backed the team that proceeded to get pumped 5-0. For some added spice, I bet on Manchester City and Liverpool to win their respective games and they both ended 0-0. At this point I might genuinely be cursed. We move though and at least I can just copy and paste the Last Five bit (saves me a few seconds of having to move the tick emoji around)*\n\n**Last Five:** ❌❌❌❌❌\n\n**Event:** Lige One McDonald's, Toulouse v RC Lens, 14:45 pm EST\n\n**POTD:** Toulouse DNB -120, 1 unit\n\n**Write Up:** We're venturing into the French league and I'm eyeing up the match between Toulouse and a flying Lens side. But make no mistake, Toulouse are in a pretty decent spot too. They've quietly turned their season around and come into today’s clash with **real momentum of 3 wins on the bounce** and 4 matches without defeat, making them a strong candidate to stun the slight favorites on paper. After a frustrating first half of the campaign, they look much sharper, more confident, and far harder to break down. They’ve gone unbeaten in their last four matches across all competitions and have won their last three games, including a **convincing 3-0 victory over Paris FC** that boosted both morale and momentum heading into 2026.\n\nWhat I think is especially encouraging for Toulouse is their **home form.** They’ve picked up points in **five of their last six home matches**, keeping **two clean sheets in their last three outings** at the Stadium de Toulouse.\n\nMeanwhile, *Lens may be leading Ligue 1,* but they **don't look very threatening going forward** and don’t have an overwhelming H2H edge. **Toulouse actually defeated them twice in 2025**, only conceding one singular goal across the two fixtures, and Lens have generally **rarely cruised past this opponent** recently. The hosts also have **key attacking threats like Santiago Hidalgo and Yann Gboho** in good form, giving them real scoring potential even against strong defensive sides.\n\nConsidering Toulouse’s upward curve, solid home performances and the fact that they’re not outdone by Lens, I'm leaning towards a Toulouse win, but going to cover my stake in case of a draw. BTTS Yes is a fine bet too, but I'm sticking to match results for now. Preserving my bankroll for a special Saturday's clash I really like, so going real light on this one with just a standard unit. BOL and let's get the first win of the year ☘️🫡",

Anyways, we move on again today and try a different league. I don't frequently venture out of English football, but today I like the value on AC Milan.\n\nMilan head to Cagliari as a clear favorite. I like them to come away with all 3 points here and put themselves back in 1st place. I debated taking -1, but there's a very good chance they only win by 1 goal. So we are adding Pulisic SOT to up the odds. Pulisic had been in great form, scoring 4 goals in his last 4 matches. He was out injured for a chunk of the season, but is now hitting his stride and playing much further forward than last year, leading a dual pronged attack. \n\nBOL everyone, remember to tail with caution and do your own research. I'm very cold, despite some decent reads. Not every good read pans out. Happy Friday!",

Both the Rangers and Panthers rely on structured defensive play and strong goaltending rather than high-tempo offense. With the added pressure and unique setting of the Winter Classic, scoring chances are usually more limited. At near even money, the Under 5.5 offers solid value in a matchup that profiles as a low-scoring, grind-it-out game.\n\nBOL to all who tail and enjoy the Winter Classic 🏒❄️",

ML doesn’t seem like a value, 180’s are inconsistent. One thing or person that has been consistent and that’s Gian van Veen. \n\nHe almost slaughtered Humphries into a 5-1 win with an average of 105.41. I knew I was going to take the winner of their game against Anderson because Anderson didn’t turn up as much as I expected him to today. Just unfortunate to see the ML is at such low odds.\n\nAnderson has been playing great but his performance today was even worse than Humphries’ performance against van Veen. Of course, it’s a different opponent and everything. Still haven’t seen Anderson play as well as Gian van Veen has been doing this tournament. The guy literally smashes all of his opponents. \n\nI’m still convinced that Gian van Veen will be winning this with -1.5 sets. Take into account that yesterday was the first to 5 sets to win. This game is first to 6 sets to win the match. \n\nGian van Veen -1.5 sets @ 1.90 it is.\n\nBOL!",

Pisacane’s side are expected to adopt a compact, low-to-mid block against a stronger Milan team chasing the top of the table, prioritising intensity, duels and disruption rather than possession. With key attacking absences such as Belotti, Felici and Folorunsho, Cagliari’s main way to stay competitive is through aggression, tight marking and stopping Milan’s rhythm with tactical fouls, especially in midfield and wide defensive areas against Leão, Pulisic and Nkunku. At home, Cagliari have consistently shown they are hard to beat against top sides, but that resistance often comes at the cost of discipline. Referee Rosario Abisso is known in Serie A for a relatively high incidence of disciplinary actions — averaging around 4+ total cards per game across recent seasons and often breaking up play with frequent fouls and cautions compared to league norms, including in matches involving Cagliari and big teams like Milan. With Milan expected to dominate possession and Cagliari forced into prolonged defensive phases, the likelihood of the hosts picking up at least two cards is high.",

However that should hopefully be the spring board that gets them back into the top 25 with a string of incoming wins. Had rough road stretch in conference play and have a few home games before their Michigan trip. Northwestern did beat USC, but UCLA is a step up at the moment. UCLA should keep Northwester at bay, as their wins have come in low scoring affairs. Give me the home team in conference play!\n\nPrediction Northwestern 61 UCLA 72",

The Mavs are cooking offensively averaging 129.8 points per game during this win streak and are facing a below average defense in the LA Lakers. The Mavs play well at home as they are 10-2 overall in their last 12 home games. The Lakers are going in the opposite direction. The Lakers are 3-6 in their last 9 and are just 1-4 in their last 5 road games. Lakers offensively aren’t good right now either only averaging 111 points per game in their last 10. They need Austin Reaves back asap but fortunately for us and the Mavs he will not be returning tonight. Mavs should be getting Gafford back tonight as well which helps interior defense with Anthony Davis still out. That said, in laying 5.5 points on the underdogs at home.\n\n👇\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/syd32506kcfg1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de1286a8f71d1783557efc200ef39f4623b7c9c3",

Maybe we can start to win some of those back with this play. \n\nJosh Hokit could potentially be a legit heavyweight contender by the end of this year. He’s 7-0 in his professional career with 7 finishes (4 by KO and 3 by Sub), and he’s 1-0 in the UFC with a KO. \n\nHe was a D1 all American wrestler in college who also played football and was signed to the 49ers as an I drafted free agent for a minute there in 2020. Needless to say, this guy is a proper athlete in a division where that is currently a rarity. \n\nHe faces Denzel Freeman who is 7-1 in his professional career with 5 finishes and who is also 1-0 in the UFC (however that one win coming by not so impressive of a decision). Freeman is a former Olympic Greco Roman wrestler, which I think is impressive, but give me an all American folk style wrestler over an Olympic Greco Roman wrestler all day long when it comes to MMA. \n\nI think Hokit will win this one via KO… he’s not going to be taken down by a Greco Roman guy, hes the better athlete, and hes also 28 years old whereas Freeman is 34. However him by KO is sitting at +275 odds so went with the double chance here as he has finished fights by sub before.",

The team never looked back and shot effectively, posting a season high 57.6% FG shooting percent. Final score 89-71\n\n**Today's Pick:** Laces -7.5 points || 1.0u at -113 on FD || Hive at Laces || 3v3 Unrivaled Basketball 8:45pm ET\n\nTonight's action features two struggling sides Hive (1-4) vs Laces and Lunar Owls (1-4) vs Breeze. Neither ML odds are in range for POTD so I'm looking to the spread. Breeze have -6.5 point spread against a Lunar Owl side that is coming off their first win with Diggins returning from injury. Laces have -7.5 point spread and I think is the better play. \n\nHive average the lowest PPG at 64.2 and in their 4 losses, they have lost by 16, 11, 23, and 12. This team leads Unrivaled in blocks per game but otherwise there isn't much to show for defensively. Opponents have 3rd best eFG% at 53.81% and 2nd highest PPG at 76.0. \n\nLaces come into this game averaging 3rd best 73.8 PPG and 2nd best eFG% at 55.0%. On paper, this offense matches up well against Hive. Laces generate 2nd most assists per game (13.0) and 2nd highest assist shot rate (47.79%). Laces are also tied for lowest opponent blocks per game at 1.80. Hive allow opponents 3rd highest APG (13.2) and 3rd highest assist shot rate (47.14%). Laces are middle of the pack defensively but do limit opponents to 67.6 PPG. If their offense gets into rhythm, Laces are nicely positioned to cover against a struggling Hive squad. BOL",

If you don't like betting on middle-of-the-Northeastern Conference table 1 p.m.-on-a-Friday games, you don't like pod racing.*\n\nFor the five people that will see this before tip-off....\n\nI had a nice two-unit win betting the spread *with* Mercer three days ago. Here's why I'm taking moneyline *against* them today. Mercer is 5-24 all time at Wofford, including 0-5 the last five trips to the Terrier Dome. Last season, the Bears lost by 20 at Wofford. This is a one-possession spread (2.5) between a pair of 13-7 teams. My thesis is that the best team in the nation ATS is going to struggle where they have always struggled - Spartanburg, SC. In fact, Mercer is 2-8 over its last 10 games at Wofford. These teams already played on Jan. 10, and Mercer took it, 109-97. But they needed an absolute outlier of a shooting night to get there - 63 percent from the floor when they normally shoot 46 percent. I don't think they can do it again with the adjustments Wofford will undoubtedly make. For starters, Wofford will not put Mercer on the line like they did in the first matchup, where the Bears converted 27 of 31 trips to the charity stripe. For context, Wofford made 10 fewer free throws. The final margin? Just 12 points. It's clear why the line is what it is today. That's why I think there's real value in taking the moneyline at +125. Wofford has won six of its last eight, and the Terriers are 7-2 at home while Mercer is 4-7 on the road.\n\nGood luck and Godspeed!\n\nIf I've made you a few bucks through fades, it's just gonna ask you a few questions: [https://buymeacoffee.com/seventh\\_\\_place](https://buymeacoffee.com/seventh__place)",

Team Scoffin actually looked pretty good in their first match, despite the lop-sided result against the tournament favourite, Team Einarson. Horvey in particular was really good with her guard placement. This is a team that prefers to play an open style but we're forced into a more precise game in draw one due to their competition and the score. They should be able to peel and simplify the game against Team Kaufman. Team Kaufman, on the other hand, did not look good in their loss against Team Armstrong last night. They struggled quite a bit with guard placement and anytime they needed to play a raise. Kaufman doesn't have a great runback game which will hurt the team at this event. Skauge also has a weak takeout game. We've got great value on Team Scoffin tonight.",

This new job is making it almost impossible to contribute to the community with any sort of genuine research, as is evidenced by my last two picks being rushed. \n\n*I emphasis to all of you guys who are new here tracking*: **DON’T RUSH A PICK,** ***JUST TO RUSH A PICK.***\n\nSo, without further ado, a pick with the bare minimal research: Fulham hosts Brighton in the Premier League, and we think both teams will find the back of the net.\n\n**Fulham have had both teams score in 4/5 and 9/13, meanwhile Brighton have done the same in 5/6. H2H they’ve both scored 3 in a row and 4/5, including a 1-1 draw earlier this season**.\n\nThe parity of the Premier League makes this an intriguing one: it’s 11th vs 12th, but both teams could finish the day as high as 6th in a European place. **I expect both teams to go for it.**\n\n**Brighton have scored twice in 3 of their last 6 away games**, showing a purpose to get forward on the road. **At home Fulham have scored & are unbeaten in 4, but more importantly they’ve conceded in 5/6 at home**. They’re getting results but with leaky defense.\n\nThere’s some goal scoring form as well. On Fulham’s end **Harry Wilson has 3 goals and an assist in his last 4 matches, meanwhile Brighton’s last 7 goals were scored by different players**, showing everyone has an eye for goal.\n\nIt’s not the most gaudy form, but it’s enough form, with enough on the line, to have a goal fest on our hands.\n\nLast play review:\n\nRichmond -2.5 (-110) 1u ❌\n\n(One of those college basketball games: the better team doesn’t find the shots they need when it matters most. I actually has to take a break after this one, Richmond did everything they could to throw that game away)\n\nBOL if you’re tailing, and if not BOL in general",

O’Malleys a great lengthy striker who’s known as a sniper. I think most people see this as a great win position to get O’Malley back into contention which I agree with. What I disagree with is people looking at Yadong as a complete walk over. Although hes struggled with top level comp so far hes shown signs of belonging with Cory or Petr and even beat Cejudo. Yadongs never been knocked out in the UFC which makes me feel better about this going to decision. I think the 3.5 spread is super favorable because of the first round honestly. Yadongs won 8/10 of his last 10 first rounds losing 2 to Petr and Kyler Phillips. Most mma media gave Yadong that round over Petr and Kyler Phillips is a notorious one round Andy. I think Song can come out maybe land a takedown or ever get the better of some exchanges before Sean gets his timing down and cruises to a win. Seans rhythm must be very off considering his last 2 fights were Merab so those camps could neutralize the striking a bit. BOL everyone",

The first part of the match belonged to the home team, who also found a goal during this period (15'). Then, and gradually, Boro showed their quality and of course their metal as they not only returned in the 48th minute but also found a goal to overturn in the 59th minute. They then managed the lead excellently, with their task becoming easier after the 77th minute when Stoke had to play with ten men.\n\n\"In the second half, we had a different mentality and turned the game around. We have to focus on ourselves. This period is difficult,\" said the visibly pleased coach Helberg, who sees that his team is resilient and has the metal capable of keeping it alive in the battle for direct promotion. They are in 2nd place, -6 behind leaders Coventry and +2 behind Ipswich. Their last three have ended goalless, while they have lost one of their last five at home (3-1-1).\n\nMatch News: Defender Bangoura is suffering from an injury problem. Jones Edmundson remain out. Lenihan is out for a long time.\n\nA \"hands down\" home defeat for Preston, 0-3 to Hull. The visitors took the lead in the 33rd minute, while at a crucial moment (45th minute) Hull doubled their goals, thus gaining a strong lead in view of the continuation. Preston failed to react in the second half, with the final score being 0-3 in the 49th minute. The appearance and defeat in the home team's camp brought a lot of nerves, with the prone Osmajic receiving a straight red card in the 90+5th minute.\n\n\"The lack of discipline is completely unacceptable. Osmajic disappointed me. \"It may not have been worth it in today's game, but we have three games ahead of us,\" said Heckingbottom, clearly showing his concern for the behavior of his player, who had just returned from another nine-game suspension a few weeks ago. Two consecutive defeats in the league without scoring, while the possibility of a home elimination in the cup by a team from a lower division (Wigan) could also be included in the conversation. The last four in the Championship ended with no goals.\n\nMiddlesbrough are coming off a win that could give them a boost ahead of the next round. Boro have reacted well after being relegated from the FA, unlike Preston, who have lost and are struggling in their last two games, with the team's atmosphere not being ideal after their last game. The first reason is Middlesbrough, who seem more capable of continuing their campaign with a win. \n\nBol",

He will hit this again. I have laddered him up to 5 Shots today as I usually do. Torino play a low block and look to counter. Paz is a phenomenal high presser and is a great shooter from distance; I expect him to have at least 1 SOT from outside the box due to how low Torino sit. If you don't pay attention to tennis and/or don't trust my judgement play Como ML with Paz 3+ Shots as they have been in great form recently. (Torino are decent off the counter though, and recently beat Roma 3-2 in the Coppa Italia and Como just lost to AC Milan 3-1 who implemented a similar counterattacking style.) As for Inglis v Osaka both have gone to 3 Sets in both of their Aussie open games so far, I expect this one to as well. Inglis is an Aussie and Osaka has been flustered, especially in her last game. This will easily go over 2 sets, or at least it should. If it doesn't Inglis shouldn't lose worse than 6-,3, 6-3. These are both relatively free picks IMO, take Paz 4+ Shots + Inglis to Win a Set for better value but I wouldn't bet more than 2u on it.\n\n\nBOL!",

People like to say he hasn’t fought anybody, or he doesn’t have power or this and that…same thing different fighter. Justin has an impressive resume, but he has said himself that this could very well be his last fight, or the coming to an end, and we know how those fights usually go. Paddy is absolutely huge come fight night. He is younger and will be able to take more punishment. Now I do believe Justin is a better boxer and I do expect him to hit Paddy with a few clean shots. Justin throws very hard leg kicks to the calf, and I suspect he will use that to time Paddies entries. He should throw some heat behind wide hooks or overhands. Paddy throws good kicks to the body along with the head. I think he can create his own opportunities and land a few clean shots himself, leading to a takedown. I suspect Paddy having a bit of trouble getting Justin down, but he will be levels above Justin on the mat. Paddy is a black belt in BJJ and Justin is a newb. Justin does have better wrestling. Anyhow, I see Paddy winning this fight ITD by submission. Five rounds to do it. \n\n**Natalia Silva vs Rose Namajunas**\n\nNatalia Silva will be champion very soon. She is an extremely skilled flyweight. Her arsenal of legs kicks will overwhelm Rose in this fight. She has some of the best footwork I’ve seen inside women’s MMA. Silva controls space very well. These two have very similar styles tbh. They both like to play at distance and set traps / counter punch. It’s just that Silva is a few years younger and does it better. Thug Rose has been fighting for quite some time now, and her move up to 125 (flyweight) has her looking sluggish. It should still be a competitive fight, I just see Rose wearing the damage more as the fight lingers. She is tough as nails and will be an extremely hard out, type of fighter that dies on her shield. I see Silva winning this fight by control and prolonged damage for a decision win.\n\nSo happy UFC is back! BOL if tailing! Let’s get it 🥃.",

Let’s keep it going. UFC IS BACK! Sean O’Malley takes on Song Yadong on the Co-Main fight of the Event. Sean O’Malley is finally fighting again after coming off of back to back losses to Previous champion Merab Dvalishvili. Those losses were tough as Merab was able to hold him down and outlast him with his cardio but that’s not what we’re here to talk about. Sean O’Malley is taking a big drop in competition here fighting Song Yadong, as Song has only fought once a year for the past 3 years and his last fight was a pretty controversial one over Henry Cejudo who should have been retired a long time ago. Song’s last loss was to current champion Petr Yan where he got beat 2-1 in rounds and just got outstruck pretty easily. Sean O’Malley had a great fight against current champion Petr Yan a couple years ago, where he did get the decision win, although it was a very close fight and could’ve went either way. Sean O’Malley’s reach advantage and ability to go in and out of the pocket will give him a huge advantage as Song is more of a throw haymakers and pray guy. Sean O’Malley will be able to land many punches in volume and get out of the way and will likely play it safe as he just wants to secure a win by any means necessary. Given Song Yadong’s power, Sean probably won’t risk going for a big knockout as it could risk him getting knocked out himself. Even if Sean O’Malley goes out guns blazing beating Yadong up looking like he will get a knockout, I think it will still end up going to a decision, as Yadong is very tough, he’s never been knocked out in his UFC career. I believe Sean will be able to land a ton of strikes on Song Yadong, stay out of the way of his power, and he won’t have to worry about the wrestling takedown threat that caused him to lose to Merab Dvalishvili.\n\nTake Sean O’Malley By Decision!",

Just six months ago, he was the reigning champion, the vibrant \"Suga\" that everyone couldn't wait to watch. But then, he lost his title, and suddenly, the highlight reels were all about someone else. In the cutthroat world of the UFC, you can go from being a superstar to an afterthought in the blink of an eye.\n\nNow, his comeback isn't just another fight; it's the beginning of a new chapter in his story. His opponent, Song Yadong, is a fierce competitor, but this matchup seems tailor-made for O'Malley's redemption. Yadong is known for his aggressive style, charging forward and trading blows, which is exactly what O'Malley thrives on with his pinpoint accuracy and significant reach advantage. The pressure is squarely on O'Malley; he’s the one who needs to prove himself.\n\nI’m going with O'Malley to win here; this fight is a huge moment in his career. I believe Sean’s sharp counter-striking will give him the edge over Yadong’s aggressive style.\n\n\nJean Silva is an incredibly dynamic striker, known for his loose and creative style. Watching him play is a real treat, even if it sometimes leads him into some tricky situations. He keeps things interesting by switching from a tight guard to having his hands down, and he does this often enough to keep opponents guessing. Arnold Allen is going to be the toughest striker Silva has faced yet, but I still believe Silva will come out on top. I think his creativity, combined with his relentless pressure and the fact that Allen has had some time off, will really work in his favor. Arnold Allen will be the best striker that Jean Silva has fought, but I still think Silva wins. i thin his creativity combined with his pressure and Allen's layoff will work well for him.",

But if the odds are better on Novak to win in straight sets take it. The price was slightly better when I wrote my write-up (@1.73) but this is where they currently are and I’d consider a fair price to be around 1.50 so there’s still a lot of value in this in my opinion.\n\nDjokovic absolutely cruised past his first two rounds 3,2,2 and though were against fairly weak opposition in Martinez and Maestrelli he looked better than last year, where he reached the semis of all slams. His serving has been very strong but it’s his returning that has truly gone up a notch in my opinion after a drop in his return game last year that  caused matches to go one longer than thy should have. Limiting a big server like Maestrelli to just 55% first serves won is impressive and it seems like he’s found that groove that has seen him be the best returner of all time. In terms of conditioning which is often an issue at 38 years old, but he isn’t your average old man and has looked in great form, unlike US Open last year, still moving like the elite baseliner that he is. It’s obvious that this is one of his last chances to reach the elusive 25 grand slams, the hunger is present as always, and I expect him to sail through the tournament until reaching the big two of Alcaraz and Sinner. As a result, Djokovic knows he’ll need to be in top form to have a chance at defeating them so don’t expect him to drag out matches but instead expect a ruthless Novak to limit time spent on the court.\n\nVDZ has also had a good tournament so far, dropping just a set in victories over Nakashima and Shang. However, the No. 75 is the epitome of inconsistency plus this represents a bad match-up for the Dutchman. Botic is going to need his first serve percentage to be unrealistically high to hold regularly as the 45% second serves points won against Shang aren’t going to cut it against Novak. Against the Serb who is an elite returner is going to cause longer rallies with deep returns quite regularly. In this scenario Djokovic will have the upper hand more often than not as VDZ’s game is more focused around keeping points shorter from the baseline before the errors start to creep in when rallies get longer and more pressure is applied which Nole is the master at. I struggle to see just where Van de Zandschulp keeps it competitive enough to win a set except maybe scamming a tiebreak but he should be getting overwhelmed in all sectors of the game for another routine Novak win on his march to the title.

He is even on back to back games with goals! Burnley is also averaging the 2nd most corners against, which suits Romero nicely.\n\nBurnley are winless in 13 league games and they have conceded eight from their last four league games, but it could quickly have been way more with the chances Manchester United and Liverpool had in their last two games, where they combined gave up 61 shots! \n\nSpurs are not super hot at the moment either and the manager has been booed off a lot recently, it’s a  small surprise he hasn't been sacked yet. But they did beat Dortmund 2-0 at home on Wednesday and a lot of the players had good performances in that game, which has helped the situation a bit coming into this one.\n\nFor me this is crazy value! He almost has to go off injured in the first 10 minutes for him not to have a shot in this game with the way he plays at the moment. \n\nAlternatively you can try him to have a shot on target for 5x and up at most places. ",

Not to mention, Mbappe was up against his former club that he knows perfectly well and always plays well against (he has almost a goal a game against them). Everything lined up just perfectly, but this Villarreal game will be different as they're **defensively sound** and playing at home. They've been superb on their ground in the league this season, racking up **25 points from 10 matches.** Madrid's away form, while still impressive, isn't quite as strong.

Happy to help\n* Teams/Time: Falcons vs. Vitality (CS2) | 10:00 AM EST.\n\nWriteup:\n\n* NucleonZ is called up on short notice from Falcons academy team to replace their star rifler kyousuke due to visa issues. He had very limited notice and has very little experience as a pro so far with only 160 rounds lifetime on HLTV. In academy so far he was the standout player for Falcons Academy but was mostly playing low tier two/tier three competition.\n* Falcons are decent underdogs and should be bigger than this in my opinion. Vitality are on fire recently looking back to dominant form, this team without kyousuke is really going to struggle in my opinion to be competitive with such a hot Falcons team.\n* Vitality projected to pick their map first, very likely that they pick Inferno as their map choice in this series. If they don't go for Inferno then I think Dust 2 makes the most sense but Inferno is a no brainer.\n* Vitality were 5-2 h2h against Falcons in 2025 on Inferno, winning in rounds 87-69 in that time. Vitality are on a 4 map win streak on Inferno beating B8, NAVI, FaZe and GamerLegion on the map, a very impressive run of form. Inferno as said in previous write-ups has by far the least kills of any map in CS2 at the moment. Their is a ton of saving and this leads to much less kills then a normal CS2 map overall making it a great spot to target under.\n* NucleonZ has one series on Falcons so far, in that series they won 2-0 against Liquid but looked very shaky overall. NucleonZ averaged a .55 KPR the lowest on the entire team despite the win. He also was taking anchor roles and playing bad spots on CT side which you can see with his .50 KPR on CT side. With a .55/.6 KPR that gives him between 11-13 kills in an average map and that is assuming they win it which I think Vitality will blow them out of the water on Inferno\n* This line is set entirely off of his tier three/tier 2.5 stats against much weaker teams where he is the star on the team. This line is off by 3-4 kills in my opinion from where it should be on both maps, specifically going for map 1 though as he has 0 official games on Inferno as a pro, and of the two maps he has played on Falcons so far, Dust 2 was his weakest game, averaging a .48 KPR and dropping 10 kills in 21 rounds, despite Falcons winning 13-8\n\nNote: Would ladder this if you have that option, 13.5 and 12.5 are very worth playing as well!",

TOUCHDOWN $1.85 - WIN                                  \n**Write Up:** Today’s pick TOUCHDOWN comes here of a slight freshen and hence we come back in trip 200m to the 1600m. The reason for this is due to fires that ripped through their facilities, luckily causing no harm to the horses, however it means we missed a run the other week and have to shift back to this one.    \n     \nRegardless of this slight setback, TOUCHDOWN has still jumped out in between runs and did so very impressively, indicating he is going to pick up right where he left off tearing through the grades.    \n    \nThe stable are very bullish about his chances and have likened him to MR BRIGHTSIDE, one of Australia’s best recent horses, and so far their high opinion has been right.     \n     \nThis horse is extremely adaptable tactics wise, and can settle anywhere in the run and still be a major player. From barrier 4 I envision us either outside lead, or 1 out 1 back, both very advantageous positions on the Caulfield track.    \n     \nOur main danger YES I KNOW comes off 2 defeats to a horse called FIORENOT, a horse we comfortably handled a few runs back. YES I KNOW also backs up here after 7 days from a brutally run race, which is not a set up I like to follow.     \n      \nAll in all I think TOUCHDOWN is better than this grade of race, and I don’t think the slight setback is enough to worry us here against limited opposition, especially since we ourselves are still very much untapped in terms of a ceiling.

There were quite a few opportunities for both sides, but we end 0-0. This one is on me, bad play, on we move. \n\nBack to our SOT plays as we see West Ham host Sunderland in the early match of the day. The books have finally caught on to center back SOTs against West Ham, as I was expecting this to be closer to +200, but we're playing it anyways. West Ham concede the 2nd most SoTs in the league, behind Burnley. They also concede the most corners in the league, which allows our defenders to come forward. Last week they conceded a goal on three shots to Romero (Tottenham Center back), an SOT to Murillo (Forest Center Back) the previous week, and an SOT to all 4 Wolves defenders the week prior. They love to concede SOTs to defenders as they are not great in the air on defense. \n\nBallard is a 6'2\" defender for Sunderland, he is one of their main targets on set pieces, and has had a great season. He is coming off a 2 SOT match vs Palace last weekend. He also scored a goal on 4 shots with 2 SOTs in the reverse fixture earlier in the season. While Sunderland plays significantly better at home, I like them to make this a tough match for struggling West Ham. \n\nShop around, you might be able to find better value here. BOL and hope you all have a great weekend!",

He’s going to be riding high with confidence having won 7 in a row (Won Adelaide)\n\nObviously he’s going up against a top 5 player in Musetti and there is a chance that he’s able to win the big points.

      "text": "**Record:** 41-19-1 (+23.67u) | L5: 4-1 (1W)\n\n**Last:** (CBB) Indiana -7.5 (1.5u) - ✅\n\n**POTD:** (CBB) No. 16 Florida (-11.5) vs. Auburn\n\n**Start Time:** 4:00 PM ET (ESPN)\n\n**Odds:** -110 (DraftKings)\n\n**Units:** 1.5U\n\n**Reasoning:** They say revenge is a dish best served cold. But if it’s Auburn doing the serving, don’t be surprised if it’s a dish that gets sent back. \n\nWhile the Tigers (12-7) would love to get payback on Florida for last year’s heartbreaking loss in the Final Four, the team is simply lacking of many of the necessary ingredients. Not only is Auburn just 3-3 in SEC play, but the team is just 1-5 against teams currently ranked inside the Top 25. Furthermore, the team is just 1-3 in true road games and has lost 15 straight games in Gainesville dating back to 1996.\n\nAs for the Gators (14-5), it’s been quite the reverse of fortunes as of late. \n\nFollowing a 77-73 loss to then-No. 5 UConn, Florida fell to a surprising 5-4 through nine games. Suddenly, talks of a championship repeat were replaced with that of a championship hangover. Those murmurs only got louder when the team dropped its SEC opener to Missouri, 76-74, as 7.5-point favorites. \n\nSince then, flashes of last year’s squad that cut down the nets have been very much evident. \n\nWinning five straight in SEC play is already a tall task. But doing so against five Quad 1 opponents—including four ranked inside the NET ranking Top 50—is downright impressive. Not surprisingly, since Jan. 4, the Gators rank 2nd in the Barthag power ratings, per Torvik. It also certainly helps that the team has won 16 consecutive home games and 38 of its last 40 at the Stephen C. O’Connell Center over the last three years. \n\nOn Saturday, expect Florida’s sizzling offense to lead the way. \n\nThrough 19 games, the unit ranks 22nd in scoring (86.1 PPG), 40th in offensive efficiency (1.157), 100th in field-goal percentage (46.3%) and 348th in three-point shooting (28.6%). Over the team’s five-game win streak, those number have only increased, rising to 91 points per game on 49% shooting from the field (32.9% from beyond the mark) while ranking 2nd in adjusted offensive efficiency (133.8). That hot shooting should only continue against a Tigers defense that hasn’t played well all season—195th in opponent field-goal percentage (44.9%), 212th in defensive efficiency (1.065), 239th in opponent three-point shooting (35.0%) and 258th in scoring defense (78.0 PPGA)—and struggles even more on the road, conceding 83.9 points per game on a whopping 47.7% shooting (36.2% from deep). Not to mention, Auburn also ranks dead last in the SEC in opponent three-point shooting, allowing foes to connect on 38.8% of their opportunities from range in conference play. \n\nOn the other end of the court, look for home court advantage to have a major impact.\n\nOn the year, the Gators defense has been solid, ranking 39th in defensive efficiency (0.968), 53rd in opponent field-goal percentage (41.6%), 102nd in scoring defense (72.1 PPGA) and 155th in opponent three-point shooting (33.4%). However, the unit takes its play to a whole different level in front of the home fans, ranking 16th in defensive efficiency (0.871), 22nd in opponent field-goal percentage (38.0%) and 50th in scoring defense (64.8 PPGA). That should present some difficulties for a Tigers offense that can hold its own—27th in scoring (85.4 PPG), 33rd in offensive efficiency (1.166), 82nd in field-goal percentage (46.7%) and 235th in three-point shooting (32.6%)—but takes a step back when playing away from home, averaging just 78.5 points per game on 42.0% shooting (29.4% from beyond the arc). Add to that, the team has converted just 10-of-57 (17.5%) opportunities from long range over its last three outings. \n\nThe battle on the glass should be an X factor on Saturday evening. \n\nIf Auburn has one strength, it’s the team’s ability to come away with offensive rebounds, ranking 13th with 12.1 per game. Unfortunately, Florida just so happens to arguably be the best rebounding team in the nation, ranking 1st in rebounding margin (+18), 1st in offensive rebounding (15.3), 1st in total rebounding (46.5) and 5th in defensive rebounding (28.1) while ranking 12th in opponent offensive rebounding (7.3), 13th in opponent total rebounding (30.7) and 21st in opponent defensive rebounding (19.5). The team put that on full display last time out, out rebounding LSU to the tune of 50-30, including a 24-7 advantage on the offensive glass that resulted in 21 second-chance points. Not surprisingly, the Gators lead the nation in second-chance points (17.5 PPG; 100th percentile). That could spell disaster for the Tigers, considering they rank 283rd in opponent second-chance points (12.2 PPG; 24th percentile). \n\nExpect Florida to romp in the Swamp.\n\nBOL if tailing, and as always, please do so respectfully. One bet should not be enough to make you crash out all over Reddit.",

Hell no, he smashed his phone over this and wanted to continue being a Maverick. His last three games prove that his first game was 19 points, 15 boards and 12 assists but keep in mind that was when he was on an absolute stinker dropping below 20 points against Hornets and Jazz. The next two games when he was more established he dropped 45 and 35 points against Dallas.\n\nI like this a lot because against the Clippers the Lakers showed a lot of heart and they lost, meaning they are in the zone. The opposite can be said for the Mavericks they are way over their head imo beating the Jazz twice without Lauri Markenen which is very impactful as they have only won once with him out and that was a 15 point comeback, beat the Knicks when they were going through their slump which they could still be in (knicks were so bad Brunson called for a players only meeting and trade talks began about KAT). And now they beat GSW without Jimmy Butler who is just as valuable as Steph due to the rotations, plus Kuminga got injured in 9 minutes and had 10 points. \n\nAlso I want to say I think this because put in polite terms Max Christie is saying they cant guard me, players screaming and one and the fact they are very very active on the bench screaming.\n\nThe point is what happens a lot is teams develop an ego and gain confidence which is great, but they tend to relax and put their feet on the pedal. The opposite usually happens with a team that is hungry.\n\nKeep in mind this could all be a stretch as these guys are roleplayers and young players who are hungry for it. (Brandon Willians, Ryan Nembhard,  etc). Also another reason this could be a stretch is due to the circumstances, Cooper Flagg wants to show up to say I am the new face of the franchise and Max Christie definitely wants to show up.\n\nBut tbh I feel like home court advantage isn't really a factor here either, I expect a lot of cheers and Doncic Jerseys in this crowd as well. And remember this is one of the best scorers of all time, the only issue is whether he decides to assist instead but he can do both.",

      "text": "Ludogerets @ 1.77 (CircusNL) - €300.00\n\nLast 5 >LWWWW // Profit: €3,577.04\n\nI was initally going to stay away from today, since I find predicting cup games way tougher. Anyway, this one is an interesting one. OGC Nice are technically done, they cannot qualify anymore for the Europa League. I've looked at their Instagram and found out that atleast 80% of the normal selection are not traveling. This makes it a B maybe C team against a full men's team of Ludogerets, whom are looking for a win to get qualified.\n\nFurther, Nice are very bad on the road. they have currently lost 3 out of 3 away games in Europe. Ludogerets at home have been okay, with a 1-1-1 record and managing a win against LaLiga team Celta. The only worry for this game is that Nice recently changed their coach, which makes the form of a team a bit less influential. Still though, with the team being mostly youngsters today, I do not expect they can put up a fight against Ludogerets.",

It’s a neutral ground game, with Bologna’s transfer value being over 5x that of Maccabi’s.",

That early pressure raises the probability of a first-half goal, and once Porto get in front, the quality gap and Rangers’ weakened defensive rotation make a second goal far more likely than a controlled 1-0.\n\nUnits: 2\n\n[Buy me a beer 🍺](https://www.paypal.com/ncp/payment/833MDWKA7GUVA)",

Thunder is without a doubt the better team talent wise as well as offensively and defensively. They are 1st in the west at 38-10 on the season and more importantly 17-5 on the road. The question here is that the Thunder just lost Jalen Williams (16.8 PPG) to injury which would be a setback for a lot of teams however the Thunder arguable have the most depth in the league. You can even make the argument the Thunder are better without JDub as well. Don’t forget Williams misses the first 19 games of the season and the Thunder went 18-1 in those games and looked basically unstoppable. That said, SGA will carry more weight with Williams out tonight and I’m fine with that. SGA can go off against anyone and Holmgren is still anchoring that elite defense. Give me the reigning MVP and the Thunders depth to cover 5.5 points against the Timberwolves tonight.\n\n👇\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jkqb3dz3ubgg1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ee7387096a1b64985112076bd5814ab9ff6b1491",

Love a sweat free bet.*\n\nThis one should be pretty straight forward. Nice is already out of the competition and will probably have the focus set on stopping their rapid decent down the Ligue 1 table (2W - 1D - 7L in last 10 games). This contrasts with Ludogorets who are 2nd in their League and need a win today to keep their Europa dreams alive. I expect them to bring their A+ game.\n\n  \nOther fun stats include:\n\n\\- Nice has lost every away game in this Europa Campaign\n\n\\- Ludogorets has lost only 1 which was to Real Betis, a really strong team in the competition\n\n\\- Nice have conceded 2+ goals in their last 3 away Europa games\n\n\\- Ludogorets has scored 3+ goals in 3/4 of their home games.\n\n\n\nHoping for another sweat free bet.

Hawks vs Rockets at 8:10\n\n\nSince Trey Young was traded, Jalen Johnson is averaging 10.9 rebounds per game. He is averaging 11.3 in his last ten games. \n\n8.8 of his 10.6 rebounds a game are defensive. Most of his rebounds are outside the paint or in transition, which is not where Sengun typically collects his. He usually grabs rebound around the rim. The Rockets do lead the league in offensive rebounding, which is why I expect Johnson to be extra aggressive on the boards because that will be a focal point to them winning (limiting Rockets offensive boards). So to connect the dots, if he plays his normal game (collecting rebounds outside the pain and in transition), but is also spending some extra time crashing the boards to limit second chance opportunities, I think his potential rebound opportunities are higher than normal. \n\nRockets are on a back to back with all their main starters playing 36 minutes late last night. They have to travel and play at Atlanta. This line has already moved from -130 initially to -160 on some.",

His advanced metrics among qualifying D-men is phenomenal: Gost ranks 5th in XGF/60 and unlike freaking Zegras, *2nd* in actual GF/60.\n\nThe nice thing about Carolina has a very deep line relative to the league. They have 9 players with at least 10 goals (most in NHL), so that means Gost doesn't have to play with the top line to produce (although it would help).",

Utrecht’s European campaign has been very unremarkable having only found the back of the net three times across seven matches, and with their elimination already confirmed, the motivation to break a goal drought at a Celtic Park is likely at a low. On the flip side, Celtic is navigating a significant injury crisis at the back with key figures like Carter-Vickers and Alistair Johnston sidelined, which usually forces a manager to prioritize a touch of a safety first approach rather than an all out offensive. Expect the Hoops to focus on a professional, disciplined clean sheet to secure their progression, while a struggling Utrecht team who haven't scored a goal in their last 180 minutes of football, struggles to offer any real threat, making a \"both teams to score\" outcome feel like a fair long shot tonight. Can’t deny the odds for what I believe to be a good chance. BoL",

I’m feeling pretty confident about this play. Durant has been logging a ton of minutes this season, which is especially true in his last few games. Steven Adams suffered a season-ending injury, which has pushed KD to play 39 minutes a night. Insane volume. We’re going to take his points + assists here as he has covered 27 out of 43 games this season. However, when Adam doesn’t play, this jumps to an outstanding 10 out of 12. In one of those games, he played the Grizzlies and shot an awful 5/18 - 28% with no free throws. In another, he played the Spurs and finished with 25 pts+ast, where he only shot 12 times, a season low. \n\nWithout Adams, KD is looking at 19.5 FGA per game. In the majority of those games, he is shooting 46% or better. He is also looking at 10 potential assists per game, while averaging 5.5. Versus the two teams he failed to cover his 29.5 pts + ast line, he got revenge in his last two games, going 35 against the Grizzlies and 30 against the Spurs. KD has been on an absolute tear since December 1st.\n\nKD is getting a much softer matchup tonight on a back-to-back. KD has covered in every back-to-back this season without Adams. Hawks rank 28th in points allowed to the small forward position; for reference, the Spurs rank 2nd. KD is the iso god. Hawks get obliterated in iso matchups, ranking 28th. KD is getting 50% of his points from isolation buckets, free throws, and spot-up shooting. Hawks rank 13th in defending spot-up shooting this season. This is where KD thrives. Versus teams that rank 13 or better in defending spot-up shooters, KD has covered in 15 out of 17 games. With one loss coming all the way back in Nov. 3, and the last versus the Kings, where he finished at 29 pts+ast. KD wants you to guard him. KD wants to pull up and shoot it in your face. The slim reaper is extremely tall - taller than the entire Hawks starting lineup. I think KD has even more incentive to score now, since he is inching closer to MJ’s scoring record every day. \n\nHawks are ranking 2nd in pace this season, and KD has covered every game all the way back to Dec. 1 versus teams that rank 10th or better.. loves slowing down fast pace teams. Hawks are allowing the 23rd most assists and 20th most to small forwards. KD has been torching mediocre transition defenses lately as well. Everything points to him having another monster game and a cover. \n\nThis leads me to a max bet. Even if he somehow doesn’t cover tonight, I believe the value here is highly worth the risk. The minutes will be there, and the majority of shots will be KD’s. Spread sits at -3.5, favoring the Rockets. It should be a close game, considering the Hawks just took down the Celtics last night as well. \n\nGood Luck, fellas!",

Braga fighting to keep top 8 spot and Bologna for a tiny tiny chance to make it to top 8 since qualification is already confirmed. Bologna may rest key players seeing that they’re playing last place Maccabi Tel aviv who’s managed to only get 1 point from a 0-0 draw with palinthakos, but maybe they may bring out their full squad on purpose. Im more afraid of their game in hopes of Bologna not rotating heavily. Braga visits go ahead eagles in Netherlands?

First of all, this Lipscomb squad has been lights out in conference play so far as the Bison have got off to a 7-1 in Atlantic Sun play while the Dolphins have struggled in conference play with a 3-5 record against Atlantic Sun opponents. These Bison hold an advantage over the Dolphins in points scored per game, field goal percentage, free throw percentage, three point percentage, three point defense, team rebounding, blocks per game, steals per game and turnovers limited on the offensive end per game. These two team have met before at the Bison had a convincing 76-57 win over the Dolphins and the Bison held the Dolphins to the least amount of points given up to a division one school all season so I think this Bison squad matches up well against Jacksonville and they will be able to have repeat success against them. I also like adding Southeast Missouri State to this slip because the Redhawks have demolished the Leathernecks by 23 points earlier this year and because the Leathernecks are one of the worst basketball teams in all off division one college basketball. The Leathernecks have not beaten a division one team in regulation all year with their only division one win coming against North Dakota in overtime and this team ranks near the bottom of division one in points scored per game, field goal percentage, free throw percentage, steals, blocks, RPI rating, NET rating and KenPom rating so I like fading this terrible basketball team. That being said, I think both of these team should be able to handle business in their respective matchups.\n\nPrediction: 77-71 Bison, 79-68 Redhawks\n\nLast pick:🏀Purdue -3.5💩Total letdown by Purdue there.

However, as bad as the Kings always seem to be, they do a pretty good job of preventing faster, shorter guards from making their threes thanks to the energetic ball chasers they have on the team (Westbrook, Schroder, Keon Ellis, Nique Clifford).  \nSomething to note is that high volume 3 point makers have gone over this line: Curry, Donovan Mitchell, and Anthony Edwards. This is the reason for the lower risk I put on this pick, but I still like it. Unlike the others, Tyrese Maxey is a much more willing passer and has to be with Embiid looking as good as he has recently.",

They make for a bad matchup for most teams especially a team like Aurora.\n\nIn November on LAN Paravision beat Aurora 13-11 on Overpass. Since then to start the year Aurora was played 3 best of 3’s going 1-1 against GamerLegion and beating HOTU. Meanwhile Paravision won Blast Bounty beating #6 Spirit, #3 Falcons, and #1 Falcons.\n\nBoth teams have added a new player since their last meeting. For Aurora soulfly has a 0.98 over 8 maps while Zweih for Paravision has a 1.14 rating over 15 maps. It is a small sample size and soulfly has plenty of time to turn it around, but so far he is struggling and I expect that to continue against tough competition at his first big lan.\n\nFor the map pool Aurora perma bans Ancient while Paravision perma bans Nuke. From there Paravision has an immediate weakness they can punish. Aurora plays little Inferno and is 0-3 over the last 3 months. Paravision holds a better win percentage than Aurora on every remaining map except Overpass which Paravision already beat them on. The only wildcard in this is the return of Anubis with map changes that we have yet to see. Either way I believe Paravision has a clearer path to grind out a victory.\n\nGL!\nhttps://www.paypal.me/tzbets",

On top of this, he had one huge map but if you factor that map out which looks like an outlier, he is averaging a .55 KPR in tier one\n\n\\-NIP pick their map 2nd based on current odds, they normally go to Nuke as their pick, they may alter from this as they have lost two in a row however I would still predict they stick with it as Passion UA are not a good Nuke team at all but other maps could be possible as well\n\n\\-Cairne has struggled in two main areas so far in the team, T side and Nuke specifically. On Nuke Cairne is averaging a 0.43 KPR overall, -.22 KPR from his averaging and he has really struggled on both sides of the map dropping 7 and 11 kills in his two maps played on Nuke so far. His second area struggling is T side. While he has put up great CT averages with a 0.79 KPR, he is struggling massively on T side averaging a .49 KPR.\n\n\\-Since NIP pick the map, they will start on T side as Passion UA will get side choice, this is going to give us a big advantage once again.

Simply put MTA are not doing well, they are dead last in the league going 0-1-6 (W-D-L) and have a massive goal difference of -17. I can't see them beating Bologna who are mid table at 15th and have qualified for the round of 16 knockout phase - despite this I do think Bologna put their better foot forward and still will be too much for MTA especially when they now have nothing to play for. Bologna are too much for a very poor MTA side that have proven they are not the same quality as their opposition in the league this year.\n\nAston Villa/Salzburg is at Villa park, an absolute fortress of a European ground. AV average 10 corners per game at home (for both teams), they have seen u10.5 corners 6/last 7 games and Salzburg have gone under this same line 4/last 5 games. I do think that this is a game that will be won or lost in midfield, given AV's injuries I do think there will be some rotation - HOWEVER it is important to know that both midfields posses the quality to counter and seek out breaks.

Hawaii is also top 30 in defensive efficiency, while UC Irvine is 216th in offensive efficiency. Both teams have a mediocre shooting percentage, average rebounding, average free throws, etc. I expect UC Irvine to create some turnovers however, and with their average pace of play, I expect only an average number of points off of said turnovers. UC Irvine has been playing better recently, but is one of the worst teams while playing at home. Hawaii has been playing worse recently, but plays better away. All in all, expect a lot of mediocracy. The books already have this as a low total, but I like it even lower. If I had to pick a side, give me UC Irvine +1.5, but I like the under more in this one.\n\nRemember to only bet what you can afford to lose, and BOL!",

MIdtjylland vs Dinamo Zagreb (Over 2.5 Goals)@1.71\n\n**Write Up:** \n\n**Celtic VS Utrecht | 21:00 GMT +2**\n\n* Celtic have won the 1st half in 9 of their last 10 games\n* Utrecht have lost at halftime in 3/3 Europa League away games \n\nTo understand the Scottish league, all you need to know is that since the 84/85 season only Rangers (18 times) & Celtic (22 times) have won it. To further expand on this the last 13 of the last 14 league titles has gone to Celtic! So when they suddenly find themselves eight points of Hearths in 1st place and fail to qualify for the Champions League against a team close to the Chinese border, things aren’t great. When you then also as manager starts bitching about the management it’s just over.\n\nSo in comes Martin O’Neil as interim manager and he wins every league game and knocks bitter rivals Rangers out of the League Cup to make the finals.\n\nThen they hire their new guy who is going to instill a new vision for the team and really change the way the club plays… They have decided on Wilfred Nancy, who is unproven in European football and what proves to be the most evident of all, he has no big club experience. \n\nHis first game in charge is league leader Hearts and Celtic not only fails to make any ground on them, they lose 2-1 at home! He followed that up with 3-0 beating at home again against Roma and then lose 3-1 in the League Cup final against bottom of the table St. Mirren. At this point the crowd has turned properly on him. He somehow survives a couple more games until he loses 3-1 at home against bitter rivals Rangers and finally gets the sack.\n\nSo in comes Martin O’Neil for a second time and instantly beats Dundee United 4-0 at home, a club Nancy lost 2-1 against a couple weeks ago. Celtic failed once again to beat Hearts last weekend as they took the lead twice against them away, but a red card made things very hard and it ended 2-2. Celtic also drew 2-2 against Bologna last midweek in the Europa League, but that was a pretty good performance as they played for 60 minutes with a player less. \n\nUtrecht had an amazing last season that saw them finish 4th in Eredivisie, but they are currently 11th in the league and have only seen 1 win from their last 14 games across all comps. Their Europa League dreams are dead after only one point earned and three goals scored in seven games… Celtic on the other hand needs a win here to progress. \n\nO’Neil in his two periods in charge has seen \n\n* First periode in Charge 6/8 1st half wins\n* Second Period in charge 5/5 1st half wins \n\nThis should be an easy enough win for the host which the odds reflect and doing it by halftime as they usually do should also be very possible.\n\n\\++++\n\n**Midtjylland vs Dinamo Zagreb | 21:00 GMT +2**\n\n* No team has seen more goals in their EL games than Midjylland & Dinamo Zagreb who both have seen 26 goals from seven games.\n\nWe are going with the over this time after the spectacular fail last time around when I was tempted to take the under 3 goals line and was met with a crazy 3-3 draw against Brann. \n\nMidtjylland's chances of finishing top in the Europa League table is more or less gone now after last round's result, but they still need to fight to secure a top 8 finish. Dinamo Zagreb with a massive win 4-1 over Romanian FCSB saw them more or less secure a spot in the top 24.\n\nThe host will still miss their top scorer for this game, which is unfortunate, but they showed against Brann that they do have other players that can contribute with goals. Dinamo are playing really well in the league at the moment after being a bit off the pace at the start of the season. 2-1 or 2-2 is my guess for this game.  ",

Manager Unai Emery has openly confirmed a midfield injury crisis, with Youri Tielemans out for around two months, John McGinn sidelined for six to eight weeks and Boubacar Kamara ruled out for the season — forcing Villa to adjust their core structure and bring in reinforcements like Douglas Luiz and Amadou Onana to compensate. Emery repeatedly stressed that the club wants to win this match to secure a top-two finish and home advantage deeper into the Europa League, and that every player must be ready to compete in a demanding fixture, showing how seriously Villa value goals and control of the game despite rotation.\n\n\\- On the other side, RB Salzburg enter this game in must-win territory if they want to keep their slim hopes of reaching the playoff places alive — a motivation that Austrian media and club insiders have emphasized as a driving force behind their approach. Salzburg sit outside the qualification spots and know a defeat could end their European journey, so there is inherent pressure on coach Thomas Letsch and his troops to play aggressively and create chances rather than sit deep. Salzburg showed attacking intent in their recent 3-1 win over Basel, with young attackers like Kerim Alajbegovic on form, and Austrian reports stress the belief in collective belief and willingness to go for goals here.\n\n\\- Tactically, this sets up a game where Villa may be slightly more open than usual due to forced midfield changes and rotation, while Salzburg are likely to attack from the front knowing that only goals keep them in European contention. Combine that with Salzburg’s tendency to concede more on the road in Europe and Villa’s historical tendency to score at home even when rotated, and both teams finding the net becomes a realistic and compelling outcome.",

Neither match was quite as straightforward as I expected, but neither player actually faced a set point. \n\nFeels weird to go with this pick, as I actually faded Kotov in the opening round of qualifying. That was his first match of the season, and I wasn't particularly confident about his fitness coming in. He didn't play great tennis in that match, but it was enough to win, and he has steadily raised his level since then. Do I think his movement looks great? Not really, but the courts here in Quimper are playing fast enough that his strong serve and overall talent pay dividends. In the last round, he closed at a really short price (around +130) against Mark Lajal, one of the better indoor CH players out there, and scored a three-set win. \n\nIn comparison, Remy Bertola's first-round win over Mannarino would have looked really nice...about three months ago. The 37-year-old Frenchman has experienced some severe backsliding to start the year, and the market has reflected that. Even still, Bertola closed as a significant underdog despite having a dominant indoor win on the record last year, when Adrian was actually playing solid ball. I believe a significant factor in this price was Bertola's poor form to start the year, including a first-round ITF loss as a 1.1 favorite and winning just three games against Kukushkin in Glasgow. Speaking of Kukushkin, Bertola was around a 2.7 dog in that matchup as well, while Lajal played Kuku recently and was a 1.4 favorite. If you compare the odds, Kotov's price in this one doesn't make a ton of sense: the market seems to be valuing him higher than a player who closed as a much bigger favorite than this against Bertola. Keep in mind that all of the matches mentioned were played indoors.\n\nOn top of the odds seeming off, Kotov had a higher performance rating in the first round (7.34 vs 7.14). Bertola has a solid serve for his height and a creative game, but I think his one-handed backhand could cause issues here. Kotov has a solid career record against one-handers, including wins over Stan Wawrinka and Lorenzo Musetti; while Bertola can certainly generate some pace off that wing when he strikes the ball clean, Kotov's reliable backhand stroke, which almost comes off as \"pushy\" at times, can be an effective counter. Overall, this is starting to feel like the right setup for a breakthrough run from Kotov, and I don't see Bertola taking him down here. As a result, this is my first 2-unit play of the year.",

They're sitting pretty at the top of the whole Europa League table with a perfect record in most spots **18 points from 7 games**, best defense in the comp (only 3 goals let in total), and they've been on this mad winning run. Their last Europa League away was a clean 1-0 at Young Boys, and domestically they just slapped Metz 5-2. At home in Groupama? They're beasts strong attack, Tolisso and Lacazette types banging them in, and that backline is rock solid. They want to lock in that top seed for the knockouts, no messing about. **They also have won 8 match in a row**\n\n‎PAOK? Yeah, they're buzzing too on a 7 game unbeaten streak or whatever, smashed Betis 2-0 recently, and they've got goals in them (15 scored already, second best). But look closer: their away form in Europe this season has been shaky. They've only got one win on the road from a few games, and when they face proper quality sides away, they leak. Facing the league leaders who concede almost nothing at home? Nah, that's a tough ask. Greek sides can be brave, but Lyon at home in a must-win vibe for top spot is different gravy.\n\n‎so much value this odds in the world.\n\n‎Fingers crossed it lands easy tomorrow. Up the Lyon! 🍻\n\n\n‎",

      "text": "**POTD: 5-0 (+7.82u)**\n\n**Event:** **League of Legends (LOL) - LCK Cup 2026 - DN SOOPers vs BNK FearX**\n\n**Pick: Map 1 - BNK FearX -5.5 Tower Handicap (2.00) 1.5u to win 1.5u** ✅️\n\n**Start Time:** 17:00 KST, \\~8 hours from posting\n\n**DISCLAIMER: I took this same line at -4.5 @ 1.72 a few hours before this thread was created, it has moved up to -5.5 on my main sportsbook before I could post POTD. -5.5 is still good value, especially now that the odds are higher, BUT please exercise caution. Lower your usual bet size or outright fade. I have lowered the usual 2u POTD bet to 1.5u for that reason as well.**\n\n**If it goes up higher to -6.5, its an automatic fade for me. If you can find it anywhere at -4.5, that was the original intended line for this pick and you can increase your units. Gamble responsibly and only bet what you can lose.**\n\n**Writeup:**\n\nDN SOOPers (1-3) are lacking in firepower. All of their players are just about outside of their primes and they are simply regressing. This roster five years ago would've been legit, but the next generation are already making waves and these old fellas aren't cutting it. They're second last in their group and only marginally better than HANJIN BRION who have ZERO match wins.\n\nBNK FearX (2-2). What more can I say about this team that hasn't been covered in previous POTDs. I'm loving how this team is right now and their playstyle. They can play slow, turn up the pace, and challenge the top teams all in one. They're playing great League of Legends.\n\nComing into this match, I fully expect FearX to take Map 1, and it'll just come down to the manner in which they execute. Just like most games, FearX will most likely make early game plays botside to give their star player Diable a lead. If they can end the first 10-15 minutes of the game ahead, DNS will have a tough time breaking through the line to destroy towers.\n\nIn order for the tower handicap to win, FearX must destroy six MORE towers than DNS. In all losses, DNS average -7.14 tower difference, meaning they destroy seven LESS towers on losses. In all wins, FearX average +5.4 tower difference, meaning they destroy five MORE towers on wins. FearX's schedule has been really rough and a lot of their wins are from behind so this number should be higher based on their ability.\n\nIn losing efforts, DNS aren't staying in the game and taking these towers which speaks to their lack of ability to claw back deficits. On the other hand, FearX likes to take the game slow from winning positions, which includes slowly breaking down the map and taking towers. If FearX gets ahead, I suspect they'll smash the over easily. If it's close, I expect FearX to play it slower and still comfortably hit the over. And if they're behind, I'm not convinced in DNS' ability to get snowball a lead so they won't destroy too many towers before FearX fights back. BOL!\n\n**Map 1 - BNK FearX -5.5 Tower Handicap (2.00) 1.5u to win 1.5u**",

      "text": "**Record:** 43-21-1 (+23.37u)\n\n**Last:** (CBB) Houston -5.5 (1.5u) - ✅\n\n**POTD:** (CBB) No. 9 Illinois (-12.5) vs Washington\n\n**Start Time:** 9:00 PM ET (FS1)\n\n**Odds:** -108 (DraftKings)\n\n**Units:** 1.5U\n\n**Reasoning:** No hurdle has proven to be too tall for this year’s Illinois squad. \n\nLost senior guard Kylan Boswell to a broken hand? Junior Andrej Stojakovic responded with a career-high 30 points in a commanding 89-70 victory over Maryland. Down 11 to then-No. 4 Purdue—which started 14-of-18 (77.8%) from the field—on the road? Freshman Keaton Wagler took the reins, pouring in an eye-popping 46 points on 13-of-17 shooting to help pull off the 88-82 upset. Now, off the high of that victory, and with a Sunday road trip to No. 5 Nebraska looming, surely this has all the makings of a letdown spot?\n\nMeh. Trap game, smap game. \n\nThe Fighting Illini (17-3) might very well be the best offense in the country right now, ranking 1st in offensive efficiency (1.247), 25th in scoring (85.5 PPG), 65th in field-goal percentage (47.1%) and 68th in three-point shooting (36.0%). The team leads the nation in adjusted offensive efficiency (130.5), owning what currently stands as the highest offensive rating in the history of the kenPom era (since 1996-97). Furthermore, Illinois seems to feed off the energy of the home fans, averaging 90.3 points on 49.1% shooting while boasting a +24.1 scoring margin in 11 home contests. That’s very concerning for a middle-of-the-pack Washington defense that enters ranked 80th in opponent three-point shooting (31.7%), 108th in defensive efficiency (1.020), 118th in opponent field-goal percentage (43.3%), 140th in scoring defense (73.3 PPGA). \n\nUnfortunately for the Huskies (11-9), they lack the kind of offensive firepower to keep up. \n\nThrough 20 games, the team ranks 97th in scoring (79.0 PPG), 101st offensive efficiency (1.100), 162nd in field-goal percentage (44.9%) and 288th in three-point shooting (31.4%). Although the Illini don’t boast elite numbers defensively—25th in opponent field-goal percentage (40.4%), 41st in scoring defense (68.3 PPGA), 68th in defensive efficiency (0.997) and 77th in opponent three-point shooting (31.6%)—the team does step it up against sub-par offensive units. In nine contests against opponents that rank outside the Top 100 in offensive efficiency, Illinois has conceded just 63.1 points on a porous 37.3% shooting from the field (29.6% from beyond the arc). That includes allowing just one opponent to top 40% shooting and holding all but three to 65 points or less. \n\nBut if the Illini want to cover the double-digit spread, it’s imperative that they continue their dominance on the glass.\n\nOn the year, Illinois ranks 7th in offensive rebounding (12.2 per game), 11th in total rebounding (41.6) and 17th in defensive rebounding (26.4). That includes holding a double-digit rebounding edge in each their last three games. However, if there’s one downside, it’s the team’s tendency to cough up second-chance opportunities to opponents, ranking just 194th in opponent offensive rebounding (9.2). This is an area Washington will look to pounce, as the team ranks 44th in offensive rebounding (11.0), 49th in total rebounding (38.3) and 65th in defensive rebounding (24.3). Limiting the team’s impact on the glass will be critical for the Illini. \n\nAll things considered, look for Illinois to put it together on both ends of the floor for a convincing victory. \n\nBOL if tailing, and as always, please do so responsibly. One loss should not have you crashing out all over Reddit. ",

Both rosters are desperate to reach the Grand Finals because neither team has qualified for a major event yet, and losing here means waiting months for the next opportunity. Nobody is rolling over or calling GG early with their season on the line.\n\nIf you look at the rosters, this is basically a SEA All-Star match. On one side, you have the PlayTime veterans (Gabbi, Armel, Kuku, DJ, Akashi). On the other side, Nemesis is absolutely stacked with firepower (23savage, Mac, Jabz, Q, Jaunuel). When you have this much talent and this much desperation on the server, sweeps are rare. Nemesis has the raw carry potential with 23savage to take over a game, but PlayTime’s shot-calling usually drags matches into the late game where things get messy.\n\nBoth teams are prone to clown fiestas and throwing leads. I expect them to trade games, with the veterans stealing one and the young guns taking another, forcing a decisive Game 3.\n\nBOL.\n\nhttps://buymeacoffee.com/222benz",

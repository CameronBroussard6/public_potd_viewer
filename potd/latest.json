We don’t have any goalies starts confirmed yet, but the Capitals starter Logan Thompson has started 4 straight and he got a bit ruffed up in his last game, so there is a good chance that Lindgren gets a start, but that’s not confirmed. If that comes to fruition, I think the odds will swing a bit to the Wild.\n\nSpeaking of the Wild, they’ve won 4 in a row. It’s pretty likely that they will have Gustavsson starting and Minnesota is 11-3-4 at home this season.\n\nGood luck!",

Flipping back to the defense system for Fox. He hit this on Saturday and simply put he has not gone more than 3 games in a row where he did not have 2+ steals this season. \n\nGiven that this game is the NBA Cup final I expect it to be as competitive as it it gets at this point in the season. \n\nShould this not hit I will double my units and play it again on Thursday. \n\n**Previous Pick**: Jonas Valanciunas o7.5 points (Nuggets vs Rockets) ✅ \n\n***Track my sports betting picks on [POTD.LOL](https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/EthicalGambler-U6cnjV?utm_source=mdembed&utm_campaign=EthicalGambler) (since 09/01/25).***",

It’s just wild, he scores for the first time in two years but as soon as Sheffield would take him on he would run off shying away from every challenge. Rodriguez got two SOTs (and a goal) in the wildest match I’ve ever watched, an even better version of Watford-Leicester 2013.\n\nI’ve left the football before the football has left me, how the mighty have fallen (I also may have lost my mind tipping women’s Chinese basketball). I’m not going to act like I watch this league but I know basketball and most importantly the stats make this play worth it. Shaanxi are playing at home and are the heavy underdogs coming into this game against Jiangsu. The line is therefore a lot higher than expected but it doesn’t reflect the reality of the situation. Shaanxi is the team that plays the slowest in the league at home whilst the Phoenixs are generally pace-compliant on the road which means that we can expect a low scoring game with low possessions if all goes to plan. 17/19 (89%) of the home team’s matches have cleared the line at home whilst 7/8 (86%) of the away team has also gone under. Their H2H isn’t meaningful considering they’ve only played once since 2019 but that match was last year and it featured just 132 points. At these odds, all I’m seeing is value. Considering the run I’m on everything will probably go against my research so there’s that to consider.

I have received a lot of messages about the model, the ROI, EV, and the SD (Standard Deviation). It seems that a lot of reddit users would like to see the model's + odds and plays that the model can find that has positive EV value. That being said, I played around with the model for the past few hours, inputted some new information, so here we are. I wanted to play Spurs +2.5 & Over 228.5 together, but I have to keep the odds under +200 per Reddit's rules. I will also be parlaying two picks each POTD moving forward because it allows for you all to tail the parlay or individually. Let me know what you all want to see moving forward and if there is anything I can do to help!\n\n• ⁠EV Information: Win probability for the Spurs at +2.5 is 57% vs 52.4% implied at -110 - EV on 1 unit = (0.57 × 0.91) − (0.43 × 1) ≈ +0.09 units (about +9% ROI)\n\n• ⁠Personal Information: Public seems to really like Knicks in this one, probably because of how they have been playing/recent form - The Spurs are well rested, and coming off a huge W against OKC where Wembanyama was on restricted minutes\n\n• EV Information: Looking at efficiency and tempo, the projection is around 232.5 for the game - With the current line being at 228.5, which is 4-5 points lower, SD = 10 points which gives the over a 0.3-0.4 edge - 55% hit rate vs. 52.4% implied number\n\n• Personal Information: I think we are seeing Vegas undermine the Spurs offense - they have such a big ceiling when Wemby plays - Knicks on the other hand, between their man guys Brunson, Towns, Anunoby - they will be leading the way for the Knicks in scoring.\n\nLet's go Achane, need them to hand him the ball just a little bit more. I hope this information on tomorrow's game was helpful, and more importantly, let's hope for a W - I can see the Spurs winning outright in this one tomorrow.\n\nBOL!\n\n**POTD: NBA Cup Final: San Antonio Spurs +5.5 & Over 225.5 Total Points +129 (2.50$ TO WIN 3.25)**\n\nTips are greatly appreciated. Proceeds will be going towards my student loans and my morning cold brews. For any tips 10$+ I will be sending a sports card to your mailbox.\n\n[http://buymeacoffee.com/claysmiith](http://buymeacoffee.com/claysmiith)\n\n[https://venmo.com/u/claysmiith](https://venmo.com/u/claysmiith)",

Buccaneers Team Total OVER 23.5 points (-126) Draft Kings. 5 Units ✅\n\nToday's Pick: NBA 🏀NBA CUP CHAMPIONSHIP San Antonio Spurs vs New York Knickerbockers (neutral site in Las Vegas) UNDER 230.5 (-110) Betonline. 1 Unit\n\nTwo teams here that can put up a lot of points. Total has been bet up from 227.5 so it may continue to rise given the current trend so if you share similar beliefs on this pick you could risk waiting for better odds.. However, IMO this number is too high for a championship game. I expect the referees to swallow their whistle more  and allow for more physicality (which they have for every cup final in the past). Players giving more effort usually leads to more gassed players, more turnovers, more missed bunnies/total shots than normal, etc. A lot of factors that help usually bode much better for the under than the over.\n\nKnicks have some intense perimeter/backcourt defenders like Hart, Bridges, OG, and the Spurs have Castle on their end to lockdown. Towns and Mitchell can provide Defense on the frontcourt end for New York, While Wembanyama is the best defender in the NBA and Kornet provides big interior size when he's off the court for San Antonio.\n\nMiles McBride being out is an additional slight help to the under IMO.",

On top of this, in their last 15 series Betera have won their map pick in 13/15 of them. They have a very strong map pool atm with only one map below 50% winrate and a ton of reps on all maps as they have been very active recently and this new lineup has been looking increasingly good and facing very strong/active tier two competition while doing it including betBoom, 500, BIG, EYEBALLERS and more\n* GUN5 have been much less active team overall and have also struggled a bit the last 3 weeks losing to K27 3 times and 2-0'd by Sashi in a complete stomp, with their only wins coming against WW who aren't a serious team and are ranked outside the top 100 atm. They haven't been facing many hard teams outside of Sashi in the last month and a half I really think a slow start could be on the table for GUN5 in this one\n* GUN5 are the higher seeded team, they got a playoff invite directly while ex-Betera qualified/played to get here, last Nodwin Clutch Series, the playoff invite teams picked their map second in Round of 16 in 8/8 matches meaning GUN5 should pick their map 2nd, meaning Betera get first choice. Interestingly enough, we saw invited teams underperform expectations at Nodwin 2, with non invited teams going 4-4 in the round of 16 with a 9-8 map score overall while generally being lower ranked\n\n**Projected Veto:**\n\n* Betera ban Nuke, GUN5 ban Overpass\n* Betera pick Train/Dust 2\n\n**Train Stats:**\n\n* Betera are 57% winrate on 23 maps of Train L3 months, 5-4 in the last month\n* Betera are 10/11 hitrate on O 18.5 rounds on Train in 2025 with this roster iteration\n* GUN5 are 36% winrate on 11 maps of Train L3 months, 0 games last month. Least played map and lowest winrate by far \n* GUN5 15/15 hitrate on O 18.5 Rounds on Train in 2025,\n\n**Dust 2 Stats:**\n\n* GUN5 52% winrate on 23 maps of Dust 2 in the L3 months, 4 map loss streak\n* Betera 65% winrate on 31 maps of Dust 2 in the L3 months, 3 map winstreak\n* GUN5 19/20 hitrate on O 18.5 Rounds on Dust 2\n* Betera 15/20 hitrate on O 18.5 Rounds on Dust 2, mainly when they start CT side (not their map pick) however and also not expecting them to pick Dust 2 here",

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 14-9-1 (Avg Odds +127)\n\n**Previous Pick:** Bruno Fernandes to Score or Give Assist (+100) ✅️\n\n**Today's Event:** EFL (Carabao) Cup | Cardiff City vs Chelsea (12:00 PM PST)\n\n**Pick:** Estevao ATGS (+180) 1.0 unit to win 1.8 units\n\n**Write Up:** What. A. Game. 8 total goals and really could have been more. Bruno cashes for us with an assist in the 1st half stoppage time and then scores a lovely free kick goal in the 2nd half for good measure. Great game to watch and even better that our pick cashed sweat free. \n\nToday we've got a spicy +180 odds pick, as we head to Wales as Cardiff host Chelsea in an EFL cup match. Cardiff is first place in League One, which confusingly is actually the third tier of English football. They are the lowest tier team still in the EFL cup and I expect them to throw everything they can at Chelsea here in front of their home crowd. So I really don't think they'll park the bus and only play defense. They will know they need a few goals to get by here. This will be Cardiff's 6th game in 17 days, an absolutely brutal schedule, and they do not have nearly the squad depth that Chelsea does. They've also conceded 10 goals in their last 4 games and are going to have another tough test today.\n\nChelsea on the other hand have almost an entire 2nd squad that could probably compete in the Premier League (certainly could beat Wolves). Coach Maresca has emphasized resting his starters in these cup matches and I would not be shocked if the starting 11 today is 11 entirely different players than their last match over the weekend. Even with that expectation, Chelsea are still -400 favorites away against the team two tiers below them. \n\nQueue Estevao. The 18 year old budding Brazilian superstar. This lad is going to be special. Up until a week ago where coach played him for just the first half of a few EPL matches, he scored a goal in 7/7 of the matches he started for club and country. Most of his starts for Chelsea have come in Champion's League and the EFL cup, having a great game in his last EFL cup match against Wolves where he scored a 41' goal. There's always a risk, but I don't see a world where Marecsca keeps him out of the lineup today, and he is very likely to be the best player on the pitch for either side. \n\nI'm expecting an end to end match and a lot of ball control for Chelsea as their 2nd team and fringe starters fight for more 1st team playing time. I expect Estevao to lead this charge and I love the odds we're getting for it. BOL!",

Wemby being a blocking machine and rim protector is going to be huge for this game. And not to mention wemby is going to be doubled sometimes on offense. Dish and shoot for the Spurs, and the Knicks are going to have a challenge with Wemby’s elite rim protection. \n\nNew York is already down key guard depth like Miles McBride (out) (and Shamet out).

I refuse to be deterred however, and believe Pikachu will win the this match for a few reasons. \n\nHead-to-head, Ricardo is 3-0 in their last 3 dating back to 2022, including a 6-4 victory this year back in April. Ricardo also has been trending upwards & quite well on the PDC Order of Merit, achieving a career best top 33 ranking. De Sousa, on the other hand, who was the Premier League of Darts runner-up back in 2021, has continued to plummet, earning just $59k on tour in the past calendar year. \n\nWinner of this one has a fairly favorable draw in the bracket as well, with the victor taking on the winner of Fallon Sherrock/Dave Chisnall in the next round, with the winner likely being a decent-sized favorite in the following round, as the 🇸🇪 Andreas Harryson eliminated world #12 Ross “Smudger” Smith. \n\nNot much more for analysis on this one. Locking in the slightly favored Pietreczko, who owns the H2H record and is in vastly better form at this time. After Pikachu wins this one, got my eyes on a match for Wednesday, and it is off to the races! 🌶️",

This bowl has been one of the most underrated bowls for years, with 10 of 11 being decided by one score. Both these teams finished as runner-up’s in their conference championships. Troy didn't have a prayer against the James Madison run game in the conference ship. JMU ended up with 318 yards on 42 carries for an average of 7.6 ypc. That run defense is going to be a problem vs a Jax St team that has one of the best run games in the country, more on that later. Troy is in its 3rd bowl game in four years, & its first since Gerad Parker took over. Troy went 4-8 on his first season as coach, but quickly turned them around this season. The Trojans don't do anything particularly well, they’re missing key players, & they're banged up, but they're a tough team. As for Jax St, they made it to back to back Conference USA championships this year. After winning last year, this year they fell to my Alma mater Kennesaw St, despite beating them in their first matchup earlier in the season. Jax St made the move up to FBS in 2023 & have been incredibly consistent, winning 8+ games in 3 years in a row. They had a tough blow this past offseason, losing their Head Coach Rich Rodriguez to West Virginia. But new head coach Charles Kelly came in & picked up right where Rodriguez left off. Jax St is a blast when the offense works. It didn't in the CUSA title loss to KSU, but with a win, it will come up with its third 9 win season in a row since moving up to the FBs ranks. It's also the 3rd straight bowl appearance. Big game for both teams to end the season strong. But not all players will be participating in this one. Here are the players each team will be without & why:\n\n__Troy key players out:__\n\n__Starting CB Kaleno Levine - NFL Draft:__ 2nd in passes defended on team (5), 2nd in tackles among CB’s (41). __Starting RB Tae Meadows - Transfer:__ Leading rusher with 695 yards, 159 carries, 4.4 ypc, 6 TD’s. __Starting C Paul Bowling - Transfer:__ One of highest rated OL on team. __DT DJ Jackson Jr- Transfer.__ Averaged half snaps per game. __Starting LT Elijah Prather - Injured.__ Out for half season. __Starting RT Garner Langlo - Injured.__ Out for half season.\n\n__Jax State key players out:__\n\n__Starting RT Reggie Jackson - Transfer.__ Started 11 games. __LG Adrian Gumm - Injured.__ Missed CUSA ship. __CB Tyrin Taylor - Injured.__ Missed CUSA ship.\n\nThis is going to be one of the best non-playoff bowl games this season as there are only 3 players total on both teams that are sitting out for the portal, one of the fewest amount of all the bowls. The only player hitting the portal for Jax St is their RT, but it shouldn’t affect one of the best run offenses in the nation. __Jax St had the 2nd most rushing yards in the nation this season (3,354), averaging 258 per game.__ They have one of the RB’s in the nation, the stats prove it. __All American running back, TCU transfer Cam Cook leads the nation in rushing yards with 1,659 on the season, rushing yards per game (127.6), 101 broken tackles, & 52 explosive runs. He is destroying defenses averaging 5.6 yards per carry & has 16 TD’s on the season. He is one of just 4 RBs this season averaging over 2.00 Scrimmage Yards per Team Play this season.__ The dude is a monster & this weak Troy run defense won’t be able to stop him. Troy just allowed James Madison’s RB Wayne Knight to run for 212 yards on 21 carries & 1 TD. __Troy has allowed 192.1 rushing yards per game, 115th in the NCAA. Their biggest issue is tackling, as they have a 59.6 PFF tackling grade, 112th in NCAA.__ That’s going to be a problem vs Cam Cook who is almost impossible to be brought down with his 101 broken tackles on the season. Cook has been most successful this year with power runs from the pistol or offset gun formation, which is a gap scheme. __Troy has been torched vs gap schemes runs this year, allowing 5.3 yards per carry (109th).__ Jax State’s spread offense creates light defensive boxes. __62% of Jax St’s plays have been against a light box. Troy run’s a 3-3-5 scheme, which is naturally a light box & they have gotten wrecked with it, allowing 6.0 yards per carry to RB’s when in a light box (108th).__ Troy has only have 2 teams faced top 10 in run rate & rushing yards this year in Old Dominion & James Madison & they lost both games. OD is 10th in run rate (61.38%) & 8th in rushing yards per game (234.4). They beat Troy 31-0 rushing for 351 yards & 3 TD’s. JMU is 9th in run rate (61.61%) & 6th in rushing yards per game (240.8). They beat Troy 31-14. Jax St also has a mobile QB in Caden Creel who has 1,085 rushing yards (2nd among QB’s, 23rd in NCAA) & 684 yards after contact is (2nd among QB’s), & had 7 rushing TD’s. Creel has an 8/4 TD/INT ratio with a 60.7% completion rate. Creel didn’t even play until Week 5 this season. Troy’s defense will have their hands full with Creek & Cook.\n\nTroy’s QB Goose Crowder left last game on crutches & is questionable but has practiced & most likely will play banged up. Crowder had just a 58.9% completion % with an 11/5 TD/INT ratio. __He leads a Troy offense that ranks 111th in success rate.__ They are without their starting RB Tate Meadows who entered the transfer portal. Meadows was their workhorse back. Even with Meadows, __Troy averages the 2nd lowest yards per carry in the nation averaging just 2.4 ypc.__ Their backup Lovett has just 317 yards on 81 carries this season on a  weak 3.9 ypc & 2 TD’s. He’s much less explosive with a longest rush of just 22 yards. __Troy will be without 3 starting offensive lineman which is a disaster for an offense that leads the nation in sacks allowed with 57. The next closest team entering the bowl season was Ball State with 49. Troy ranks 126th in pressure rate allowed. Jax State ranks 32nd in pressure rate generated. The offensive line struggles to block (126th in front seven havoc) & that’s where Jax State’s defense excels (43rd in front seven havoc, 31st in line yards).__ Troy is going to have to pass since their ground game is horrible, they’ve passed a ton ranking 23rd in pass % the last 3 games, yet they average just 7 yards per pass (74th). Troy gains a full yard less per play on offense (4.7) than it allows on defense (5.7). Jax St has improved defending the pass as well as they went from rank 120 in passing yards allowed, to top 50 over their last 3 allowing just 207.3 per game just behind LSU. In those last 3 they played Kennesaw St who ranks 41st in pass yards, WKU (29th), & FIU (54th). I like Jax St on both sides of the ball.\n\nCam will Cook.\n\n__Jacksonville State ML__\n\nAppreciate the love!

Still like this line though.\nCardiff are the best league one side so far, averaging the 2nd most shots for team in that league. They got to this stage covering vs Wrexham with 23 shots, and 9 vs Burnley (away). Chelsea should make significant changes here as they did against another League One side (Lincoln), where  Chelsea allowed 16 shots, they played Wolves in this cup after that and allowed 15. Cardiff have covered this in 14/15 home games in all competitions so far, although against significantly weaker sides. Chelsea have allowed 9+ shots in 10/13 away games that include Qarabag, Lincoln, Leeds, Wolves.",

      "text": "NBA POTD 13-9 Pending\n\nLast Pick: James Harden over 7.5 Assists. \n\nWin or lose im happy with the Harden pick, line has moved to 8.5\n\nTodays Pick: **Jalen Brunson Over 29.5 Points.**\n\n**TL;DR:** Brunson’s NBA Cup scoring has been consistently strong at **29, 33, 37, 35, and 40 points**, and San Antonio ranks **bottom 23rd in points allowed to opposing point guards** while also sitting **top five at limiting assists**, a setup that pushes scoring toward self-created offense. With the game total at **231.5**, it is reasonable to think it is in the NBA’s best interest for either a high-scoring game or star-driven performances from players like **Brunson and Wembanyama** in a showcase setting. That environment aligns well with Brunson’s usage-heavy, score-first profile.\n\nMotivation is clearly present across the board in this NBA Cup setting. You’ve got players openly talking about what winning means to them, like Tyler Kolek wanting to buy his dad a new car or Josh Hart joking about getting himself a new watch. But Jalen Brunson operates on a different level. This is the same player who took a **113 million dollar pay cut** to help New York bring in Karl Anthony Towns, a move that shows his focus is on winning and competing, not personal incentives.\n\nThis matchup sets up well for Jalen Brunson because his role and scoring profile are both stable and self-generated. He averages **92.1 touches per game**, nearly **8 minutes of time of possession**, and over **5 dribbles per touch**, confirming that he is not a system scorer. He is the possession finisher. When the Knicks need offense, the ball stays with Brunson, and possessions usually end with a shot or a foul drawn by him.\n\nThe scoring base is clear and repeatable. Brunson produces **10.9 points per game from pull-up jumpers** on **43.6% shooting**, plus **11.3 points per game off drives** on roughly **16 drives per game**. That puts him around **22 points per night from self-created offense alone**, before accounting for secondary buckets, late-clock shots, or non-drive free throws.\n\nHome and road splits add context without introducing risk. On the road, Brunson increases his pull-up volume from **9.5 to 12.6 attempts**, boosting pull-up scoring from **9.1 to 13.0 points per game**. His driving volume and output remain steady at about **16 drives and 11 points**, with the difference being method rather than result. He draws more free throws at home and finishes more efficiently on the road. There is no drop-off in involvement or aggression.\n\nDefensively, San Antonio aligns directly with Brunson’s strengths. The Spurs allow **47.5 points in the paint per game**, with recent games trending even higher, and show clear softness in the **5 to 14 foot range**, allowing **41.3% from 5 to 9 feet** and **45.5% from 10 to 14 feet**. That in-between area is Brunson’s comfort zone, where he thrives on floaters and short pull-ups without needing to attack the rim repeatedly.\n\nPositionally, the Spurs rank **bottom 23rd in points allowed to point guards**, while also ranking **top five at limiting assists to the position**. That defensive combination tends to suppress ball movement while allowing primary scorers to take on more responsibility. Against a score-first guard like Brunson, that usually results in more shot attempts rather than fewer.\n\nVictor Wembanyama is accounted for, but with a likely **20 to 22 minute restriction**, his impact is limited to short stretches. Over a full game, Brunson should see extended possessions against non-Victor lineups, where San Antonio’s paint and mid-paint defense weakens significantly.\n\nPut together, this is not a spot where Brunson needs an outlier shooting night. His usage is secure, his scoring comes from multiple independent avenues, and the Spurs’ defensive weaknesses sit directly in the areas he exploits most. With a **231.5 total** and an NBA Cup setting that naturally elevates star usage, Brunson’s path to a strong scoring night is supported by role and volume.",

I do believe that they will end this game in the first half by going all out, and not do the same mistake as last time. They were losing 1-0 vs Gronningen in their last game and then managed to win it in the second half. The scenario here is that they will be focused to the max and dominate in possession, chances created and xG. They will have at least 2-0 here in the first half. But I do suspect a 3-0 score more. Let´s get this one in!\n\nOn the side note: My tactics won’t change by lowering the odds. The goal is to find high odds to play here. I’m trying to keep track of the results in all of the top leagues. We will **always aim for** **long term** gains here and make sure to manage your bankroll. I will try to post another pick in the coming days. Seems like a good week is coming, with lots of league football to pick from. Good luck everyone.\n\nBookie: **Coolbet** and a **5** unit bet. Gamble **responsibly**!\n\nAppreciate all the support:\n\n[https://buymeacoffee.com/longterm123](https://buymeacoffee.com/longterm123)\n\n[paypal.me/LongTerm123](http://paypal.me/LongTerm123)",

Coach Marek Papszun has made it clear in press conferences that excuses are over — despite absences like Rafał Augustyniak, Jean-Pierre Nsame and Rúben Vinagre, he has emphasized visible structural progress, improved defensive organization, and intensive work on set pieces and compactness within the 3-4-2-1 system. Legia’s recent performance in Gdynia showed better spacing between lines and greater midfield control, suggesting the breakthrough is close. Crucially, the motivational edge lies with the Warsaw side: the pressure to collect points has created a “reaction game” mentality, with players publicly speaking about responsibility and restoring standards. Meanwhile, GKS Katowice are also weakened (Jirka, Paluszek, Rejczyk absent), limiting their pace in transition and defensive stability, and their recent messaging has been more cautious than assertive. With Legia tactically tightening up, drilling defensive discipline, holding historical superiority in head-to-head meetings, and entering this fixture with heightened urgency, the value clearly leans toward a Legia victory.\n\n",

You know I do everything for you. I love you, even the guys who started crying in my DMs when a pick lost.\n\nNow for today..\n\nPick: NK Slaven Belupo-NK Lokomotiva BTTS & Dortmund/draw @ 2.05\n\nWrite Up: \n\n1. In their last 10 H2H since late 2023, BTTS has hit 8/10 times. Slaven has hit BTTS in L5/7 overall and Lokomotiva has hit BTTS in their last 4/5. These two played a month ago and the score went 4-2 for a Lokomotiva win - both scored two goals in the first half!\n\n2. 2nd place Dortmund has not lost at home all season - I don’t expect them to lose to 14th place Mainz.\n\nBOL!\n\nShow your boy some love: https://buymeacoffee.com/yeahicreatedsomethin\n\n￼​",

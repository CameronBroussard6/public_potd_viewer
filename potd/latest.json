Boise State and UNLV have faced off earlier in the year and the Broncos trounced the Rebels 56-31 and the Broncos just could not be stopped on offense in that game. Runningback Dylan Riley had his best game of the year against this Rebels defense, running for over 200 rushing yards and averaging over 13 yards per rush attempt, he looked like former Broncos runningback Ashton Jeanty against this Rebels defense and I think he will have another great game against them in this conference title. The Broncos will also be getting their star quarterback Maddux Madsen back who missed that past few games due to injury and when he faced off against UNLV earlier this year he had an amazing performance throwing for 4 touchdowns and averaging 11 yards per pass attempt. These two teams are very different on the defensive side of the ball, the Broncos have a top 10 pass defense in the nation only allowing 167 passing yards per game while the Rebels are ranked 113th in pass defense allowing just about 250 passing yards per contest. Boise State also has the defensive edge in rushing yards per contest and points allowed per game. Boise State also has home field advantage in this one as the Mountain West title game isnt played on a neutral field so I see that as another huge advantage in this one. I expect Boise State to win by more than field goal again against the Rebels and take the Mountain West title for the second straight year.\n\nPrediction: 34-27 Broncos\n\nLast pick:🏀Indiana -2.5/LSU -1.5💩Indiana has no business being in the top 25 after that performance.\n\nBest of luck to everyone tailing and remember to bet responsibly! Happy championship weekend everyone lets have ourselves a great weekend!!🍀🍀\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vhmcmr09db5g1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c20c0f6af058dd187d769758b7fcc6a1dec08d2b",

Plus, defensively, they’re way more physical than Quinnipiac is ready for.\n\nAnd honestly, Iona only needs to win by a couple buckets. With the way they’re attacking the paint and controlling tempo lately, that’s not a big ask. Quinnipiac can hang for stretches, sure, but they don’t have the consistent scoring to punch back for a full 40.",

The underdog was still able to hold a decent percentage on both first and second serve and she took this one to 3 sets. Great play here, especially against the number 1 seed in the tournament.\n\n**Tennis** | **Challenger Angers (Women)** | **12:30 PM (Eastern Time)**\n\n**Plays will always be shared as 1 unit for fair record purposes**\n\n**Pick:** **Parks vs Korpatsch - Parks ML @ 1.63**\n\nAlycia Parks, currently ranked 71st in the world, is the number 1 seed in this tournament and needs to defend her title points, since she also won in Angers last season. She's one of the tallest players on tour, which gives her a big advantage on this surface (Indoor Hard), with the ability to get free points on her first serve much more frequently than most of her opponents. She produced 26 aces in the last round, which might be a good indicator that she can use her best weapon once more to increase her chances of winning the tournament. Her game does have some problems, especially when playing outdoors, as she moves a bit slowly compared to the tour average, and she hits really flat. With this, she ends up making a lot of unforced errors when outdoor conditions nullify her serve power, but the same can't be said here in Angers, where she feels much more comfortable.\n\nKorpatsch is a veteran of the circuit now at 30, always seen as an average player with a decent rally tolerance and baseline game, but a weak serve, which has prevented her from standing out from the rest of the WTA tour. Last year, she was defeated specifically by Parks in this tournament in straight sets.\n\nWith this, Parks knows that most of her ranking points need to come from Indoor tournaments, and defending this title should be a major priority. With her powerful serve, she should be to simplify each point and win the match. Keep in mind that in order to win this tournament in the previous year, Parks had to defeat Belinda Bencic in the final, the current number 11 in the world.\n\nGood luck!",

In away games, Haverfordwest average 5 for and a 11 total, covering this line in 8/9 games, which makes them arguably the best away matchup for corners in the league. ",

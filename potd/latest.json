His 1Q FG% is 55%, 3 pt 60%. He’s starting well, has no Miller so the responsibility is his. \n\nMatch-up wise Suggs isn’t listed on the injury report but missed the last B2B as he returns from knee surgery, so expect limited minutes. Anthony Black I think has great defensive potential but isn’t quite complete just yet and the Magic have not brought the hustle early this season as a unit. Against guard shooters this year Cunningham 30, Young 25, Maxey 43 have gone well v the Magic, not necessarily from the get go but all play different minutes to Ball so not meant to be a direct comparison, just acknowledging the match-up is there. \n\nBoth teams are in the top 10 in the NBA for pace (according to StatsMuse & nba.com site itself), so I like that Ball will get the opportunities here. The Hornets are averaging 128.3 PPG, good for 3rd in the league. \n\nAs always, I like to raise issues that should be considered before tailing - consider 1Q bets can be flaky as a player can have a cold 3-4 minutes easily and miss an otherwise solid prop spot. I do like this spot as I think the match-up, the pace, the usage & the team dynamics (Miller out still) - but it is still a 1Q prop.",

Not to mention they’ve have a strong connection being from the same county and have been working together this time lamar been recovering. zay is one of the dudes lamar depends on so much because zay is as much of hard worker as him and has the same love for the game as him so with that being said lamar wants to show case his brother hard work on the field in front of friends and family and get back rolling. \n\n(im back with real picks from now on no more plus money picks i want to see how long i can stay on a W streak)",

They’ve been scrappy at home, and while they’re not exactly Serie A’s goal machines, they do grind out results when it matters. Sassuolo, on the other hand, have been flatter then a pancake on the road lately, struggling to find the net in their last couple of away matches. Historically it’s been tight, most of their head-to-heads could’ve gone either way. But Cagliari’s home comfort and Sassuolo’s travel sickness tip the scale ever so slightly toward the cags favour.\n\n\nSo yeah, expect a cagey match where one goal could be enough. Not one for the neutrals, but if Cagliari sneak a 1-0 win, don’t say I didn’t warn you, they’ve been quietly making “ugly wins” look like an art form.",

But with Lamar Jackson returning both the rush and pass game will be greatly improved. With the defense showing improvement last week against a HOT Bears offense who hadn’t been held under 20 points all season, I expect the Ravens to build on this momentum. The Ravens should have the ball most of the game, and they need to get the run going if they want to make the climb to contend for the division. Expect Derrick Henry to have this line easily against an abysmal Miami run defense. Zay Flowers gets a handful of schemed touches a game in screens or jet sweeps. He is undoubtedly the guy on the outside they want to get the ball to. Despite a lack of SERIOUS production, he has been able to go over 4.5 receptions all but 1 game this season. \n\nTAIL OR FADE, BOL!!!",

Short week for both teams, and I expect Baltimore to take care of business. Lamar is back from missing extended time; I think they will ease him back in. Stick to the game plan and use Henry. That was the game plan last year, this year they have gotten away from that and struggled to find wins early. \n\nHenry has cleared this line in the past 2 games. I’m expecting another big game out of him especially with Lamar’s threat back.",

This is a match between two of the top teams in Serbia, with Vojvodina already being a team I've picked to win last week. The away team from Belgrade are favorites for the title once again but have seen their opponents score a goal against them 7/11 matches so far. Vojvodina have managed to score 23 goals in 12 matches so far. I see this as a game with two well performing teams that will see a few goals. I just think this pick has a higher likelihood of hitting then BSC Young Boys to win against Grasshoppers, and because I wanted to sway away from the moneylines for today, but it was still a close choice.\n\nBest of luck if tailing! 🍀\n\n**PS:** If you want you can check my record and units won on [https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/OliveCritical5134-qXXxJZ](https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/OliveCritical5134-qXXxJZ)",

Likely and Jackson have yet to play a full game together this year and he hit this line in 56% of games last year and has yet to do it this year. The dolphins perform pretty poorly against tight ends too, in their last 3 games Kyle Pitts(9 rec.), Harold Fannin(4 rec.), Orlando Gadsden(7 rec.)

      "text": "**POTD Record 36-34-1**\n\nOkay, full disclosure: my bias really got the best of me. I backed Cleveland –4 against Boston and ended up eating humble pie. I was being a little facetious when I under-played Boston’s big guys. Holy fuck. The guys I claimed to be “G-League plus” players(comment I made in the last post…) out-rebounded one of the best frontcourts in the NBA BY 10!!! (Minott & Queta). I mean, let’s just sit with that for a second. Cleveland got worked on the boards, and while I had faith in Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen, those cats out-hustled them in a way that made me pause.\n\nI know Cleveland is talented and I love this team but I’m stepping away from betting on them for a bit. They’re playing for the playoffs, not necessarily the regular season, and I don’t want to ride hype when the book says “wait a second.” I’ve got hope for these Cavs, but I’ll sit on cash until Garland, Strus and Merrill are back and the rotation’s locked in and gets into form.\n\nAnyways, my next play, I LOVE. I’ve been waiting to get on this team for a while and the line is too good to pass up.\n\n**Bucks +2.5**\n\nWhat really convinced me to pull the trigger on the Bucks +2.5 is Giannis. We all know he grabbed a ring in 2021, and yes, that title run was special. But here’s the thing since then, the big games have been few and far between. He’s played just one complete playoff series win in the last three post-seasons and the Bucks have exited early more than once even though he’s still in his athletic prime. Giannis isn’t just playing for stats anymore. He’s deeply motivated. He knows he hasn’t been in those late-May/June playoff trenches the way he used to. That hunger matters.\n\nSo yes, I’m leaning into the Bucks tonight. With +2.5 at home, a motivated superstar and a team that’s clicked early this season. I really love the addition of Turner, and bet this teams over in win totals. I also have some $ on them to win the east and the title. I in no way put them as one of my favorite teams, however how the fuck can at team with this talented of a guy be such long shots?\n\nThe matchup versus Golden State favors Milwaukee. The Bucks’ frontcourt and length give them an edge vs whatever Warriors are trotting out. +2.5 is a spot. I’m getting points at home with a motivated roster. That’s a luxury. Giannis, Turner + help side = size mismatch vs Warriors’ front line running thinner.\n\nI do have to say, GSW looks good so far, and I know I did not break them down too much, as no data or eye test could discard them, or show any significant edge that Milwaukee has vs them. GSW is 1-1 on the road so far this season, winning against the Lakers on the first night of the season, and losing to Portland several days ago on the 2^(nd) night of a B2B. This play is purely a play with a team I am high on getting points at home, and with not many other games that stuck out to me.\n\nGiannis is pissed off and dominating right now, so +2.5 is a gift when you believe you’ll hang tough or outright win.\n\nPS: I was close to taking the Magic -2.5 at Charlotte tomorrow, and still might through a smaller bet down on it. I have bet charlotte once (lost) and faded them once (won) so far in my plays, and mentioned numerous times I like them compared to vegas, but Magic cant go 1-4 to start the season after they had arguable the biggest off-season in the NBA.",

They have had an easy schedule outside of TAMU and North Texas. Yet they still dropped games to Temple and Texas State. The Road Runners almost allowed Colorado St and Incarcerate Word to hit this line. I have not seen their ability to stop the run or pass and unfortunately for them Tulane can do both. \n\nUTSA does have a good enough offense to stay in this. Led by Owen McCown and Robert Henry Jr the UTSA offense has the ability to chunk big plays forcing Tulane to keep their foot on the gas.\n\nOn the other side of the ball we have the 6-1 and Tulane Green Wave. Tulane has been rolling with BYU transfer Jake Retzlaf. Jake can pick up yards through the air or on his feet. They also have a plethora of supporting options in the backfield and the wide receiver room. Tulane has a very balanced offense which will keep the UTSA defense guessing all game leading to big yardage drives. \n\nPrediction: Tulane goes for over 500 total yards",

There are two games slated for the night, and I am evaluating Tulane @ UTSA.\n\nTulane is 2nd in the American conference, boasting an overall record of 6-1 (3-0). They are led by the BYU QB transfer Retzlaff, who finds ways to win football games. Honestly, I had a lot of fun watching him last year - and this year he is putting up impressive numbers yet again. UTSA, not much difference on their side of the ball compared to last year. McCown is back under center and is capable of energizing a high-powered offense, especially at home. Despite their overall record and conference standing, they are at home and are capable of putting points on the board. I don't foresee either defense making a huge impact in this game.

Still ended with 6 assists in both those games and had 12 dimes in the first game of the season. He’s avg 8.3 assists per game & 14.8 potentials per game and is that guy for Heat to handle the ball.\n\nSpoelstra even praised him after last game praising his facilitating and playmaking for them\n\n“We love it because he has a great heart that he just wants to set other people up to score. And you need guys like that. He has a great skill for it. He’s an aggressive guy.

The Ravens will be getting back quarterback Lamar Jackson this week and this team is completely different with him under center so I am not looking into their record as they were ineffective with Cooper Rush as quarterback but last week they did find a win with Tyler Huntley as quarterback. My key factor in this Thursday night showdown focuses on the rushing offense and defenses of these teams. This Ravens rush attack is 8th in rushing yards per game with 134 a contest and averaging 5.3 yards a carry while the Dolphins are 23rd in the league averaging under 100 rushing yards per game while their rush defense is 28th in the league allowing 145 rushing yards a game so I think they will have their hands full with Derrick Henry in this one. I also like Tulane to defeat UTSA as they are a well put together squad that has two wins over power five schools, Duke and Northwestern. Texas San Antonio is coming off an ass whooping against North Texas where they lost 55-17. This weakness of this Roadrunners team is their secondary and I think Green Wave wide receivers Shazz Preston who averages 16 yards a reception and Omari Hayes will exploit this UTSA defense. Also quarterback Jake Retzlaff is dangerous on the ground and in the air as he has 1428 passing yards, a 6:1 touchdown to interception ratio and he averages 6.5 yards a carry and 8 rushing touchdowns to go along with that.\n\nPrediction: 30-24 Tulane, 27-19 Ravens\n\nLast pick:🏈⚾️Dodgers F5/Chiefs ML💰We take a small cash with the Dodgers F5 pushing but well take a little bit of profit over a loss or a push any time!\n\nBest of luck to everyone tailing and remember to bet responsibly!

Giannis is in fantastic form and is over this line in all four games this season (45, 54, 51 and 51), including against more physical teams like Cleveland and the Knicks. I just can’t see a way for the Warriors to stop him with Draymond and Horford, and he should be able to get to the basket and the FT line at will, especially as the Bucks have an effective cast of guys to space the floor.\n\n\n\n*This line is available on FD. The other books don't have his player props yet but I'd play it to 44.5.*",

This creates many rebound chances for big men such as Giannis. In the previous game, Zubac crushed his line of 9.5 rebounds with 13 rebounds. Expect a big night from Giannis here.",

Giannis is GTD but always is and is likely to play. Anyways the bucks are 10th in net and the warriors are 10th. The bucks are playing solid team basketball right now and get to stay at home again, Ryan Rollins is also a breakout star. I think Gianni’s has a big game as well in sheer size advantage alone over this tired team. We are getting what could potentially be the better team right now at home, as an underdog, and in a better situational spot. Not sketchy either cause warriors carry the public on name alone.

They definitely made us sweat with the first goal in the 63rd minute. \n\nHowever, Roma scored twice and looked set to run out 2-0 winners. However, Parma scored late to get it back to 2-1... Which is basically exactly why we covered the Roma to win and 3.5 line. Just in case Parma scored a jammy goal. \n\nToday's Pick: Bangkok Utd v FC Samut Sakhon. Over 3.5 Goals AND KuPS to win v Gnistan. 3u @ $2.20\n\nPick: Combining two legs here. If you're not one to do that, I like the o3.5 for the Bangkok game, or KuPS -1 handicap. \n\nFirst up, we're at the Thai FA Cup. One of the best teams in Thailand, Bangkok United, plays away to 3rd division FC Samut Sakhon.\n\nSamut Sakhon are doing well in the third tier and are sitting in second place after four games. \n\nBangkok United are second in the top division and in great form in both the league and in the Champions League 2, which is basically the Europa League of Asia. \n\nPlenty of these early cup games have crazy high scores, so I like the o3.5 and that covers us a fair bit. \n\nAlong with that, we're in Finland, where top of the table KuPS host IF Gnistan. \n\nGnistan have struggled since the league split into the championship group, going 0-1-6. \n\nKuPS want to keep winning to maintain their lead at the top. There are only 3 games left, and a loss here could see them drop to second depending on other results. \n\nKuPS should win this.",

      "text": "Record: 43-40\n\n**Verona - Milano** 🏐 Italy - Superlega UTC 19:30\n\nPick: **Verona -1.5 Set Handicap** @ 1.55 Betsson\n\nVerona has made a flawless start to the 2025-2026 season. Winning both of its first two matches, they share the top spot with reigning champions Trentino with 6 points. The team demonstrated its fitness by defeating Piacenza 3-1 in the first week and Grottazzolina 3-0 away in the second. One of the key factors behind this success is the appointment of **Fabio Soli**, the coach who won the championship with Trentino last season. Under Soli's leadership, Verona has built a squad that blends experience and youth. The signing of American **Micah Christenson**, considered one of the best passers in the world, has taken the team's playing style to a whole new level. At the opposite end, they feature 23-year-old Brazilian talent Darlan Souza, while the remaining outside hitters include Rok Mozic and Noumory Keita. This squad structure clearly demonstrates that Verona is aiming for the top spot this season, not just the playoffs.\n\nMilano, on the other hand, started the season with mixed emotions. They showed \"solidity and character\" by beating Modena in their opening match, but suffered a hard-fought 3-1 defeat against Piacenza in the second week. After this defeat, they are looking at the away game against Verona as a \"redemption\" match. Milano's biggest asset is undoubtedly their Belgian captain, Ferre Reggers, currently the league's top scorer. Reggers has scored a staggering 55 points in two matches, averaging an incredible 6.11 per set. His 27 points in the last match against Piacenza alone demonstrates his vital role for the team. Milano will aim to capitalize on Reggers' exceptional performance and return from their challenging away game against Verona with a point or points.\n\nWhile Milano may have a scoring machine like Ferre Reggers, Verona appears to have a more balanced squad. Christenson's passing ability and ability to effectively utilize multiple scoring options like Darlan, Mozic, and Keita will make things difficult for Milan's defense. My pick is Verona, given their chemistry with their new coach and world-class passer Christenson. I predict a 3-1 result.",

He has averaged 16.8 yards per reception (268 yards/16 catches) since Week 4, 6th best of 41 qualified NFL WRs (League Avg: 12.7.)__ Now, Waddle gets his easiest matchup since Tyreek went down. \n\nThe Ravens have had a really bad defense so far this season. __Baltimore ranks 30th in the NFL in EPA/Play allowed (0.148). Their pass defense has been poor ranking 28th in EPA/Dropback allowed (0.21) & they have the 6th worst Dropback success rate allowed. Baltimore ranks 31st in turnover margin (-6).__ Last week the Ravens got torched by a pair of Bears WR’s. __Rome Odunze had 7 catches for 114 yards, DJ Moore had 73 yards on 4 catches. Both going over Waddle’s receiving line this week.__ But wasn’t the first occurrence of WR’s doing well vs the Ravens. __Baltimore has been getting lit up by WR’s all season, allowing the 3rd most receptions per game (14), the 9th most receiving yards per game (159), the 8th most yards per target (9.0), & the 3rd most TD’s (10).__\n\nThe biggest reason their defense isn’t doing well is because QB’s are getting tons of time in the pocket. Baltimore has has a tough time generating pressure. __The Ravens rank 29th in pressure rate (27.1%).__ A key change they have made over the past 2 weeks to help with pressure is they are now deploying 3 safeties as part of their base defense. They are using Kyle Hamilton as a Swiss Army knife alongside Alohi Gilman & rookie Malaki Starks. Hamilton has been all over the field. He played 18 snaps in the box on Sunday, playing linebacker on 19 snaps. He played another 24 snaps at slot corner & 2 snaps out wide at corner. Hamilton rushed the passer on a season high 8 snaps. This was all to fix their pressure issues. But doing created a lot of space out wide for Bears receivers as evident by Odunze & Moore’s stats. The Dolphins Defensive Coordinator Anthony Weaver actually came from the Ravens last year. He & Ravens Defensive Coordinator Zach Orr coached together as assistants, so Weaver will know Orr’s gameplan & schemes very well. As bad as Tua’s been this season, the Dolphins are going to actually be able to pass on this weak pass defense. But Tua wasn’t that bad this past Sunday.\n\nTuaturndaballova bounced back from a nightmare outing in Week 7, connecting on 20 of 26 passes (76.9%) for 205 yards (7.9 Y/A) & a season high 4 TD’s Sunday in Atlanta. Now Tua gets to go back to Miami off a good game, & he is a much better QB at home. Tua’s biggest thing is he is a first read guy. He focuses on that read & struggles if he has to make a 2nd read. __Tagovailoa is averaging 8.3 yards per pass attempt on his first read throws compared to 6.4 yards per pass when he is moved off his first look.__ This is why Tyreek Hill had so many big games. Now Waddle is his 1st read guy. __Since Hill’s injury Waddle has been targeted as the 1st read on 31% of Tua’s dropbacks.__ But it’s not all Tua’s fault, Miami has one of the worst offensive line’s in the league. Their line has been so bad added a 6th offensive lineman last week, & it actually worked. This shouldn’t be an issue this week vs a Ravens DLine that has had trouble pressuring QB’s. The Ravens may have had defensive issues, but Miami has had just as much. \n\nMiami has had major defensive troubles. __The Dolphins are currently 27th in the NFL in EPA per play allowed (0.114).__ They also have had trouble getting to the QB. __Miami ranks just 22nd in pressure rate (33.7%) even though they blitz at the 5th highest rate (33.1%). Only 40% of their blitzes generate pressure (22nd). When Miami has failed to get pressure, they have allowed a 79.3% completion percentage, worst in the league. Even when the Dolphins have gotten pressure, they have allowed a 58.3% completion percentage (30th) & 7.5 yards per pass (31st).__ That’s going to be a problem vs the Ravens offense now that Lamar is back. Jackson’s return is a significant boost for the offense. __Baltimore was averaging 6.5 yards per play (best in NFL) when Lamar was on the field at the start of the season. Without Lamar they avg just 5.1 yards per play (24th in NFL).__ He is coming into the game with a hamstring injury, but if he doesn’t have any restrictions he’s going to run all over them. __The Dolphins have allowed a league high 4 rushing TD’s to QB’s & 180 rushing yards on the season.__ The Ravens are going to score a lot of points this game. As bad as the vibes are surrounding Miami in bulk, they have found a way to score 21+ points in 6 of their last 7 games, with that performance in the rain in Cleveland being the exception. It’s also worth noting that the Over is 26-6 since 1983 in games with totals of 49.5 or higher involving a team that has lost 4 or 5 of its last 6 games & 2 teams with winning percentages between 25% & 40%. The average total points scored in that betting system is 60.8 points per game.\n\nWith the Ravens favored by 7.5 points, Miami should be trailing, which means a pass heavy game script, & plenty of chances for Waddle to break one deep.\n\n__Jaylen Waddle over 62.5 receiving yards__\n\nAppreciate the love!

I was slightly worried that Vacherot would smash him in 2 after watching the first couple games, but Rinderknech recovered well. The first set went to tiebreak, and Vacherot choked it away. In the end, he was the better player though, like in their first encounter, and won a deserved, tough-fought match (6-7), (6-4), (6-3).\n\n——————————————————\n\n**Today’s Pick** - Malik Washington 25+ receiving yards (-136) + Marshall -2.5 vs Coastal Carolina (-194) | (**+162**) FD | (**3 units**)\n\n**Marshal @ Coastal Carolina 19:30 EST**\n\n**Ravens @ Dolphins 20:15 EST**\n\nAll my picks so far have been exactly +200 odds. I’ll continue to share plus odds picks that I’m confident in, as I have the most success with this method, and it’s going well so far on here. This one is a bit lower at +162.\n\n——————————————————\n\n**Malik Washington 25+ receiving yards (-136) write up**\n\nWashington’s role has expanded in recent weeks, clearing 30 receiving yards in each of his last two games while his snap share has surged from 44% three weeks ago to 64% and 62% in the past two.\n\nLast week: 4/5 for 36 yards. Prior: 5/8 for 30. Trend’s clear — more targets, more opportunity.\n\nBaltimore is not good vs the pass and has a problem with slot receivers in particular—which I’ll expand on more.\n\nMarlon Humphrey was once a great cornerback. Just last year he was elite. He was a feisty lockdown corner that could shadow top receivers and hang with the best of them. A Gandalf corner as I like to call them: “THOU SHALT NOT PASS!”\n\nNowadays, he’s more like Santa, and Malik Washington might be the primary beneficiary of his generosity tomorrow. \n\nHe plays 63% of snaps as the scb. While he is “only” targeted on 17.8% of routes run, which is high, but not egregious, he is at the bottom of the barrel statistically in most of the productivity coverage stats. He gives up a lot of production. The stats don’t lie, this year has been a major regression season.\n\nHe’s allowing 52 ypg, 9.8 YPT, and ranks bottom-10 in most coverage stats (PFF grade 45.4, #109/113). \n\nWashington runs 52% of routes from the slot, so he’ll see plenty of Humphrey.\n\nThe rest of the Ravens corners and secondary as a whole are nothing to write home about either. They’re the 2nd worst defense against WRs in terms of fantasy points allowed and they give up the 9th most yards to WRs.\n\nNotable primary slot Wide Receiver lines against the Ravens:\n\nAmon-Ra St. Brown - 7 / 77/ 1 (pre-game O/U 72.5) ✅\n\nKhalil Shakir - 6 / 64 (pre-game O/U 47.5) ✅\n\nChristian Kirk -  4 / 64 yards (pre-game O/U 36.5) ✅\n\nDJ Moore - 4 / 73 (pre-game O/U 42.5) ✅\n\nJuJu Smith-Schuster - 4 / 36 / 1 (pre-game O/U 14.5) ✅\n\nJordan Whittington - 3 /23 (pre-game O/U 12.5) ✅\n\nThat’s a clear rate in 6/7 games. I couldn’t find exactly who the primary was for the Browns so it could be 7/7.\n\n——————————————————\n\n**Marshall -2.5 @ Coastal (-194) write up**\n\nI don’t bet CFB often, but I stumbled across this game while browsing the ESPN app looking for my next victim, and it jumped out. Right off the bat, just looking at the previous games for both teams, Marshall seems to have much more impressive results despite both being 4-3. \n\nFor instance, they beat Old Dominon 48-24 two weeks ago, and Coastal Carolina got absolutely dog walked, 47-7, by Old Dominion the week before that. Maybe the Old Dominion players partied all week, drunk off their victory against CCU, and got smashed by Marshall because of that, but more likely it’s a sign that Marshall is a cut or two above Coastal, I would think.\n\nLooking at the stats of the QB for Marshall: Carlos Del Rio-Wilson, he looks really good. 1,131 yards passing with 12/1 TD/INT and a team high 347 yards rushing with 4 TDs. He’s a transfer and didn’t even start the first game of the season too.\n\nCoastal Carolina has had some major quarterback problems this season. They benched their starter in week 2 after he threw 3 picks and then benched their replacement quarterback last week after he filled in with 447 passing yards and 3/3 TD/INT since then. Their latest quarterback, Samari Collier, will start this game. Maybe the third time’s the charm. \n\nHe had a pretty good debut start in their win last week vs Appalachian state, but this guy’s a senior, 2 year JUCO transfer, who’s mobile but very much unproven.\n\nMarshall’s QB Del Rio-Wilson is elite through the air and elite on the ground. He didn’t have a single interception until last game, and he’s averaging 293 total yards and 3.2 TDs per game since becoming the starter.\n\nBig advantage for the Thundering Herd.\n\nMarshall’s top wide receiver, Demarcus Lacey, has 35 / 484 / 4 on the year. Coastal’s top WR has 19/158. Lacey has more yards receiving than any of Coastal’s quarterbacks have passing.\n\nPretty primitive analysis, but compelling to me nonetheless. I don’t think home field advantage will make up for the deficit in quality between these two teams. My gut tells me Marshall will win on the road here and maybe stomp them. \n\nTeased down from -6.5 to -2.5 for extra safety, as Marshall has had 2 of their last 3 games decided by exactly 3 points (both in 2OT). They’ve had 12 days off since their last game though, and will be well rested and ready to lay a beatdown on their enemy.\n\nMy pick is combining these two alts to fit with my high odds strategy, but you can of course pick to just tail one or the other, and the standard lines for both picks also seem good to me.\n\nBOL",

      "text": "Record: 153-134, -4.23 units\n\nLast Pick: Dylan Dietrich ML vs Jay Clarke (+135, 1 unit): Win\n\nTennis | Charlottesville Challenger | 11:30 AM EST (estimated)\n\nToday's Pick: Rinky Hijikata vs Mats Rosenkranz | **Hijikata ML at -153 (DK). 1 unit.**\n\nWrite-up: The odds movement before the match was pretty wild, as things even swung in Clarke's favor at one point. However, Dietrich closed at around +110 and played a very strong match. \n\nFor today's pick, I'm sticking with Charlottesville and going with Rinky Hijikata to defeat Mats Rosenkranz in the second round. Hijikata is one of those guys who never really looks to be dominating his opponent, but always manages to score enough wins throughout the season to stay in the Grand Slam main draw range. He tends to perform fairly well indoors, as a strong net game makes up for a lackluster serve and fairly standard baseline game. His first-round match against clay-courter Matias Soto was tougher than expected, but he actually didn't play badly, earning a 7.04 performance rating.\n\nMeanwhile, Mats Rosenkranz has a more traditional indoor game - he's a big lefty server that likes to take it to his opponent in rallies. However, he doesn't really have the same consistency from the ground as Hijikata, and I feel that his approaches to the net can be a bit too lumbering when facing a speedster like Rinky. He got a decent first-round win over Andres Martin, but I still don't feel that he's in quite the same weight class as Hijikata. Looking at some common matchups, they both played Patrick Kypson indoors recently; Hijikata closed at around even money, while Rosenkranz was a 3.10 underdog. Rosenkranz was also priced similarly to this match in the first round against Martin, but I don't feel that Andres is at the same level as Hijikata, as he's more of an outdoor player and hasn't scored any big wins recently. Teelo's model supports the idea that there's a gap in form between these two players, as it gives Rinky a 70.3% chance of winning this one (60.47% implied). \n\nOverall, I think Hijikata should be a bigger favorite here. This won't be pretty, but he's the more consistent player by far, and I simply see a bit of a level gap here. Some books have a worse price on this, but I would take it down to around -165. \n\nNote: The [POTD Capper Tracker](https://potd.lol), which you may remember from its Google Sheet days, is finally back in a cleaner, more robust website format!

Last time it happened was week 4 for a whole 2.5 quarters until Lamar was taken out of the game. Now Likely did get 0 receptions that game but as mentioned, Lamar was not in the whole time and it was Likely's first game back from  a fractured foot from over the summertime.\n\nAs Tyler Huntley clearly does not care much for Likely given he has 26 yards from 5 receptions over the 3 games they've played together, we'll be looking at 2024 stats. Leaving out playoffs (which would make all these stats better mind you), Likely has been average 3.5 targets with 2.6 receptions, 29.8 receiving yards, and 11.4 Yards Per Reception per game. It's clear that he's got some good chemistry with Lamar.\n\nAnother aspect I want to look at is offensive snap share percentages. Aside from week 4 (where he played 45% of all snaps) and week 7 where I could not find data, Likely has played over 50% of the offensive snaps in each game.\n\nNow let's look at the Dolphins. They've given up the most fantasy points to Tight Ends this season. Opposing TEs have an average of just under 11 yards per reception (450 yards from 41 receptions). Dolphins also play zone nearly 70% of the time vs man, which Likely seemed to do better in last year. All these factors add up to what should be an explosive game to get Likely really going this season\n\nBOL everyone tailing!\n\n[http://buymeacoffee.com/Pefkov](http://buymeacoffee.com/Pefkov)",

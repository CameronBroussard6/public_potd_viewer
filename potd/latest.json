The Cardinals are coming into this game after a 27-17 win over the Cowboys as 4 point underdogs. The Seahawks are coming off a 38-14 win over Washington as 3 point favorites. Seattle is 9-1 in its last 10 games versus the Cardinals. __The Seahawks won their first meeting of the season in Arizona 23-20 in Week 4 when Jason Myers kicked a 52 yard field goal for the game winner as time expired. Cardinals QB Kyler Murray threw 41 times that game, only rushing 17 times.__ That should continue this week, despite the Cardinals starting Jacoby Brissett at QB.\n\nThe Cardinals having been throwing it a ton with QB Jacoby Brissett filling in for Kyler Murray. __Arizona ranks 2nd as the most pass happy team in the NFL via Pass Rate Over Expectation. In his first 2 starts, both losses, Brissett averaged 40 attempts per game, exceeding 36 in both games.__ Last week vs the Cowboys on Monday Night Football Dallas pooped the bed & the Cardinals won by 10 running the clock down with 29 rushes. The Cowboys looked rough buff it’s a different matchup this week. __The Seahawks are favored by 6.5 points with an offense that is rocking & rolling. Seattle QB Sam Darnold has this unit operating at an elite level. Seattle ranks 1st in dropback success rate & 2nd in dropback EPA/play.__ The Seahawks run game has been trash. Seattle RB’s Kenneth Walker & Zach Charbonnet haven't been able to generate much on the ground this year. __Seattle currently ranks 23rd in rush success rate & 27th in rush EPA/play.__ All of the Seahawks' offensive success runs through Darnold. __Darnold ranks 1st in the NFL in both EPA/play & success rate, & is also 3rd in Completion Percentage Over Expected (CPOE).__ Through 8 games, Sam has completed 70+% of his passes with 16 TD’s & 2,084 yards, while turning the ball over just 5 times. __With Seattle, Darnold leads the NFL in the rate of passing plays that gain 10+ yards (39.3%) & the rate of passing plays that gain 20+ yards (14.8%). This had led to 43.4% of Seattle's sets of downs to reach 3rd down, the 6th best rate in the NFL.__ With the heavy passing attack the Seahawks are running a ton plays. __Seattle is averaging 65.3 plays per game, 4th most in the NFL. This has enabled the Seahawks to average 28.9 points per game (5th in NFL). Seattle has outscored opponents by a league high 72 points in the 1st half this season (134-62).__ This sets up the Cardinals & QB Jacoby Brissett to throw the hell out of the ball.\n\nWith Seattle’s high powered offensive attack, opponents have been forced to chunk the ball. __The Seahawks defense is facing an average of 37 pass attempts per game, including more than 40 in 50% of their games.__ This is set up for a huge pass funnel for a Cardinals team that’s been passing it a ton lately. __Over the last 3 weeks since Brissett took over, Arizona has averaged 37 pass attempts per game (5th most in the NFL) & 2.9 more than the offense had attempted all season. The Cardinals are throwing the ball 6% over expectation.__ This has proven that the Cardinals rely more on Brissett’s arm over the confidence on the Cardinals legs. __Arizona has struggled to run the ball this year & they currently sit at 28th in rushing success rate. They’re going to have a tough time vs a Seattle run defense that ranks 8th in success rate vs the run.__ This is even more significant now that James Conner (ankle injury out for season) & Trey Benson (meniscus injury had surgery) are out for this game. __The Cardinals are down to their 3rd & 4th string RB’s. This is significant because Arizona has trailed for 27.1% of its offensive snaps, 2nd lowest rate in the NFL. While Seattle has trailed for 19.6% of its offensive snaps, the lowest rate in the NFL. Also Arizona has been outscored by 54 points (83-29) in the 4th quarter this season, worst margin in the league.__ But things have turned around under Brissett. __44.6% of Arizona's sets of downs have reached third down under Jacoby Brissett (14th) compared to 54.4% under Kyler Murray (29th). Arizona has converted a league best 56.1% of its 3rd downs (23 of 41) under Brissett.__ What is even more significant is that Brissett set an NFL record last week. __Jacoby Brissett has thrown 25 career interceptions in 1,873 pass attempts. That’s an INT rate of 1.3%, the NFL’s all time record per PFF.__ The Cards trust him & don’t trust their ground game, & if they want to keep up with a Seahawks team that’s slings it they’re going to have to air it out. I was going to post passing yards instead of completions but Seattle is elite in allowing deep passes. __The Seahawks allow the 2nd fewest yards per completion (8.9) in the NFL.__ This is setting a game where Brissett dinks & dunks his way downfield.\n\nSeattle will beat up this weak Cardinals pass defense. Jacoby will throw it a ton to keep up. \n\n__Jacoby Brissett o34.5 pass attempts__\n\nAppreciate the love!

Colts are projected to win with a spread of 6.5 and -310 Moneyline. Colts have the fourth best rush defense currently and the 26th best passing defense. With a high likelihood of Falcons to be trailing like they have the last 3 games, and a hard rush defense, there will be many more passes than rushes. Further evidence is Penix's pass attempts line being set pretty high at 34.5\n\nNow for Allgeier himself. While he has been averaging over 26 yards per game, his last three have been mediocre. Week 7 he had gotten a knee/hip injury which have been limited his carries and yards. The last three weeks, Allgeier has gotten 10 carries for 26 total yards. Now, he was taken off the injury report week 9 against the Patriots, yet played lower offensive snaps than week 8 (30% compared to 40%) and managed 2 carries for 6 yards. I still believe his knee/hip is affecting him. Note that the falcons have trailed majority, if not the entirety of all 3 games, which im expecting to continue \n\nIm expecting a very pass heavy game from the falcons with Bijan getting majority of the carries.\n\nBOL to anyone tailing!\n\n[Tips Greatly Appreciated  ☕](https://buymeacoffee.com/pefpef)",

      "text": "Record: 20-12\n\nLast Five Predictions (Old - New): ❌❌✅ ✅❌\n\nNet Units: +16.61\n\nYesterday's Pick: South Shields HT/FT v Kings Lynn 4u @ $2.30❌\n\nSouth Shields scored a couple of minutes in which was great, and went into the break in front. However, Kings Lynn made it 1-1 early into the second half and that's how it stayed. \n\nSouth Shields had some chances in the second half to make it 2-0, unfortunately none were converted.\n\nToday's Pick:  Erling Haaland to score vs Liverpool 3u @ $1.72\n\nI'm going for the big game of the day which isn't usually something I do - but when you've got a game like this, you've almost got to. \n\nCity and Liverpool have played some classics in recent seasons. \n\nI'm going Haaland to score. You can combine it with 2+ shots on target for $2.25, or combine it with City to win or draw for $2, but I won't get fancy. \n\nThis season's City side are designed to feed Haaland the ball... No two ways about it. \n\nHe has 13 goals in 10 games, and none of them are penalties. In fact. In the Premier League, City's second highest scorer is a Burnley defender who scored two own goals.... From there, it's only singles. \n\nBut it's not really outperforming numbers. \n1.08 xG per 90\n4.5 shots per 90\n2.6 shots on target per 90\n7.24 touches in the opposition box per 90\n\nAnd out of all those shots he's had this season, only one has been outside of the box (and it was barely outside). \n\nHe's having an insane season, and City are feeding him as much as possible.\n\nTbh, there's been a bit of doom and gloom around City's gameplan this season - for me though, if you've got Haaland, you may as well do this.\n\nYes.... If he's injured, you're cooked (or need to pivot and do something else).... but this City side isn't as good as they have been in the recent past, it doesn't matter how you play, if Haaland is out, you're cooked regardless. So you may as well play like you've got the best striker on the planet on your side. \n\nIt will be interesting to see how both teams line up. Liverpool signed a bunch of attacking talent in the offseason (even the defenders they signed were attacking players) and struggled to combine them all into a lineup that doesn't a) cop a million chances, b) isolate Mo Salah completely, and c) play about 3 people out of their best position. \n\nNow, they've gone back to what's largely the same lineup as last season, and have been better, which makes sense. \n\nI expect Liverpool to do something similar to what they did vs Real Madrid with the only new outfielders starting being Ekitike and Wirtz. \n\nCity will have selection choices to make too. Foden, Doku, and Cherki all look good but starting all 3 could be an issue without Rodri. Against Bournemouth they did it by having a Silva and Gonzalez double pivot, and they might do it again, but Silva as a DM is never an ideal situation. \n\nI still think there will be chances in this game, and I like City to win. And realistically, if City are scoring in this game, there's a massive likelihood that Haaland is the one to do it. \n\nI know Haaland hasn't got the absolute best record vs Liverpool considering he's a goal machine, but the team has never really been so reliant on him getting the ball as they are this season.",

Manchester City is in excellent form but has conceded goals in their last four matches, showing some vulnerability at the back. Liverpool, fresh off a morale-boosting win against Real Madrid, is regaining their rhythm and has a strong scoring record at the Etihad, finding the net in eight of their last nine visits. \n\nHistorically, their head-to-head clashes rarely surpass five goals, with the last five meetings all finishing under 5.5 goals. Given the stakes, City aiming to isolate second place with a slight edge over Chelsea, and Liverpool looking to push up to second with 21 points, both teams will be cautious yet competitive. Arsenal’s draw today adds an extra layer of tactical discipline likely to influence this game’s approach. Initially, over 2.5 goals seemed probable, but the odds being equal and the consistent trend towards under 5.5 goals, especially in such tightly contested fixtures, make the under more appealing. Expect an intense, well-fought match, with goals at both ends but no goal-fest.",

For Philly, once again it will be the Maxey show with VJ as an inconsistent secondary. This Raptors team has its best team available, and they continue to play well together, with all starters contributing each game. They are 7-2 ATS ad 8-1 SU in the L9 games. The 6ers have lost 4 ATS in a row. Add in that the Raptors have much better depth and rotations, and I’ll happily bet on the underdog.\n\n \n\n*If you’ve enjoyed these picks, tips are always appreciated:* [Coffee Link](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/TheBrat)",

      "text": "POTD Record: 6 - 1\n\n\nNet Profit : +7.9 Units\n\n\nPrevious Pick: Draymond Green Over 10.5 RA @1.67 3.5u to win 2.3u ( PENDING )\n\n\nEvent: NBA | Hornets @ Pacers\n\n\nPOTD:  Miles Bridges Over 21.5 @1.79 3u to win 2.3u\n\n\nWrite Up:  \n \n\n\nBridges has pretty much been the Hornets’ go-to guy whenever they need someone to actually get a bucket. With all the injuries and the up-and-down play from the rest of the roster, he usually ends up with a solid chunk of the offense, and that usage jumps even more when Tre Mann or Brandon Miller aren’t fully out there. He’s the one they trust late in the shot clock or when they need someone to create something on their own.\n\n\nThe matchup helps a ton too. Indiana’s defense just isn’t the same without Hali and the other guys they’re missing. They don’t really have that big, physical wing who can stay in front of Bridges, so forwards like him usually get good looks specially in the mid-range .\n\n\nAnd the nice part is Bridges isn’t one-dimensional. He gets points in transition, he can pull up in the mid-range, and he’ll hit spot-ups or pops from 3s. Because he scores in so many different ways, he doesn’t need a perfect shooting night to get past 21.5.\n\n\nIn games like this, he usually ends up taking around 15–20 FGs, and if that happens again, he’s basically sitting right in the 22+ range without needing anything crazy. It’s just a good spot for him.\n\n\nMILES BRIDGES OVER 21.5 ",

Can’t win them all.\n\nTodays pick is the definitely rogue to what people expect on this thread lol. Women’s cricket isn’t exactly top of the agenda for most people including me. \n\nFirst and foremost from the outside looking in this seems a weird pick as Sydney thunder a 0-3 facing the Scorchers who are 2-2. However, The thunder are punching way below their weight and should find their form and get rolling at home - a ground which favours the bowling attack, of which they have the better! \n\nBack them to get the job done and wake up to some great profit. Really confident with this pick and backing with 3 Units.\n\n If you appreciate my picks, any tip is appreciated link below for the research etc.\n\nhttps://paypal.me/PaymePlease9937\n\nBOL to those tailing and as always, see you on the other side  🫡🫡🫡",

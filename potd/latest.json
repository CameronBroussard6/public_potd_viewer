Cirstea once again had 5 break opportunities, but only converted 1 of them this time instead of all 5, and it was a straightforward (6-4), (6-4) affair.\n\nMarkkanen has the Suns number for scoring this year, with 33 points midway through the 4th last I checked . He put up 51 points last game in a OT win vs them. They’re going to lose this time around, but he still showed up to make this a very sweat-free win for us. \n\n——————————————————\n\n**Today’s Pick** - **Fernadez ML vs Mboko and Over 21.5 games** (**+200**) bet365 **2 units**\n\n——————————————————\n\n**Hong Kong WTA 3:30AM EST** starts in approximately 3 hours\n\n——————————————————\n\nI’m going back to Hong Kong and sticking with Leylah again. I linked the write up to my previous pick above, if you want to read my analysis prognosticating her match vs Cirstea. \n\nIn this one, we have a clash of countrywomen, with Canada’s rising phenom Victoria Mboko facing Canadian #1 Leylah Fernandez. This is their first meeting, so there’s no data on that front, but there’s plenty else to analyze and try to infer upon.\n\nSo far in Hong Kong, Fernandez has annihilated every opponent, winning all three matches in clean straight sets.\n\nShe plays very well historically in this tournament, winning it in 2023 and reaching the semifinals last year.\n\nI watched Leylah’s match against Cirstea, and it’s clear that she’s in excellent form. Her return was excellent and she used it to absolutely punish Cirstea’s second serve — winning 71% of those points.\n\nComparing this match to their last match in Osaka this month, something that stands out is that Fernandez won 74.4% of her first serve points this time versus only 57.9% in Osaka. \n\nShe’s been incredibly consistent in that area, winning 75.9% vs her first round opponent Wang and 77.4% vs Lys in the 2nd round. \n\nHer serve is dialed in right now and I don’t see that changing against Mboko.\n\nMboko has been good too, but hasn’t had as clean of a run to the semifinals, needing 3 sets to beat World #134 Gibson and #51 Eala along the way. She had a nice win against #35 Kalinskaya, last round, although she retired in the second set.\n\nEala is a lefty like Fernandez and similar in some regards, albeit an inferior player, and gave Mboko some trouble.\n\nMboko has a good serve, particularly her first serve, putting up good 1st in and similar 1st win percentages to Leylah. \n\nHer second serve can be susceptible, as evidenced by her recent match against Rybakina in which she only won 18% of her second serves.\n\nA similar story to what happened to Cirstea against Fernandez.\n\nLeylah has significantly more consistent 2nd serve win percentages over the season, and I think that it’s plausible that might separate them and decide the match. \n\nBoth players will want to win this match and prove themselves the best Canadian. I expect this to be tightly contested, but Leylah’s brilliant form and her experience edge over the young Mboko will carry her to victory in 3 sets. \n\nThe over 21.5 games also covers a close two set win: (7-6, 6-4/3) and (7-5, 6-4). \n\nDon’t bet more than you can afford, and keep in mind that it is a long odds pick, keeping with my strategy. Not every pick will hit, and I only need 45-50% to make solid profit in the long run.\n\nBOL",

In one corner we have Vanderbilt, led by senior Diego Pavia. The Commodores are ranked inside the top ten for the first time since the 1940s with him under center, and their lone loss on the season was against Bama. Vandy has been taking care of business in conference play so far this season, and they’re coming off of a close win against a ranked Missouri squad.\n\nIn the other corner we have Texas. Led by future commercial actor Arch Manning, the longhorns strike me as the ultimate paper tiger. Sure they dominated rival Oklahoma, but that performance was preceded by an ugly loss to Florida and followed up with 2 narrow wins against SEC bottom dwellers Kentucky and Mississippi State. To make matters worse, Arch Manning is dealing with a concussion he suffered last week and yet he has been cleared to play.\n\nThis is a must win for both teams and the pressure will be palpable. I think this will ultimately come down to which QB executes better, and my money isn’t on Arch. Between the injury troubles and high expectations at home, I’m picking the Commodores to continue their last hurrah season with Pavia by getting a win in Austin. BOL to those who tail. Let’s do some winning!",

Always feels good to win early.\n\nAlright, to the next one. Rutgers heads to Champaign, and while the number looks tempting for an over, the math — and the vibes — say otherwise.\n\nLet’s start with the Scarlet Knights. On the road this year, Rutgers have only hit the over once in three tries — and that was the emotional game for Athan Kaliakmanis’s first trip back to his old stadium against his old team. Outside of that anomaly? The Rutgers stay pretty tamed on the road. They’re averaging just 25 points on the road while giving up 31.\n\nFlip it to Illinois: They have hit the over just once in their four home games. They’re averaging 35 points at home while holding opponents to a tidy 17 on average. That defense has taken some serious hits and has given up an average of 39.5 points per game over the last 6 weeks. And yes, I agree, it looks bad. However, I expect some serious adjustments — and a bit of pride — to kick in for Saturday's matchup.\n\nIllinois is also staring down back-to-back losses for the first time this season. They haven’t dropped three straight since 2022, so you know they’re coming in focused. I don’t see them turning this into a track meet — more like a grind-it-out, Big Ten-style “get-right” game. Expect clock control, methodical drives, and a few stalled red-zone trips.\n\nCould it get high scoring? Sure. But a shootout? Nah. Not with these trends, not with this motivation.\n\nI’m buying up a few points and hammering Under 65.5.

The Texas Longhorns come in off a 45-38 OT win on the road against Mississippi State to move to 6-2 on the year, including 3-1 within the SEC. Vandy is rocking & rolling, especially now that Theo Vonn is banging Vandy’s QB’s mom, they are looking to continue to keep it going vs a Texas defense that just gave up 38 points vs a bad Mississippi State offense.\n\nHey sorry I just saw this. Idk if this is going to be my pick but just thought I’d share my research. Look at this shit\n\nVandy RB’s have faced a stacked box (7+ defenders) on 77% of carries, 4th most in NCAA \n\nThey are averaging an absurd 7.3 yards per carry, most in NCAA. For context Ashton Jeanty only averaged 6.2 yards per rush vs a stacked box last year\n\nVandy tackles well & Texas has struggled to break tackles. Texas ranks 89th in yards after contact. Vandy ranks 20th in yards after contact allowed. \n\nSark’s West Coast spread offense tends to create light boxes with less defenders. 60% of their runs have been vs light boxes. Vs light boxes they only average 4.4 yards per carry, ranked 104th. \n\nThey’ll either starting Arch or Caldwell. Caldwell was a backup at Troy last year. He had a 49% on target pass rate on throws 10+ yards downfield ranked 130th. Even if Arch starts his on target rate is 51%. \n\nAlso Texas offensive line sucks and Arch has been pressured at an insanely high rate. The OL ranks 113th in pressure rate allowed, worst in SEC.\n\n*Writeup incoming*\n\n__Vanderbilt +3__\n\nAppreciate the love!

However, I don't necessarily think it was the best play, because Rosenkranz was definitely the better player, and I feel that I should have known that he would succeed in that matchup. \n\nToday, I'm going with Henry Bernet to beat Thiago Agustin Tirante in the first round of Athens qualifying. This is the first year that this event is being hosted in Greece (moved from Belgrade, Serbia after last year), so it's hard to know exactly how the conditions will play. However, it can be expected that they will be reasonably fast, as with most indoor events around this time of year (with the notable exception of Paris. 18-year-old Henry Bernet is one of the top Swiss prospects right now, having won the Australian Open Juniors at the beginning of the year and drawn comparisons to Roger Federer with his one-handed backhand. Injuries have significantly affected his schedule this year, meaning he hasn't made a ton of noise on the pro tour yet, but that doesn't matter too much to me after the match he played against Jakub Mensik in Basel. Bernet's serve and forehand were firing in that match (8 and 7.8 shot quality ratings), and he was able to pull off some really nice shots with the backhand as well, even if it remains inconsistent. I understand why Tirante is favored as the much more proven and well-rounded player, but two big things would concern me about backing the Argentinian here. First, he's never really been an indoor player, even if his fast-court game might be slightly underrated. Second, he's had a pretty packed schedule recently, switching from clay to indoor hard last week and coming here with just a day of rest after losing to Lajal in Bratislava. The odds movement on this play has been a bit weird, as Bernet moved down to 2.24 from an opening price of 2.48 before swinging all the way back to this price. However, my prediction is that this is the highest you'll see him, and these odds present 1 unit of value to me. \n\nNote: The [POTD Capper Tracker](https://potd.lol), which you may remember from its Google Sheet days, is finally back in a cleaner, more robust website format!

William Saliba and Gabriel are one of the best defensive partnerships in the Premier League, and David Raya in goal has been making excellent saves, meaning Arsenal almost never concede goals at home or away. Burnley are sitting 16th in the league with only 10 points from 9 games and have struggled badly to score, especially when playing against big teams like Arsenal. Scott Parker's team is very defensive and they have missing several key attacking players who are injured for a long time. Arsenal are the league leaders and are hungry to keep winning, so they will control the game completely and not let Burnley have any chances to score. With Arsenal in their best defensive form of the season and Burnley struggling to score against anyone, this is one of the safe picks for today. \n\n\nIf you found these picks helpful, tips or donations are greatly appreciated as they support the time and effort I put into creating them: [buy me a beer🍻](https://buymeacoffee.com/hercules.son.of.zeus)",

Also being afraid to cop a corner or foul someone changes the way you defend too. \n\nBurnley probably look like the most likely club to go down at the moment, but they have been a lot better at home and have only conceded two goals in four home games. \n\nIn fact their 4 home games have only had a total of 8 goals.\n\nGranted, Burnley have played the other two promoted teams at home, but they've also had Liverpool and Forest. And while those sides aren't as good as they were last season, they'd still expect to beat Burnley.\n\nIn Arsenal's four away games they're 3-0-1, with that loss being the crazy Liverpool free kick.\n\nArsenal 4 away games have only had a total of 6 goals so far. \n\nI think Burnley are going to sit deep, keep things very tight but it won't be enough. \n\nI like the u3.5 goals instead of the 2.5 for a few reasons... But at these odds I like having an extra goal up my sleeve. \n\nAlso, Gabriel is $3.60 to have a shot on target which I think is great value as he's a beast at corners.",

Though loss last time, Mbappé failed the penalty, then the goal offside and the endless chances where both teams could've scored on the second half. \n\n\n\n\n\nEPL Combo Pick: Brentford Over 0.5 + Liverpool vs Aston Villa BTTS\n\nCrystal Palace versus Brentford is a matchup that historically screams goals. Looking at the last six meetings between these sides, all six have seen both teams find the net, with the average fixture producing 1.56 goals from Brentford and 1.33 from Palace. This isn't by accident, it's the nature of how these two play.\n\nWhat's most compelling about Brentford right now is the quality they're bringing to every attack. Over the 2024-25 season, the Bees recorded the highest xG-per-shot in the entire Premier League at 0.15, bettering even champions Liverpool who sat at 0.14. They've been clinical, efficient, and prolific throughout the campaign, averaging 1.28 xG per match while taking a sharp 10.67 shots per game. Igor Thiago, Daamsgard and Kevin Schade have formed a genuinely destructive attacking unit that has blown away most defences they've faced. At Selhurst Park, Brentford are conceding goals at a higher rate away from home at 75 percent compared to Crystal Palace's 75 percent at home, creating the ideal environment for a goalfest. I'm backing Brentford to score at least once, they've been too good to ignore in the final third.\n\nLiverpool versus Aston Villa is where the real story unfolds. Liverpool's defensive issues are becoming increasingly difficult to ignore, and Villa possess the attacking prowess to exploit them comprehensively. In their last 10 meetings, both sides have scored in nine of those matches, delivering consistent BTTS outcomes. Looking at the broader picture, Liverpool are conceding at an alarming 63 percent rate this season, while the Reds themselves maintain a 97 percent scoring rate across all competitions. Aston Villa, having won four in a row heading into this fixture, have shown they can trouble elite defences. Liverpool's home record against Villa specifically shows BTTS landing in 75 percent of matches, with the Reds scoring in every single game at Anfield in their current data set while Villa managed to put the ball past them in 50 percent of away visits. Both teams averaging 1.8 and 1.4 goals respectively over their recent runs means the 3.5 goal line feels realistic. Liverpool will score because they always do at home, but Villa have the tools and form to breach Liverpool's backline and make this interesting. Expect both teams to get on the scoresheet.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's cash it!\n\n\n\n\nPS: Glad to hear so many of you are enjoying the write-ups and making profits from the tips!

Arsenal is a different beast though. They have the best defense in the world and even on games where their opponents park the bus like Burnley will most likely do, their set pieces efficiency comes into effect. I expect a professional 0-2 win for Arsenal.",

His career match-win rate of ~55.7% and frame-win rate over 53% indicate that he is consistently stronger than a break-even player. Meanwhile, Wells hovers just above 50% for both match and frame wins, suggesting Ford has a higher ceiling in head-to-head play. Adding to that, Ford’s strong performance in opening matches (winning ~61.5% of his first-in-tournament matches) gives him a psychological and practical advantage when starting a fresh event like the International Championship.\n\nFurthermore, Ford’s recent dominance over Wells…including two convincing wins in 2025…suggests he understands how to exploit Wells’s game under pressure. If Ford brings the same tactical discipline and capitalizes on early frames, he’s well-positioned to control the match rhythm and come out on top. \n\nAs always, BOL and stick to the unit system, snooker can be a silly sport but Tom Ford is a solid veteran that I think can pull through in this match. Let’s get back on a little win streak!",

They don’t park the bus; they press, they open spaces, and when they fall behind, the game turns chaotic fast.\n\nEstrela are just as wild. They can look compact one week and then explode into a shoot-out the next (see their 2.6 xG home blitz against AVS). They give up big looks on the road — over 2 xG conceded away to Gil Vicente — and they’ll probably try to trade punches again here.\n\nAdd both together and you get two teams who live around the 2.5–3.0 expected-goal range most weeks. Neither has the back line to kill tempo, and both have forwards who shoot on sight.\n\nThe market still prices this like a slow, low-scoring grind. It isn’t. Anything north of 2.30 for Over 2.5 is real value — and at 2.37, it’s a bet I’m happy to take.\n⸻\n\nBOL!",

Let's hope it's worth the wait.\n\n**Auxerre v Marseille**\n\n**Auxerre is 17th with only 7 points in 9 games**. Their points came from games against mid-table teams or **relegation sides**: **FC Lorient (16th), Toulouse (9th) & Rennes (10th).** I must admit that Auxerre have had a pretty tough schedule so far with fixtures against teams like PSG, Lens, PSG, Nice & Monaco. But they've also lost all of these matches and haven't managed to upset against any of these teams. **Marseille is 3rd** in the league and is coming off losses against Lens last weekend & Sporting midweek. Overall they are having a good season and with **Greenwood on top of the league in goal contributions** they are looking as far the better team here and 1.70 is way too high of an odd here in my opinion.\n\n**Vitoria Guimaraes v Benfica**\n\n**Vitoria Guimaraes** is normally sitting in European spots in the Portugese top flight. How different is that this season with **only 11 points after 9 games**. With **3rd-place Benfica visiting** them today I think they need to look at next weekend to see if they can get some more points there. Benfica is supplying **topscorer Pavlidis** with enough chances to score **8 so far** in the campaign. With 5 of those being after the last International Break he is looking on fire. Benfica is just the better team here, have the better squad and want to win here to keep up with Sporting and Porto.\n\n**Best of luck if tailing!** 🍀\n\n**PS:** If you want you can check my record and units won on [https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/OliveCritical5134-qXXxJZ](https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/OliveCritical5134-qXXxJZ)",

Bayern will simply be too much for them here. On to the 2nd leg 1st placed Arsenal face bottom of the table Burnley and this is a game where Arsenal simply cannot afford to drop points if they want to stand any chance of winning the league so therefore I expect Arsenal to be motivated enough here to not drop any points and keep their lead at the top of the table.",

Hit under 60’. We move on\n\nToday: England | FA Cup | 2:30pm Eastern | Preston vs Wigan | total goals Over 2 1U @ -140\n\nWrite up: checking out both Preston and Wigans home and away records, total goals, and recent performances, I see at least 2 being scored here, at worst we get a push, but I can definitely see a 2-1 scoreline here. Preston are top 4 in the Championship and Wigan are middling League One side. Debated taking the Preston ML here but there’s always the chance of heading to penalties here, so I’d rather just take the Over 2 total goals. BOL if tailing.",

Need to string some wins to get out of this 6-7u profit rut.\n\n1st Leg - East Bengal has scored 2 or more in 5/6 matches they have played, and have scored 9,5,5 goals in the last 3 matches. Their player quality is well above the rest of the field & should comfortably win here. However, Gokulam is pretty decent in defense, so going conservative & taking a 2 goal asian line for EB to score.\n\n2nd leg - THe HIL has started & most games have been pretty decent goal wise. Both these teams have seen their 2 games hit this mark. I expect the total to end at around 5 or so, but i really want to get out of this rut, so going conservative with a 3 goal asian line.\n\nHope we get the W & BoL",

He had a great game too all around, and looked the most promising for Liverpool to score. I'm bordering fade territory with a couple unfortunate losses, might be best to limit your units or stay away for a few games. These plays are fun for me to back and gives me something to root for during the game, so we keep charging along. \n\nEPL goes on a bit of a break as the FA Cup comes to life this weekend. For those unfamiliar, the FA cup is a cup between pretty much ALL English professional teams, starting with over 700 teams. We are currently in the 3rd round with 64 teams, which is the first round that EPL and Championship teams join the matches. The FA cup is typically more prestigious than the EFL Cup, and the winning team earns an automatic berth in the Europa League next season. In these early rounds, you tend to see Premier League sides play a B team and lower division sides throw their all at the game to try and advance. \n\nFor this match Wrexham, aka Hollywood FC, (9th in 2nd tier) host Nottingham Forest (17th) place in the EPL. Forest are in a proper relegation battle this season, so coach Dyche is going to have to preserve his top players and hope that mostly subs can grab the win here. Worst case he will throw on the bigger names after halftime if it looks grim. Wrexham have played 4 matches since Christmas, but also have a week off after this match so I expect mostly their first team. \n\nTaiwo Awoniyi (Big T) is an easy player to root for. He is a big and powerful center forward who a high motor, great attitude, and works super hard. He has had a really tough go of it over the last year, facing a really serious head injury at the end of last season when he collided with a goalpost. He's had a slew of other injuries this year, but he's finally fit again. This game is a prime game for him to show what he can do and finally get a chance. \n\nThere is really no great data here to back up this play, because the sample size is so small. He scored a goal last season in the FA cup 4th round, but has otherwise struggled to find playing time. But with Wood out, and Kali out on loan, Big T will get his chance here as the team's 2nd striker (Igor Jesus needs a rest). I'm backing that a premier league striker can find the back of the net against a 2nd division back line. \n\nNo doubt this is a risky play, while I feel strongly that Big T will start, **lineups are always a risk in these cup games.** I personally am playing this now, as I expect the odds will go down once he is confirmed starting and lineups are out. But they'll still be plus money, so please do your own research and consider the risk. \n\nBOL and happy Friday!",

Senegal are a very organized, very sturdy team that plays as a unit, is top 10 in the world (in my opinion, FIFA ranks them #19) right now, doesn't concede many chances, and most importantly is consistent. Mali on the other hand keep games very quiet, they're okay-ish defensively, but are a team that's relatively inexperienced and capitulates at most challenges. It's not that they can't go through, but I trust Senegal to finish the job without scoring too many or conceding much.",

Word to Joe & Soggy, and much of the nation, *Indiana is the team everyone is leaning on*, but I can’t find myself to stray from the public - I’m just a bit of a pussy, and I’ll pay for the insurance.\n\nThere’s of course metrics and data and information we can dive into - but honestly, the simple and plain fact of the matter is **Indiana has already beaten Oregon this year, and made them look basic in the process**.\n\nYou can stop reading here if you want - unless you believe the old adage in college football that *”it’s difficult to beat a team twice”*\n\nFor me, when the stage is this big, I have to lean on what makes the most sense to lean on: similar to the first college football playoff game, **I think the more balanced team, with the stronger defensive unit, will win**.\n\n**Indiana are undefeated, they’ve only allowed more than 2 scores in 6 of their last 7 games, they are the number 2 overall defensive unit in the country: they rank in the top 3 in the country in yards against, rush yards against, scoring D & 3rd down D**.\n\nI shall not disregard the fact *Oregon have an elite level defensive unit themselves*, but Indiana have the offensive unit to match in spades: **7th in total offense, 3rd in scoring, the number 1 3rd down offense** - a lot of elite level ingredients to concoct successful playoff football.\n\nAdd to the fact that this feels like the Fernando Mendoza party - we are all just invited. The kid is a stud, and seems un-phased by the limelight. \n\nGive me Indiana by a FG minimum.\n\nLast play review:\n\nCFP - Miami +7.5/Total u56.5 (-119) 1.5u\n\n(PENDING)\n\n***BOL if you’re tailing, and if not BOL in general.***",

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 7-26-3 *It's going to be one of those streaks again, isn't it? Atletico played even better than I expected and overshadowed Real in pretty much every metric (22 shots to 8, 2.43 xG to 1.05, and 9 corners to 1), mental how they just couldn't get it done. And of course it wouldn't be my pick if Valverde didn't score a rocket from 30 odd metres in the second minute. That really just set the tone for the rest of the game. Also,* ***by surprisingly popular demand, I've set up a Buy Me A Coffee page,*** *linked at the bottom of the post, so you can tip me if I've helped you make some money with my (apparently) very fadeable picks. Tips would be greatly appreciated, but are absolutely not mandatory, no pressure y'all, this entertainment will remain free*\n\n**Last Five:** ❌✅❌❌❌\n\n**Event:** Scottish Championship, Ross County v Partick Thistle, 2:45 pm EST\n\n**POTD:** Ross County 0.0 Asian Handicap +135, 1 unit\n\n**Write Up:** From the AFCON and the Spanish Super Cup in Saudi Arabia, the journey takes us to the good old second tier of Scottish football, where I've come across this very interesting matchup. We have the second placed Partick Thistle *(I could swear this team was called Patrick, immersion has just been broken)* travelling to Ross County's ground. Ross County currently sit dead last on measly 13 points, in comparison to Partick's impressive 40.\n\n*The form, as well as H2H also favor the guests,* as Ross County are winless in over 5 league games and they've lost the last three H2H encounters, conceding 7 and scoring just 2 in the process. The home team boasts a terrible goal difference of -18, having scored at a rate of less than a goal per game (18 in 19), while conceding almost twice per game (36 in 19). On the other end, Partick aren't showing many cracks in their game, maintaining a positive goal difference with 33 goals scored and 23 conceded.\n\nSo, why on earth am I then backing Ross County if all the signs point to a Partick Thistle masterclass? Firstly, the **line just seems like a trap,** as at the time of writing, Partick's ML is sitting at +105 odds. Secondly, Ross County are **playing at home,** and I've observed that especially the UK teams tend to get a big morale boost on their own ground. I have already backed the team that was supposed to be the paper favorite in a similar kind of matchup before, **and they've almost always dropped points.** So, I'm not making the same mistake. Taking the Ross County 0.0 Asian Handicap at the beautiful +135 odds because I truly believe in a sneaky Ross County win, while a draw isn't disastrous. This is essentially a DNB pick, but for whatever reason, my book offers slightly higher odds on the 0.0 Asian Handicap. Make sure to check if that's the case in your book too. Going with just the one standard unit because, knowing my luck recently, Ross County are getting hammered 3-0 with all the goals coming after the 80th minute. BOL and let's enjoy another mad clash together ☘️🫡\n\n☘️ ***Want to leave a tip?*** [Click Here](https://buymeacoffee.com/sigmabale)",

That brings me to 4-1, +2.54 units in 2026, and I'm looking to continue my strong form with this pick!\n\nAlexander Bublik comes in to Hong Kong ready to make an impact after an up-and-down 2025 that saw him capture four ATP titles but also win three games in a BO5 match (to be fair, it was against Jannik Sinner). He already got off to a good start against Botic, winning in just under an hour with an 8.36 performance rating, while Shang took down Sonego (7.57) and Comesaña (7.37). The market has been trending towards Shang, as Bublik opened at -200 before dropping to this price, and I completely understand why. Shang is a talented but injury-prone lefty who finally seems to be healthy again, has the crowd behind him, and has a 2-1 H2H advantage in this matchup. However, there's also a pretty simple case for Bublik: he's the better overall player, and his serve does so much damage on these courts. Shang is certainly a crafty player who demands patience in rallies, but Bublik has started to show a willingness to not bail out early with a drop-shot or slap forehand. The two matches where Shang beat Bublik came in late 2024, a low point in Bublik's career where he didn't seem to enjoy being on court, and yet Bublik was still able to keep those matches quite competitive (with one going to five sets). This is a big step up in competition for Shang, and I see Bublik coming through here.",

They are awful, especially defensively. The Mammoth might score 5 by themselves. Only the Anaheim Ducks have given up more goals this year. Hofer will be in goal, who has been better than Binnington, but the defense is so bad it’s hard to trust anyone in net.\n\nOn the other side, Vejmelka has started 4 games in a row, so it seems possible that they go to the backup Vanecek in this one. He’s only got 2 wins in net this year with a .879 save percentage and 2.92 GAA.\n\nGood Luck!",

ARISTOPOLOS $1.55         \n**Write Up:** Our pick today ARISTOPOLOS returns to the races after a month and looks primed to win again in similar fashion to his debut. We come up against a few horses from that debut race and it’s hard to see them turning the tables on our pick despite the small weight swing.    \n    \nIn that debut run, we drew barrier 1 (like we do here), but instead of using that to advantage, we stepped slowly and ended up 7/8 in the run. Despite this, we still won running away by over 2 lengths, running the fastest last 200m split of the race by a fair bit.     \n    \nTrainer has indicated that the desire is to lead this race, or at very worst be 2nd/3rd in run, which would be ideal as there’s nothing in this race that could match our last 400/200 split. Natural development and 2nd race start will help all horses, but I don’t think any horse from the debut race can reverse that result regardless, and the first starters haven’t shown much.    \n\nOdds aren’t flash here sorry.

He's mentally weak in big moments - however he's just starting his season off in a small ATP 250 so shouldn't be any nerves, and beat Yibing Wu who's in good form recently (beat Medvedev, Korda late last season) and beat marozsan in straight sets. He beat Yibing Wu 6-2 and 6-1 last couple sets after dropping the first which is a steamroll, and indicates he found his groove at the end of the match.\n\n \n\nBorges is an all-around solid player, but his mobility is mid so he is prone to being hit through. His power is decent but not great - good fundamentals but no big weapons. He's playing decently right now having beat Cilic (big server, old, no mobility) and Dzumhur (short clay specialist, good mobility 0 power). I think Rublev's power will be too much for him here, as has been historically with their record. Don't see borges winning this unless Rublev completely doesn't show up or gets injured. I would give Rublev an \\~80% chance of winning this, so this line is good value. I actually got it at -220 when it first came out so getting worse odds than what you guys can get.",

Indiana coach Curt Cignetti came into Indiana & completely changed the program. In the 3 years before Cignetti’s arrival Indiana had a 9-27 record. Since his hiring he has led Indiana to its only two 10 win seasons in school history, with a 25-2 record in 2 seasons, & they are currently undefeated playing for the national title. Cignetti was a former Nick Saban assistant so it makes sense how he has the blueprint for success. Interestingly, all 4 head coaches left in the playoffs were at one point on Saban's staff. That includes Oregon coach Dan Lanning who also has only lost 2 games in the past 2 seasons & is coming off a 23-0 win over #4 Texas Tech. Despite a 23-0 win, Oregon didn’t look great as they had a net success rate just above 5%. Lanning attempted 8 4th down conversions, converting just 4 & went 4 for 19 on 3rd downs. TT’s offense also isn’t as strong as its 39.4 ppg suggests, ranking just 41st in offense FEI. Now Oregon looks to get revenge after their previous loss vs Indiana, which was a slugfest. \n\nIndiana’s defense stole the show in the 1st game, holding Oregon to just 13 offensive points. Oregon’s offense had just a 39.7% success rate. Oregon QB Dante Moore was sacked 6 times, the 3rd most sacks taken by an Oregon QB since 2014. He was pressured a massive 20 times. Indiana’s 50% pressure rate was the highest rate Oregon had allowed since 2020. But Moore is getting the ball out much faster in the 2nd half of the season. He went from averaging 2.8 seconds throw time down to around 2.3. But that hasn’t helped much as he has thrown 3 INTs in the playoffs, including a 0-1 TD-INT ratio vs TT. He’s had at least 1 TO worthy play in 5 of his last 6 games. Indiana ranks #1 in the nation in TO margin (+18). Moore has also struggled in the red zone, owning negative EPA when passing inside the 20. Oregon ranks just 47th in TD rate in the red zone. Indiana ranks No. 1 in TD rate allowed (26%). Oregon’s biggest success in the red zone has come from RB Jordon Davison, who is tied for 13th in rushing TDs nationally. Davison averaged 7.4 ypc vs Indiana in Week 7. But he has been ruled out with a broken clavicle. Oregon also just lost RB Jayden Limar to the portal. This is a major concern for Oregon’s offense since they run the 3rd most 2RB packages in the country. OC Will Stein runs a Sean McVay inspired offense utilizing 2RB’s/2TE’s. When these teams first met 52% of Oregon’s plays were in those formations, but that rate has jumped to 65% recently. Indiana allows just 3.4 yards per run (18th) vs 2RB/2TE formations. 48% of the Oregon’s carries go to the outside, they avg 6.6 yards/run. Indiana allows just 2.6 yards/carry (3rd nationally) against outside zone concepts, with the highest stuff rate and the most TFLs. Another issue with Davison being out is he ranks #2 among Big Ten RBs by PFF on pass blocking snaps, which will be tough to replace. It’s unlikely they pressure Moore 20 times again, but Indiana does currently rank 13th in pressure rate generated. However this is a new-look defensive front for Indiana since Week 7. Indiana will be without edge rusher Stephen Daley, who was injured in the Big Ten title. Because of this they primarily went with a 3 DL look vs Bama. Oregon has averaged 5.8 ypc vs 3 DL (7th) but that number is skewed by weak defenses in James Madison, USC, & Minnesota. Texas Tech has a much more similar DL to Indiana & used 3 DL sets 17 times. They held Oregon to just 2.4 ypc & a negative EPA/play. In their last matchup Indiana went to 3 DL sets just 6 times, holding Oregon to -2.0 ypc. Indiana’s defense will look much different this time around, but their offense will as well.\n\nIndiana’s offense has been elite this season. Heisman QB Fernando Mendoza has led their offense to rank #1 in EPA/Play. They’ve lost just 8 turnovers (3rd), they rank 1st in 3rd down conversion rate (56.5%), & they’ve scored on 91.2% of their red zone possessions (17th). Ranking 8th in net drive starting field possession, every drive starts off on the right foot. Mendoza has been the most consistent QB in football. He has not been sacked nor turned the ball over on first down through 14 games. Mendoza ranks top 5 in throws of 20+ yards & leads the nation with a 13% explosion rate. Against passes of 20+ air yards, Oregon ranks 86th in EPA/play allowed & 95th in completion percentage (39.3%), without a single INT of 20+ yards. Mendoza’s depth of target has increased over the last several weeks with the emergence of Charlie Becker. Before Week 11, Becker had 8 career targets. Since then Becker is the #2 PFF graded WR with 21 catches for 399 yards, & 2 TDs. He has destroyed man coverage. Oregon runs man coverage at the 12th highest rate in the NCAA. Becker ranks 3rd in yards per route run (4.7) vs man. He has a contested catch rate of 83% (12th in NCAA). Since Becker’s breakout Indiana ranks 6th in yards per pass (11.2) & 10th in success rate (52.6%) vs man, including 2 great defenses in Bama & Ohio St who ran man on 59% of plays. Since the first matchup between these teams, Indiana has dropped back against man the 13th most times in the nation & has allowed just a 31.7% pressure rate. Indiana relies heavily on quick dropbacks & Mendoza’s ability to get the ball out quickly helps avoid pressure. Indiana uses quick dropbacks 47% of plays (20th most). When forced into traditional dropbacks Mendoza has been even more elite, averaging 12.1 yards per pass (2nd). Another factor will be Mendoza vs blitzes. Oregon ranks 31st in total blitzes & has blitzed 27 times this playoffs. Last game vs Bama, Mendoza went 9/10 for 167 yards, 3 TDs, 0 INTs, & 27 rushing yards vs the blitz. The pass success & recent emergence of Becker has made the offense more vertical, which has opened up the run. Indiana ran on 71% of snaps vs Alabama. Oregon who has stopped opposing RB’s for zero/negative yards just 15% of plays (88th). This happened in the first game as 8 of Indiana’s 11 carries gained 3+ yards. Indiana has also been incredibly disciplined this year. They committed just 50 penalties this year (8th), with 11 on defense (1st). They’ve only lost 380 yards to penalties. They’re the only team left in the playoffs with a positive Total EPA via penalties (9.21). Oregon has 71 penalties giving up 703 yards. They rank last in Total EPA via penalties at -30.19 of the remaining teams.\n\nIndiana is going to play steady efficient ball. But the difference will be in the redzone, where Indiana has shined & Oregon has struggled.\n\n__Indiana -3__\n\nAppreciate the love!

Pellegrino Matarazzo, Real Sociedad's new head coach, emphasized the need for aggressive ball recovery and a high pressing game, noting that his team has struggled with creativity in the final third this season. Following a positive performance in his debut against Atlético Madrid, Matarazzo's setup with a 4-4-2 formation and vertical attacking play has shown signs of rejuvenating the team's offense, particularly through Oyarzabal and Méndez linking up with Kubo and Guedes. The coach acknowledged that Sociedad's games tend to open up after halftime, making it more likely to see goals in the latter stages. On the other hand, José Bordalás of Getafe is facing a defensive crisis, with key absentees like Djené, Duarte, and Abqar, leaving the team with no natural center-backs for the match. Bordalás, known for his disciplined defensive approach, has expressed concern over the lack of defensive solidity, admitting that his team might struggle to maintain their usual compact shape. With Getafe likely to sit deeper and look for counterattacks, Bordalás's side will have limited ability to resist Sociedad's intense attacking play. Given the injury-hit Getafe squad and Matarazzo's pressing game, goals seem inevitable, especially as Getafe's defense is weakened, and Sociedad will look to exploit the spaces left open. All signs point to a match that will likely see over 1.5 goals, with both teams adapting to their respective tactical needs but struggling to prevent goals.",

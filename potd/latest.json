It is what it is. \n\nPlay of the Day:  Kentucky vs Florida over 153.5 (-110 FD) 1U\n\nI like the over 153.5 in this matchup because the tempo and scoring profiles both point toward a high total. It’s not necessarily that either Kentucky or Florida plays bad defense, but both teams give up a lot of points largely because of how fast they play and how many possessions they create. The pace leads to more shots, more transition opportunities, and naturally higher scores on both ends. With each team averaging over 80 points per game, the baseline projection already flirts with this number. If this turns into the up-and-down game it projects to be, 153 is very attainable.\n\nGood luck to anyone tailing!",

Slafkovsky is clearly the go-to player on the Slovak team. He leads the team with 4 points and among forwards in TOI in the first 2 games. Slafkovsky was also the leading point-getter in the 2022 Olympics.\n\nSlovakia is going up against a Swedish team that gave up 2 to an Italian team expected to finish last, then 4 to a Finnish team that gave up 4 themselves to Slovakia. The team total for Slovakia is at 1.5. I can think they can score at least 2. It would be hard to imagine Slovaks having any offense outside the top two lines.\n\nNote: Don't play this on DK. Terrible odds. If you don't play on BetRivers, I'd go as low as -110.",

      "text": "**Record: 8w - 7L**\n\n**Net Units: +26.04**\n\n**Last:**  **AC Milan ML +** Dortmund vs Mainz **Over 2.5 Goals (3.5u)** ✅ (+5.03u)\n\n**Six Nations Rugby** **16:40pm GMT** **| England League One @ 15:00pm GMT**\n\n**Pick:** Scotland vs **England -5.5 + Cardiff ML** vs Luton **(4u)** \n\n**Odds:** \\+190\n\n**Write Up:** A little bit sweaty on the Milan game but won comfortably in the end, Dortmund put 4 past Mainz to clear the second pick. Appreciate anyone who tailed - once again apologies about the late post.\n\nFirst up we have a fixture in the Six Nations rugby, we travel to Scotland where they host England at Murrayfield. My pick of -5.5 handicap for England comes from, despite their poor recent form in Edinburgh, England are coming in from a 48-7 win against Wales whilst Scotland enter of a 15-18 loss to Italy. Whilst these score lines are not indicative of the result watching both I do believe England posses better form (currently winning 13 fixtures in a row), better depth and kicking control which is pivotal in these kind of matchups. Scotland were weak in their lineouts and even with practice I do think England's quality in this area will give them problems a plenty just as Italy did; to slow down England's attack they need to neuter their offensive power, especially forwards, which will be difficult for the Scots. It must be said that Scotland have won 5/8 encounters with one draw, 3 of which are coming from Murrayfield - international fixtures in autumn tend to prove better results for this England team oddly enough. Simply put it will come down to depth and form, both of which England have an advantage. Original line is -8.5 but I have bought it down a little bit for a buffer, safe pick for me would be the ML.\n\nSecondly, we go to League One where Luton are winless in their last 6 away games going 0/1/5 (total record of 4-2-8), with the hosts Cardiff going 12-1-2(W/D/L) from 15 home games. Cardiff are unbeaten in 10, sitting nicely in 1st in the league and Luton sit 7th - but home/away forms are currently very important. The bluebirds only posses 2 points more than 2nd place Lincoln so they will be wanting to take all 3 away from this fixture. The reverse fixture ended in a win for Cardiff on the road, no overthinking here I reckon they take all 3 much important points from a poor travelling Luton side.\n\nBOL and always bet what you can afford to lose!",

Just like my last pick, this line depends on the match being a competitive series rather than a sweep. However, the data for **Liquid vs. OG** is even more aggressive than the previous matchups. In their last four competitive maps, these two teams have averaged **52.5 kills per map**. Their Bo1 during the group stage of this tournament on February 3rd was a bloodbath, ending with **56 total kills** in just 38 minutes.\n\nTo hit **Over 186.5**, at their current average of **\\~52 kills/map**, they only need the series to go **4 maps** (4 x 52 = 208) to clear this comfortably. If OG continues their giant-slaying form—they already beat Liquid 1-0 this tournament—it is highly unlikely Liquid finishes this in a 3-0 sweep. So we're basically betting OVER 3.5 maps again but with better value\n\n**Reasoning:** High historical kill average (52.5/map) + high probability of at least 4 maps + OG’s aggressive tournament form.\n\nParlay option:  Team Liquid vs. OG  OVER 186.5 total kills + Navi vs Yandex (Player Watson over 4.5 kills map 1)  (@2.50)",

He’s holding serve comfortably and shortening points, which is ideal on fast indoor courts in Dallas.\n\nFritz is favored, and I would say take a slight edge on a fast surface with his serving, but he’s had more court time during the tournament and had an elbow injury come up during his match in the quarterfinals that he may have to deal with.\n\nFritz mentioned after his last match that he felt “really sharp pain” in his elbow and needed treatment plus painkillers to finish. Even if that only limits him 10–15%, that’s significant in a serve-dominant matchup like this. A slight dip in serve velocity or forehand pop could be the difference in one tight set or breaker.",

A bit of a slow start, 1 goal in the first half, and two quick goals after halftime to cash us hype the 60th minute. They ended with 4 goals, really should have been 6 or 7 with some of the chances they missed. We went 4-1 during the week, lets see if we can carry some momentum into the weekend.\n\nHappy Valentine's Day for those who celebrate, here's a too late reminder to go buy some flowers and chocolate. Today we've got another FA Cup match, this time as League One side Burton host Premier League side West Ham. As confusing as it is, League One is actually the 3rd tier division in English Soccer. Burton, is ranked 21st in that division, meaning there are 47 teams in the hierarchy between West Ham (18th in EPL) and Burton. That's a huge talent gap in soccer. Burton are both bottom 5 defensively and offensively in League One, and are winless in their last 5 matches. \n\nI get it, for those who follow the EPL, you'll note that West Ham is bad and be cautious to back them. They're neck deep in a relegation battle. However, they have won 3 of their last 5 and seem to have turned a corner the last few weeks. The team is clicking, and they'll see this match as a chance to continue to build momentum and maybe have a chance to make a deep cup run. They've brought in some attacking players during the January window and have genuinely looked good the last few matches (going up 2-0 away at Chelsea). So I really like the odds here given the talent gap on paper and form of both teams. Lets hope West Ham show up. \n\nBOL and hope everyone has a great weekend!",

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 15-40-5 *Finally, it feels like all the pain and bs I had to witness in my Barcelona fades lead to that moment! Barcelona were completely outclassed from the very first whistle and shipped 4 goals in the first half alone. The second half was a bit of a snoozefest, but Atletico had everything under control. I knew they'd do well, but I couldn't have imagined what would follow, not even in my wildest dreams. This was the third successful Barca fade and I feel like I'm finally starting to get the hang of this thing. Let's move on from this now though, as my record is still somehow even more horrific than that Barca first half performance. Still a lot of work left to be done if I'm to get anywhere near a positive record*\n\n**Last Five:** ❌❌❌✅✅\n\n**Event:** LaLiga, Real Madrid v Real Sociedad, 3:00 pm EST\n\n**POTD:** Real Sociedad Win or Draw, +200, 3 units\n\n**Write Up:** It seems like I've finally managed to tame Barcelona a bit (kinda), but my ambitions are loftier. I'm coming for the other Clasico side, Real Madrid. They're matched up against Real Sociedad, who, in case you forgot, **actually beat Barcelona earlier in the season.** How poetic would it be if they could get one over Real Madrid too? They certainly **have the squad to do it.** Not only that, but they're coming into this matchup in great form, remaining **unbeaten in the last 11 games, a run that includes 8 wins** in that span.\n\nReal Madrid are still very much finding their feet after a turbulent beginning to 2026, and I think they're definitely there for the taking. I absolutely love these odds as they're in the absolute upper limit of what's allowed in these threads, but after that Barca shocker, my confidence is sky high so yes, I'm putting down three whole units on a +200 odd play. I just see terrific value in these odds. Not expecting a high scoring game, so something like Under 2.5 goals sounds reasonable too, if you want to go down that route. Expecting a big game from Oyarzabal, who loves turning up against Barcelona and Real Madrid specifically. For those of you who are wondering about the fade, you can go with something like a Real Madrid +1.0 Asian Handicap or even a Real Madrid +1.0, +1.5 Asian Handicap for some decent odds (I think the Madrid divas are getting clapped though).

That means that FUT map pick is up first in this series as the odds also indicate\n* Both teams have a clear perma ban, Aurora ban Ancient, FUT ban Inferno, both teams also have EXTREMELY OBVIOUS map picks. FUT pick Mirage, Aurora pick Anubis, there is almost 0 chance we see either team swap their map pick off of these unless one team just randomly drops their perma ban\n\n**Mirage Stats:**\n\n* FUT are 89% winrate on 18 maps of Mirage in the L3 months, they are on a rampage run, I would argue maybe the best Mirage team in the world strategically, they have been running Mirage as their home map forever. They first pick this map in 70% of their games and for good reason. FUT dominance on Mirage as mentioned is not new, they went 51-20 on this map in 2025, an insane run of form\n* Aurora are 29% winrate on 7 maps of Mirage in the L3 months, they have heavily struggled on this map, this is their only map in the pool currently they are <50% winrate on.\n* FUT are on a 10 map winstreak on Mirage, and while for a while they were mostly farming tier two teams, recently they have been dominating tier one teams on the map as well. They have beaten Astralis, G2, FURIA, as well as some strong tier two teams on the map like OG, EYEBALLERS and BetBoom.\n* FUT are extremely well rounded on this map, they win 64% of pistol rounds, they average a 73.3% winrate on CT side/defense, and a 53.4% winrate on offense as well. In the last month despite a drop in pistol round win % down to 40%, they are 5-0 in this time including the win against FURIA where they won 13-11 despite losing both pistol rounds\n* Aurora struggles really started for them in October and to close out the year but a lot of their Mirage maps back then were still close, but in 2026 these struggles have been much worse then previous, they are not just losing Mirage but getting dominated by teams, they lost to FURIA 13-4, Falcons 13-10, PARIVISION 13-5, GamerLegion 13-5 in 2026 so far which is when they picked up Soulfly.\n* Aurora are 20% winrate in their last 5 mirage games, they have lost them by a total score of 59-37 winning just 39% of rounds overall. They have really struggled on CT side recently generating only 40.3% of rounds on this side in the new year, despite a 50% winrate on pistol rounds, their offense has always been shaky on Mirage going back 6 months, they average 42.1% winrate on T side over a 24 round sample, but in the past were able to win close maps due to their strong CT sides and often sneak win close maps, without good CT sides, they will never stand a chance against strong Mirage teams in my opinion",

Similarly, in Fenerbahçe's last 5 matches, both teams scored in 4.\n\nLooking at the H2H (head-to-head), a similar situation applies: In the last 6 matches, 5 featured both over 2.5 goals and both teams scoring (BTTS).\n\nBtw that was good to start with a win to that series ❤️",

Today we’re going with Germany v Latvia. This game should be fairly competitive but I think Germany has the edge. Lead by Leon Draisaitl and Tim Stutzle who combined scored all 3 goals in Germanys game against Denmark. Draisaitl who is one of the best in the NHL has recorded 80 points in his 55 games played this NHL season. Latvia lost to the states 5-1 in their last game.

They want to win lanes, group up, and suffocate you with perfect efficiency. They are the best \"front-runners\" in Dota.\n\nBut, this new OG roster is pure SEA chaos. They don't respect structure. They constantly force bad fights that turn into chaotic trades.\n\n​Liquid historically struggles when they can't play perfect Dota. When the game becomes a scramble, they hesitate.

Slovakia to secure their quarterfinal and top spot in the group and Sweden to try to at least qualify for the next round. Although Sweden has more firepower than Slovakia, they have not played to expectations and I don't see them getting that much better on a back-to-back. They give up some great chances and they allowed 4 goals against Finland and 2 goals vs Italy with zero NHL players. Slovakia meanwhile has played really well in this tournament by beating that same Finland team that beat Sweden 4-1 and beating Italy 3-2. They should be able to at least score 2 goals against a fragile Sweden team.\n\nBOL!",

Stuttgart are aggressive going forward and usually create plenty of clear chances at home. Köln’s defensive record on the road is often shaky, and when they concede, the game tends to open up. Both teams are capable of scoring, which increases the pace and intensity. A 3-2 or 4-0 result would not be surprising here.",

Urawa Reds beat regional rivals JEF United 2-0 away, but how the fuck that game didn’t AT LEAST see a third humanity will never now, just how the fuck didn’t the ball go in one more time! The chances both teams had!  \n\nBoth meetings in the league last season ended with 3-2 wins for the host. The teams also faced each other in the Emperor Cup where FC Tokyo knocked Urawa out with a 2-1 win at home, but Urawa was the better team in that game and should at least taken the game to extra time. \n\nThe bookies are not really feeling this game that strongly and while neither side saw three goals in their opening match, if they come into this game that they did in those opening games this should have no problem seeing 3-4 or even more goals.\n\n",

Units: 4U\n\n\nWrite Up: Hi Friends, I thought id share my knowledge in the hopes of all of you benefiting from it too. I am new here but find the insights very interesting (especially from jaysial) and sharing is caring.\n\nStating of with a high confidence wager in \nSA vs NZ for extras (b,lbs,wides,nb - for the non cricket players) to hit over 17.5. Multiple reasons for the conviction as below.\n\n1. Match is played in Ahmedabad , the pitch is extremely flat meaning bowlers need to alter the lengths significantly and be more aggressive and hence prone to mistakes.\n\n2. SA bowling attack is notoriously wayward in bowling , past 2 matches they have given away 11 & 12 wides respectively. Not to mention 2 no balls in each innings as well. New Zealand are also susceptible bowling 7 & 9 wides in their last 2 games.\n\n3. This is a highly competitive game and a high scoring one resulting in the full over quotas being close to completion.\n\n4. The conditions - The match is played at night in India where dew will come into play, the balls will slip out of the hands easier for the team bowling second increasing the number of errors. Also, weather is clear so the innings won’t be truncated.\n\nHope to be off to a good start and best of luck!",

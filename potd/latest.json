They have won 9 of their last 10. Florida has covered in four straight H2H vs Texas A&M. Texas A&M have a slightly better offensive efficiency but Florida’s offense is still solid. The difference in this matchup will be on the defensive end where Florida clearly has the edge. Florida are an elite rebounding team as well, offensive and defensive rebounding both rank top 2 and 3 in the country which is significantly better than Texas A&M. Lay the 3.5 points on the Florida Gators tonight.\n\n👇\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pruh5gp9f4ig1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4038bcba244dbb42bcb810536f4f9e67c957107c",

Everyone is looking at them, and they aren't disappointing. Lyon has been winning, convincing and on a hot streak with 11 wins in the last 11 games, also undefeated in 17 of the previous 20 games. If you want to go deeper, Lyon is currently sitting 4th in League 1 and has recorded over 2,5 goals scored per match.\n\nNantes, on the other hand, hasn't been winning or convincing. They currently sit 16th in Ligue 1 after 20 matches, with 2 wins in the last 12 games. Last time they played, Lyon won 3-0, dominating every statistic. Nantes has also been underwhelming in their home games, with 1 win, 2 draws, and 7 losses, the worst performance in the league.\n\nThe odds don't fully reflect the gap in form between those two. Lyon is locked in, and every point is crucial to get into Champions League next season, while Nantes is struggling to survive. Lyon also thrives playing with the ball and transition, as they're a very creative team. Nantes will most likely struggle with this.",

Poor first half shooting led to this. \n\nPOTD: Charlotte -1.5 v Hawks\n\nWrite-up: the boys are still getting doubted despite being on a 8-WIN STREAK, which is crazy.\n\nHowever, that’s good for us. The spread is tolerable and aligns for us to get the bag.\n\nNo significant injuries on the report as of the moment. All players will play. \n\nAs for our reliable statistics: \n\nAt home, the Hawks are 12th in Net Adjusted Efficiency, while the Hornets are ranked 9th in Net Adjusted Efficiency being on the road.\n\nFor the last 5 games, the Hornets are ranked 12th in Net Adjusted Efficiency vs the Hawks’s 16th spot. In addition, the stats show that the Hornets are reliable in continuing their performance. \n\nEvery game is crucial for the Hornets as they make a push to get in the playoffs since they are in the 10th spot as of today.  \n\nThis is a big test for the boys due to the probability that they will face this team again in the Play-ins.\n\nBest of Luck and I hope we can bounce back.",

Okongwu should be back as well, so he'll be competing for boards too. \n\nYes JJ has hit this line a lot recently, but that has inflated this line, and the situation today is different than before the trade. JJ will have to share more rebounds, and Charlotte won't give them many to share. At almost even money, it's a good value. \n\nJJ under 10.5 rebounds. ",

Since the start of the year (2026) and conference play, they're 1-8. Averaging 63 points per game (the last 4 games have actually been worse 58 ppg), while allowing 76 points per game. Losing their last 4 games by 15 or more points (Michigan State, Washington, UCLA, Iowa). They should start this game slow, west coat team traveling east. Early start time (10 am in Oregon), lack of offense; would be lucky to get to 60 points this afternoon. \n\n**Purdue** \\- Looked to be like a top 2 team in the country early on, if not the best team in the country. Big Ten play has not been too kind to them as they come into this game with 1 win out of their four. Losses to Illinois, UCLA, and Indiana. Maryland and Oregon back to back is a recipe to get the team back on track before their visit to Nebraska. Purdue at home this season has been dominant, only losses coming to Illinois & Iowa (two really good teams on their day). If they can replicate a 40-50% shooting from deep today, they should easily cover this number. \n\n![gif](giphy|2XxxMykHvDGJwMqk9E)",

Wolves haven’t been leaking goals, but they don’t control games and, as the season progresses, they’re forced to take more risks to chase wins. That shift opens transitions and second balls, which tilts the game toward a Chelsea win and makes Over 1.5 goals a high-probability outcome.\n\nUnits: 5",

Meanwhile dartmouth is going to have to rely on some pretty stellar perimeter play from undersized guards. \n\nDartmouth has been an interesting team the last couple years, they keep finding ways to win (including this year on the road at harvard lol) but this is the time to take advantage of that result and put it to use. i think Harvard wins by 5-8 today.\n\nBOL\n\n\nEDIT: I feel like i have a lot to say about this game but i’m tired as all hell and don’t have the energy. i just think it’s a good play and wanted to share it lol",

Really love the way Bautista has looked. Everybody was kind of giving him shit for the Aldo win, but he has some wins and fights against high-level fighters, like his last fight, versus Umar. Umar is considered the next Khabib/Islam and is destined to be king of Bantamweight (according to “experts” lol) with most of his fights being listed around -1000. He had Umar in a deep ankle crank early, and launched a knee that landed on Umar’s chin, but still ended up losing 30-27. If you watched that fight you understand it was fairly close and Mario had his chances. He is right there on the cusp of being ELITE. With this being a five-round fight, I have to side with Bautista. We are talking insane pacing and cardio … close to Merab levels, against Oliveira, who gasses pretty fast. He also has an extremely dangerous top game that he hasn’t had to rely on in recent fights. Early rounds will be scary for our boy, and I expect him to eat a few heavy shots. He doesn’t have knockout power, but I do think his Muay Thai striking will serve him well enough to stand his ground when Oliveira pressures forward. Once this fight gets into round three, I expect Bautista to start pulling away drastically and put on an elite display of takedowns, mixed with accurate striking and control time.",

At home they control games through sustained possession, high pressing, and chance creation from wide areas. Their xG numbers are consistently strong, and defensively they allow very few high-quality chances, especially against sides that struggle to play through pressure. Squad depth also matters here — Arsenal can maintain intensity for 90 minutes, and late goals have been a recurring pattern. Unless there’s a major tactical surprise, this is a spot where Arsenal’s control and efficiency should translate into a win.\n\nTrabzonspor are a reliable attacking side, particularly in matches where they’re allowed space in transition. They average solid shot volume and tend to create chances regardless of opponent quality. Even in tougher fixtures, they’ve shown consistency in getting on the scoresheet due to their aggressive wing play and willingness to commit numbers forward. Defensive solidity on the other side isn’t always perfect, and Trabzonspor only need one moment — a set piece, counter, or individual quality — to cash this line.\n\nBOL",

Both teams have seen Both Teams To Score land in each of their last five matches, underlining a clear pattern of goals at both ends. The head-to-head also backs this up, with BTTS hitting in four consecutive meetings between these sides.\n\nFrom a squad perspective, Luzern arrive with no noteworthy absences, while Sion are only missing right-back Lavanchy, which shouldn’t heavily impact their attacking output. Recent performances show a similar picture for both teams: defensively shaky, but offensively reliable, consistently creating and converting chances.\n\nOn top of that, both clubs were knocked out of the cup during the week, so motivation should be high to bounce back with a strong league performance. With form, match-up history, and circumstances all aligning, BTTS stands out as a solid play here.\n\nRemember to gamble responsibly and only invest what you can afford to lose!\n\n\n\nBOL!",

As a starter, Diabate averages 9.9 rebounds/game. This would put him within the top 10 rebounds/game in the league.  \nThe Hawks give up a lot of rebounds. One of the Hawks biggest troubles was rebounding at the center position; at the trade deadline, they acquired Jock Landale which, in terms of rebounding, is definitely an upgrade over Porzingis. The thing is, even with starting his first game with the Hawks, Kyle Filipowski grabbed 17 rebounds which surprisingly isn't his career high (tied for second highest rebound count). The Jazz ran an eight man rotation, but it only took Filipowski 28 minutes to do that. To be fair though, Onyeka Okongwu was out and their backup bigs were Newell and Gueye.  \nI think the reason for bigs rebounding well against the Hawks (besides roster) is how fast they play. They are one of the league's leaders in pace. More possessions played means more rebounding opportunities for Diabate to capitalize on.  \nFor pace to be taken advantage in favor of defensive rebounding, the other team has to miss shots. The Hawks offense is built to shoot a lot of threes. They are ranked 10 in 3PA/game at 39.2. This year, and especially recently, the Hornets have been great at defending the three point line.\n\nI'm taking 9+ rebounds, but I really like o9.5 rebounds at plus odds too. I'm opting for the lower payout just because I missed on two in a row. Hopefully I get lucky with this one",

      "text": "**POTD Record**: 4-2-2 (+3.15u) [All 1 Unit Plays]\n\n**Event**: EFL Championship - Wrexham vs Millwall / Birmingham City vs Leicester - 15:00 GMT+0\n\n**Pick**: Wrexham to score **+** Birmingham City to score @1.55\n\n**Write Up**: We're targeting the promoted sides attacking threat here. Both teams have scored in every home game so far this season and will look to carry that form into the second half of the season if they aim to be promoted. Both sides have reinforced in the January with attacking talent. Wrexham with Bailey Cadarmateri and Davis Keillor-Dunn. While Birmingham have recruited Alaves star Carlos Vicente for £7m in LaLiga. With Brighton loanee Ibrahim Osman and Danish striker Priske. This is to compliment League One Transfer Record holder Jay Stansfield, German international Marvin Ducksch and Japanese international Kyogo Furuhashi. It is fair to say they are not light on firepower. Both sides have gotten over the 'adjustment period' so to speak and this is really where their season begins. Even through the chopping and changing they have both found themselves in the top half of the table. \n\n*Their opponents*:\n\nMillwall - Millwall are a very decent side and have themselves in fifth right now, just a place above Wrexham. They're not rock solid at the back and concede an average of 1.38 xG per game, 1.51 away from home. They ended up losing to Wrexham in the opposite fixture where Millwall had the advantage at home. No one major missing but they do have a new #1 in Anthony Patterson who got promoted with Sunderland last year.\n\nLeicester City - They are a mess. You may have seen they have sacked their manager recently and have been docked 6 points by the EFL for financial misconduct. They have 1 win in their last five and the last time they've kept a clean sheet was in September. 14 of their last 15 opponents have generated at least 1 xG against them so they are open at the back but still a decent threat going forward. Their new manager Andy King has had one game in charge, 2-0 home loss to 17th place Charlton. The thing to note is that even though they were down to 10 men for over half the game they still had 21 shots and created a decent amount where they could have came away with something. With main centre half Caleb Okoli suspended. They will either draft in youngster Olabade Aluko or new signing but possibly not match fit Jamaal Lascelles. The expected defensive line of Pereira - Aluko - Nelson - Thomas is not the strongest by any means, which is good for us!\n\nWrexham are decent xG generators of 1.38 xG which improves to 1.64 at home. Birmingham are great xG producers with an average of 1.51 improving to a massive 1.91 at home.\n\n**Additional Thoughts**: Fourth time is the charm.",

Volume is the most reliable forensic indicator of a \"Heist.\"\n\nPick of the Day: : Austin Reaves (LAL) OVER 23.5 Points\n\nReasoning: 🕵️ Detective clues: Evidence 1:  This season, Reaves is averaging 36.2 PPG in 6 games without Luka Dončić. He has cleared 23.5 points in 5 of those 6 games (83% hit rate), including a 51-point explosion against Sacramento\n\nEvidence 2: Reaves leads the Lakers in Usage Rate (34.1%) when Luka is off the floor. Against a Golden State defense that just gave up 113 points to a short-handed Philly, he will have a permanent \"Green Light.\"\n\nEvidence 3: Reaves averages 13.3 free throw attempts without Luka. He can practically hit this over on free throws and a few layups alone.\n\nScenario Playbook\n\nScenario A (The Ideal):Reaves attacks the rim early, drawing 2-3 fouls on Golden State's guards. He sits at 15 points by halftime and cruises past 24 early in the 3rd quarter.\n\nScenario B (The Grind): Golden State doubles him. Reaves struggles from three but continues to drive, using the \"Lakers Whistle\" to stack points at the line.\n\nScenario C (The Outside Influences): Referees like Scott Foster (who often works high-profile Saturday games) tend to call games that favor high-usage \"foul-drawers,\" which is Reaves' specialty.\n\nScenario D (The White Flag 🏳️): A blowout. Even if the Lakers are up big, Reaves is usually the reason why. In his 6 games without Luka, he averages 20.4 points by the end of the 1st half.\n\nScenario E (Cold Night):  He goes 0-for-8 from three.\n\nScenario Proof: Even on his worst shooting night this year without Luka (against Phoenix), he still managed 17 points in only 22 minutes. If he plays his standard 35+ minutes, the \"floor\" for his points is roughly 25-26.",

      "text": "Record: 5–1\n\nLast 10: 5–1\n\nLast Pick: Bradley @ Northern Iowa — Full Game Under 131.5\n\nResult: ✅ WIN (110 points)\n\nReview: This game went under 131.5 because it never produced the kind of scoring volatility needed to push the total upward. Bradley struggled to generate efficient half-court offense, shooting just 33% overall and finishing with only 49 points, while Northern Iowa dictated tempo from start to finish. Misses drained clock instead of creating transition chances, fast-break scoring was nearly nonexistent, and fouls never piled up late to inflate the score. Even with UNI controlling the game, the pace stayed compact and methodical, preventing any late-game chaos. This was an under that cashed on structure and tempo control rather than relying on extreme shooting variance.\n\n⸻\n\nToday’s Pick\n\nCollege Basketball | NCAA Men’s\nAmerican Eagles @ Navy Midshipmen\nFriday, February 6, 2026 | 4:00 pm\n\nPick: Full Game Under 134.5\n\nOdds: -112 (DraftKings)\n\nWrite-Up: \n\nThis matchup sets up as an under because Navy dictates how games are played, not just how fast. Their offense is methodical, possession-heavy, and intentionally limits variance. Even when Navy scores efficiently, it rarely comes with pace acceleration — points are earned deep into the shot clock, which compresses the total regardless of outcome. That’s a critical distinction when evaluating unders: efficiency without tempo doesn’t break games open.\n\nAmerican complements that environment well. They don’t have the personnel or offensive profile to force pace when things aren’t working, and they’re comfortable playing long, grinding possessions. If American falls behind, the response isn’t frantic offense or early-clock shots — it’s more half-court basketball. That removes one of the most common late-game over paths: desperation tempo.\n\nFor this total to get over 134.5, multiple things would need to align at once: elevated shooting from both sides, sustained foul pressure late, and a game state that encourages pace rather than suppresses it. That’s a narrow window in this matchup. More often than not, missed shots here don’t create chaos — they create time burn. And when time keeps draining without volatility, totals like this tend to land short.\n\nBest of luck!\n\nEDIT: If you find value in my analysis, contributions are appreciated [https://cash.app/$KindlyQuantifying](https://cash.app/$KindlyQuantifying)",

This is because last matchday they achieved a great victory with 1-3 at the home of Kaiserslautern. The losers saw Robinson face a second yellow card in the 45+5 and be sent off. A minute later, Petkov opened the scoring for the visitors with a well-aimed penalty. The match became a rodeo in the first half's stoppage time and in the ninth (9!) minute of stoppage time, Rohr scored in the wrong goal to equalize. With the restart and in the 55th minute, Dussu put Elversberg ahead again, while in the 86th minute, Selbacher sealed the victory for his team.\n\nThey celebrated three points again after December 14, 2025 and the 1-0 against Fortuna Düsseldorf, while they have two wins, two draws and one loss in their last five games. Their record this season is 11-5-4, while they have the best attack in the league with a total of 37 goals to their credit. They are also doing great in defense, having only conceded 20 goals. All of the above rightly place them in second place in the standings with 38 points together with Darmstadt and they will fight hard until the end for promotion to the Bundesliga.\n\nElversberg is quite strong at home and will look for a win at all costs to take advantage of a possible Schalke upset on the way to the top of the standings. Hertha Berlin, on the other hand, is a fairly tough team with strategy and good defensive cohesion, but will definitely struggle at this home. \n\nBol",

When the fight was first announced I naturally leaned Jailton since he’s a mainstay of the Heavyweight division and has a somewhat unique skillset in this division (relentless takedowns and grappling pressure). However a few people alerted me to Kuniev’s background as a grappler and that got me interested in diving into his tape. Kuniev is indeed highly proficient at grappling. Moreover he’s the natural heavyweight here - today he weighed in at 260+ lbs whilst Jailton typically weighs in 230+ however today he weighed in a career heaviest 240+ and looked in the worst physical shape I’ve seen him in for normally such an athletic specimen (he’s coming off the couch so what do you expect). Jailton is in big trouble here if he cannot get this fight to the mat early and often. Kuniev is a skilled striker and Jailton will be at constant danger on the feet so for every minute this fight is standing I believe Kuniev will be getting the better of the exchanges. I do expect Jailton to attempt and maybe even get a takedown early on but Kuniev will work back to his feet and the energy expenditure for Jailton will be massive. I think there’s a good chance Kuniev could dispatch Jailton inside of 2 rounds here and expose what we already knew about Jailton but that isn’t reflected in the line - he’s a one trick pony at HW and he’s just not fought a true HW grappler with hands (except Curtis Blaydes who finished him in one round).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y5i0bqe860ig1.jpeg?width=866&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=100777ab5c4199864a1b28c700e93519995e9d88",

Value on Cirstea here in my eyes as Raducanu folds against players who hit the ball harder and this should mean much more to Cirstea than Raducanu who should be fighting for it but I just think Cirstea is better and can clutch the win.\n\nLeg 2 - Newcastle has seen this event hit in 5/5 last games in the PL.

She just destroyed Daria Snigur, who is in red hot form, in 55 minutes.\n* She had a 2 hour battle with Potapova before that but a lot of that was drawn out games, not because it was tight on Cirstea's serve...she generated 21 BP opportunities against Potapova but only converted on 4 - a lot of games to deuce, advantage and back to deuce etc.\n* Raducanu has been dominant as well this tournament but pretty poor before that. At her best, she probably is the favourite here but given she's had soft opponents except for Oliynykova. Oliynykova beat Xinyu WAng and Bondar to get to the semis and I honestly thought she'd take Raducanu out too.\n* Raducanu generated 14 BP opportunities against Oliynykova but had to save 13 herself. The form on paper is probably misleading when you look into how Raducanu and Cirstea's winning %s look like on 1st and 2nd serves.\n* This is Cirstea's retirement tour and I think she's a better chance than the bookies say she is of getting this win.

Despite the massive height difference between these two (Ball is 5’2”, Figueroa is 5’9”), height and reach won’t be an issue for Ball to overcome as Figueroa prefers to sacrifice his reach advantages to fight in the pocket.  This puts Ball in prime range to score rounds over Figueroa.  In addition, Ball throws punches that are more attractive/flashy to the judges as opposed to Figueroa, who despite throwing with high volume, throws many punches that get smothered.  Figueroa has one of if not the highest stat for being hit by his opponents’ power shots in the sport, so he is wide open for punishment at all times.  Figueroa has also never been knocked out and has an amazing chin which can take a lot of punishment, so I expect him to make it the full distance of the fight.  Ball has a knockout percentage of a little over 50%, which isn’t very high at all, so I do not expect him to be able to knock out one of the fighters with the best chin in the division.\n\nThe event is being hosted by Frank Warren and Queensberry Promotions, and is being held in the UK.  Frank Warren is on a roll with building up British fighters and getting them to world level, especially at heavyweight, so while I’m not claiming fraud or cheating to take place, I fully expect Frank Warren to have had some degree of influence in the choice of ref and choice of judges (see Ball vs Goodman, Wardley vs Parker) in order to secure a win for Nick Ball, who could potentially see a unification bout with Bruce Shu Shu Carrington in the future.",

League model putting this between 75-80% chance of hitting at + money, meaning it is incredible value/ROI play\n\n***Hazel U 4.5 Kills Map 1 (-200)*** (Teams: Karmine Corp Blue (KCB) vs. Shifters)\n\n* Shifters are -260 favorites coming into this game, Hazel is on the worst team in the LEC, basically eliminated from playoff contention and nothing to play for tomorrow, meanwhile Shifters are in a bad spot, but can contest playoffs, but need a big weekend and that starts with beating KCB, to move up in contention.\n* Hazel is averaging 2.4 kills per map, the worst amongst all adc's and by a relatively signifcant margin as well. He has had very poor laning stats, with a -750 GD/15 and a -6.3 CSD/15.\n* While Shifters haven't been great either, they have a big bright spot imo in Paduck, their adc who will be going h2h with Hazel in lane. Paduck is averaging the 5th most kills of any ADC in the LEC at 4.9, despite his team having the second lowest winrate overall, he also is averaging the most damage of any adc in the league at 32.8% over 1.5% above the next highest.\n* Hazel has hit this line in 1/9 maps this split so far, 1/8 in losses and 0/1 in wins overall. Taking out his anomaly game in a map loss, he is averaging 1.85 kills per map loss. Even going back to when he was playing in tier two much lower leagues/worse competition, he had only a 5/14 hitrate in Summer, and a 4/14 hitrate in Spring for a combined 9/28. Shifters have only won 3 maps but have limited the deaths more then most teams in their wins so far.\n\n***Baus U 3.5 Kills Map 1 (-263)*** (Teams: SK Gaming vs. Los Ratones)\n\n* Baus line seems like such a free square to me, pretty hard to state how much I love this line, Baus is averaging a league worst 1.2 kills per map as a top laner, this guy was previously a challenger streamer, and while I respect tf out of him for making the leap out of his comfort zone, he is nowhere near a pro level top laner.\n* He has been awful at this tournament so far, averaging a -1010 GD/15, -1062 XP/15, and -16.9 CSD/15, all the worst metrics in the league by far. He also gets next to no jungle help/resources because his team knows he is their weakest player so he is left on an island to soak resources and hopefully let the ex pro players Crownie/Nemeis carry games. Baus champ pool is mostly tanks/bruisers, he has shown next to no super strong champs outside of Gragas/poppy and decent team fights on Kled\n* Baus has a 1/9 hitrate this season so far, taking out the anomaly gragas game, he has put up 6 kills in the other 8 maps he has played averaging 0.75 kills per map, with only one game coming close to this line with 3, **every other game has been 1 or less kill**.\n* While tier two data isn't as relevant because they were winning >80% of their games so his stats got inflated and allowed him to play crazier and pick up more kills, he still had a low hit rate on this line, hitting it in 0/27 map losses in his pro career, while hitting in just 43/92 map wins, giving him just a 36% hit rate",

Most of their games have gone over this line and I don’t see why it wouldn’t happen again. Both teams play slow, tend to go for late game, farm a lot and play really well from behind.\n\n\nGoing for map 1 because historically teams play cleaner and more careful in map 1 to not give the lead early on and delaying the game by farming, map 2 tends to be faster because the losing teams starts tilting or the winning team starts playing too comfortably and make mistakes that causes the game to finish faster, so I rather take map 1 over than map 2 .\n\nYou can follow my other bets in esports daily discussions feed, feel free to text me also. \n\nBOL!\n\nUpdate: Unlucky, we only needed one more minute.",

Andoni Iraola’s Bournemouth are built around an aggressive, high-intensity attacking identity — a hybrid press that consistently forces turnovers and drives rapid transitions into the final third — and this isn’t just hype: data analyses show Bournemouth rank among the Premier League’s most intense pressers, winning the ball high and creating opportunities directly from these turnovers, a pattern that regularly produces goals for and against them. Although injuries to key players like Tavernier, Brooks, Adams, Soler, Kluivert and Doak weaken Bournemouth’s depth and defensive balance, Iraola’s philosophy means the team still presses forward relentlessly, even without its full complement — which increases the likelihood of both scoring and conceding as space opens up.\n\n\\- On the away side, Unai Emery’s Aston Villa combine structure with attacking intent that regularly produces goals at both ends. Villa’s midfield creativity and direct transitions have seen them feature in high-scoring encounters far more than shutouts, and sportsbooks’ statistical models flag that Villa matches frequently hit over 2.5 goals and both teams score patterns. Emery has publicly emphasised his desire for a balanced yet forward-orientated setup, pushing his side to sustain pressure even when defensive lapses appear, and while he prioritises solidity, his pragmatic philosophy still leans toward creating chances rather than grinding out sterile draws — especially away from home.\n\n\\- Both squads are motivated to attack: Bournemouth are chasing European aspirations despite a growing injury list, and Villa are fighting for top-table positions with players like Ollie Watkins returning to fitness, giving them attacking breadth. Tactically, Bournemouth cannot sit deep given their style and personnel losses, and Villa’s structure often entices opposition into transitional spaces that lead to goal opportunities. With both sides inclined to take risks, concede chances, and press opponents high, the conditions strongly favour a match that exceeds 2.5 total goals.\n\n",

Schoenhaus is not on the same level and has won two of his 3 matches in a third set and not played anyone on Kotov's level.\n\nI believe Kotov is going to win a solid 2-0 win, as he is really difficult to break with his strong serve and has seemed to return quite well in this tournament so far, with 3 solid wins and lately against Rehberg who have played amazing this year.\n\nGood luck!\n\n\\_\n\nIf you follow my bets, I would appreciate a little tip - I spend a lot of time analyzing the bets day to day.

Today we've got the 19th place team in the league hosting the 18th place in the league. Burnley are statistically the worst defensive team in the league by most metrics, other than goals conceded which West Ham holds the honor of. Don't expect fantastic football here, but I do expect some offense. \n\nBurnley, as I alluded to above, concede the most SOTs in the EPL, averaging over 6 conceded per game. Matteus Fernandes plays in the same role as our favorite player to back Enzo. He is less of a box crasher and more of a fire from range kind of player. When he hits them he hits them. He had an absolute screamer for a goal vs Sunderland. Fernandes does not take a ton of shots, but he has been trending towards taking more shots the last few weeks and I think coach Nuno has been encouraging him to shoot more frequently. He has landed an SOT in both of their last two matches (Sunderland and Chelsea), and took 5 shots between those two games. I like him here against this Burnley side to continue the streak. \n\nBOL and happy Saturday!",

Japan is transitioning from a February - December schedule to a more  European fall-spring schedule. This has resulted in the *J-League 100 Year Vision League!* Which means the team has been split into two, the WEST and EAST division. This will run until the final in June.\n\nThere is a fair bit of money on the line if you are one of the smaller teams in the league, plus the winner of the EAST/WEST division meets in a final that rewards a spot in the ACL!\n\nThere is also another big difference from the normal league format, a draw = penalty shootout! \n\n* So a normal win = 3-points \n* A win in the penalty shootout = 2-points\n* Lose in the penalty shootout = 1-point\n\nAlso there is no relegation/promotion on stake until the season starts proper in August. It will be interesting to see how this tournament pans-out. A lot of teams seemingly want to use this tournament to give some younger players a chance, so there has been less transferactivity than what one might expect.  \n\n\\---\n\n**For the actuall game:**\n\nJEF United are one of the “Original 10”, but despite being one of the founding members of the J-League and spending 44 seasons in Japan's top division, they have spent the past 16 years in J2! So what better way to start their comeback in the top division with a game against regional rivals Urawa Reds.\n\nUrawa Reds with another disappointing performance in J1, if we can still say that after a disappointing 2024 and 2023 and 2022 and 2021 and so on and so on and so on… Urawa haven’t done any big business for this “Pre-season Thingamajig Cup”, but they have lost Marius Høibåten in the defence who has been very good for them in his time there. \n\nSo there is kinda no big reason to believe in them again… However, they do have a pretty decent squad with individuals that can do things on their own. I also believe Urawa will play some more young players in these games  which will introduce more “random” into the game.\n\nFor me, this is probably the most fun game we have from the J1 sides today. The atmosphere is going to be amazing, not only are they back in J1 after an eternity in J2, but they are also up against local rivals in Urawa Reds. 2-2 maybe?",

In a full series, it's much easier for a team like Spirit to ban out his best heroes and shut him down.\n\nEven though Spirit is still getting used to playing with Mirelle, I trust Yatoro and Collapse way more in a do-or-die spot than I trust Yandex.\n\n​This is a BO3 elimination match, and we all know how it usually goes for Spirit in these spots.\n\n​BOL.\n\nhttps://buymeacoffee.com/222benz",

And yeah, that last fight against Volkov was a total robbery.\n\nKyoji's opponent Amir had a tough time with injuries, probably caught in a post-prime slump, in his last showing he laid an absolute egg against Moreno. Given the circumstances, I'm going with Kyoji Horiguchi - his footwork and movement could be a game-changer. Not expecting a repeat of his last fight, but he's got the skills to pull it off.",

Wolves are already done mentally from this season and Chelsea are sitting in 5th position currently. Wolves will be sitting back mostly, and Chelsea will lead the way with their chances. I do expect a great performance from Chelsea after going out vs Arsenal in the Carabao Cup, where results such as 0-2 and 1-3 are highly likely. Of course Chelsea can turn up and put a higher gear here with bigger scores such as 0-3 or higher, but we will play it safer with only -1,5 handicap here. I’m not impressed by Wolves at all and never saw it coming this season. Chelsea on the other hand keep growing and only turning out better for each season as expected from their younger purchases.\n\n\n\nI also had other games in my mind to bet on, but they didn't impress me as much as this game. They were pretty similar in terms of odds and picking style as well. My goal is to have something around the 3x odds barrier or higher. This one qualified well and we will always aim for long term gains. I will try to post another pick on Sunday as well and I really want this one to go in.

AB draws perfectly here in barrier 5, and has shown great tactical speed in all starts so we will be able to capitalise this good draw and settle in a forward position.     \n      \nAB hasn’t really been fully tested in either of it starts on good ground, and the trainer is adamant that this horse has improved over the last break, so we could see a really good performance here.

Okay, with that said, I like my Tar-heels +10.5 here - I believe Boozer & Wilson will cancel each other out in this game - You will have Dixon on Evans, Trimble on Foster, Young on Sarr, and Veesaar on Ngongba - I really like these matchups for Carolina - I think between Wilson & Veesaar, they will limit Boozer and Ngongba on the boards - Carolina is at Chapel Hill, giving them a edge as always - I’m not saying it’s a crazy edge, but in this rivalry, whoever is home, always has a small edge - the key for the Tarheels in this one, I believe, is Stevenson, Bogavac, and Powell - these 3, if they play to their standards, will make an impact on this game - I expect Hubert to enter this game with his game-plan yet, with a focus on limiting Boozer - Backing the Tarheels in this one due to 3 things - One, they should be able to keep Duke off the boards and win the rebound game, Two, if Carolina can get out into the open floor and have some quick transition, they can control the game, Three, this game is being played at the Dean Smith Center\n\n• Houston is the better team. Houston is playing great ball, BYU is not - Although BYU has the edge at home, they are also 1-4 against ranked teams coming into this one - BYU hasn’t answered many questions this season, and although they do have the firepower, and they are home, I can’t put money on them quite yet - Houston has won 17 out of 19 games this season when they have been the moneyline favorite - In every Houston write-up, the first thing I talk about is their defense - they will be able to stop BYU’s 86.7PPG % - I think Houston’s defense will be able to slow their offense and Dybamtsa down just enough for them to cover our +7.5 - Truly, I think Houston wins this one here, but BYU is way overdue for a good showing and a win - I’m not completely sold on Wright III & Saunders yet either, if those two can put together production more consistently to help AJ out, this team will be very very dangerous - Houston’s defense averages 63 PPG, and it’s hard to not take them in any of their matchups strictly because of this - they grind out their opponents and capitalize on every mistake made \n\nPOTD History: [https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/SoggyDatabase2348-bvjHUn](https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/SoggyDatabase2348-bvjHUn)\n\nBOL!\n\n**POTD: 2 Pick Parlay: NCAAMB: UNC +10.5 vs Duke + Houston +7.5 vs BYU -132 (0.50U TO WIN 0.36U)**\n\nTips are greatly appreciated - Proceeds will be going towards my student loans and my morning cold brews.

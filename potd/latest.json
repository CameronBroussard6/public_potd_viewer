Home crowd means a lot to them, and they have a big support in Moraca. 4 straight wins, 2 of those at home, they beat Besiktas, probably the best team in this group, by 3. Their form is going upwards, one could say, with 8 in the last 9 games (all competitions).\n\nOn the other hand, Ulm has 3 losses in the last 4, and a lucky 87-86 win against London at home. Last round, they lost to Bourg 64-96 at home. That loss was devastating, combined with 4 straight losses in the German BBL and the Cup game against Alba. \n\nThese losses come, among other reasons, due to injuries. Tommy Klepeisz, Chris Ledlum - best scorer this season - was injured against Bonn; he slipped on the wet part of the floor. Nelson Weidemann - didn't play against Bourg, questionable. \n\nThey don't have that deep roster, and have played some kids from the ProB league against Bourg.\n\nBuducnost also has some injury problems, but their roster is deeper, and they can cover it better. Going with 1.5 units, more confident than usual on this one, I really don't think Ulm can hope for anything.",

The line last game was 13.5 but it massively dropped after a foul heavy game from ace where he scored 5 pts in the first 3 mins then proceeded to get in foul trouble then eventually foul out but the games prior to that he has scored WAY beyond this line, so the risk here is whether he is going to be in foul trouble or not and getting almost a 2x bet on whether someone will be in fould trouble or not is INSANE VALUE to me\n\nI'm not even gonna bother researching for other picks that I could use as my POTD because this is literally free. Now this isn't the most confident I'll ever be in a pick just because rookies are always yk... but probably the most value logically I have given in this sub by far. Also I am gonna be laddering this play which is something I almost never do just cuz of the value\n\nTo sum up: PLACE THIS BET NOW BEFORE THE LINES CHANGE ASAP\n\nLets keep this undefeated streak going and as always never financial advice and always bet within bankroll limits and BOL!!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7aetpd0r6z1g1.png?width=454&format=png&auto=webp&s=463ab5f12c2b821f95a50cd654956bc639960466",

Wales and North Macedonia are both on 13 points looking to get that second place behind Belgium. North Macedonia is the team with the best goal difference. I think that because of this they will sit back and defend as a draw will see them through to the World Cup. Wales have to win here, and if they do not score an early goal they will have to attack to get that win and that will cause them to be in the opponent's penalty area a lot, meaning they will get a lot of shots off.\n\n**Best of luck if tailing!** 🍀\n\n**PS:** If you want you can check my record and units won on [https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/OliveCritical5134-qXXxJZ](https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/OliveCritical5134-qXXxJZ)\n\nIf you're enjoying the picks and write ups and are looking to support me you could do so here: [buymeacoffee.com/olivecritical5134](http://buymeacoffee.com/olivecritical5134)",

Castle and Wemby are out. \n\nExpecting heavy usage out of Fox to put the game on his shoulders. And he never hesitates to shoot.\n\nGrizzlies are ranked worst in the league (30/30) in allowing Threes to PGs, last three PGs got 3 (Lonzo), 5 (Pritchard), and 6 (Brunson).\n\nCashed in L2/2 with 4 Threes each while playing with Castle. He's hitting at a high clip almost 50% of attempts.\n\nShould be a gritty game with no Ja, Wemby, or Castle so let's see Fox takeover.\n\nFull Stats if you'd like to do additional research: [https://www.statpick.ai/31796031/deaaron-fox-threes](https://www.statpick.ai/31796031/deaaron-fox-threes)\n\nBOL!",

Last game without Wemby he had 39 PA, 28 points on 20 FGA & 11 assists on 14 potentials. Game prior to that he had 34 PA, 24 points on 22 FGA & 10 assists on 14 potentials WITH Castle and Wemby playing.\n\nStarting to look like his old self again and gets a great matchup here against a Memphis side that’s ranked 5th in pace and is allowing 4th most PA to opposing PG’s this season & 2nd most points to PG’s.\n\nFox will be their main ball handler with both Castle and Harper out (both guards) and main scorer for the Spurs tomorrow with Wemby out. He’s coming into this game with good confidence and knows he’ll need to step up tomorrow, I like the trend to continue against a Memphis side that has the 7th worst defensive rating this season.\n\nIndividual split would be 25+ Points for me (alt) if PA isn’t available.",

They have only won 2 out of 25 away matches since 2021.\n\n**Leg 2 Brazil vs Tunisia**\n\nThe Brazilians are playing Tunisia in Lille, France where a large Tunisian crowd awaits.  However, the Brazilians are simply stacked and have a super deep bench to choose talent from.  Despite Tunisia’s recent good form, they will be overrun by Brazil.\n\nNot enough data to support facts here and post bullet points of significance, but suffice to say it’s Brazil and am confident they will secure a victory especially after losing to Japan recently in a match where they had 67% possession but simply did not convert.",

Dak played like dak! They were motivated from the jump! That’s just class right there baby. What a way to honor kneeland.\n\nEvent: Michigan State vs Kentucky (5:30pm central)\n\nPOTD: Under 154 (-115) (1U)\n\n-everything is bet to win unit amount-\n\nWrite up: \n\nTomorrow in the first game of the champions double header classic in NYC we have two dominant programs set to face off! Izzo and the Spartans will face mark pope and his wildcats to kick the night off and I expect this to be more of a rock fight than a firework show like the public thinks. This line opened at 154.5 and has since dropped to 153.5 despite heavy public action early on the over! The public has seen Kentucky put up over 90 points in almost all of their games and they saw the absolute shootout that went down in Louisville and immediately thinks why the hell would I not take it here?!\n\nLet’s dive into some stats here…Kentucky plays at the 85th ranked adjusted tempo in cbb and Michigan state plays at the 267th ranked adjusted tempo in cbb. For instance, being on the road in Louisville for Kentucky, Louisville was able to establish how they wanted to control the game, and they play at the 26th adjusted tempo in the nation. The wildcats rank 144th in possessions per game while the Spartans sit at a lowly 311th in the nation in possessions per game. In terms of offensive rating per kenpom Kentucky sits at 8th in the nation, Michigan state is at 57th. However both teams are elite at defense ranking 10 and 13th respectively.  \n\nHere’s where things get even better for our under,  Michigan state is 255th in the nation in effective field goal percentage at 47% and is damn near dead last in college basketball when it comes to shooting the three ball at 353rd in the nation sitting at a lowly 21%. The funny thing is these guys still hoist up 20+ threes a game as a lot of their players believe they can shoot the rock. I have watched many of their games and they are just pitiful from behind the arc. They are 118th in the nation in two point percentage as well. Not to mention they only shoot around 67% from the free throw line as well. With all this being said Kentucky is 17th in the nation in opponent effective fg% holding their opponents to just 40.9% and teams are shooting just 26% from behind the line against them, and just 41% from two point range! \n\nNow you may be thinking Kentucky -5.5 is the play after all that being said (and I do like that as well) however… the Spartans and izzo do know how to beat teams without shooting the ball well and that is what makes izzo and the Spartans such a dangerous team. They managed to beat Arkansas shooting 41% from the field and just 7% from three! That game ended with a total of 135 points! Kentucky is shooting 59% effective fg% at 20th in the nation and around 34% from three which is average at about 144th in the nation. However like I said, the Spartans are relentless on defense and hold their opponents to 48% effective fg% (which is what the Spartans themselves shoot) and 31% three point range. \n\nBoth teams have some real size and matchup very well with each other on paper as they are both top 17 in the nation in total rebounds per game. \n\nI do not think the Spartans can afford to turn this into a shootout and izzo without a doubt knows this. If they want to have a shot to take down Kentucky tomorrow they are going to have to slow this game down, limit possessions, relentless defense, and taking the time to actually get a quality shot up each possession which does nothing but  bleed clock. The Spartans do not have the three point range to turn this into a game in the 80s and I think they will do a great job of keeping it the way they want to play, and if shit hits the fan I don’t think they’ll do enough to force this game over the total either. \n\nWith sharp money on our side, reverse line movement, and a clear gameplan for the under I believe we have a solid POTD for ourselves. We have been having a great year in cbb and all sports in general! As always, cheers 🍻 \n\nIf you enjoy the picks and want to leave a tip: https://venmo.com/ben_wrigley they are greatly appreciated!",

On defense he’s always around the action, boxing out, crashing the glass, and doing all the little things that lead to extra rebounds.\n\nAnd honestly, based on his season averages, if the game plays out normally he should land over 10.5 RA more often than not.

With both teams fighting to automatically qualify for the World Cup, the teams will be eager & highly aggressive in pushing up the field and getting a lead. \n\nCheers 🍻",

Woltemade came through in the 19th minute with a header from a corner to net Germany their first of 6 goals on the day and clinch their spot in the World Cup. We also hit a +640 ATGS Parlay in the soccer thread. Great day overall! \n\nToday we head to Scotland where our hosts face off against Denmark in another winner take all match to decide the group. Winner goes to the World Cup, loser heads to the 16 team playoffs in March, where only 4 teams will make it in. Of additional note is that Denmark goes through with a tie, so Scotland will need to be on the attack here at home. I'm expecting an end to end match here with both teams needing (and expecting) a win here. I'd be shocked if we wind up 0-0 like the reverse fixture in Denmark back in September. \n\nDenmark have had a mildly disappointing World Cup Qualifier thus far, in a group that they were expecting to run away with, and are coming off a disappointing draw against Belarus at home a few days ago. Now here they are, fighting for a spot at the World Cup away from home. They will be aggressive and want the win here and likely control the ball much of the match (73% possession in their last match), which much like our Kvaratskhelia pick, suits us just fine for this pick. \n\nJohn McGinn, the captain of Aston Villa and 5th most capped Scotland player of all time, is my favorite kind of player to back. If you read any of my other write ups you'll notice a theme, but I really do like to back hard working midfielders/strikers who don't shy away from a challenge and always sprint to attack on breaks. Our guy McGinn obviously falls into this bucket and is a fun guy to watch on both ends of the pitch. McGinn has played all 90 minutes in every world cup qualifying match here and is the back-up captain for Scotland, so I see him playing the full 90 here again. We are getting good odds here as he has only hit this line in 2 of the 5 WC qualifying matches. But I've noticed a pattern that he tends to take more shots in the 2nd match of international breaks, hitting 1 SOT in all 3 of these matches this year. I'm also backing the intangibles a bit here, in that I like him to leverage his experience in the big game, take a few shots, and work hard to get his country to their first World Cup since 1998. \n\nBOL!",

I spent the day taking care of my dog post surgery & we watched Western Michigan & Northern Illinois film while he was high on meds. He & I both agreed that this is the play. The Western Michigan Broncos (6-4, 5-1 MAC) are traveling to Dekalb, Illinois to take on the Northern Illinois Huskies (3-7, 2-4 MAC) at Huskie Stadium. Northern Illinois has had a brutal season this year, huge 180 after having a solid 8-5 season & winning the Idaho Potato Bowl. Now this season they are disqualified from the bowl eligibility & have been a punching bag all season. Last week NIU blew out UMass 45-3, seems like they’re turning it around right? False. UMass is the worst team in college football, with an 0-10 record, & an average scoring margin that ranks last in the NCAA (-30.0). The week before NIU lost to Toledo 3-42. Western Michigan beat Toledo 14-13 earlier this season. The week before NIU beat Ball St 21-7, WMU beat them 42-0. Week before that NIU got wrecked by Ohio 21-48, WMU just beat Ohio 17-13 last week. Ohio is a good MAC team. Ohio & Central Michigan were both tied for 1st place with WMU in the MAC Standings. WMU just beat them both the last 2 weeks to take the lead in the MAC standings. WMU has only 1 conference loss & their only other losses came in nonconference play against Michigan State, Illinois, & North Texas. North Texas is 9-1 & ranked 22nd in the country in the AP polls, & they had to come back & win in OT to beat WMU. Western Michigan has a good team & with a win this week they’ll improve to 6-1 & will lock up a spot in Detroit in the MAC Title Game. __WMU have been covering machines this year with a (7-3) ATS record. Western Michigan has covered every time (3-0) as a 5.5 point favorite or greater this year. Northern Illinois on the other hand is (3-7) ATS record so far this season. Northern Illinois has just 1 win ATS (1-3) as a 5.5-point underdog or more this year.__ The Huskies are going to have a tough time this week vs a Western Michigan team that is rolling & looking to lock their spot in the MAC Ship.\n\nWestern Michigan has had a successful season this year due to an elite MAC defense. They are an incredibly defensive 1st team. __The Broncos allow 291.4 yards per game, 12th in the nation. They rank 7th in FBS in passing yards allowed (161.1), 34th in yards per carry allowed (3.9 ypc), & 16th in scoring defense allowing just 18.9 points per game.__ They are even more elite in their EPA (Expected Points Added) defensive numbers. __WMU has #2 EPA defense in the MAC, one of just 2 teams that have held their opponents to a negative EPA (-0.029). They have the 2nd best EPA/run allowed in the MAC. But they rank #1 in EPA/pass allowed in the MAC (-0.055), 40th best in the nation (which is crazy for a MAC team).__ That doesn’t bode well for an NIU team that hasn’t been able to pass all year. The NIU offense has been brutal this year. __Northern Illinois ranks 130th in offensive EPA & are the 2nd worst in EPA Margin in the MAC (-0.335). They have the 2nd worst EPA/pass in the nation & rank just 104th in epa/run. They haven’t had a QB top 90 yards in their last 3 games. NIU is averaging just 108.1 passing yards per game, 3rd fewest in the nation. Averaging even fewer at home with 76 yards per game, 2nd fewest.__ That normally would mean that they have an elite run game. __However, they faced a defense similar to WMU in Toledo 2 weeks ago (both ranked 52 & 53 in EPA), & NIU had just 62 yards on 36 carries. That’s an average of just 1.7 yards per carry.__ NIU has had obvious QB trouble all season. Last week Jalen Macon (6-5, 230) took over at QB for Josh Holst. He's thrown just 4 times all year, but he is a dual threat QB who uses his legs more than his arm. Still, it doesn’t look like this offense has any desires to pass the ball with Macon. Last week he threw just 4 passes vs the 2nd worst pass defense in the MAC. He completed 3 of those throws for 73 yards, but 67 of those yards came on 1 pass in busted coverage. If WMU takes a lead NIU doesn’t have the ability to come back with no pass game. It doesn’t help that WMU has a stout DLine either. __WMU ranks 31st in pressure rate in the NCAA & will eat this weak NIU OLine alive.__ NIU’s offense just can’t do anything vs solid defenses. __Despite scoring 42 points last week, NIU still ranks 132nd in scoring offense at just 15.5 points per game.__ Where Northern Illinois struggles the most is on 3rd down. __NIU ranks 127th in 3rd down %, converting 32% of the time for a 1st down. WMU ranks 23rd in the country in 3rd down defense, allowing its opponents to convert at just 33.6%.__ They’ll have their hands full with this defense, but this game is going to come down to Western Michigan’s offense.\n\nLast week Western Michigan faced Ohio, both teams were 4-1 & were playing for 1st place in MAC standings. __Ohio had the #2 ranked EPA Defense in the MAC & WMU had a highly efficient offensive performance. WMU ranked 10th in the country last week in offensive success rate (57.1%). They outgained Ohio 336-287 in yards & won the turnover battle 1-0.__ There was a QB competition earlier this year between Broc Lowry and Brady Jones, Lowry took over & now has a 7 to 1 TD/INT ratio with a 64.7% completion rate & is the team’s leading rusher in yards, carries, & rushing TD’s. Most importantly he has taken great care of the football in this rushing offense. __Lowry is the highest graded QB in the MAC with a 82.1 grade (per PFSN).__ But where WMU does their damage on offense is on the ground. __WMU has averaged 177.7 rushing yards their last 3 games, 2 of which were against the best 2 defenses in the MAC. NIU has the 132nd EPA/run defense in the nation, 114th vs the pass.__ Western Michigan’s biggest weakness on offense has been ball control. __WMU has lost 8 fumbles this year. But that’s not going to be a problem vs an NIU defense that has just 3 fumble recoveries on the season & had only recovered 33% of fumbles (118th). WMU has been elite at recovering fumbles, snagging 56% of them (39th).__ NIU doesn’t have any advantages on either side of the ball. *Ran out of room but wanted to focus more on WMU’s defense.* \n\nWestern Michigan has both a better offense & defense with a +3.4 point differential, as opposed to Northern Illinois who has -6.7 point differential.\n\nBroncos Country, let’s ride.\n\n__Western Michigan -5.5__\n\nAppreciate the love!

The Netherlands attacked the entire game. It was disappointing to see them just constantly recycle possession outside the box instead of putting a few balls in or getting some long shots away. \n\nI got on a hedge early in the second half, so I didn't lose money, but I was disappointed to miss the POTD. \n\nToday's Pick: Belgium to win to nil AND Romania to win to nil. 4u @ $1.78\n\nNot a hell of a lot to say here. Backing the two worst teams in Europe to not score and lose is pretty safe to me. Also, I got on this yesterday at $2.17, and it's already down to $1.78, so I'd expect it to go down more too. \n\nHowever, for the sake of the write-up. \n\nTop of the group, Belgium play at home against the bottom of the group, Liechtenstein. \n\nLichtenstein have lost every game and are yet to score, conceding 24 in the process. Last time these guys played, Belgium won 6-0. \n\nRomania had the wind knocked out of them against Bosnia a few days ago (great for us though). Even with that, I can't see them doing anything silly vs San Marino. \n\nThey might not be going at 100%, but San Marino to not score is always a good bet. ",

That brings us to a SIX GAME WINNING STREAK.\n\n \n\nNext Pick: **Desmond Bane (Magic) O18.5 Pts @ 1.84**. 3U play.\n\nBane has been shooting poorly all season, and in fact, has shot above 50% just once in his L10 games. Why am I taking his over you ask? Because he’s gaining confidence with every game, and the missed shots aren’t reducing his FGAs nor his aggression. He’s also a near-perfect free throw shooter, and I expect he’ll do quite a bit of that against the Warriors. He’s taken between 15-20 FGAs in each of his last 4 games, and with Paolo out, he’s taken on more responsibility for the offense. He’s shooting just 27% from 3 with the Magic, but I attribute that to his adjustment to a new system and new team. It's only a matter of time. As a final vote of confidence, he is over this line in 4 straight games for the Magic, and all 3 games against the Warriors in 2025 (with the Grizz). Between the high FGAs, free throws, 3pt mean reversion and a favorable matchup, he has many paths to get over this line. \n\n\n\n*If you’ve enjoyed these picks, tips are always appreciated:* [Link](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/TheBrat)",

Ghiță; Kbilashvili is predominantly active on 7-meter shots. This limits \"easy scoring\" opportunities.

It comes as no suprise that San Marino are not given a great chance tomorrow. Sitting bottom of the group with a record of 0-0-7 with 1 goal scored and 32 goals against.. Romania on the other hand have missed the chance to qualify for the World Cup via the group and will have to settle for the playoffs. It appears they will field a strong team tomorrow and I would be suprised to see them win by 5+. However, I think the -2.5 handicap is the sweet spot, just incase they take their foot off the gas late on.\n\nPick 2 - Austria ML. Austria come into this game knowing a win or draw vs 2nd place Bosnia see’s them win the group and go to the World Cup. They come into the game with a record of 6-0-1 in the group having scored 21 goals and conceded only 3, impressively not conceding a single shot on target in their last game vs Cyprus. \n\nAustria are starting to look a very strong side under Ralf Ragnick and come into this game with no fresh injury concerns. Bosnia however have 3 players suspended. \n\nBosnia are a half decent side but it as very much been a case of them being the best of the rest in the group and Austria should be able to take control of the game and get the job done. I predict a 2-0 win for the hosts. \n\nAs always nothing is guaranteed in sport so bet responsibly.. but the facts point towards this being a winning play on a very regular basis.\n\nIf you appreciate my picks and are making money, any tip is appreciated link below for the research etc.\n\nhttps://paypal.me/PaymePlease9937\n\nBOL to those tailing and as always, see you on the other side  🫡🫡🫡",

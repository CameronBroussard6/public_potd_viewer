      "text": "Last 5 POTD : ✅️✅️✅️❌️✅️\n\n**Previous pick**: Sweden(W) vs Switzerland(W) under 4.5 goals (+105) ✅️ (Sweat-free pick honestly even the gold medal game went under 4)\n\n**POTD Record**: 29-22\n\n**Today's Pick:** Canada vs Finland 10:30am EST (Olympics/Men's Hockey)\n\nCanada 1st period Puck line -0.5 (-110)\n\nUgh I gotta say guys I looked at a couple of props and this one is the one I feel most confident about with the best odds. I think we all saw Finland vs Switzerland and how it went in the first period(don't remind me please lol). Anywayyy I was not impressed at all by Finland's performance. Switzerland had 3 good NHL defensemen but come on now. Except for 6 Swiss forwards who are in the NHL, everybody else played in the Swiss league and Switzerland even had played the day before. Meanwhile Finland had fresh legs, a full NHL lineup anddd they were facing a 38 year old goalie starting again on a back-to-back. Until the 3rd period they looked a lot of times lost in their own end making bad plays after bad plays(go watch the highlights the defensive miscues were plenty). The smaller rink might have honestly been more of a factor for NHL players than what I originally thought in these Olympics. Players have less space and this seems to favor the European players who are most used to it than NHLers (Slovakia is in the other semi-final with 7 NHL players). Now tomorrow it will be NHL players vs NHL players so I don't think there will be surprises like what we saw vs Czechia. Tomorrow it will come down to the powerplay and raw talent which Canada is better in both. They are the faster and better team and I expect them to have a much better start than against Czechia. Canada is expected to win this one so it's not my \"hockey expert analysis\" here guys. The game vs Czechia was way too close than what it should have been and they know it too. They have the firepower to do it and I expect them to come out roaring in that first period to make sure the game doesn't go out of hands. Why are the odds so low then? The big factor here for team Canada to hit this prop lays on Jordan Binnington and how will he play tomorrow. I know Binnington was shaky vs Czechia but I don't expect him to have 2 bad games in a row especially with a finals spot on the line. He did win the gold with Canada at 4Nations so we know that he can be better than what we saw vs Czechia and I expect him to be solid.\n\nAnother factor that for me feels like will help team Canada is the injury of Sidney Crosby. Crosby has been a legend for team Canada for 20 years and he might not be available tomorrow. Team Canada said after their comeback to Czechia that they didn't want that game to be Sidney's last game in the Olympics and if he's out vs Finland you know the young guns on the team who used to idolize him will be extra motivated to win for him and have a good showing. His absence will be missed for team Canada but they have plenty of great players that can help cover and that probably means more minutes for MacKinnon and McDavid which is good for us.\n\nIn other words, for me it comes down to how Binnington will play tomorrow in that first period and how Canada will respond early after their almost embarrassing loss to Czechia (they played against each other a week ago and Canada won 5-0 so I think Canada just thought that game was gonna be a breeze and underestimated their opponents). I strongly believe that Canada and Binnington will have a much better start as they are proven winners and also that before Czechia's game, Canada hit the 0.5 first period prop in **every other games in these Olympics.**\n\nBOL! Please play responsably?\n\n[Buymeacoffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/lordestros)",

      "text": "Current Record: 8W - 5L\n\nLast Bet: PARIVISION double chance vs Yandex + Tundra ML vs Execration (@1.70) ✅\n\nSport: eSports | Dota 2 \n\nEvent: DreamLeague Season 28\n\nMatch: Team Liquid vs paiN Gaming + NAVI vs Execration \n\nPOTD: PARLAY: Team Liquid ML + NAVI ML \n\nOdds: 2.20\n\nUnit: 4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ovo1fsd8djkg1.png?width=339&format=png&auto=webp&s=057fff60dfbe83d52b3dc56790b0ac44bae192cf\n\nRecap: Yesterday was a bit rough at 5-5, but overall 28-13 this dreamleague major and a few CS2 picks. A few people in the comments asked why we didn't just take PARIVISION 2-0 yesterday. We got our answer when they dropped a map to Yandex. That 1-1 draw would have ruined the parlay, which is exactly why we played it as a Double Chance/ML anchor instead. We are staying disciplined with our reads to keep the main record climbing.\n\nHuge thanks to everyone following the heat.\n\nWRITE-UP: NAVI is the primary focus of this parlay. They are currently fighting for their lives in Group B and absolutely must win this series 2-0 to secure a spot in the next stage. They are facing Execration, who have struggled all tournament with a 2-10 record. NAVI has a perfect head-to-head history against them. The motivation gap here and the skill difference are just huge.\n\nPairing them with Team Liquid to bring the odds to a solid 2.20. While Liquid is already safe for the next round,  and even though they are safe for the next stage, they still need the better ranking in this current stage to qualify for RIYADH MASTERS, so there are not going to be any cheese picks to fuck up our parlay. They are facing a paiN Gaming squad that is already eliminated and recently had roster instability after kicking their carry (Parker and his dramas). The skill difference between the current BLAST champs and a demoralized paiN roster is too wide to ignore. This is a high-probability combo to keep the streak alive.\n\nIf you have any trouble finding these lines or need help with your slips, feel free to reach out. I am always happy to help.",

      "text": "Dubai/Doha/Delray: 2-3 (-5.8 units)\n\nAustralian Open: 8-3 (+17.8 units)\n\n2026 record: 13-11 (+2.5 units) | 2025 record: 55-41 (+26.5 units)\n\nEvent: ATP Delray Beach QF 🎾\n\nPick of the Day: Casper Ruud 🇳🇴 ML vs Sebastian Korda 🇺🇸 5 units to win 5.5U @2.10 (Bet365)\n\nYou will never see me post women’s tennis ever again, way too volatile. The books love Korda don’t they? This does seem a bit over the top though. Both players came through really tough matches in the last round, Korda had to save 4 SP’s in the second set to Michelsen whilst Ruud battled back from a set down to Giron. Casper recently became a father which explained his absence since AO but really started finding his rhythm against Giron after the second set which is going to be a big positive coming into this match as he was obviously slightly rusty to kick things off, especially against a player he’d struggled against in the past. Korda has been playing a lot of tennis but I don’t think the match fitness edge is going to have too much of an impact since Ruud is simply the better player in my mind. \n\nThe slower and bouncier courts should favour Ruud’s heavy topspin game more than Korda’s flatter strokes. That means that he should be able to reset Korda’s attacks with a deep ball that is difficult to control and will have the upper hand once rallies are dragged out as his rally tolerance is simply better. Can Sebi hit through this? Absolutely as he’s an excellent ball striker but the more he receives, the more he’ll be prone to miss. The topspin on Ruud’s shots also means that the American will have to be in the right strike zone to have a clean hitting point and whilst his anticipation is generally quite good, his lateral movement is poor which might make it difficult to truly attack every shot and being off balance is going to invite Casper to come in and finish the points. I have seen a lot more offensive intent from the Norwegian as well recently to take even more time away from his opponents plus has slightly tweaked the serve, fired 20 aces past Giron last round which is going to be a welcome addition. Korda is going to cause some issues on the serve + 1 and with the shorter points which is why I think the match will be relatively close but I still think Ruud will have more looks on return especially if Korda’s 1st serve percentage falters in a game and therefore can take initiative. Casper leads the H2H 2-0, both matches being last year including in Stockholm where Korda theoretically had a better chance of winning on a fast court compared to today. Most importantly though is the fact that Christian Ruud (Casper’s father) defeated Petr Korda (Sebi’s father) in 1999 so it’s only logical that the Ruud’s have the Korda’s number. I would have fairer odds closer to 1.8 adjusting for a very slight concern on Casper’s sharpness and predict a 2-1 win. BOL !",

      "text": "Out of the 10 maps Paravision has played on de_dust2 this year, Jame has hit this line in 8/10 of them (17.7 avg kills). The only two times he went under were due to blowouts wins (13-1, 13-4). Paravision boasts a 78% win rate across 14 matches of Dust 2, due in part to Jame’s stellar calling and AWPing.  Paravision is just about guaranteed to select this map and I do not see them blowing out a top 5 team with superstar talent such as Falcons. De_dust 2 is Paravision’s playground. A map in which they are capable of defeating any team in the world. Jame is Parvision’s AWPer and captain. De_dust 2 also lends itself to the AWPing role quite well, with it historically being a pop off map for AWPers given the long site lines on each lane of the map. Without a strong AWPing performance, your chances of winning Dust 2 decrease significantly. With Jame being the captain and IGL, he will put himself in positions to succeed with the AWP in order to give his team the best opportunity to win the match.  The only negative factors I am able to locate regarding this wager are the blowout potential (low) and an AWP H2H vs a top 3 player in the world mOnesy (doesnt directly affect Jame’s kill total).

The Mavs have now lost 9 straight, only covering the spread in 2 of those games and are now without Cooper Flagg for this matchup. Their second best scorer, Naji Marshall left before the end of the teams last game, and appears to be playing tomorrow but he will struggle to orchestrate the offence due to Gobert's paint presence. The Mavs front office also appears to have deemed this season a wash after selling at the deadline and shutting down Kyrie for the rest of the year. Coming out of the break, the team doesn't have anything to play for except a lottery pick. The timberwolves have won 7 of their last 10, and are itching towards a top 4 seed. At home, their defence is ranked third in defensive efficiency, while Dallas ranks 4th last. Im backing the healthier, deeper, more talented, and more motivated team at home to cover against the tanking Mavs. BOL.\n\n[https://buymeacoffee.com/ch1cken](https://buymeacoffee.com/ch1cken)",

Their most creative player is out with an injury, and their #9 couldn’t score to save his life right now. They are entirely dependent on individual brilliance from Leandro Paredes. They are facing a Racing team that, despite a shaky start, has secured 2 consecutive wins and has a consolidated manager who knows exactly how to play these types of \"Clásicos.\" Racing is the more balanced team here.\n\nRosario Central vs Talleres: Not much more to say about Rosario Central—we’ve backed them several times and they are a powerhouse at home. I’m taking the double chance (1X) to secure the parlay. They are playing against a weak Talleres side that has only won against lower-division teams in the Cup recently and has looked very poor at the start of this tournament. Central has a high-quality squad and often gets the \"benefit of the doubt\" from the referees when playing at home.\n\nAs always, manage your bankroll and BOL!!",

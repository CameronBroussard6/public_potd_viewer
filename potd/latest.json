All picks 1 unit, unless stated otherwise.\n\n\nLast event: Soccer/Football, [England National League South] Chelmsford vs Hornchurch\nLast pick: BTTS @ 1.72 L\n\n\nEvent: Soccer/Football, [Scotland Challenge Cup] East Kilbride vs Celtic B\n\n\nPick: BTTS + OVER 2.5 GOALS @ 2.05\n\n\nBoth teams have played 5 very high scoring games in this cup so far, 5 total goals per game for Celtic, 4.4 for East Kilbride. East Kilbride covered this line in 4/5 games, Celtic in 4/5 as well. East Kilbride are the favourites here, however they're already qualified and will advance so Celtic should be scoring here even easier as they've done that on all teams they played so far. East Kilbride have allowed goals to the weakest teams in this cup as they beat Hearts B 3-2, Motherwell B 3-1 (the only goal that Motherwell scored in this cup).",

Celtic volume of corners per game shows as they sit first in the Scottish Premiership for Corners awarded and coming up against german opposition I expect an end to end game that Stuttgart wont shy from. They'll look to take a lead early and sit compact but the tempo clash will be our benefit.\n\nStuttgart rank third in the Bundesliga for corners awarded only behind Bayern and U Berlin and I see them pressing high and taking value in set pieces away from home.\n\n\\---\n\n**If You're from Ontario and Dont have MGM LMK!**\n\n**BOL**",

Tauson is the No. 15 and is defending finals points here in Dubai. This masters event has been an absolute sham with all the withdrawals and the walkovers which has led to a really open draw for quite a few players. Unfortunately for the Dane, I see her adventure ending here. She’s had a pretty bad start to the season and struggled with fitness earlier on and was knocked out easily by Siniakova in Qatar. She’s done well so far this tournament with straight set victories over Kenin, Stearns and Linette but this is another level. Pegula reached the semis of both Brisbane and the AO where she ended up losing to the eventual winner Rybakina in the latter. Jessie steamrolled her way past Gracheva and Jovic to make the quarters here.\n\nTauson is a player with a big serve and aggressive groundstrokes which translates fairly well to the medium-fast courts of Dubai. However, she is really going to need her first serve percentage to be perfect to have a real shot in this match. If she sustains the 42% and 55% from the two previous rounds Pegula is going to have a field day on the second serves. The match-up is pretty bad for Clara as Pegula is going to force her to move a lot which is a major weakness of hers. Jessie’s returning is also excellent which is going to force a lot of neutral balls and force errors out of Tauson. The No. 5 has built a reputation as a player who commits few errors, will force you to play the extra shot while keeping it deep and provide little angles to attack her from. As a result she usually falls short against the elite players who manage to hit through this more defensive tactic but Tauson isn’t part of that group and I can see this be an error fest as the match goes on especially with her movement issues. I can only realistically see one close set before Pegula pulls away and with the prices similar to Jessie 2-0, I would rather take the under games just in case Tauson puts out the performance of a life time and fires winners with no possible response like when she beat Sabalenka 3 and 2 here last year. Pegula had seen the under clear pretty easily in her last 10 matches and routinely defeated better power hitters such as Anisimova and Keys in Melbourne. I would give more appropriate odds to be around 1.60 for this play. BOL !",

His role leans heavily toward spot-up and transition threes, and he’s not shy about letting them fly when he gets space.\n\nIndiana ranks in the lower tier defending the three and plays at a top-10 pace, which creates extra possessions and more catch-and-shoot opportunities.

Dominant overall win from Canada.\n\nPick: Olympic Hockey Women (USA vs Canada) | **USA to win and both teams to score** | 1PM ET | (1.75 on BetMGM) (2 units)\n\n**Writeup:** I was originally going to post US -1.5 spread but the odds have gone down so I'll go with another option. And digging deeper, I would avoid the spread as most IIHF and Olympic gold medal games have been a 1 goal difference and the odds are now too low.\n\nIn all of the US 6 games, they've been utterly dominant. 5 straight shutouts most being 5-0. The important thing is the only real competitors are the US and Canada. Since the start of women's hockey in the Olympics, only Canada and the US have won gold. When they played a few days back, the US won easily 5-0. Key part is the Canadians were missing their star player, Poulin. Her return will help with achieving both teams to score, but I don't believe its enough to win the game. The american roster is really good this year and I think they take home gold.",

USA have played very well in the round robin and are not getting enough credit with this spread. Their front end can certainly keep up with the Swiss front end and keep these ends tight. Peterson and Tirinzoni have 17 career head-to-head matches and Peterson has covered +3.5 in 13 of them, including the most recent matchup at Worlds last year. I would like this play even without the motivation factor but USA fighting for a playoff spot while Switzerland has already clinched is an added bonus.",

We are moving away from home for a bit and heading to Saudi Arabia, where we’ve been perfect so far.

They are facing the bottom-tier team that has managed only 1 win in 21 matches. This should be a walk in the park. I'm taking the -1.5 AH. If you feel risky, you can go for -2 or -2.5, but that's on you.\n\nAl-Ettifaq vs Al-Fateh: Ettifaq is a solid mid-to-high table team with European-level experience (Wijnaldum, Rodak). They only lost 3 of their last 10, and those were against 2 of the top 3 giants. Playing at home against a lesser rival, they shouldn't lose this one. Double Chance (1X) for the parlay.",

They ended the year on a 17 map winstreak before losing their last game of 2025 to 9INE, meaning they are 23-1 in their last 24 Inferno maps played.\n* Johnny Speeds are 50% winrate on 6 maps of Inferno in 2026, they are 1-3 in their last 4 overall on the map. In 2025 they were 14-12 with a 54% winrate on the map, however it wasn't quite a strong map for them but one a lot of teams picked against them, they also had a couple farm wins at local lans against bad teams as well.\n* Two big keys for Alliance, they are 57.6% winrate on T side, and 57.1% of pistol rounds won, they have dominant starts and come out swinging for big first halfs\n* Johnny Speeds have struggled on both their CT sides and pistol rounds on Inferno, winning only 46% of CT rounds and only 48% of pistol rounds despite their positive overall winrate. Alliance have outscored Johnny Speeds on T side Inferno 28-8 in their h2h matches or \\~78% of rounds\n\n**Final Notes:**\n\n* I mentioned yesterday we almost never see a team with a perma ban choose to ban their opponents best map instead, which is very true, however, if their was ever a series I think a team would try it, it may be this one. Alliance have pummeled Johnny Speeds 13-4 in three straight h2h's including 8 days ago.\n* Despite this possibility, Johnny Speeds have a small history on Ancient and it has been awful, they were 1-7 on Ancient as a team and lost mostly one sided games, Alliance are on a 4L streak on Ancient, however the teams they have lost to were mostly tier 1.5 teams (BC Game/OG/BIG), they are historically a strong Ancient team, still 56% winrate in the L3 months overall despite the loss streak and 40-17 overall. Just wanted to put this as a possibility I am aware of and would back Alliance just as hard on Ancient as Inferno.\n* Alliance -2.5 rounds Map 2 or 1x2 ML are strong alternatives if you don't like the juice at -145",

Super dominant by the Premier League side, much as expected. \n\nToday we head to Greece for some Europa League action. Same playoff structure as Champion's League, each team plays a game at home and away. I'm expecting a very similar setup here, where the home teams play aggressively to try and win the tie at home and the away teams try to counter. End to end games like the last few days of UCL.\n\nThat said I'm surprised this line is so high. Both of these teams average scoring right at 2 goals per Europa match and are not great defensively. PAOK had the highest scoring matches in the entire Europa League in their first 8 matches, averaging 4 goals per game. Celta Vigo average 3.2 goals per game, and only one match had less than 3 goals and that was against RSB, the team with the lowest average scoring games in the league. \n\nBOL if you choose to tail, happy Thursday!",

I do favor Gamba to progress from this match, but I do have some question marks about their offensive ability, especially if the opponent is sitting back. Both of Gamba’s league games so far have ended 0-0 and we saw it very much against city rivals Cerezo when they had a player sent off and sat back in a low block, how the Gamba players could not break them down. Gamba also without some big players in the attack from last season like Mitsuta and Juan Alano, it also looks like their big star Takashi Usami is also missing the game, but not 100% sure about that. \n\nPohang Steelers saw very few goals in their end of season run-in, especially away was there few goals, as only 2 of their last 14 saw more than two. They come here pretty much full strength after not losing anyone important during the winter window. I think the highlight from the game in South Korea was the Steelers goalkeeper who had another really good game and had kept five straight clean sheets before that. \n\nWe could always get some nonsense like what we saw in the Sanfrecce game, where they first gave away a stupid penalty, before one of their players made a nice diving header to send the ball into their own net… However, I think we will get a game where Gamba will pass and pass and pass the ball around trying to find a way through, and Steelers will hope they can grab a goal on the counter. In the end neither side will see much success.  \n\n",

Gold medal match, and USA has just steamrolled through the competition. Like, it wasn't even close. The Americans have a 31-1 goal difference, and that lone goal given up came in the first game. They've scored at least 5 every single game, including 5-0 against this same Canada squad a week ago. \n\nUSA has beaten every single team ranked in IIHF\"s top 6 (except themselves) with a combined score of 25-1. The closest game was that first game against Czechia 5-1. Obviously since this is the gold medal match, play will be tighter and I don't expect the US to win by 5 again, but that also means Canada won't have many shooting lanes against the US. The US controls the puck *extremely* well and if it's anything like the first game, they will be living in the Canadian third.",

AC draw out the game thanks to a second half goal. Nice little cash for you guys, lets keep the ball rolling now. Have a great day folks!\n\nFirst and foremost we go to the WTA Dubai where Pegula (ranked 5th) and Tauson (ranked 15th) are facing off. This is their first matchup, so no previous head-to-head data to work from. Based off **singles outdoor hard** information we can see this: Tauson owns a 7-3 record in her last 10 since 19th Jan, going 3-2 in the last 5, with wins in the last 3 - Pegula comes into this fixture going 8-2, 4-1 in the last 5. Many of Pegula's most recent wins are coming from players under ranking 20 (3 of the last 5 she has beaten were ranks 60, 20, 17 and 6) all in straight sets, losing to rank 3 Rybakina. Tauson has not faced a player in the last 5 games under the rank 30. Now, this information itself is not indicative of future results, based off recent opponents, ranking and form I see Pegula winning this one, maybe not in straight sets like most her wins as I think Tauson keeps it close but she can see it out.\n\nRugby League World Club Challenge is for leg two. Since the start of 2025 Hull own a home record of 13-2, Brisbane have an away record of 8-6. It must be said that Brisbane do look to be favourites with good reason, but they have not played a game this year yet. Hull have played two, both away with a 104-0 win at Lock Lane and 19-18 shock loss at York. Brisbane's forwards tend to win the collisions, gaining more ground after contact - with this also comes an advantage in territory pressure and scoreboard results. Hull tend to struggle against strong rotation in the middle and ruck speed is an issue - BUT I do think the extra games, the home advantage, the travelling team coming from Australia to the UK (different environment, weather, grounds etc.) can force the game to be close even with the Broncos being strong favourites. I think they can keep it within +12.5, feel free to buy down to +14.5 or +16.5 if that makes you more comfortable.\n\n**BOL and always bet what you can afford to lose!**",

      "text": "Record: 180-151, +3.80 units\n\nLast Pick: Zhizhen Zhang +3.5 games vs Jakub Mensik (-120, 1 unit): Loss\n\nTennis | ATP Doha | 12:40 PM EST (estimated) (estimated)\n\nToday's Pick: Jannik Sinner vs Jakub Mensik | Mensik +5.5 games at -105. 1 unit. \n\nWrite-up: I have to admit that I was totally wrong there. Zhang didn't necessarily play badly, but Mensik was excellent. I don't think too many people tailed though, because my post didn't appear until a few hours before the match due to automod issues. I'm always willing to admit when I had the wrong read on a player's form, and I'm actually backing Mensik today. \n\nInteresting match between Sinner and Mensik here, as it's actually only the second time Sinner or Alcaraz has met one of the three players in the younger generation (Fonseca, Mensik, and Tien), with the first one being Sinner's 6-2, 6-2 win over Tien in last year's Beijing final. However, Mensik has already shown that he's not afraid of the titans of the game, having beaten Novak Djokovic in last year's Miami final and taken a set off him the year before. A lot of comparisons have been drawn between Mensik and Alexander Zverev, who is widely regarded as the best player to never win a Grand Slam - they both have strong, high-percentage first serves, questionable second serves (Zverev has improved on this quite a bit), elite backhands, and powerful, but error-prone forehands. Indeed, Zverev has generally played tight sets against Sinner if you ignore one drubbing at last year's Paris Masters. However, one distinguishing factor I see between Mensik and Zverev is mentality. Even at 20 years old, Mensik seems to be willing to be aggressive on big points, to have the composure to truly take down his idols and not just come within a few points. He also tends to stay focused even when he's down in a set, so I would trust him not to start throwing away service games even if Sinner secures an early break. \n\nThe serve is Mensik's biggest weapon, and he showed it in his first two matches here (8.3 and 8.4 serve ratings). In comparison, Sinner maybe hasn't been as dialed in on return as usual (7.5, 7.6), and failed to cover this spread in R2 against an out-of-form Alexei Popyrin. The conditions here in Doha are often viewed as quite slow, but I would say that the courts themselves are actually medium-speed. The variable desert winds and low humidity are the real X-factors that can make life tough for big hitters, but conditions have been quite mild so far, and that should continue tomorrow with highs of around 26 degrees celsius, 7 mph wind, and 30% humidity expected tomorrow. Mensik already played on this center court in the first round, and the crowd is honestly pretty nonexistent, so I don't expect him to have any trouble adjusting to the moment. I don't expect him to break Sinner's serve, but Sinner's forehand hasn't been quite the weapon we've seen in the past this year, and I expect Jannik to be tinkering with his game a bit in lower-tier events like this one. I'm not concerned about whether Mensik can hold up on the backhand wing, but the only question mark is whether his forehand breaks down. Honestly, though, all aspects of his game have been firing this year, and he's already won a title and made the second week of the Australian Open. My only concerns about him in the second round were physical due to his injury layoff, but those are mostly gone now after seeing how he performed. I think this spread is a bit wide, and I expect him to cover it. \n\nNote: The [POTD Capper Tracker](https://potd.lol), which you may remember from its Google Sheet days, is finally back in a cleaner, more robust website format!

Celje were without a doubt the greatest underdog story last season, reaching the quarter finals of the Conference League and only narrowly losing to Fiorentina on aggregate in what was their first ever European appearance. In the process, their midfielder, Seslar, set the record for the most assists in the competition's history. Super impressive stuff. A lot of that success has to be credited to their manager, **Albert Riera, who is now no longer at the club,** having recently taken over Frankfurt midseason. This is going to be a **huge blow for Celje,** who have already dropped some points in the league immediately after his departure.\n\nNot only that, but they've **sold their best striker,** Kovacevic, to Ferencvaros. For those unaware, Kovacevic was at one point **the most in-form striker in Europe,** bagging goals for fun. For a short period of time, he even had more than Kane and Haaland *(granted, he played in a weaker league, but it's still nothing to scoff at).* They absolutely haven't found the replacement for him yet.\n\nI think the odds just haven't updated yet and don't reflect the sheer drop in quality that Celje now possess after losing one of the most talented managers in Europe rn, as well as their main attacking output. *Drita are still a slight underdog,* but these odds for what is essentially a DC are too good to pass up on. They're very **defensively sound,** and neither team is going to push too hard in the first leg. **Celje are playing away from home,** so their main goal is coming out of this game undefeated. Everything is going my way atm so I'm going in with 5 whole units. Feeling a low scoring affair here, so Under 3.5 goals sounds good if you want to ramp the odds up even further, but I'd just stick to the outlined POTD personally. BOL and let's enjoy an exotic football matchup ☘️🫡",

It seems reasonable as Detroit is a top rebounding team that ranks #5 in fewest RPG allowed to opponents.\n\nHowever, Detroit will be without their first and second center, Duren and Stewart, due to suspension, moving Paul Reed to starting center position. Robinson, coming off the bench, will therefore be matched up against either 4th-string center (Tolu Smith) or a small-ball lineup with no true center. Either case should prove a favorable matchup for Robinson.\n\nBetter still is homecourt advantage, where Robinson’s rebounding average is much higher (9.7 home vs. 8.5 away).\n\nAnd in 22 home games this season, **he is over this line in 20/22**. In both of the two misses, Robinson was in the starting lineup, which brings down his rebounding numbers. In today’s game, he will be in his natural role coming off the bench, backing up KAT instead of playing alongside him. When coming off the bench in home games this season, **he is over this line in 14/14.**\n\nThe odds aren’t all that juicy but the line is well-supported this season in this spot.",

I watched both women's semi-finals and boy oh boy was that painful to watch. Plenty of broken passes, low danger shots and messy plays that resulted in no real offensive chances. Felt like I was watching AAA junior hockey. Switzerland had **8 shots** against Canada(I know Canada is on another level). They literally could not generate any offense except on their lone goal. They scored by the way only 1 goal in every game since the start of the quarterfinals so their offense is not good at all. What they do have however is great goaltending in Andrea Braendli. She kept Canada to 2 goals only with 44 saves. She did the same against Finland the game before with a shut-out with 40 saves. So I expect her to be solid in a game for a medal. Meanwhile for Sweden, they put up a good fight vs USA with 23 shots but team USA is simply the best women's team in the world right now. What I'm looking at though is the Swedish goaltender. Before the USA game, Sweden had only allowed 2 goals **in the whole tournament**. Their young goaltender is playing solid and honestly even during the USA game she did the best she could with some big saves but team USA is just too good right now. With the game being this important I expect a low score again tomorrow and their goalies to be solid for the chance to win a medal. Last 3 games for Switzerland went under the 4.5 goals line. For Sweden, before the USA game, their last 3 games were also under the 4.5 goals line. In other words, BASED ON THOSE PAST GAMES AND NOT MY HOCKEY EXPERT ANALYSIS, I feel like with the bronze medal on the line they both will be playing great defensive games like they both did for the whole tournament which worked really well for them until they met the powerhouse that are Canada and USA. \n\nBOL \n\nMY POTD RECORD WAS 23-21 BEFORE THE OLYMPICS DON'T LIKE MY PICK DON'T TAIL I  DO THIS FOR FUN AND I'M NOT AN AI TRYING TO MAKE YOU LOSE MONEY.

Huge thanks to everyone tailing the heat.\n\nPARIVISION has been a revelation this tournament. With Puppey’s veteran coaching and their new offlaner, they are sitting pretty at 7-1 at the group stage. Meanwhile, Yandex has been a disaster, struggling at 1-7. They just dropped a map to a Tier 2 Chinese stack and practically have one foot out the door. Mathematically, Yandex needs to win 4 maps in a row just for a *chance* at tiebreakers. The motivation gap here is a canyon. PARI is playing for top seed, while Yandex looks like they’re already checking out of their hotel and some possible EPT points xd. This is as close to a \"lock\" as you get in Tier 1 Dota.\n\nThe gap between Tundra and Execration is just too wide. Tundra is a legitimate contender for the Grand Finals and has looked clinical in their macro play. Execration, on the other hand, has been the group’s punching bag, losing every single map except for their series against the bottom-tier NA squad. I believe both these matches have over an 80% chance to hit. BOL\n\nUpdate; Many people asking why taking such low odfs of double chance and not take Pari ML. This is a Bo2 dota 2 game and in bo 2 games “draw”’ is a very likely outcome. Pari ML is 2.25 makes the parlay too risky for a 5 unit bet. Pari DC is simply a “ lock in” bet.",

Its a slight risk in a weir market, but i expect Koln to start strong in their home stadium, but the quality of players in Bayern are just too good & they probably will open the floodgates in the 2nd half (similar to the wolfsburg game)\n\nHope we get the W & BoL",

UNLEESHING $1.70                 \n**Write Up:** And we back today with UNLEESHING having its third run for the prep and ticks every box here. Bit injury plagued this horse has been, and has never got far enough into a preparation to get out over its ideal distance, which it sees today. Both runs this prep have been grouse without winning, first up was a deadset sit and sprint which did us no favours, however still was beaten under a length; and then last start was a bit of horror watch, but again we flashed home to be narrowly beaten.    \n    \nNow today we go up in distance another 150m, down in grade from a Saturday class race to a Wednesday, stay in fillies and mares grade, and to top it all off we draw barrier  2 with the worlds greatest jockey aboard.    \n    \nStable is extremely confident, and the reason for the drop in grade is purely to knock off a confidence boosting win before taking on better targets in the future.    \n    \nMy only knock/worry is the potential position in run. From barrier 2 I’d like to be 2nd pair, however the trainer has said he doesn’t care where the horse is (even 3 pairs back the inside) that it should be winning. Now if we do get a fair way back there is always the possibility of bad luck, so I’m hoping the goat jmac shows some positivity out of the gates.    \n    \nAll that being said, UNLEESHING is different gravy to the other horses here, and provided the breaks come (faith in the best jockey), I think we should be way too good. GL    \n    \nAlso I have like 3-4 other picks that could’ve been today’s POTD so message is you want more :)",

Bayern aren’t immune to narrow results and complacency could set in after an 8-1 hammering of Wolfsburg. If you want to take the BTTS Yes, I certainly don’t mind that either.

He's done very well though and it's all behind a very strong first service game. Being able to generate 5 BP opportunities off the Blockx service game shows the kinda form he's in.\n* Kjaer is a young up and comer making his first attempt at the AO. He's covers the court very well and is a strong ball rallier, evident with him regularly taking more than 50% of his opponents 2nd service games. He's had much less prep than McCabe for this one and given more games leading in, I think he'd easily win it. His recent victory over Watanuki tells me he's almost there and is still a very good chance of winning this and deserves to be the favourite.\n* At their best, McCabe is nowhere close to Kjaer in terms of talent but I think his service game is so strong right now and the fact that he's had more time on court to start the year and is playing in his home country gives him enough to come close in this match.\n\nI can't decide who's going to win this match, which is a good indicator for me it could go the distance.\n\nBOL",

However, away from home, they only have 1 win in their past 5 league games (1 draw, 3 losses).

Coach Ole Werner has publicly framed the match as a chance to “restart the season with rhythm” and stressed that Leipzig are “well-prepared” despite the unusual break caused by the snow cancellation — his words underline a desire for a dynamic, high-tempo game rather than cautious play. Werner also hinted that attackers like Timo Werner might feature, as he remains “in discussions” with the club and could return to the squad, giving Leipzig additional firepower up front.\n\n\\- Defensively, Leipzig’s setup remains stretched: injuries to Kampl, Klostermann, Nusa, and Bakayoko force structural adjustments and weaken their ability to cope with transitions once their press is bypassed — an issue critics in Germany have repeatedly flagged as leading to goals conceded. Freiburg coach Julian Schuster, meanwhile, has emphasised his side’s confidence and offensive rhythm, praising his squad’s ability to respond and contribute goals, especially through substitutes — which underscores his intent to keep attacking rather than sitting back.\n\n\\- Schuster’s remarks and recent team news also highlight that Freiburg will not shy away from an open contest; while they struggle historically away at Leipzig, Schuster has publicly spoken about focusing on Leipzig’s strengths and exploiting spaces between the lines — language typical of coaches who plan to counter-attack and invite pressure as a pathway to goals.\n\n\\- Finally, German previews note that Leipzig’s home offensive numbers are among the league’s strongest, while Freiburg’s defensive record away is far from secure, adding a statistical backbone to the tactical picture that supports multiple goals.\n\n\\- All told, with both teams motivated to push forward, Leipzig’s injury-forced defensive shifts, Freiburg’s attacking confidence, and coaches indicating a proactive rather than cautious mindset, the conditions are aligned for a match exceeding 2.5 goals.",

In their last five games they’re averaging 4.4 goals scored while conceding just 0.8. On top of that, they just sent a message this weekend by thrashing Wolfsburg 8-1 at home. When Bayern get rolling, games can get ugly fast.\n\nKöln really struggle against top teams, especially defensively. They give up a lot of chances and don’t cope well with sustained pressure, which is exactly what Bayern bring for 90 minutes.\n\nWe’ve also seen this matchup recently. On 29 October 2025, Bayern went to Köln in the DFB Pokal and won 1-4, again showing how big the quality gap is.\n\nQuick explanation of the line: Asian Handicap -2 means Bayern need to win by three goals or more for the bet to win. If Bayern win by exactly two goals, it’s a push and the stake comes back. Anything less and the bet loses.\n\nYou could wait for the line-ups in case Bayern rotate a bit, which is always possible with their schedule. That said, even if they do rotate, they still have ridiculous depth with players like Lennart Karl and Nicolas Jackson potentially coming off the bench. Just keep in mind that if you wait for line-ups, the odds will likely drop.\n\nAt +100, I’m happy to take this now. A 3-0, 4-1 or even bigger scoreline wouldn’t surprise me at all.\n\nBayern Munich -2 Asian Handicap\n2 units\n\nLet’s keep it rolling.",

Achilles has his heel. Illinois has… playing on the road at Northwestern?\n\nYes, the Illini (13-3) have posted an impressive 145-45 all-time record against their Big Ten foe. Sure, under head coach Brad Underwood, the team is 11-5 in the series. However, Illinois is just 3-4 over its last seven trips to Evanston, including dropping each of the last three. That includes a frustrating overtime defeat last season in which the team coughed up a double-digit lead late in the second half.\n\nFortunately, this year’s Wildcats (8-8) have made a living snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. \n\nIn six of its eight losses this season, Northwestern has held leads of seven or more points with under 13 minutes to go. The proof isn’t that hard to find, as the team saw second-half leads disappear in each of its past three games against Minnesota (67-60 w/ 4:39 remaining), Michigan State (45-38 w/ 12:36 remaining) and Rutgers (65-59 w/ 2:33 remaining)—the Wildcats lost all three contests. With a March Madness bid all but gone, and staring down an 0-6 start to conference play, the team appears ready to be put out of its misery.\n\nLook for a revenge-minded, lethal Illini offense to deliver the kill shot. \n\nThrough 16 games, the unit ranks 2nd in offensive efficiency (1.234), 30th in scoring (86.0 PPG), 55th in field-goal percentage (47.7%) and 122nd in three-point shooting (34.8%). It’s become a game of “Pick Your Poison” for opposing defenses, as Illinois boasts four players averaging 12.4 points per game or better. That has disaster written all over it for a suddenly-reeling Northwestern defense that ranks 63rd in opponent field-goal percentage (41.6%), 94th in scoring defense (71.2 PPGA) and 113th in defensive efficiency (1.014). Not surprisingly, those numbers have ballooned to 79.0 points per game conceded on 47.6% shooting over the team’s three-game slide. \n\nConversely, the Wildcats have the nation’s leading scorer in Nick Martinelli (24.1 PPG) and not much else. \n\nOn the season, the team ranks 54th in field-goal percentage (47.7%), 67th in offensive efficiency (1.127), 100th in scoring (79.1 PPG) and 294th in three-point shooting (30.8%). Over the last three games, those numbers have dropped to 73.0 points per game on just 42.7% shooting (26.9% from beyond the arc). Things won’t get any easier against an Illini defense that ranks 20th in opponent field-goal percentage (39.5%), 34th in scoring defense (67.4 PPGA), 44th in defensive efficiency (0.968) and 66th in opponent three-point shooting (30.9%). The unit has been more suffocating as of late, only conceding just 58.4 points per game on a meager 35.2% shooting (24.3% from deep) over its last five games. \n\nLook for Illinois to impose its size advantage on Wednesday night.\n\nPer KenPom, the team ranks 1st in average height and 4th in effective height. That advantage has been evident on the glass, where the Illini rank 9th in total rebounding (42.3 per game), 13th in defensive rebounding (27.2) and 20th in offensive rebounding (11.9) while ranking 8th in opponent defensive rebounding (18.5), 28th in opponent total rebounding (31.3) and 208th in opponent offensive rebounding (9.3). Furthermore, the team also ranks 16th in blocks (5.4) and 18th in second-chance points (15.3). That all adds up to what could be a long night for a Northwestern team that ranks 233rd in opponent second-chance points (11.8), 247th in total rebounding (33.6) and 288th in opponent offensive rebounding (10.2). \n\nBut the X factor in this one might just be Illinois’ ability to get to the charity stripe. \n\nThus far, the team ranks 28th in drawing fouls (20.6 per game). But not only that, the Illini makes good on those opportunities, ranking 4th in free-throw percentage (79.8%). That includes shooting 27-32 (84.3%) from the line over its last two games. Conversely, the Wildcats rank 229th in fouls committed (18.5). \n\nLook for Illinois to finally conquer its own personal House of Horrors and cruise by double-digits. \n\nBOL if tailing, and as always, please do so responsibly. One bet should not lead you to crash out all over Reddit.",

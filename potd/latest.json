This season, **Hunter has gone over this line 12 out of 23 games.** The **first 16 games of the season, he went over this line 11/16 times**. He then went on a 5 game slump where he went under this line. \n\n**All this slump has really been is him not being able to find nylon.** He is averaging slightly lower field goal attempts compared to the beginning of the season, but just shooting a lot worse. **Chicago ranks 25th in defensive efficiency, and allows the 27th most points + rebounds to opponents (forwards specifically).** \n\nAll it is going to take is for Hunter to start seeing a couple shots go down and he will start averaging a consistent 15-17ppg. A slow Chicago defense and a slight rebounding advantage overall, I believe Hunter can find his groove and be the consistent role player Cleveland would really love to use. \n\nBOL.",

I am indeed ironically the worst accountant currently (or Vegas agent, fade of the day… choose your pick) and my God is it painful. I appreciate you guys for sticking with me and showing support during this run, losing my money is one thing but losing yours is even tougher to accept. So anyways the pick lost by 0.5 (68-95) after Jiangsu sank a 3 at the buzzer to finish with a 27 point lead. Sweet.\n\nOk we’ve officially hit rock bottom going for a play like this. However, the stats are mental and I couldn’t let an opportunity like this slip by. Taking our talents over to peak sports betting obscurity, Vakifbank are top of the division and are coming in as extremely heavy favourites against the home team Aras Kargo who are 7th (out of 14). The travelling side have seen this line clear in their last 17/18 matches on the road (94%) which makes up 12/13 (92%) in the league. Meanwhile the hosts have covered the over in their last 9/10 (90%) home games, 8/9 (89%) in the league . Those numbers are very convincing but I will flag that this game last year produced 129 points (I stg if this happens again). Other than that, their only previous fixture gave us 167 points. Despite all the stats involved I would still probably fade at the moment since, logically, the under is going to narrowly win.

These matches however, being a single elimination usually keep a tight scoreline and a single goal difference is all that is necessary to advance.  Therefore, City may show some rotation in their squad. \n\nJeremy Doku will be out, as will John Stones, Rodri, Kovacic, Marmoush and Ait-Nouri.  Nonetheless, the depth of talent to choose from is quite remarkable and they should have no shortage of players to introduce.  Meanwhile Brentford only have a couple of shortages as Outtara nad Onyeka will be absent to play at the African Cup of Nations.\n\nWhile Brentford will present mostly their strongest starting 11, that same team could not beat Leeds this past weekend.  Also in the last two weeks, they also lost to Tottenham and Arsenal in multiple goal shutouts.   On the flip side, within the last week Man City beat Real Madrid in Spain and then travelled to Selhurst Park and beat Crystal Palace by 3-0.\n\nI will side with Man City to advance in 90 minutes here.  Should they win by only 1 goal, it’s a push.",

Both teams are trending under in back to back games, & in the last FOUR games between these teams, the total has been under 4.5, let alone 5.5.\n\nVegas alone have been under 5.5 in 4 of their last 5 games, and whether it’s Schmid or Hart, they seem to be confident to play defensive hockey and take their chance the Vegas way.\n\nFun fact: both teams are 16-16 vs the total this season.\n\nLast play review: ELC: Cardiff - Chelsea\nBTTS/o2.5 (-105) 1u ✅\n\n(Chelsea crucially made a pair of halftime subs to open up the game a bit and get us a second win in a row.

As always, please wait for lineups if you don't like this play if he does not start - as anything can happen with these cup games as we saw yesterday.\n\nCity is a deeper squad with more talent on the bench than Brentford and are playing at home, so I like the juice the ML adds to the ATGS.

PSG operate at a much higher competition level week-to-week, averaging roughly 2+ goals per match against elite European opposition, while Flamengo step up significantly in defensive difficulty here, meaning sustained pressure is almost guaranteed across 90 minutes. From a game-flow standpoint, if we model PSG’s scoring probability at ~70% in the first half (early intensity, quality gap, aggressive pressing) and ~75–80% in the second half (fatigue, tactical adjustments, space opening up), the combined probability of scoring in both halves still sits around 55–60%. Over 90 minutes, sustained possession, superior chance quality, and situational urgency make PSG goals in both halves a logical outcome and for 2.4, a very good price.",

We’re two roommates posting these POTD’s and both been tailing loads here. Surely two brains work better than one?\nNewcastle vs Fulham quietly sets up as one of the cleanest Both Teams To Score spots on the day. Newcastle host Fulham with both sides in strong attacking rhythm and neither showing much interest in clean sheets lately.\n\nBTTS has hit in 4 of Newcastle’s last 5 matches and 4 of Fulham’s last 5, with the only miss for both teams coming against Sunderland — a side notorious for slowing games down and sitting deep. Remove that anomaly, and the trend is clear: these teams trade chances.\n\nThe head-to-head backs it up, too. BTTS has landed in the last 3 H2H meetings, including the reverse fixture at St. James’ Park on October 25, where both teams produced over 1.5 xG each, proving this matchup consistently creates high-quality chances on both ends.\n\nNewcastle have been automatic at home. They’ve scored in every single home fixture this season, totaling 26 goals across 13 home matches — exactly 2.0 goals per game. Fulham aren’t shy on the road either, finding the net 10 times in 9 away matches, and they’ve turned it up recently.\n\nFulham come in hot offensively, scoring 10 goals in their last 4 matches, including 5 goals in their last 2 away games. Newcastle, meanwhile, were riding a 17-match scoring streak before their narrow 1-0 loss to Sunderland, another outlier given the matchup and game state.\n\nAll signs point to goals — but the defensive side seals the bet.\n\nNewcastle haven’t kept a clean sheet in 8 straight matches, with their last shutout coming against Bilbao in the Champions League — a Bilbao side that has only scored in 7 of 11 away matches across UCL and LaLiga this season. Fulham are no better defensively, failing to keep a clean sheet in 4 straight matches while conceding 10 goals in that span.\n\nBoth teams are comfortable committing numbers forward, both are vulnerable defensively, and both have clear, repeatable scoring trends. This isn’t a game where one side sits back — it’s one where chances come naturally.\n\nThe price hasn’t caught up.",

      "text": "Darts 🎯- 2026 PDC World Championship \n\n🌶️ Overall: 53-33-1\n\n2026 PDC 🎯 World Championships: 2-1\n\nPrevious: \n\nMadars Razma (-161) v Jamai van den Herik ✅ \n\nMervyn King (+120) v Ian White ❌\n\nRicardo Pietreczko (-136) v Jose de Sousa ✅ \n\nPOTD: Matt Campbell (-149) v Adam Sevada\n\nGood stuff from our boy Pikachu yesterday, grinding out a 3-1 win against a very capable opponent. Ricardo going 11/25 (40%) on doubles really illustrates how valuable a high checkout % is in this format. \n\nOnly four matches on the board today, and each one fairly lopsided in terms of odds. Despite this, I will gladly back the North American #1 Matt “the Ginga Ninja” to defeat Adam “The Reaper” Sevada. \n\nFairly difficult to compare these two players, as Campbell has been cutting his teeth on the PDC Tour all year, while Sevada has mostly competed on the MODUS Super Series & CDC, with a few exceptions. In the end, i think one very large reason points me towards Campbell. \n\nIf you look at the #s for each player over the last 12 months, the averages, checkour %s, TV averages, etc. are all fairly close — 91.1 Campbell vs 89.6 Sevada; 40% Cambell vs 41.1% Sevada (per DartsOrakel)\n\nThe main difference bw the two has been their competition. Sevada is a world championship debutante, earning his spot in this year’s tournament by cementing his spot as the CDC’s highest ranking player. He beat up on lesser players for most of the year, and when a big moment came up at the US Darts Open, Sevada averaged 74.6 en route to a 2-6 loss vs Gerwyn Price. \n\nCampbell, on the other hand, has competed at the highest level darts has to offer since 2022. He reached the final 32 in the 2024 world championship, and reached the QF at this year’s European Darts Open. Campbell also reached the QF at the PDC Players Championship 33 & 34, which took place just two months ago. \n\nBig stage & big tournament experience largely favors Campbell, and his recent success a few short months ago gives me confidence locking him in this one. Honestly consider the (-149) price tag a bit of bargain, could see this one moving higher as the match draws closer. \n\nLastly - have had a few folks ask, so including details below for tipping. Absolutely no need, but always greatly appreciated 🌶️ \n\nVenmo- @Jake-Lazzo\n\nCashapp- $NedPepprr",

Also my apologies, somehow I kept saying Cardiff and Lincoln were Championship teams even though they're in League 1. Anyways.\n\n**Event**: EFL Cup: Manchester City vs. Brentford 11:30am PST\n\n**POTD**: Manchester City Moneyline + Manchester City Goals Range 2-4 (-115) 2u\n\n**Write up**:\n\nDon't really feel like I need to touch on the moneyline aspect of this pick as it is pretty much a given that City win this game. They LOVE the EFL cup and have performed amazing in it for the last 10 years, winning it 5 times. I wanted to bet the straight goal range but its sitting at -150 which isn't amazing value for me personally.\n\nCity have scored 2-4 goals in 18/25 games played this season across all competitions, going 9/11 on this pick in their home games. They're also 2/2 on this pick in both EFL cup games played this season. City average close to 2.5 goals per match across all comps this season and have caught a lot of form recently. In their last 5 games, City are undefeated and have scored 2-4 goals in 4/5 (with the only game this not hitting being their 5 goals against Fulham). Although there will probably be some squad rotation, squad rotation for City means having first team quality players getting minutes they don't usually get. City have also scored 2-4 goals in 3/5 of their last games against Brentford.\n\nOn the other side here we have a struggling Brentford team, being 1-1-3 in their last 5 games and 1-0-4 in their last 5 away games (with the only win being the last round of the EFL cup against a League 2 side). In these last 5 away games, Brentford have conceded 2 goals in 4/5 with the only exception being that cup game where they held Grimsby to 0. Brentford allow on average 1.37 goals per match to their opposition across all comps and 1.6 goals allowed in all away games. Brentford have conceded 3 goals a few times this season but never more, and with the probable rotation for City ahead of some important Premier League games, I don't see the Blues scoring over 4.\n\nCity beat Brentford earlier this year 0-1 at Gtech Community Stadium, at a time that Cherki wasn't fully proven yet and Savio + Bobb were still starting almost every week. With the loss of Doku due to injury, this could be a match for Savio to finally prove his worth to City fans and get a contribution or two. Not to mention Marmoush (I believe) will not be apart of the squad because of AFCON which means big Erling should still start up top. Even if Omar is available and starts, I almost believe that to be a better outcome because he is dying for a contribution to show Guardiola he deserves more minutes this season. If I were to make a score prediction to this game it would probably be 3-0 or 3-1 to City. The only team that Brentford have beat of real quality are Newcastle which was a home game that was 1-1 until Newcastle picked up a red and conceded 2 goals. I wouldn't count the Villa game as this is when Villa were quite bad.\n\n**BOL!**",

In the league, Newcastle are 12th on 22 points while Fulham are just behind on 20 (so overall quality is similar), but the home/away split is where it separates: Newcastle are 5-1-2 at home (16 points from 8) while Fulham are only 2-1-5 away (7 points), which is a big swing in reliability.   The performance data lines up with that too: Newcastle’s home xG is 14.90 vs 9.47 xGA across those 8 home league matches, meaning they typically create more and concede fewer “good chances” at home (the kind of profile that wins cup ties over 90 minutes).   \n\nThey’ve also already shown they can handle Fulham in this exact matchup recently, beating them 2–1 at home earlier in the season, which matters because it hints that Newcastle’s style (high tempo, pressure, and creating enough shots/chances in front of their crowd) can tilt the game.  The main worry is Newcastle’s defensive availability: Dan Burn reportedly suffered a fractured rib and lung damage in the Sunderland match and is likely out—so Howe may have to reshuffle, but this being a League Cup quarter-final at home still gives Newcastle a clear path: press early, win territory, and generate the higher-quality looks while Fulham’s away form has been shaky (they only just recorded a rare away win at Burnley).",

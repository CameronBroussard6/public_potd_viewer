Leeds have been in decent scoring form lately, but ultimately only have one win in their last six PL games and are coming up against an Arsenal team that have Calafiori and Havertz back, both important players to their attack. Arsenal are coming off of a few poor PL results and need a good win today. Don’t have much more to say, 1st place away to 16th place.",

Wolves are absolute dogshit right now, I mean 17 losses?? They look like they've already packed their bags for the Championship and honestly, I don't blame them lol. Bournemouth on the other hand are actually cooking under the radar. Even with the injuries, that win against Liverpool was mental and they always seem to have Wolves number at Molineux for some reason. $2.35 is fucking insane value for a team with this much momentum against a literal basement dweller. I'm putting a few units on it and probably gonna regret not putting more when Evanilson inevitably bags a brace. easy money if you ask me. As usual, probably don’t tail me as I’ve got a losing streak not much different to the wolves BoL",

I'm going with the same argument that I used for Werenski yesterday. Nathan MacKinnon is going to the Olympics next week and doesn't want to get injured before the event starts so he plays more passively than he would usually do. It also helps that Colorado is first in the league with a comfortable lead.\n\nColorado doesn't play Detroit often but the last 2 games between them, MacKinnon only had 1 and 2 shots. Detroit will be playing their last game at home before the Olympics break and will look to finish strong as they lost 2 in a row especially with the Atlantic division this season being pretty tight. In their last 10 home games, they allowed on average only 25 shots.\n\nHoping for a 6th game in a row where MacKinnon goes under!\n\nBOL!",

Zach Edey (Ankle), Brandon Clarke (Calf), and Santi Aldama (Knee) are all OUT. They are forced to play small-ball with Jaren Jackson Jr. at the 5, who historically prefers to float on the perimeter rather than bang in the paint for boards. The Matchup Math: • Season Average: Rudy is averaging 11.2 RPG this season. • The Ceiling: In his only game against Memphis this season (Dec 17), Rudy feasted for 16 rebounds. • Memphis Vulnerability: The Grizzlies allow 45.2 opponent rebounds per game. Without their 7'4\" rookie Zach Edey to box out, Rudy will have a massive reach advantage on every single miss.\n\nScenario Analysis: The \"Gobert Vacuum\" • Scenario A: The \"Brick City\" Shootout Memphis is currently starting \"G-League\" level guards due to injuries to Ja Morant and Scotty Pippen Jr. They are projected to struggle with efficiency against the #1 Timberwolves defense. More misses from Memphis = more defensive rebound opportunities for Rudy. If Memphis shoots under 42%, Rudy hits this line by the 3rd quarter.\n\n• Scenario B: The Foul Trouble Trap The only real threat to this \"Over\" is if Rudy gets two quick fouls in the 1st quarter. However, Memphis doesn't have a traditional \"bruiser\" center right now to bait him into foul trouble. JJJ plays mostly \"face-up,\" which keeps Rudy's hands away from the whistle.\n\n• Scenario C: The Blowout (The White Flag 🏳️) If Minnesota goes up by 25 points, Rudy might sit the entire 4th quarter. However, even in a recent 20-point blowout win over OKC, Rudy still managed to stay on the floor for 34 minutes and grab 11 boards. Against a smaller Memphis team, he can easily hit 14 boards in just 28 minutes.\n\nReferee Influence 🏁 Keep an eye on the officiating crew. If we get a \"let 'em play\" crew like James Williams or Mitchell Ervin (who both rank high in PPG allowed), the game will have a faster flow with fewer stoppages. A faster pace means more shot attempts, which directly translates to a higher rebound ceiling for Rudy.",

      "text": "Record 1-0 POTD\nLast pick UFC 324 Song Yadong +3.5 -140 3u ✅\n  \nUfc 325 pick: Billy Elekana -3.5 + Salkilld KO = +190 3u\n\nExplanation:\nLeg 1: Quillan Salkilld vs. Jamie Mullarkey\nTo put it bluntly, Jamie Mullarkey has hit a hard ceiling in the UFC. He doesn't possess a single elite attribute, and his most famous moment remains getting folded by Alexander Volkanovski on the regional circuit nearly a decade ago. I’m a huge believer in Salkilld; he’s a highly technical, heavy-handed prospect who is catching Mullarkey at the perfect time. While Mullarkey might try to survive the initial onslaught by stalling and clinching, I don't see him lasting the full 15 minutes. Expect Salkilld to find his rhythm and land a clean straight right down the pipe to floor Mullarkey, likely in the second round.\nLeg 2: Billy Elekana vs. Junior Tafa\nThe other side of this parlay is a pure \"fade\" of Junior Tafa. Tafa simply isn't a UFC-level mixed martial artist. We saw Valter Walker, Mohammed Usman and Tuko Tukkos make him look like a beginner by taking him down and controlling him with ease. Junior’s only path to victory is a \"puncher’s chance,\" but as Billy Elekana proved in that ugly fight against Ibo Aslan, he is a master of the \"shit show.\" Billy is excellent at neutralizing power, forcing a grind, and avoiding high-risk exchanges at all costs. Against a grappler with Billy's discipline, Junior Tafa is essentially a fish out of water. It is almost impossible to envision a scenario where Billy doesn't grind out a dominant, albeit perhaps ugly, victory here.",

The hosts have a solid attacking line: Gomez is clinical in front of goal, Sané is consistently finding the net, while Karlsruhe is far from perfect defensively and is clearly outclassed here.\n\n\nI expect a fired-up Eintracht, backed by their home crowd, to bag at least two goals today. Their commitment will be at the maximum, especially since it's crucial not to drop points at the start of the season.",

Volkanovski is fighting Diego Lopes in a rematch to try and keep his title as featherweight champion. In their last bout, we saw Volkanovski win a decision pretty handily, winning the fight 4 rounds to 1. Volkanovski is getting pretty old and his chin might not be 100% anymore but he showed in his last defence against Diego that he is still a cardio machine and has great technique. I think he will be as safe as possible and try to land takedowns if possible and be able to manage the distance and stay out of Diego’s power like he does to all of his opponents. Diego Lopes is good but he doesn’t have great cardio and that showed in his previous fight with Volkanovski, once it gets to the later rounds, he will be breathing heavy and that’s where Volkanovski will dominate. I expect Volkanovski to take 1 or 2 of the first 3 rounds by landing more volume punches, while Diego is going for a knockout. After those first 3 rounds, Volkanovski should take over and be able to take Diego Lopes down, or just keep on landing many strikes to win the 4th and 5th rounds. I’m not worried about Volkanovski finishing Diego lopes, because Diego is good defensively on the ground and can avoid getting submitted, but Volkanovski should be able to hold him down and win the rounds that way. As for the striking, Volkanovski doesn’t have much power and Diego Lopes has a great chin, so even if Volkanovski lands a big amount of punches, Diego Lopes should be able to take them without getting knocked out. I expect Volkanovski to most likely win 4 rounds to 1, unless Diego does somehow take 2 whole rounds which I don’t expect due to his cardio, Volkanovski could still win 3 rounds to 2.\n\nTake Alexander Volkanovski By Decision!",

      "text": "POTD record 87-5-67 (W-P-L)\n\nLast pick: Parivision ML vs Falcons, 1u @ +165 **✅**\n\n**UFC: Alexander Volkanovski ML 3u @ -130**\n\nVolk won the first fight against Diego Lopes 9 months ago in Miami, Floria (that was also one of my POTDs). Tomorrow he finds himself on Australian soil defending his belt against a very game opponent. Over the Xmas period I was actually leaning towards Diego Lopes but in researching this fight I re-watched the first bout at length and some notable features stood out to me:\n\n\\- Volk out-struck Diego on the feet at an almost 3-to-1 ratio, he was largely winning all of stand-up exchanges bar two very impactful moment for Lopes. The judges scored the fight 48-47, 49-46, 49-46 however the crowd were partisan for Diego that night and I believe they may have influenced the judging slightly. Scoring it myself I actually give all of the rounds to Volk, that's right, the fight was 50-45 for me personally (that's just my opinion on re-watching)\n\n\\- The aforementioned moments for Lopes were a knockdown in round 2, which whilst troubling, didn't seem to slow Volk down he popped right back up and got back to fighting and the second incident really needs some exposition - Volk did get clipped with a good right upper cut from Lopes but right before that shot landed Lopes threw a jab that cut Volk's eyelid - the two things combined made Volk seem more hurt than he probably was because during this flurry by Lopes he actually didn't land many shot and Volk was actually out-landing him despite backpedalling - in this round and in all round Volk landed more shots on Diego and in my opinion did more total damage\n\n\\- In a nutshell I am of the opinion that Diego Lopes needs to finish Alexander Volkanovski here to win this fight and I'd cap that possibility conservatively  at 40% or lower which means Volk should be winning this match up at a 60% clip or greater. In essence anything above -150 is offering some value according to my capping. My fair estimate for Volk winning here is 65% likelihood (60 being low and 70 being high) which would put him closer to -200 favorite.\n\n**Side note:** I believe an early finish for Volk is unlikely so there are options to play the late win props such as Volk to win by decision or Volk to win and Round 4 to start. These would both be plus money.\n\n**Summary:** Diego Lopes is a dangerous fighter and I fully acknowledge he has the finishing upside here however based on the evidence we have (the first fight) Volk is a level above Diego in striking, ring craft and winning the minutes. Also I want to give some credit to Volk's fight IQ and game planning, I have seen people saying there is no way for him to improve on the first fight and I think that is untrue. I believe Volk can have more success than in the first fight by mixing in takedowns earlier and getting some top control on Diego to nullify any threat on the feet and land some ground and pound.",

Starting off with Leeds, they may not have a great record but boy do they score some goals. Leeds have scored in 9 of their last 10 games and have only gone scoreless at home once this season (which was GW3 against a strong Newcastle team). At home this season in the Prem Leeds average 1.72 goals scored per match and 1.18 goals conceded. Across the entire competition this season Leeds average 1.35 goals per match and concede 1.65. Although in their previous matchup this season Arsenal won 5-0, this was before Leeds found consistent goal scoring form and it was at the Emirates. \n\nFeel like I don't really need to touch on Arsenal. They're the best team in the league (although it pains me to say) and they score practically every game. Although they are the best defensive side in the league, they conceded 2 at home to an awful UCL team last match, conceded 3 to United at home, and overall have conceded in 5 of their last 6 games.\n\nI dont see Leeds winning this game or scoring more than 1 goal, but I'll be shocked if they don't bag at home considering their recent form along with Arsenal's poor form as of late. \n\n**BOL!**",

The bet looked very safe, but then Flick did his team talk magic and Barca ended up scoring 4 in the second half. It seemed like there was some life in Copenhagen as they did score a late goal, but in prime sigmabale fashion, it was disallowed by VAR. We move though and I'm sure we're going to have a great weekend ahead*\n\n**Last Five:** ❌✅❌❌❌\n\n**Event:** LaLiga, Elche v FC Barcelona, 3:00 pm EST\n\n**POTD:** Elche +1.5 Asian Handicap, +103, 3 units\n\n**Write Up:** Elche have been the surprise package of this LaLiga season, sitting in 12th place after coming up from the second division just a season ago. They do play above all expectations, but their team genuinely looks very solid with the likes of Inaki Pena, Chust, Rafa Mir and many others. *Their form might've taken a bit of a nosedive at the beginning of the year,* but they're still capable of frustrating the visitors. Emphasis on visitors, because here's a fun stat for you: **Elche have a record of five wins, five draws and just one loss in 11 home matches.** Yes, they're extremely resilient at home and are no doubt going to make life tough for the Catalans. They're also going to treat this as a bounce back and a revenge game because as I said, their recent form has been patchy, and Barcelona did win the last time they met.\n\nBarcelona, with their usual defensive instabilities, which were on full display once again against Copenhagen, are going to struggle for sure. **They're also going to be tired after the midweek Champions League match,** in which they had to give it their all to secure the top 8 spot in what proved to be a surprisingly demanding game against Copenhagen.\n\nThe stats point in Elche's favor and even if they lose by a goal, the bet still wins because of the +1.5 handicap. All in all, Barcelona are definitely vulnerable, so I'm dropping 3 units on this.

I mean they have back to back wins now in the league, having beaten Tottenham and Sunderland in the last two rounds. At least the atmosphere around the club has livened up a bit and it’s no longer all doom and gloom. \n\nChelsea has started well under Liam Rosenior, but I do still have some caveats about the results/performances until now. Sure, winning 3-2 in Italy over Napoli is nice… But Conte has a horrible record with his teams in the Champions League, just god awful, which can easily be proven by the fact that Napoli couldn’t even make the top 24. A 3-1 away over any team in the Premier League is great, but Palace is in a terrible place at the moment. 1-0 over Pafos was a bit disappointing. They beat Brentford 2-0, but the guests were just as good if not better. Then they were a bit lucky not to concede more in their 3-2 defeat at home in the first leg of the League Cup against Arsenal.\n\nRegardless if you agree or disagree with my assessment of Chelsea’s performances in these games, we can all agree that the situation with their defense isn’t great and Robert Sanchez in goal isn’t exactly mister reliable. \n\nThe sale of Lucas Paqueta doesn’t change much for this game, as he hasn’t really been good for West Ham for a while now. Castellanos has only scored against QPR in the league so far, but he is at least getting shots off which is what we want for this bet. Also, Summerville has really popped off for the Hammers recently with a goal in his last three games and just generally great play.",

While the Jayhawks (15-5) already rank among the nation’s best defensively all-around, their numbers get even better at home, where the team concedes just 61.1 points per game on a porous 35.4% shooting. In fact, Kansas has beaten five of its last six opponents at home by 18 or more points, including a 84-63 thrashing of then-No. 2 Iowa State on Jan. 13. \n\nOn the other end of the floor, this is a BYU defense that seems to be unravelling.\n\nWhile the unit enters ranked 23rd in defensive efficiency (0.955), things have slipped in recent weeks.

I think lot of people are still underestimating Auroras new lineup and the way they play and they think Spirit is able to “ Stomp” them in a short duration game. Nightfall their carry has been playing outstanding this tournament and they have been beaten the two favourites to reach upper bracket final. Spirit on the other hand are still the favourites to win this tournament with Yatoro finding his form again on Sven and Windranger. \n\n• Head-to-Head History: In their last three Bo3 encounters, over 70% of Map 1s have gone over the 38-minute threshold. Both teams currently favor high-durability cores (like Abaddon for Nightfall) that naturally extend team fights and objective sieges.\n\n• Tournament Stakes: As this is the Upper Bracket Final, both teams are expected to play conservatively in Map 1. Neither side wants to concede an early series lead to a \"cheese\" strategy, leading to a more methodical, late-game oriented draft. I choose spirit because I still do think they are the better team, more experienced and there is good value.\n\nPrediction:\n\nI think it will hit over 35.5 map duration regardless of which team wins, however I am edging more towards Spirit taking the map but Aurora won’t back down easily, longer slower game but Spirit will eventually come out at the end.\n\nFor safer bet—> Over 36.5min 1.75 odds",

DARYTE - WIN - $1.70 (Betting 3.5 units)                           \n**Write Up:** Picking back up a little with 3 wins on the trot now, and for today’s pick we’re heading west to Ascot for DARYTE. Now this horse trialled well into its debut last  start however the performance it put up there far exceeded what I expected. Sat leaders back and had to wait for a gap, only to rocket through it and put 3 lengths on the second horse in about 50 meters. The acceleration off a sit sprint was insane and the mark of a good, young horse.      \n      \nWe draw barrier 1 today and I expect the exact same scenario to play out again here; we sit leaders back and wait for the gap before exploding past. The same leader/2nd place getter is the 2nd favourite in the race, alongside the 3rd place getter, and I can’t see at all how they get any closer to us, especially factoring in the extra 100m.     \n      \nGot the goat WA jockey in W Pike aboard again, and all he needs to do is get us some space in the straight and we’ll go whooshka.     \n      \nNow we could be in some trouble if we begin badly and get buried on the rail, but in all trials and the one race-day performance, we’ve jumped well enough to hold a spot, so I’m not that concerned.     \n      \nGL!    \n    \n[https://ko-fi.com/bstilled_](https://ko-fi.com/bstilled_)",

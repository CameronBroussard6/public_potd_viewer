He’s holding serve comfortably and shortening points, which is ideal on fast indoor courts in Dallas.\n\nFritz is favored, and I would say take a slight edge on a fast surface with his serving, but he’s had more court time during the tournament and had an elbow injury come up during his match in the quarterfinals that he may have to deal with.\n\nFritz mentioned after his last match that he felt “really sharp pain” in his elbow and needed treatment plus painkillers to finish. Even if that only limits him 10–15%, that’s significant in a serve-dominant matchup like this. A slight dip in serve velocity or forehand pop could be the difference in one tight set or breaker.",

A bit of a slow start, 1 goal in the first half, and two quick goals after halftime to cash us hype the 60th minute. They ended with 4 goals, really should have been 6 or 7 with some of the chances they missed. We went 4-1 during the week, lets see if we can carry some momentum into the weekend.\n\nHappy Valentine's Day for those who celebrate, here's a too late reminder to go buy some flowers and chocolate. Today we've got another FA Cup match, this time as League One side Burton host Premier League side West Ham. As confusing as it is, League One is actually the 3rd tier division in English Soccer. Burton, is ranked 21st in that division, meaning there are 47 teams in the hierarchy between West Ham (18th in EPL) and Burton. That's a huge talent gap in soccer. Burton are both bottom 5 defensively and offensively in League One, and are winless in their last 5 matches. \n\nI get it, for those who follow the EPL, you'll note that West Ham is bad and be cautious to back them. They're neck deep in a relegation battle. However, they have won 3 of their last 5 and seem to have turned a corner the last few weeks. The team is clicking, and they'll see this match as a chance to continue to build momentum and maybe have a chance to make a deep cup run. They've brought in some attacking players during the January window and have genuinely looked good the last few matches (going up 2-0 away at Chelsea). So I really like the odds here given the talent gap on paper and form of both teams. Lets hope West Ham show up. \n\nBOL and hope everyone has a great weekend!",

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 15-40-5 *Finally, it feels like all the pain and bs I had to witness in my Barcelona fades lead to that moment! Barcelona were completely outclassed from the very first whistle and shipped 4 goals in the first half alone. The second half was a bit of a snoozefest, but Atletico had everything under control. I knew they'd do well, but I couldn't have imagined what would follow, not even in my wildest dreams. This was the third successful Barca fade and I feel like I'm finally starting to get the hang of this thing. Let's move on from this now though, as my record is still somehow even more horrific than that Barca first half performance. Still a lot of work left to be done if I'm to get anywhere near a positive record*\n\n**Last Five:** ❌❌❌✅✅\n\n**Event:** LaLiga, Real Madrid v Real Sociedad, 3:00 pm EST\n\n**POTD:** Real Sociedad Win or Draw, +200, 3 units\n\n**Write Up:** It seems like I've finally managed to tame Barcelona a bit (kinda), but my ambitions are loftier. I'm coming for the other Clasico side, Real Madrid. They're matched up against Real Sociedad, who, in case you forgot, **actually beat Barcelona earlier in the season.** How poetic would it be if they could get one over Real Madrid too? They certainly **have the squad to do it.** Not only that, but they're coming into this matchup in great form, remaining **unbeaten in the last 11 games, a run that includes 8 wins** in that span.\n\nReal Madrid are still very much finding their feet after a turbulent beginning to 2026, and I think they're definitely there for the taking. I absolutely love these odds as they're in the absolute upper limit of what's allowed in these threads, but after that Barca shocker, my confidence is sky high so yes, I'm putting down three whole units on a +200 odd play. I just see terrific value in these odds. Not expecting a high scoring game, so something like Under 2.5 goals sounds reasonable too, if you want to go down that route. Expecting a big game from Oyarzabal, who loves turning up against Barcelona and Real Madrid specifically. For those of you who are wondering about the fade, you can go with something like a Real Madrid +1.0 Asian Handicap or even a Real Madrid +1.0, +1.5 Asian Handicap for some decent odds (I think the Madrid divas are getting clapped though). BOL and let's enjoy some Valverde longshots ☘️🫡",

That means that FUT map pick is up first in this series as the odds also indicate\n* Both teams have a clear perma ban, Aurora ban Ancient, FUT ban Inferno, both teams also have EXTREMELY OBVIOUS map picks. FUT pick Mirage, Aurora pick Anubis, there is almost 0 chance we see either team swap their map pick off of these unless one team just randomly drops their perma ban\n\n**Mirage Stats:**\n\n* FUT are 89% winrate on 18 maps of Mirage in the L3 months, they are on a rampage run, I would argue maybe the best Mirage team in the world strategically, they have been running Mirage as their home map forever. They first pick this map in 70% of their games and for good reason. FUT dominance on Mirage as mentioned is not new, they went 51-20 on this map in 2025, an insane run of form\n* Aurora are 29% winrate on 7 maps of Mirage in the L3 months, they have heavily struggled on this map, this is their only map in the pool currently they are <50% winrate on.\n* FUT are on a 10 map winstreak on Mirage, and while for a while they were mostly farming tier two teams, recently they have been dominating tier one teams on the map as well. They have beaten Astralis, G2, FURIA, as well as some strong tier two teams on the map like OG, EYEBALLERS and BetBoom.\n* FUT are extremely well rounded on this map, they win 64% of pistol rounds, they average a 73.3% winrate on CT side/defense, and a 53.4% winrate on offense as well. In the last month despite a drop in pistol round win % down to 40%, they are 5-0 in this time including the win against FURIA where they won 13-11 despite losing both pistol rounds\n* Aurora struggles really started for them in October and to close out the year but a lot of their Mirage maps back then were still close, but in 2026 these struggles have been much worse then previous, they are not just losing Mirage but getting dominated by teams, they lost to FURIA 13-4, Falcons 13-10, PARIVISION 13-5, GamerLegion 13-5 in 2026 so far which is when they picked up Soulfly.\n* Aurora are 20% winrate in their last 5 mirage games, they have lost them by a total score of 59-37 winning just 39% of rounds overall. They have really struggled on CT side recently generating only 40.3% of rounds on this side in the new year, despite a 50% winrate on pistol rounds, their offense has always been shaky on Mirage going back 6 months, they average 42.1% winrate on T side over a 24 round sample, but in the past were able to win close maps due to their strong CT sides and often sneak win close maps, without good CT sides, they will never stand a chance against strong Mirage teams in my opinion",

Bayern Munich ML & over 2.5 goals @ 1.57\n\n16th place Werder Bremen host league leaders Bayern. With Borussia Dortmund winning already this match week and closing the gap between 1st and 2nd to 3 points I'm hoping for a motivated Bayern outfit to come out and secure 3 points.\n\nThey are scoring plenty so I wouldn't be surprised if they covered this goal line by themselves although I expect Werder Bremen to score which could help also.\n\nThe only absentee from BM is Olise but I expect the difference in class to be on show here.",

Urawa Reds beat regional rivals JEF United 2-0 away, but how the fuck that game didn’t AT LEAST see a third humanity will never now, just how the fuck didn’t the ball go in one more time! The chances both teams had!  \n\nBoth meetings in the league last season ended with 3-2 wins for the host. The teams also faced each other in the Emperor Cup where FC Tokyo knocked Urawa out with a 2-1 win at home, but Urawa was the better team in that game and should at least taken the game to extra time. \n\nThe bookies are not really feeling this game that strongly and while neither side saw three goals in their opening match, if they come into this game that they did in those opening games this should have no problem seeing 3-4 or even more goals.\n\n",

Units: 4U\n\n\nWrite Up: Hi Friends, I thought id share my knowledge in the hopes of all of you benefiting from it too. I am new here but find the insights very interesting (especially from jaysial) and sharing is caring.\n\nStating of with a high confidence wager in \nSA vs NZ for extras (b,lbs,wides,nb - for the non cricket players) to hit over 17.5. Multiple reasons for the conviction as below.\n\n1. Match is played in Ahmedabad , the pitch is extremely flat meaning bowlers need to alter the lengths significantly and be more aggressive and hence prone to mistakes.\n\n2. SA bowling attack is notoriously wayward in bowling , past 2 matches they have given away 11 & 12 wides respectively. Not to mention 2 no balls in each innings as well. New Zealand are also susceptible bowling 7 & 9 wides in their last 2 games.\n\n3. This is a highly competitive game and a high scoring one resulting in the full over quotas being close to completion.\n\n4. The conditions - The match is played at night in India where dew will come into play, the balls will slip out of the hands easier for the team bowling second increasing the number of errors. Also, weather is clear so the innings won’t be truncated.\n\nHope to be off to a good start and best of luck!",

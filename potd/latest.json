      "text": "Record : 17-15-2  \n\nNet units:(-0.94 units)\n\nLast pick: Naji Marshall under 2.5 Assists✅\n\nPick of the day : Payton Pritchard over 8.5 Rebounds+Assists (-130 HR)\n\nReason • \nPritchard has seen ELITE volume in the RA department in his L5 games he’s averaging 19.2 RA chances on 33.2 minutes per game. Pritchard is also over this line in 4/L5 games averaging 10.6 RA with the only miss coming right at 8. \n\nThis Heat team has been absolutely LEAKING RA to opposing PGs as they allow the MOST assists (9.2) & 6th MOST rebounds (6.9) - Pritchard is also over in 2/3 matchups against the Heat when playing 30+ minutes averaging 11 RA on 17.3 RA chances. \n\nThis game has a 6.5 point spread favoring the Celtics coming off of 3 days rest of course, BUT Pritchard should see full minutes without a doubt. Also, if Herro ends up suiting up it only makes this game even closer (I don’t see a blowout in this matchup at all either way). Miami Heat play at a Top 5 fastest pace as well which suits Pritchard’s RA volume perfectly. \n\nWe love the rebound upside in this matchup to go along with his assists, he should absolutely COOK tonight & be all over the ball!",

Anyway, these teams face off in league play today. Crewe is at home in decent form, and Bristol sits 2nd from last on the league table in terrible form. They’ve lost 6 of their last 7 matches, and only scored 3 goals in those matches. \n\nCrewe sit at 8th on the league table with a positive goal differential. They’ve scored 11 goals in their last 5 matches while allowing 9. Even though they haven’t defended well, I don’t trust Bristol’s offense to do much in this game. Crewe should be able to get the W at home today.",

      "text": "**Record**: 5-6 (-3.08u)\n\n**Last Pick**: (NBA) Clippers at Thunder O 221.5 points (W)\n\n**Event**: (NBA) Miami Heat at Boston Celtics | 7:00pm ET\n\n**POTD**: *2 Leg Alt Line Parlay* | **Boston Celtics -2.5 (-182) + Total Points UNDER 238.5 (-198)** | +115 on FD - - - **both are alternate lines**\n\n***1.5u to win 1.74u***\n\n**Reason**: I'm going to give the 2 leg alternate line parlay a shot here and see how it works. I have been playing with some the lines and looking and teams trends against the spread and margin of victory and thought why not give this a shot. Miami headed straight to Boston after a much needed win in Brooklyn. The game was close the much of the game until Miami was finally able to pull away in the 4th. This season, Miami is currently **2-2 ATS in back-to-back games with a margin of victory of -1.5.** I think going into Boston after a tough one in Brooklyn, and **Boston not playing a game since Monday**, they should pull away with this one relatively easily as long as they can score the ball which they have been doing pretty solid, and they should give a lot of thanks to Jaylen Brown for that who has been averaging roughly 30-6-5 this season.\n\n**Boston is also allowing only 110.8ppg this season which is 2nd in the NBA,** behind OKC. Miami plays a slower game in more high stakes games as well which I think will give Boston the advantage especially coming off this much rest as I'm sure these guys are eager to get back on the court. **The Celtics are averaging 116.2ppg, and in games they have scored more than 117 points, they are 11-1 ATS.**  The **Heat are allowing (just about that mark Boston thrives at) 117 points per game** (18th in the league). Derrick White is also providing elite two-way play for **Boston and the team overall has better secondary scoring options than Miami** does who seems to be less consistent.\n\n**In Boston's last 10 games, the total score has averaged out around 229 points, and Miami's last 10 average is 231.5** which the 238.5 alternate line gives some cushion. **Against the spread in their last 10 - Boston is 8-2 and Miami is 5-5.** I really believe after seeing Miami's performance yesterday against Brooklyn, the Celtics will hold them to less than 110. **Miami has struggled on the road this season at 5-8** and their overall play style struggles to be efficient especially on a back-to-back. I think that the two play styles of these teams and calls for a much slower kind of grind out possession games, especially because I think the only way Miami can win this game being tired after yesterday, they will have to slow it down a bit. Boston can win by playing explosive and fast on the offensive end and using the rest to their advantage.\n\nSorry if any of that sounds jumbled together I'm trying to get this pick to you guys while on break lol and don't want these odds to change for those who see it early.\n\nBOL.",

Yes, this was 9 days ago and they had a lot of time to dwell and feed off the lose but a tall task in the Villanova Wildcats awaits. Hailing from Philadelphia, this Villanova sqaud is young and hungry to get a signature win on the season. The Badgers do not have much size in the interior and this is where Nova lacks depth and stability. Wisconsin also does not shoot the 3 very well, where the thrive is the free throw line and not turning the ball over. Nova will need to play a clean game and not get into foul trouble to keep the Badgers off the line. The match up of Nick Boyd and John Blackwell for Wisconsin against Bryce Lindsay and Acaden Lewis in the back court is the show of this game. The young guards from Villanova will make their names known against a veteran Wisconsin guard duo. Kenpom has Villanova ranked 34 in the nation and Wisconsin 39.\n\nPICK: Villanova +5.5",

Risk 1U to win 1.35U.\n\n**Write Up:** \n\nKennesaw State is a classic bowl-season value play where the market is overvaluing brand name and undervaluing trajectory. The Owls enter this game as an ascending, highly motivated program treating the bowl as a program-defining moment, while their opponent profiles as flatter and more reliant on perception than current form. KSU’s run-heavy, ball-control offense and willingness to win ugly travel extremely well to neutral-site bowls, lowering variance and keeping the game inside one possession deep into the fourth quarter. That style creates multiple win paths — either controlling tempo early or staying close enough for late-game execution to matter — which is exactly what you want backing an underdog or short moneyline in bowl season.\n\n  \n[Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=NMSJPU4XF8C9S)",

The successes this Celtics team has had this season is owed almost entirely to the ascendant performance of JB.\n\nHe has recorded 30 or more points in 8 of his last 9 games, (the only outlier being the time he put up 19 on his way to a triple double) and averaged 7 rebounds per game over that span. Over the Celtics last 5 games played his average Pts+Reb is 39.4.\n\nWe all know Brown is capable of putting up 37+ Pts+Reb, absent of the matchup data. But let’s take a look at this Heat team. Sure, they are one of the slowest teams relative to pace, but they’ve often allowed small forwards to walk all over them. \n\nA few notable recent performances by small forwards vs Miami:\n\nMPJ: 28pts 6reb  \nIngram: 28pts 5reb  \nWagner: 32pts 5reb  \n\nBrown is a far better scorer and rebounder than any of these small forwards, and should put up good numbers against a Heat team that has allowed the third most rebounds in the NBA over their last 15 games. Over that same span they’ve allowed the fourth most points in the paint, where JB likes to feast. \n\nHe’s also coming in after 4 days rest. When having 3+ rest days here are Brown’s relevant stat lines in his last five 3-day rested games:\n\n38pts/8reb - 46  \n30pts/3reb - 33  \n30pts/8reb - 38  \n42pts/4reb - 44  \n41pts/6reb - 47  \n\nBOL, and a huge THANK YOU to the degens that sent tips last week!

(Could be wrong but I think line will definitely move)**\n\nUnfortunately I'm not going with numbers or statistics here.\n\nNow OG and Mikal could lock some of these guys up but I think honestly this team is very tired. Also if KAT and Mitchell Robinson play then this could also affect this a lot due to paint presence.\n\nTyrese Maxey in his last 5 games has scored 28, 12, 35, 35, 44. Against the Knicks in his last 5 he has gone 30, 33, 17, 35, 27. This line to be honest is so questionable to me as this is essentially the Knicks third back to back game as the one day break they had, was flying to Indiana lmfao and even the commentators were saying these boys were whining to hurry up and go back to New York. This team is so fatigued we can definitely see it. Brunson has been playing close to 40 minutes a game and is now on a back to back, Andrew Nembhard dropped 31 on Jalen Brunson and to be honest I'd be amazed if he plays. Furthermore Players just tend to usually play better in certain teams/areas and players loveeeeeee the Knicks home.\n\nAlso if your someone who is cautious understand that he is coming back from a 2 game absence from an illness. So if you want to be safe maybe avoid this as this is his first game back whether its out of him actually feeling better or him being forced to play.",

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 5-2\n\n**✅✅✅**❌**✅✅**❌\n\n**Net Units:** \\+7.75\n\n**Previous Pick:** Mark Williams to record a double double (+173 on DK); 2 units ❌\n\n**Previous Pick Reaction:** Fuck. From the 1Q I could tell I was cooked. Mark started picking up some momentum in 2Q but Ott takes him out abruptly despite having the highest +/- on the team at that point and having only one foul. He gets heavier minutes in the second half but does fuck all with it.\n\nI hate losing but I really fucking hate losing a POTD. So sorry to anyone who tailed. I got a little too cute with a higher-risk longer-odds prop and it bit me in the ass. Never again.\n\n**Today's Event:** NBA 🏀 SA Spurs @ Atlanta Hawks (4:30pm PST)\n\n**Today's Pick:** SA Spurs Moneyline \\[ML\\] (-135 on DK); 4 units\n\nAfter that defeat I scanned until I found something a little more evidence-based.\n\nThe Spurs are far and away the better team here, with or without Wemby, and the fact that we can get odds this long on them to win outright is worth jumping on IMO.\n\nFirst, and most obviously, is the win % comparison of ATL (.536) vs SAS (.731), despite the west being an objectively tougher conference. Indeed, Spurs are 6-1 vs. eastern conference teams. This win % gap of roughly 20 percentage points remains relatively constant even when comparing ATL's home win % (.454) to SAS's road win % (.615). Yes, ATL's record at home is worse than on the road.\n\n~~Second is the rest comparison. ATL will be playing the 2nd night on a back-to-back, whereas the Spurs are coming off of two full days of rest.~~\n\nSecond is this specific matchup. Spurs have won three straight against the Hawks, once this season (no Wemby) and both games last season (with Wemby). Obviously Wemby can be a difference-maker and with no Porzingus, ATL doesn't really have the size to stop him or keep him off the glass. But the real story of the Spurs this season is the emergence of Castle, Harper, and Vassell, who are all exceeding expectations.\n\nThird is the defensive difference. While Spurs and Hawks are neck-and-neck in at least a few different offensive categories like FG% and 3P%, Spurs have a decided advantage defensively in terms of overall defensive rating (SAS 113.1 ATL 114.5), defensive rebound % (SAS 71% ATL 68%), opponent 2nd chance points in which SAS ranks #3 (13.5 per game) and ATL ranks #23 (16.0 per game), **and my favorite stat, opponent fastbreak points** in which SAS ranks #2 (12.4 per game) and ATL ranks #17 (15.6 per game).\n\nThis latter point is where I think SAS has the most decided advantage: Spurs and Hawks both get a large % of their own points off of fast breaks, but only the Spurs are effective at guarding the fast break.\n\nIn fact, from my search, there is not a single defensive stat in which ATL outperforms SAS. And this difference should only be starker with Wemby back, who has the 16th best defensive rating among all players this season. No Hawks player is even in the top 50 defensively. And the return of Trae Young only makes this worse for them, as he is a massive defensive liability.\n\nPerhaps the books are overreacting to Trae's return, though I think this only helps our case as he has been out so long that he no longer fits smoothly into the offense, and as noted above, exacerbates ATL's defensive woes. As evidence, consider that the Hawks are 2-4 with Trae Young this season and 13-9 without, including yesterday's loss to the lowly Hornets.\n\nAnd as a final point, Spurs are motivated after losing that cup game to the Knicks. They will come out fighting for a win from the opening tipoff.\n\nIf you want a little more bang for your buck the spread is at -2.5 (-108) and I think the Spurs likely cover. But due to my last POTD losing I'm building in a little extra cushion on this one and just sticking with the ML.\n\nApologies again for that last pick, hoping for some redemption here. Thanks for reading.\n\n**Edited to fix an oversight on rest advantage. Both Spurs and Hawks are playing off no rest. This does not diminish my confidence though, as Spurs are 3-0 this season on no rest.**",

Oklahoma’s CFP hopes rest on the performance of John Mateer in unison with their defensive unit. This number jumped out at me earlier in the week and only moved slightly. Some books have 17.5 available closer to even money, so this might be an alt line.\n\nAgainst LSU in his last regular season game, Mateer completed 23 of 38 pass attempts, getting him back on track in a big way in the passing game.\n\nMateer HAS been under this prop line in 2 of the last 3 weeks, but we all know, these CFP games are slugfests that can take longer than pre-pitch clock baseball games.\n\nNeither of these teams being particularly good running the ball, which screams a lot of short pass offensive football, and a lot of stopped clocks - Mateer should exploit the moment with his play style. \n\nBack against Bama in Week 12, Mateer completed only 15 passes, but it was on a season low 23 pass attempts. I am betting on the belief that he will (have to?) throw the ball more than he did last time.\n\nThe college football play clock, mixed with the college football playoff stage, gives this prop a solid chance to clear. Yes, he likes to check the ball and run from time to time, but I expect Alabama to challenge him to throw the ball rather than give him the option to choose. I feel like he clears 20 easily.\n\nFun fact: Since becoming a starter last year, Mateer has eclipsed this prop line in 18/23 games.\n\nLast play review:\n\nNFL - Los Angeles @ Seattle, Kyren Williams o68.5 APY -110 1u ✅\n\n(4 in a row! - The bet went more or less to plan, lots of touches, Rams established a run game early, rotation with Corum didn’t take away volume. Williams ended the game with 85 yards on 26 touches, including 3 receptions on 6 targets.)\n\nBOL if you’re tailing, and if not BOL in general!",

Both of these teams are conference champions as the Kennesaw State Owls are champions of Conference USA while the Western Michigan Broncos are champions of the Mid-American Conference. I firmly believe the Mid-American conference is a much better football conference than Conference USA and I also believe the Broncos are a better football team than the Owls. The Western Michigan Broncos lean on a run heavy offense with an one-two punch of quarterback Broc Lowry who leads the team in rushing and runningback Jalen Buckley who is coming off a stellar 200 yard 2 touchdown performance in their conference championship game against Miami-Ohio. This Owls team major weakness is in their run defense as they rank 106 out of 136 FBS schools in rush yards allowed per game with 180 yards let up per game while on the other hand the Broncos tote a very strong defense as they are 33rd in rush yards allowed per game, 18th in passing yards allowed per game and 14th in points allowed per game only allowing 18 points per contest. Both of the teams have players opting out and the Broncos only have one opt out that I would call “notable” as 5th string running back Cole Cabana and defensive linemen Noah Bishop who only has 2 tackles are non-notable opt outs but starting defensive end Nadame Tucker is expected to sit out in this one. The Owls have three notable opt outs, all coming on defense as cornerback Caleb Offord, safety Antonio Stevens and linebacker Garland Benyard will be missing from this Kennesaw State defense. I think the Broncos win this one because of how efficient they are on the ground and with how poor this Owls defense is against the rush, especially without three defensive starters I dont think the Owls will have it in them to stop this Broncos rushing attack.\n\nPrediction: 28-23 Broncos\n\nLast pick: 🏈Panthers -2💩Up 10 just to piss the game away.

Check your books if you agree with this bet to find the best value.\n\nRing sized announced 22x22 which is a little bigger than normal, giving Paul more room to run from Joshua.\n\nThis brings back horror memories when I hammered (didn't post on here) the over 5.5 rounds at (-110) and watched the line to explode to over 7.5 rounds well into the -200's only to watch Joshua make him look like a girl and knock him down 3 times and out cold effortlessly in the opening rounds. Honestly was sketched out by how Nganou can beat and knock down the arguably better Tyson Fury (even in bad shape) and not last the opening rounds with Joshua.\n\nAnyway if Nganou legitimately couldn't last at all with Joshua being around 265lbs Jake Paul coming in weighing 40-50lbs less would seemingly not have a chance to do better one could think. However I'm betting the opposite.\n\nJake has much more boxing experience than Francis and will be more fleet of foot, and does know how to box well and avoid shots much better than Nganou. With the bigger ring allowing more room will benefit Jake more than Joshua. I think Jake starts out and quite possibly goes as long as he can picking his safest spots while focusing on survival more than inflicted damage as long as he can.\n\nIt just feels for me personally Jake never schedules in opponent that will end up embarrassing him. Him getting knocked out in under 2.5 rounds classifies as that. If he can duke out 6+ rounds in this fight i believe he'll gain boxing respect. Both Fighters will/could end up walking from this winners from a money/status standpoint.\n\nIf Jake gets rocked early it takes a ton a value and appeal form future fights. If he somehow makes this a fight, that's set ups even bigger money grabs in the future. I guess I'm willing to bet hard that this happens.",

The Canucks, meanwhile, have traded away a top player in the league in Quinn Hughes, and look to really settle in for a rebuild type of season after a disappointing start. Although they’ve won their games since trading away Hughes, the Canucks cannot keep riding on their mediocre defense and anemic offensive pressure.

Surely two brains work better than one? So far so good ;)\nNow honestly… what are the bookies doing with this price? Crewe at 1.91 / -109 at home against a side that’s lost 10 league matches on the bounce feels generous. Instead of just looking at results, let’s break down the form, trends, and matchup.\nCrewe host Bristol Rovers in a fixture that’s all about momentum versus a team in free fall. Crewe come into this off an impressive 4–1 away win at Tranmere (15th), while Bristol Rovers were comfortably beaten 3–0 by Swindon (3rd) and never really looked competitive.\nThe away form is the real concern. Bristol Rovers have lost 5 away matches in a row, conceding heavily throughout that run, including a 4–0 defeat away to Barnet (13th) in their most recent trip. On top of that, they’ll be without their starting centre-back through suspension, which only weakens an already fragile defensive unit.\nCrewe at home are front-foot, aggressive, and rarely allow matches to drift. They consistently apply pressure and create chances, and while they’re not perfect defensively, they tend to outscore teams rather than sit back. At home this season, Crewe have:\n·       Scored 3 against Shrewsbury\n·       Scored 3 against Grimsby\n·       Played high-scoring draws with Chesterfield and Newport\nTheir home games are rarely slow or cagey. Crewe push the tempo, keep opponents pinned back, and force mistakes — exactly the type of environment where Bristol Rovers struggle.\nAnd it gets worse for the visitors. Bristol Rovers haven’t scored a league goal in their last 5 matches. Zero. Asking a side in that kind of scoring drought to get something away from home, against constant pressure, is a big ask.\nTactically, this is a poor matchup for Rovers. They tend to concede once their defensive structure breaks under sustained pressure, and Crewe’s home style is designed to do precisely that. The longer this game stays level, the more it favours the hosts.\nOne final note — not something to base a bet on, but worth mentioning — Crewe have never lost to Bristol Rovers in a league fixture. History doesn’t cash tickets, but it certainly doesn’t hurt. CMON CREWE!!!",

Jake has fought so many people who are either way smaller or way older or don’t even box, and now we have someone who’s a true professional boxer in Anthony Joshua. Paul is like +700 to win this fight which is just dumb, in reality he should be getting knocked out in the first round. There is no way Jake’s team believes he can win this fight, and they most likely signed a promotional agreement forever ago and now have to go through the motions. But like so many of these other fights, this is for entertainment on Netflix and an easy way to make a stupid amount of money for them. Netflix and Joshua both want to make a spectacle and drag this out for views. I wouldn’t even be surprised if this goes the distance to make Jake look good. If Netflix and these two fighters don’t want to be made a mockery of, they’ll make sure this fight goes a respectable distance. \n\nRemember to only bet what you can afford to lose, and BOL!",

That said, I am a realist.\n\n\\*\\*Todays pick:  Will Wilson ATTD (-105 FD)  Gasparilla Bowl 230PM ET   NCSU vs Memphis\\*\\*\n\nReasoning:  I only come out of the woodwork when I feel good about something.  In other words 80% confidence, and always an ACC or NC team.\n\nOnly 3 books have this line available so check pikkit in the morning before taking this.  For now -105 is the best available.    Wilson has 6TDs in the last 3 games.  Anytime State College has a 3rd-4th and short they sub out our starting QB and give it to this guy for a direct snap and he is pretty much unstoppable.\n\nNC State's #1 back is also out, as he has entered the portal.  Tail at your own risk and this time, wait til the end of the game before sending me hate chats haha.  If we lose, I will take em with grace  GL!",

      "text": "__POTD Record:__ 65-32-1 (+71.23u)\n\n__Previous Pick:__ [❌ Rashid Shaheed o34.5 receiving yards (-110), 3.3u](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/s/NWrKAkOfEs)\n\n__Event:__ NCAAF: Alabama @ Oklahoma 8pm EST\n\n__POTD:__ Alabama ML (-105), 3.15u to win 3u\n\n__Write Up:__ The 1st game of the College Football Playoffs is here, as #9 Alabama (10-3) travels to Norman, Oklahoma to take on #8 Oklahoma (10-2). Bama is looking for revenge after the 2 teams faced off a month ago, where OU used 3 turnovers (including an 87 yard pick six), to take down Bama 23-21 in Tuscaloosa. Bama had almost double the yards as OU (406-212) but couldn't overcome costly turnovers as they lost their 1st home game in head coach’s Kalen DeBoer tenure. OU is looking to become the 1st team in history to beat Bama twice in the same year. They’re also looking for their 1st playoff win, with an 0-4 all time record in the CFP. OU finished their season strong, winning 4 in a row & 5 of their last 6. Since the Week 12 win vs Bama, the OU has won low scoring affairs over Missouri & LSU. Their 17-13 regular season finale win over LSU was a lot like my sex life. Very little scoring, lacked explosiveness, & poor clock management. OU scored just 3 first half points, committed 3 turnovers, & had 8 penalties that kept LSU in the game. Bama is also coming off a stinker in the SEC ship vs UGA. They were held scoreless until the 4th quarter, struggling to run the ball with just -3 rushing yards. Bama was a combined 4/17 on 3rd/4th down, with UGA dominating time of possession by 14 minutes. Bama will look to bounce back vs a defense they did well against a month ago.\n\nAlabama OC Ryan Grubb loves to move the ball through the air. Bama has passed on 55% of their plays this season (22nd), but that elevated to 59.15% (10th) over their last 3 games. Bama QB Ty Simpson aired it out on OU in their first game. __Simpson threw for 326 yards, averaging 7.8 yards per pass & 5.4 yards per play, both the 2nd highest rates vs OU this year.__ All anyone remembers from that game though are his turnovers. OU was extremely lucky as they’ve been poop at forcing turnovers this year. __OU has only forced 13 turnovers on the season (94th), ranking just 116th in ball hawk rate, making a play on the ball on just 10% of passes.__ This also was uncharacteristic for Simpson as he has been incredibly efficient this year. __Simpson has led an offense that ranks 12th in the nation in EPA/play (0.176).__ He has thrown for 3,268 yards (14th), with a 64% completion rate, 26 pass TD’s (12th) & just 5 INT’s (2nd fewest among QB’s with 340+ attempts). His success through the air in his 1st game vs OU was in large part due to his offensive line. __Bama’s OL only allowed Simpson to be pressured on 27% of dropbacks. Bama’s OL ranks 29th pressure rate allowed this year.__ OU’s pass rush has only gotten worse throughout the season & things only got worse when star DE Mason Thomas went down with an ankle injury Week 10 vs Tennessee. __Since Thomas’s injury, OU has ranked 82nd in pressure rate.__ Thomas is projected to return this week, but reports from practices are that he’s not at full strength. Last game, to prevent Simpson from dicing them up through the air OU was unable to blitz & had to drop back in coverage. But with no pressure Simpson carved them up. Against no blitz this season Simpson has a 68% completion rate (26th), averaging 7.9 yards/pass (43rd), & a positive EPA on 51% of passes (17th). Against a blitz Simpson only has a 55% comp rate (113th), avg 6.9 yards/pass (98th), & a 43% positive EPA (80th). __When generating pressure this season OU allows just 4.4 yards per pass (9th) compared to 7.3 yards per pass with no pressure (43rd). With lack of pressure Simpson is able to take 3 step dropbacks 59% of plays (28th most). OU allows 8.2 yards per pass on 3 step drops (92nd).__ As for their ground game, Bama has lacked one this season & OU has a great run D, so Bama will keep the ball in the air as it worked in the last matchup. Take away the uncharacteristic TO’s last game & Bama wins by double digits. Their defense matches up great vs a not so great OU offense as well.\n\nOU has the worst offense in the CFP. They are just 47th in the NCAA in EPA per play (0.054). __OU hasn’t scored more than 2 offensive TD’s in a game since Oct. 25. They avg just 26.4 points per game, fewest by a 10 win team in FBS. They only scored 21.5 points vs SEC opponents (11th in the SEC).__ OU also likes to throw the ball ranking top 50 in the nation in pass rate. OC Ben Arbuckle runs a ton of spread formations, which in turn creates light boxes for his RB’s on 68% of plays. But OU’s problem is their RB’s can’t break tackles. __Despite OU ranking 42nd in yards before contact due to light boxes, they only rank 103rd in yards after contact. Facing a light box they avg just 4.6 yards per carry (103rd). Bama allows 4.9 yards per carry with a light box (40th). Oklahoma was stuffed on over half their 26 rushing attempts in Week 12, finishing with a poor 27% Success Rate on passing downs. OU RB’s finished with just 35 yards. Over the past month OU has fallen outside the top 100 in Rushing Success Rate, Line Yards & Stuff Rate.__ As for OU’s QB, John Mateer hasn't been his normal self since suffering a hand injury halfway through the season. He also made a ton of mistakes vs LSU, was off vs Missouri, & hasn't ran the ball well. __Even before his thumb surgery, Mateer completed just 34% of his 15+ yard passes (116th). Post surgery that number dropped to 26%. Bama allows just 35% of passes 15+ yards (26th). The NCAA avg for available yards gained is 44%, OU has failed to eclipse 35% of available yards since Mateer came back. Mateer also has thrown 51% of his passes less than 5 yards since his return. Bama is elite at defending short passes allowing just 4.6 yards per pass on throws less than 5 yards (21st).__ Bama held OU to just 212 yards & 4.2 yards per play last game, OU’s 2nd lowest rate of the year. It was OU’s worst performance of the year on 3rd downs, converting just 23%. Bama’s defense was also playing on their heels all game as Oklahoma was spotted an average starting field position at the 42 yard line. Meanwhile OU’s punter Grayson Miller had 6 punts for 280 yards with 3 inside the 20 yard line. Bama looks a tad different from their last matchup vs OU. Up to 13 players were out or limited in the SEC title Game 2 weeks ago, & many of them have returned to the field, including RB Jam Miller. Bama did everything but win that first game against OU. The result will be different this week. \n\n*🌊🌊🌊 The Tide will Roll 🌊🌊🌊*\n\n__Alabama ML__\n\nAppreciate the love!

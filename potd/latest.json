They are the top scorers in the UCL, and while spurs in unbeaten in the UCL, I see PSG getting it done at home today. \n\nLiverpool BTTS reasoning: Liverpool have kept only two clean sheets in their last 14 matches and they have conceded exactly three goals in four of their last six fixtures. We’ve all seen this is not the Liverpool we expected this year, with goals absolutely floodinggg\n\nLet’s get a win!! BOL SORRY FOR THE LATE PICK",

Real Madrid -1 (-108)\n\nMadrid have scored 12 goals in their last 4 UCL games, with Kylian Mbappé leading the charge at 19 goals across all competitions (including 5 in Europe). Vinícius Júnior (8G+7A) and Jude Bellingham add 15 combined contributions—enough to break down any low block.\n\nRecent form: 3 straight La Liga wins (9-1 aggregate) post-Anfield loss, showing resilience. Xabi Alonso's side averages 2.1 xG per UCL away game, and Olympiacos have conceded 1.5+ xG in 3 of 4 home European matches.\n\nThe Greek champs sit 31st with 2 points (2 draws, 2 losses), scoring only 2 goals total in the league phase—none from open play at home. Ayoub El Kaabi (7 goals domestically) is isolated up top, and they've failed to score in 2 of 4 UCL outings.\n\nHome form is solid domestically (unbeaten in 9 European homes overall), but against elite attacks? Vulnerable: 1-1 vs. PSV, 0-2 vs. Atalanta. Expect Madrid's press to starve their counters.",

They’re also top 80 in fg % shooting the ball well so far this year. Harvard does have some sloppy stretches of basketball which worries me but I think they keep this one close today. As for boston college they are one of the worst shooting teams statistically this season. They’re also top rank 357th from beyond the arc at a 26.5% shooting clip. If Harvard can get hot, this one can go the other way pretty fast. Harvard has the better offense by a mile here and I see this one being much closer than anticipated. Boston college does out rebound Harvard offensively but I think they are just too inefficient shooting the ball to cover this one. Back Harvard with the number.",

Throughout the seasons so far, Towns is averaging 12.4 rebounds per game. The Charlotte Hornets this season have done a fine job of defending the center position overall. However, the place where they lack the most is in rebounding. The Hornets struggle to keep big centers from getting rebounds. While I have chosen this line, it would not surprise me to see Towns walk out of this game with 14 or more boards.",

And we haven't gone longer that -125 odds on a single pick.

Two rematches 2025 playoffs--Thunder vs Timberwolves and Houston vs GSW. I found a lot of things that I like tonight (Curry 3s, KAT reb & Brunson points, Sengun on anything, Jalen Duren P+R...) but it was really hard for me to decide on the single best pick to keep the streak alive. Ultimately, we are going with Kel'el Ware on rebounds. Once again I don't fully understand his lines here given recent form (18, 16, 14, 16, 14, 10, 13, 20, 12, 6). He's averaging 11 on the season, but 13.9 in his last 10. The Miami Heat are a lower FG% shooting team, and the spurs are bottom 8 team in defensive rebounds, especially without Giannis. (he's been upgraded to questionable, but probably on minutes even if he plays). This should create a few more opportunities for Kel'el, who should get some good minutes with all of Miami's injuries. Foul risk is lower here too, bucks being a bottom 4 team for opponent fouls. The Heat also just play better @ home. \n\n**Take Kel'el Ware over 11.5 Rebounds.**\n\nLet's have a great Thanksgiving eve! Cheers everyone!\n\n*Please tail at your own risk and only ever wager what you can afford to lose. BOL!*",

It came only two weeks after the 3-0 loss to Manchester City and has left the Reds sitting 12th in the Premier League after 12 games.\n\nDefensively they look lost. Even Alisson’s return could not stop them conceding three goals in back to back league games for the first time since 1965. Virgil van Dijk is surrounded by uncertainty as Ibrahima Konate’s contract situation drags on, Milos Kerkez is still adjusting, and Trent Alexander Arnold’s move to Real Madrid has left a hole that has not been filled. Dominik Szoboszlai has even been forced to play right back at times, weakening the midfield further.\n\nUp front things are not much better. Mohamed Salah looks far from the player who finished fourth in the last Ballon d’Or voting, Alexander Isak has not yet clicked, Hugo Ekitike is still finding his rhythm, and Florian Wirtz is taking time to adapt to English football. The result is a title defence that already looks finished unless something dramatic changes.\n\nEurope has offered some relief and Liverpool arrive in good shape in the Champions League with three wins from four. PSV will still view this as a rare chance to take something at Anfield. They are unbeaten in 11 games across all competitions and although their European results are mixed, they have scored nine and conceded seven in their first four matches. Their high risk style under Peter Bosz means they almost always create chances, but they also allow plenty.\n\nThe Dutch champions claimed two away 1-1 draws at Bayer Leverkusen and Olympiacos after losing their opener, while a convincing 6-2 win over Napoli showed their attacking threat. They sit 18th in the league phase table but remain vulnerable to slipping down with several teams close behind.\n\nPSV’s record away to English clubs is poor, but given Liverpool’s current frailties this feels like one of their best openings in years. The matchup points strongly toward both sides finding the net. Liverpool concede in almost every game right now and PSV’s front line is playing with confidence, while the Dutch side’s open approach usually leaves space for the opponent.\n\nAt the same time it is unlikely to become a complete shootout. Liverpool’s attack is struggling for fluency and PSV tend to play more controlled football in big European away games. Their recent scores suggest something in the range of 1-1, 2-1 or 2-2 is far more realistic than anything approaching six total goals.\n\nThat makes BTTS and Under 5.5 goals a strong angle for this contest.",

The line we set for the Kazakhstan women's team looked in danger just 25 minutes into the match after they'd conceded twice, but they actually managed to hold on without shipping the third. It's not a full win as they did concede two without reply, but it does mean we still make some profit off the match, and I'll absolutely take that after the rough start. Onwards and upwards* 🫡\n\n**Event:** UCL Olympiacos v Real Madrid, 3:00 pm EST\n\n**POTD:** Real Madrid ML -156, 3.5 units\n\n**Write Up:** Taking a break from all the underdog madness, I'm going for something that should *(at least in theory)* be a pretty safe bet. Yes, Real Madrid doesn't look too good at the moment, but I back them to get it done against a weaker side in Olympiacos. The poor results that Madrid has seen in the last three games have come **against an inspired Liverpool, a bogey team in Rayo Vallecano whom Real Madrid hasn't beaten at their ground in over three years, and Elche, who are known for harnessing a high intensity, high possession gameplay** (they're the team with the 3rd highest posession average per LaLiga game, right after Barcelona and Real Madrid) - *I had predicted the Elche draw in the SoccerBetting sub, I'm not someone who just blindly backs the favorites*. Anyway, this has resulted in a **pretty tasty ML for Real Madrid** (-156 or @ 1.64), which is imo, **slightly** **inflated**. Tonight's UCL match is a **redemption arc for Madrid**, and they'll be looking to kill Olympiacos nice and early, and I fully back them to do it with 3.5 units staked. The match holds **extra importance** to les Merengues, as a win would give them a **fighting chance of securing a top 8 finish**, ahead of some tougher matchups. It's not going to be an easy match by any stretch of the imagination, but one that Real Madrid is very capable of winning - the **quality is just there**.

In addition, they have a fast-paced gameplay style. So, I expect them to miss alot and alot more rebound opportunities.  \nIn NBA, I am more comfortable taking rebound prop when player usage is at its peak. Without RJ Barrett, Scottie will be the key player for the team and hence, have more rebound opportunities along with the usage. Very small sample size, but in the last game, he had 38 minutes against the Cavaliers and 11 rebounds, so the line 7.5 feels very safe. I personally expect him to double double but that's just me.

With a strong matchup and a reliable hit rate, this is a spot where KAT should be able to get at least 3 dimes.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tg2bv1rg2l3g1.png?width=716&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e0c8e19f06fd5a3ce0d4a0f3c8eadbbf7ff2d77\n\nLets see if we can make a good start --- Good luck!",

For the weekend, they managed to beat Dijon at home 85-80, a bottom team with 0-5 score, so not much of a success. Of course, the win is the only thing that matters there, but it shows that this team was not selected well, and they are probably the worst team in the Euroleague at this point.",

But they do beat Raptors in these categories; 3rd in Field Goals attempted, so when they are landing they are winning. 3rd in Freethrows Attempted, averages almost 2 more than Raptors. Almost 2 more offensive rebounds per game, so that’s 2 more opportunities for up to 6  more ppg. They are going to turn this around, also added another good 3 point shooter Garrison Matthews.

Under Thomas Frank, they often switch into a more direct, transitional style when away, inviting pressure but aiming to draw fouls and win corners rather than dominate possession.\n\n\\- Statistically, Tottenham are among the league’s leaders in corners per game this season, averaging well over five per match. Their aerial presence — especially via van de Ven — means opponents must be alert, and that often forces fouls or clearances under pressure, creating corner opportunities. Tactically, Frank’s set-up uses a mix of inswingers, late runs, and second-phase attacking from corners, designed precisely to exploit defensive hesitation.\n\n\\- Given the likely tactical shape: a compact, defensively solid PSG, Spurs will probably absorb pressure, win multiple set plays, and use those to relieve stress — making the over 3.5 corners bet very logical under those match conditions.",

Kylian is almost inevitable in front of goal—his pace forces defenders to panic, his first touch creates separation instantly, and his finishing is cold, clinical, and effortless. Give him even half a yard and he’ll turn it into a highlight. He glides past defenders like they’re training cones and strikes with the kind of confidence only the elite have. On a big night, when the lights are bright and the pressure’s highest, Mbappé doesn’t just show up—he takes over. Tomorrow should be no different.",

Both teams are missing players. Bayern have been absolutely incredible this season, putting together a European record of 16 straight wins before drawing with Union Berlin, and they just thrashed Freiburg 6-2 last weekend after going 2-0 down, showing they have the mental strength and firepower to come back from any situation. Vincent Kompany's side are top of the Champions League with 12 points from 4 matches and have won 17 of their 18 games in all competitions this season, making them one of the most dominant teams in European football right now. Harry Kane has been lethal with 5 goals in just 4 Champions League games and continues to terrorize defenses, and even without Luis Diaz who is suspended for three matches after his red card against PSG, Bayern still have world-class attacking options in Michael Olise, Serge Gnabry, and the rising star Lennart Karl.\n\nArsenal will be without their main center-back Gabriel Magalhaes who suffered a thigh injury on international duty with Brazil and will be out for weeks, which is a massive blow because he has been the leader of their defensive line that has only conceded 5 Premier League goals all season. The historical record between these two clubs heavily favors Bayern, who have won 8 of the 14 meetings against Arsenal compared to just 3 Arsenal wins, and the Germans have scored 30 goals past Arsenal in those 14 matches including the infamous 10-2 aggregate thrashing in 2017. Arsenal have not beaten Bayern in their last 5 Champions League encounters, with the visitors winning three of those games by a 5-1 scoreline, memories that still haunt Arsenal fans and give Bayern a huge psychological edge. \n\nIf you found these picks helpful, tips or donations are greatly appreciated as they support the time and effort I put into creating them: [buy me a beer🍻](https://buymeacoffee.com/hercules.son.of.zeus)",

Bayern have also seen some high scoring games, despite not hitting this line not as often - they've lost 0-3 twice vs Brugge and PSG, good chances for them in the PSG game, and Brugge are just too good with no goals allowed so far.

Both teams are also desperate for points as after 4 games they are near the bottom of the table.",

Enzo looked the best player on the pitch, with two disallowed goals in the 1st half, both disallowed due to questionable offsides calls (on his teammates). But, he comes through for us late in the match with a SOT, after passing up an easy goal opp for an assist. This is why I like to back players that work hard, because they can hit at any point in the match and never give up. 3rd time Enzo has cashed us at plus money, gotta love our guy!\n\nToday we head back north to Liverpool as the reigning EPL champions host the 1st place Dutch side PSV Eindhoven. Liverpool are on a major downturn after losing 3-0 to Nottingham Forest over the weekend. I think Liverpool will recognize they won't win the premier league this year and will focus on winning Champions League, which looks to be fairly open for the taking. A win here puts them level in points with 1st place in the UCL. \n\nIf you guys have read/tailed my picks, you'll know I don't play picks much under even money. I'm not about low odds, high win percentage. **I'm about data, trends, and perceived value.** I will also see occasional value way above plus money that I can't pass up. That's where we are at today. Van Dijk is a center back for Liverpool, not your typical shot taker. That said, I've noticed an interesting trend. Van Dijk has cleared this line in 3 of 4 UCL matches this year, playing all 90 minutes in every match and scoring 2 goals in the process. The odds are too tempting to pass up. Yes he hasn't shot a ton in EPL fixtures, yes he's a defender, but this is a different league with squad rotations and different points to play for. \n\nOur play here is really corners (and set pieces), as most of Van Dijk's shots come from headers off corner kicks. PSV play an attack heavy style which favors this, as I expect the pitch to be stretched and a lot of set plays. They conceded an average of 6.5 corners per match, but usually 7-8 against better sides. Vegas is also expecting 7+ corners, and I like the chances of one of the 7+ corners landing on their top target van Dijk.\n\nVan Dijk is also Dutch, playing against a Dutch team, comprised of mostly Dutch players. There will be a bit of ego/pride in play here, as van Dijk knows many of these players on PSV and will want to show out. Van Dijk is the Netherlands team captain after all, on top of being the captain for Liverpool.\n\n**Mind your units here**, the play is +255 for a reason. But I like the value, BOL if tailing and as always feel free to fade. Have a great Wednesday!",

Inter Milan is sitting in a great position in the CL table, Atletico needs to start bringing their form into the CL and I believe Simeone will have his team ready. Therefore, I believe both teams to be good enough to be dangerous however they both won’t take outrageous risks. Therefore, I expect each to score but this not to be a high scoring affair. This is subject to change based on starting lineup announcement. \n\nBOL!\n\nEdit: Lineup announced. Don’t love seeing Thuram on the bench, otherwise I like what I see. Let it ride!",

But I can actually remember it very well now that I'm writing about it again.\n\nA very cruel loss here , the away side and under dogs Schalke raced to a 2-0 lead in the first 14 minutes.\n\nThey then sat back and defended for most of the game and despite scoring 3 times , all 3 goals for Hannover got overturned by Var, so many chances and goals ruled out I'm still pissed about this pick 2 months later 😂\n\n\n\nToday's pick:\n \nUefa Champions League:\n\nPSG Vs Tottenham \n\n**PSG win and over 2.5 goals \n\n(1.80) 2 units **\n\nDefending champions PSG host a Tottenham side who started the season well but the wheels have started to come off badly for them.\n\nThe sides met at the start of the season for Super Cup, which ended 2-2 , the PSG squad had just played the club world cup 3 weeks before this and the players had just come back from their summer break, with no training or match fitness they still almost won this.\n\nPSG come into this game with 3 wins from 4 champions League games, **scoring 14 goals conceding 5**, they are outrageously stacked in attack so even with injuries to Dembele and Doue, Kvaratskhelia should start coming back from an injury, and Barcola and Ramos look good as has midfielder Joao Neves who's scored 6 goals in his last 5 matches in all competitions.\n\nFor Tottenham they started the season well, but have just **1 win in their last 5 matches** , it's not just the fact they've not been winning it's how they've been getting dominated alot of matches, Dominated against Arsenal in a 4-1 loss, dominated at home to Chelsea where they lost 1-0 but Chelsea managed 3.67 XG. Away matches against Leeds who managed 16 shots and 1.6xg, Everton managed 1.78 xg against them Leeds and Everton both teams without a good striker between them.\n\nLeeds and Everton didn't punish Tottenham despite playing well and creating a ton of chances they both lack great attacking players,but a team as good as PSG really should score at the very least 2 goals here.\n\nTottenham will get chances though, and do usually find a way to score.\nSince Hakimi's injury at right back , midfielder Zaire-Emery has been filling in and although he's an incredible midfield he's out of position here only 19 years old, they have conceded a lot more shots in the 2 games he's played out of position whether that's a coincidence or not.\n\nAs long as PSG can break Tottenham down reasonably early I can't see why they don't win this and the match has at least 3 goals here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBOL and only bet what you can afford to lose!",

First meeting between these two teams this season, the total was set at 49 and the game finished 21-19. Second meeting was a high scoring game however the score was 23-14 after 3 quarters before a 28 point burst in the 4th and OT. Highly doubt that type of outburst will be replicated today in a playoff setting. Seahawks have #1 scoring defense in the league and held Stafford to less than 150 yards already this season. The Rams defense has caused trouble for Sam Darnold as well, having thrown 4 interceptions against them earlier this year. All in all, I believe this line is inflated due to the 75 point game these two teams played in week 17. I expect a low scoring game here so I’m playing under 47.5 points. ***purposely taking u47.5 alternate number bc 47 is a KEY number in NFL totals***\n\n👇\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e46oxa7wyifg1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2da16cd77387466b559796b587c02797b377e193",

Phantom (4-2) face off against Rose (3-3) who have lost their last 3 matches despite Kahleah Copper returning from injury. This Phantom side plays well on both sides of the ball and I don't see this being an easy matchup for Rose. Taking the plus money in a close game. BOL",

It's a fantastic team featuring some of the best defensive performances we have seen over the last 15 years in the EPL and perhaps unprecedented squad depth.  \nIt is hard to bet against them however humour me:\n\n* **Arsenal's offence is not ticking in the EPL**. Specifically this team is not great (or even above average) with attacking low blocks, not even at home. The last opponent Arsenal has beaten with +2 goal differential in the EPL - except the cathartic display against Villa at home which will be regarded as the statement/signature victory against the boogie opponent when the story is told of this championship run  -  is Brentford in R14.\n* **Manchester United has underperformed this season according to the xG metrics**.  This team is actually above Arsenal in the total xG created this EPL season (according to Fotmob) !  Bruno Fernandes is creating chances left and right and of course they are especially deadly on the counter as we saw perfectly well against City.\n   * Man Utd defence was leaky all season against bad teams (**where they cannot set up in low block and wait**) and together with their bad execution in front of goal it created an underwhelming season for them to date, leading to the sack of Amorim. **However given all that, Man Utd is still \\~top 5 in the rankings.**\n* **Manchester United scored in 11 straight games. Furthermore they scored in 18 of last 19 games,** they only failed to score in that aberration of a match against Everton where Everton got the red card and outjerked them somehow. They are scoring against bad teams, they are scoring against good teams. The fact is, this is a good attacking team and they will even get better when luck turn and they start putting away the chances.\n   * Given United scores, Arsenal needs 3 goals to beat +1 handicap goal line. I don't see this happening at the moment.",

I think Stidham will struggle to put up points against the Pats D and Drake “Drake Maye” Maye will do enough to get the Pats to the Super Bowl. JSN was over this number in 16/17 regular season games and went for 105 and 96 in two games against the Rams. The Niners locked him up in the last game and I think he bounces back big in this one.

Wofford trailed by seven at the break, then led by 10 with four minutes to go in regulation, then held on for a 70-67 win and sweet, sweet cash in my first plus-money POTD. That's four wins in a row.... I've got a crippling ice storm bearing down on me. Let's see if my picks stay hot.*\n\nFirst prediction: this could be sweaty as hell. Second prediction: Southern Illinois will use this as a get-right game. The Salukis (8-12) have been slip sliding away with four consecutive losses, although three have come by six points or fewer. The one that wasn't? A 70-57 road loss at Illinois-Chicago. And if we're comparing common opponents, UIC beat Evansville by 27 on Jan. 20. As I write this, Southern Illinois' moneyline is -162. They are 5-1 straight up when favored by -160 or higher, suggesting that they generally take care of business when they're the better team on paper - even in this lost season. Southern Illinois is also a respectable 4-5 against the spread on the road, and this is an incredibly favorable road game. Evansville (5-15) is just 3-7 at home with wins over storied programs like Calumet College, Oakland City College, and Ball State.\n\nThe Purple Aces are bad. Real bad. They're 1-9 over the last 10 games. The lone win came against an Indiana State team that shot 17 percent from beyond the arc, 39 percent from the field, and still only lost by 3. Otherwise, Evansville simply cannot put the ball through the basket, and they don't get second chances or fast breaks. They are 338th in scoring average, and it's not like they play slow. KenPom ranks Evansville's adjusted tempo 145th. The shooting is just not there. Evansville is 324th from the field (42.1 percent), 326th from beyond the arc (30.8 percent), 293rd in rebounding, 324th in offensive rebounding, 302nd in steals, and 338th in turnovers. In short, the shots don't fall and there are no second chances off the glass or easy chances off the break. It's no wonder they've won five games all year.\n\nMeanwhile, KenPom ranks Southern Illinois higher in overall strength (136 to 287), offensive rating (226 to 334), and defensive rating (75 to 180). If home teams generally get 3-4 points, then this line indicates two even sides. But the numbers don't tell it. Southern Illinois will push the ball. Their adjusted tempo is 79th in the nation. They will likely shoot better (46.3 percent - 197 spots better than Evansville). They rebound better (54th in NCAA). They create possessions (85th in steals), which translates to being the number one fast-break team in the Missouri Valley Conference. How is this a one possession game?\n\nDevil's Advocate: there is some injury concern for Southern Illinois. Guards Isaiah Stafford and Quel'Ron House are both listed as questionable for today’s game. House is the Salukis' leading scorer at 13.7 ppg. He played 35 minutes in a 3-point loss to Drake on Jan. 14, but has missed the previous two games. Despite his absence, Southern Illinois played 18-win Belmont within five points on Jan. 17 thanks to 20-point games by Jalen Haynes and Drew Steffe. Southern Illinois has depth and spreads the wealth on offense. They've got seven players - other than House - that are averaging seven points or more. If House plays, it just bolsters my thesis that the better team can cover one possession against a dog water team. When it comes down to it, Southern Illinois has had a poor season, but their losses look better, and the statistical averages lean their way in almost every metric. Evansville *does* shoot the 3 better, but that's about all they do better. I'll highlight rebounding for a moment. Southern Illinois is third in the MVC in rebounding while Evansville is dead last. I think SIU will clean up misses and transition quickly against a team that ranks near the bottom of the MVC in allowing points in the paint.\n\nLooking at historical data, Southern Illinois is 7-3 over its last 10 games at Evansville, including six wins in a row. The winning margins in those six games: 9, 12, 27, 2, 4 (OT), 7. Better yet, Southern Illinois has covered the spread in five of its last six games played at the Ford Center, including the previous three. The last time Evansville covered was 2018. This season, Evansville is 3-5 ATS at home. They covered their last game out, but failed the previous three games. My thesis is simple: Southern Illinois is limping into a get-right game. They've done well against good teams - and even beat MVC-leading Belmont back on Jan. 4. If House plays, I see Southern Illinois feasting against an Evansville team that cannot score and *will* get outrebounded.\n\nGood luck and Godspeed!\n\nIf I've made you a few bucks through fades, it's just gonna ask you a few questions: https://buymeacoffee.com/seventh__place",

She should out play her counterpart, Demmans, which is a big advantage for Team Reese-Hansen. Campbell herself had an awful game last night, missing almost every raise/take out that she attempted. The Saskatchewan rink doesn't have a chance to keep this one close if she looks anything like she did last night. Team Reese-Hansen are 31-6 this year against teams outside the world top 25.

Tkachuk has hit that line in 2 of his last 3 games ever since he came back from injury and you can see he's getting back to his dominant form. He's still looking for his first goal and if you watched yesterday's game, he's clearly trying to get the monkey off his back. What makes me confident about this pick though is that Tkachuk literally dominates when he plays against Chicago. 10 of his last 12 games vs the Blackhawks went over the 2.5 line easily. If you look at those games, he had 5+ shots in more than half of them. \n\nBlackhawks are 5th worst in the league in shots allowed this season and in their last 10 games vs the Panthers they allowed **37 shots on goal on average!!** Panthers did play yesterday but Tkachuk only played 3 games this season so there shouldn't be too much fatigue from him.\n\nBOL or fade me to oblivion!",

      "text": "Record 9-3 \n\n**POTD: Chet Holmgreen over 9.5 rebounds**\n\nThe raptors currently are short handed of a center, Jakob Poetl being out has actually been a huge huge blow for them due to the fact they don't have a traditional center aka a 7 footer. While Sando and Collin have been doing a very good job on the glass there is only so much you can do at 6,9 and 6,7. \n\nThis is evident with them losing a lot of games where centers flourish because of this whether it be from offensive rebounding or due to a pure mis match. Here is some evidence to prove this, Donavon Clingan 13 points 16 rebounds and 8 being offensive rebounds, also the first quarter he had 7 rebounds. Dylan Cardwell third string center but 6,11 had 25 minutes and 7 offensive boards and ended on 13 rebounds. Quenten Post had a fair few offensive boards as well, however his role is to mainly box out and raptors scored majority of the points, Ayton yes this soft ass got 13 boards and 25 points. Zubac had 16 points and 14 rebounds as well.\n\nNow why do I like this spot? Because OKC is already so shorthanded Chet Holmgreen will get minutes regardless of his performance furthermore he is a key piece on defence and offence. I think 10 rebounds is very fair, assuming he is active on the glass and hustling.",

Both teams are likely to be playing super tight, physical defense. There's less room for easy baskets because the coaches have their players focused on shutting down the other side.\n\nLooking at Game 1: The first game of the series actually ended with a total of only 187 points. That's significantly under the 195.5 mark. That game showed just how defensive this matchup can be when both sides bring their A-game.\n\nSlowing the Game Down: This isn't just about fast breaks and shooting threes. The coaches are likely to play a more tactical game, using up the shot clock and trying to engineer perfect shots. A slower pace naturally means fewer total points get scored.\n\nThe Coaches' Comments: Even the coaches are emphasizing defense. After San Miguel won Game 2, their coach pointed out that their defense was the main reason they took the win. When defense is the main topic in press conferences, you know it's going to be a key part of their strategy going forward.",

However, Arsenal is not as pathetic as what City are at the moment and should be able to keep hold of the ball better than what CIty did and get into better shooting positions than what City could. \n\nRice also has a decent record against United despite failing to have any  of his three attempts on target when he played them in the season opener, before that he had: *1(Goal), 2(As a sub), 0 (But had two attempts + an assist in this game), 1, 1 (Scored).* ",

Drake Maye has been having a sensational year in his sophomore campaign. He has thrown for over 4800 yards this season with an extremely efficient completion percentage over 70 percent, he has thrown for 35 touchdowns on just 10 interceptions and he is averaging 9 yards per attempt. This Patriots offense ranks much higher than the Broncos offense as they are 4th in the NFL in passing yards per game, while the Broncos are in 17th place, this New England rushing attack is solid ranking 6th in rushing yards per game while the Broncos rank in 16th place and they are in second place in points scored per game tallying 29 points per game while the Broncos are in 14th place scoring 23 points per game. My key factor in this one is how the Denver Broncos will be without their starting quarterback Bo Nix as he broke his ankle in end of the Bills game so they will be going with backup quarterback Jarrett Stidham. Stidham hasnt thrown a pass in the regular season since the 2023 season and in that 2023 season he did not have impressive numbers so I think it will be hard for him to get up to game speed against a very good Patriots defense. This Patriots defense that he is going up against is a very strong defense as they rank 6th in rushing yards allowed per game, 9th in passing yards allowed per game and 4th in points allowed per game as they only allow 18 points per game. They have been red hot in the playoffs so far as they only allowed 3 points to the Chargers in the wild card round and they made CJ Stroud look like an XFL quarterback in the divisional round as they picked him off four times in the first half of the game so I expect them to make things tough on Stidham in this one. With all of this in mind I like the Patriots to take this one by more than a field goal.\n\nPrediction: 26-14 Patriots\n\nLast pick:🏈🏀Incarnate Word ML/Indiana -2💩East Texas A&M couldnt miss today and Incarnate Word played their worst game of the year and drops their first game at home.\n\nBest of luck to everyone tailing and remember to bet responsibly!

Leading 1-0 until the 88th minute and then conceding two in sixty seconds is the kind of stuff that makes you want to retire from betting. But we don't tilt, we find value.\n\nToday I’m going with Brentford at home against Nottingham Forest. The math here is simple: if you look at the home-only table, Brentford is the 4th best team in the league. They’ve turned their stadium into a total fortress (7-3-1 record this season).\n\nOn the other side, you have a Forest team under Sean Dyche that’s hovering just above the relegation zone. They’ll probably try to park the bus, but Brentford’s high press and set-piece efficiency are built to break down exactly this kind of opponent. Even without their old stars, the system Andrews has in place is top-tier. Getting nearly evens (1.90) for a top-4 home side against the 17th in the league is a gift from the bookies. 3 units to get us back to green.\n\nTips are welcome :)\nhttps://buymeacoffee.com/francocarde123\n\nBOL!!!!",

The Broncos defense has been one of the best in the league, yet it isn’t talked about enough how their secondary gets absolutely torched whenever they play against an elite QB. Considering Patriots QB Drake Maye is the reincarnation of Tom Brady, yeah I would say he’s an elite QB. The Broncos love playing 1on1 coverages considering their large amount of talent, but this has made them quite susceptible to the deep ball. The Patriots never truly have an alpha receiver for a game, which helps us here as Broncos CB Pat Surtain’s role of locking down the alpha WR doesn’t really matter here - any Pats receiver can catch the deep ball. Oh, and I forgot to mention that Drake Maye has statistically been the best deep ball thrower in the league this year. He’ll launch one for 36 or more yards in this one.\n\nRemember to only bet what you can afford to lose, and BOL!",

Feyenoord regularly score multiple goals against Heracles, and while Heracles often lose these matches, they have still managed to find the net in several recent meetings. The overall trend points toward games comfortably reaching three or more goals.\n\nFrom a recent and season-long form perspective, Feyenoord remain one of the Eredivisie’s most aggressive attacking teams, particularly at home. They maintain a high tempo even when leading, which keeps matches open and totals elevated. Defensively, they can allow chances, especially against teams that counter quickly.\n\nHeracles continue to struggle defensively, especially away from home, but they do create scoring opportunities and rarely sit back once they concede. Their matches often become stretched, increasing the likelihood of goals at both ends.\n\nThere are no significant weather concerns expected, and no major attacking absences reported that would materially reduce goal expectation.\n\nOverall, this matchup profiles as a Feyenoord-controlled game with enough attacking intent and defensive vulnerability on both sides to support BTTS and over 2.5 goals as a logical, data-backed play.\n\nBOL if tailing",

If you think it is business, think again. The books have way more of an edge than you will ever have and will win in the long run.  Have some fun, and don't be foolish please.",

Toulon at home is a scoring machine, averaging around 39 points per game at Stade Mayol, with recent blowouts like 62-22 against Bayonne and 45-34 vs Bath showing their attacking firepower. Montpellier's away defense is leaky as hell, conceding big in road games, and their own attack can keep up, leading to high totals. Looking at H2H, Toulon's last home thrashing of Montpellier was 54-7, easily clearing 53.5 with room to spare. Both squads are mid-table scrappers without a lockdown mentality, so expect open, running rugby rather than a grind. January weather in Toulon is typically mild and dry, perfect for fast-paced play without mud slowing things down. Key stars like Toulon's backline are reported fit, boosting their try-scoring potential. The line feels soft for these two—Top 14 games often explode when favorites like Toulon push the tempo. My real take: This has all the makings of a 35-25 type scoreline, and the value at 1.86 is too good to pass up. **If you're skeptical i always recommend picking the live over if the game starts slow and the line drops down.

It seemed like most people got their bets voided, which is why I am tracking it as a push for my record. However, feel free to let me know if your bet was resolved as a loss, or you think I should track it differently. I would rather have a record that underestimates my success than one that overstimates it. \n\n Thiago Seyboth Wild is no stranger to the big stage, having broken out with a shocking five-set win over Daniil Medvedev at Roland Garros 2023 and beaten top 30 players like Taylor Fritz, Lorenzo Musetti, and Karen Khachanov. A string of poor results in 2025 saw him pushed out of ATP events and into obscurity on the Challenger Tour, so he will now look to rebound in 2026 and get closer to his peak ranking of No. 58 in the world. A title here in Itajai, where he has the home crowd behind his back, seems like the perfect way to kick off that rebound. Seyboth Wild is yet to drop a set in this tournament, spending just 5 hours, 48 minutes on court (compared to Vallejo's 6 hours, 35 minutes). He also has earned a strong average performance rating in his matches (7.47 vs 7.05). This trend continues even when adjusting for # of points played in each match (7.46 vs 7.00). Seyboth Wild also has a higher average rating in 3 of 4 categories (serve, forehand, backhand), while Vallejo narrowly edges him on return. This is despite Seyboth Wild only making 54.1% first serves (62.3% avg), while Vallejo has made 58.0% (64.2% avg). Seyboth Wild has played 6 (5 singles + 1 doubles) on Center Court, while this match will take place, while Vallejo has played 3. I expect Thiago's aggressive game to be firing from the start, and while Vallejo has enjoyed quite strong form on the Challenger Tour as of late, these feel like the conditions for Seyboth Wild to capitalize. The weather conditions are expected to be hot and humid, but pretty standard for this location, and I wouldn't expect that to have a huge effect on the match. The main reason I'm going for Seyboth Wild 2-0 instead of his ML is that both of these players are big hitters, and this feels like a match where one of them builds confidence early and takes over. Of course, I think that player is more likely to be TSW, and I also felt like he looked a bit better in the defense and touch departments in the semifinals. I also would trust Seyboth Wild's fitness and focus a bit less in a tight third set, and so I'd rather buy into the outcomes where he dominates at a much better price.",

This will also be a complete home field takeover, given that the rams don’t really have that many fans, and it’s of course in Seattle. Puka was extremely limited last week against a mediocre Bears defense. I expect Seattle to at least slow him down just enough to win this football game.

Brentford currently sit 8th and Forest in 17th, Nottingham have the quality to score just not seeing results currently, as for Brentford they are in good form consistently finding goals with Thiago upfront being a huge contributor to this. I expect Forest to be wanting to stay clear of the relegation zone and want to put up a fight against a mid-table team.

Yeah, I feel much more confident in Oviedo's ability to keep the scoreline respectable. This team, while being rock bottom doesn't really ship a lot of goals, and here's a fun stat for you: **50% of their games from Nov 3rd til Jan 4th ended 0-0 (4 out of 8 games played).** Crazy run. The earlier match between Barca and Oviedo this season also ended 3-1, and I think they're going to hold on strong again. Expecting a Barcelona win, but not by more than a goal, and I can even see Oviedo snatching a point off the overconfident Catalans.

In last week’s win against Buffalo, Denver became 12-2 in 1 score games this season. However, QB Bo Nix fractured his ankle ending his season. He will be replaced by backup Jarrett Stidham, who will be playing in his first game this season. He will be come just the 7th QB to start in the playoffs after not starting in the regular season, with the previous 6 having just a 1-5 record. Stidham has just 4 starts in his NFL career with just a 1-3 record. In his career, Stidham has a 4.1% interception rate on 197 passes. That ranks 90th/102 QB’s whove thrown 150+ passes Stidham entered the NFL. But he’s even worse when pressured, completing just 40% of his passes for 5.8 yards per pass & a 20.5% sack rate opposed to 70.7% of his passes for 8.1 yards per pass when not pressured. Now he faces a scary Patriots DLine that has a 52.1% pressure rate so far this playoffs, after a 40.3% pressure rate this year (7th but injured & now healthy). The Pats D has allowed just 6.4 yards per pass (6th) this year, but in the playoffs vs Justin Herbert & CJ Stroud they have only allowed 4.8 yards per pass & a 50% completion rate. A huge part of that is they just got back a healthy Christian Gonzale who is one of the best DB’s in the league. With Gonzalez on the field, the Pats D has allowed just an 83.4 QB rating, a 62.8% completion %, 6.0 yards per pass, & a 4.1% TD rate. With him off the field, those #s move to a 100.2 QB rating, a 69.9% completion %, 7.8 yards per pass, & a 4.9% TD rate. Stidham will have his hands full vs this defense. But even with Nix Denver’s offense ranked just 16th in points per drive (2.09) & 19th in success rate (41.5%) & punted as much as any team in the league. They punted on 39.3% of possessions (28th), failing to get a 1st down on 38.3% of them (29th). The Pats D has allowed just 1.67 points per drive (3rd) & has given up points on 30.8% of opponent possessions (3rd). This playoffs they have allowed just 1 TD on 24 possessions. The Pats are going to want to play a slow tempo game, not make any mistakes, & run the ball. Especially with the defensive minded Head Coach in Mike Vrabel.\n\nPats QB Drake Maye has been sacked 10 times for a brutal 13.9% sack rate, fumbling 6 times this playoffs. Maye’s 57 sacks this season is the 2nd most in the NFL. The Broncos are 3rd in the NFL in pressure rate (41.8%) & lead the NFL in sack rate (10.1%). With the Pats having a defense that is scorching hot facing a backup QB & Maye struggling with pressure & fumbles, the conservative defensive coach in Vrabel is going to want to put the ball on the ground. Especially with a in RB Rhamondre Stevenson who is playing the best football of his career right now. __Stevenson just became the FIRST player in the Super Bowl Era, over ANY 6 game span, to have 400+ rushing yards, +7.0 yards per carry, 4 rushing TD’s, 200+ receiving yards, +11.0 yards per catch, & 2 receiving TD’s. Since Week 16 he’s gone for 402 rush yards, 4 TDs, & a league-best +194 rush yards over expected. He’s has 11 explosive runs in that span, more than he had through the first 15 weeks. This led him to rank 5th in the NFL in Explosive Run % (6.9%).__ But things have flipped in the postseason. Stevenson has 26 carries for 123 yards (4.7 yards/carry), & 7 catches for 86 yards. While Henderson has just 21 carries for 52 yards (2.5 ypc), 2 catches for 7 yards. Last week vs the Texans who have one of the best run defenses in the NFL, Stevenson had 16 carries & played 40 snaps compared to Henderson’s 25, & that includes an entire quarter where Stevenson was out with an eye injury. Stevenson has been much harder to bring down as well. He has the most missed tackles forced in the playoffs (10). In the regular season Stevenson averaged 2.75 yards after contact per run (5th among RB’s) compared to Henderson’s 1.91 (42nd among RB’s ). Stevenson also averaged 0.23 missed tackles forced per run (5th) compared to Henderson’s 0.13 (33rd). In the receiving game, Stevenson is clearly the preferred option. Henderson only has 3 TOTAL catches in his past 5 games & is a poor pass blocker. Stevenson has gone 7 straight games with at least 2 catches & is one of the best pass blocking backs in the NFL. Stevenson has out touched Henderson 33-23 this postseason & that number will shift even more vs a tough Broncos defense that has allowed 4.5 yards/play (2nd), & 1.68 points per drive (4th), & has a 62.9% success rate (2nd). However, on the ground the numbers for Denver have actually been pretty poor towards the end of the season. Denver ranked 6th in the NFL EPA/rush allowed through Week 10. But they fell to 15th in that same metric in the background half of the year. Since Week 12 they are allowing the 12th most yards/carry (4.51), & are rank in the bottom 10 of explosive rush rates & success rates allowed. They just gave up 117 yards on 24 carries to James Cook on the Bills last week. __The Broncos have been particularly poor against man & gap rushing concepts, ranking bottom 10 in both ypc (4.51) & success rate. Since Week 12 they’ve given up 5.3 ypc to runs specifically between the tackles, 3rd worst in the NFL. New England runs these concepts at the 3rd highest rate in the NFL. Stevenson ranks #1 in the NFL in rushing yards over expected on runs between the tackles. Stevenson on man/gap runs (Last 7 Games): 62.8% Success Rate, 6.95 YPC, 4 TDs. All rank #1 in the NFL.__ The Broncos allowed 50+ yards to James Cook (117 yards), Travis Etienne (50 yards), & Josh Jacobs (73 yards), all of which are elite gap runners. Vrabel is going to attack this weakness.\n\nStevenson has hit 50+ rushing yards in 5 of his last 6 games, & with a rushing attempt line at 12.5 (also love the over on that), you can count on him to average at least 4+ yards per carry. The only way the Patriots lose this game is by turning the ball over. With Maye having 6 fumbles in 2 playoff games & now facing the pass rush in the league, Vrabel is going to have to run the ball to slow this defense down. Especially as the Broncos defense’s weak spot is on the ground in the gaps. I think Rhamondre eats here.\n\n__Rhamondre Stevenson o49.5 rushing yards__\n\nAppreciate the love!

Feels like the safer play and less risk if it’s a tight game.\n\nAtalanta have been in decent form lately… won 3 of their last 4 and only conceded 1 goal in that run. At home they usually control the game and create enough to score more than once.\n\nParma on the other hand struggle a lot going forward. Only 2 goals in their last 4 games, and one of those came when the other team had two red cards. Most games they just sit back and don’t offer much.\n\nThis line covers most scores I’m expecting 2-0, 2-1, 3-0, 3-1 etc.\nOnly real danger is a boring 1-0, but Atalanta usually don’t stop at one goal vs weaker teams, especially at home.\n\nNot trying to overthink it… better team, better form, home game, low scoring opponent. Simple play with decent value.\n\nGood luck to anyone riding with me on this one, hope it lands 🤞\n\nEdit: Atlanta comfartable win 4-0 ✅",

However, for this price? Yes please. Obviously for some safety you can take the games and set handicaps but I just think the straight ML is simply better value. \n\nBublik has been on a tear this year, making his top 10 debut and going 7-0 for the season, clinching the title in Hong Kong with a straight set victory over Musetti. He’s hardly recognisable from the inconsistent player he was just a year ago and his ranking will only increase with little points to defend until the clay season. Major lifestyle as well as playstyle changes have shown a really serious face to Bublik who hasn’t dropped a set so far at the Open, confirming his excellent form. He’s one of the best servers on tour and hits incredibly hard off both wings whilst also having the ability to possess incredible variety in his game to disrupt rhythm. Sascha genuinely has extraordinary talent with all the tools to succeed at the highest level and with both confidence and consistency it can be really hard to find the means of beating him. With how good his serving is I believe that he will have more chances on De Minaur’s return games as opposed to the opposite despite his “just” good return game, as a result of ADM’s “just” good serving. \n\nLet me reiterate that this will be far from a walk in the park but should really be priced closer to a pick’em in my opinion. De Minaur is the No. 6 and whilst he has some incredible qualities about him also comes with limitations. Higher floor than Bublik, lower ceiling. ADM performed well in his opening three rounds but I feel like the first set against Medjedovic (which the Serb won in a tiebreak) will be closest to the level Bublik will bring, Hamad having as usual tired out after a huge hitting set. The demon is arguably the best counterpuncher and mover on tour who loves to grind down opponents with his defensive skills which on paper would frustrate Bublik’s hyper-aggressive game. It produces some insane levels of consistency against worse opponents but the lack of raw power and of an offensive game leads to the Aussie losing almost every time he faces a better opponent, which I believe to be the case on form personally. He’s 0-13 against Sinner whose power overwhelms De Minaur every time they face and this version of Bublik will have a similar effect. Now I’m not comparing Sascha and Sinner per-say as Bublik does fold earlier in rallies but it’s the stylistic comparison that can be made. Whilst ADM may put loads of balls back to force the Kazakh to play an extra shot, often deep, and increase the chance of missing which could very well lead to an error-prone performance from his opponent on a bad day, the sheer speed that Bublik can consistently put on a ball may very well lead to him taking the upper-hand in exchanges on a good one. Based on form, there is no reason to believe he will be in a bad day. Sascha won both their encounters last year, including a battle back from 2-0 down at the French Open on his least favourite surface. This promises to be a big battle on Rod Laver Arena so make sure to get the popcorn out. BOL !",

Genuinely can’t see it not hitting. It’s landed in all of his Big bash games this league apart from one when he finished with 19 not out due to rain ending the game short. Smith’s form at the moment is undeniable. His last 5 matches he’s gotten: 65,37,54,100,19 not out. His only threat in my opinion is Jhye Richardson who should only bowl maximum of two out of the first 4 overs. After having a not so good outting while fielding in the second innings last game, the competitive nature of Smith will be on show in the grand final. \nBest of luck if tailing!",

They are still undefeated in matches but they have had to work for their victories. Domestically they have not been the strongest in the last few years and it's showing. T1 are very beatable.\n\nFearX on the other hand have been one of the biggest surprises of the first two weeks. They are punching way above their weight class, and are finding ways to win despite being behind. Their most recent test did end in an 0-2 defeat, but that match line does not paint the whole picture. They were competitive against Gen.G, the best team in the league, and they should've won at least one game.\n\nBoth teams have some of the slowest average map durations in the league. T1 average 33:02 per game, on Map 1 they average 32:20. FearX average 31:54 per game, on Map 1 they average \\~33:40. T1 are the favourites here but they have naturally slow tendencies; leaning on strong fundamentals and game management. FearX on the other hand try to push the agenda early, targetting botside to get Diable ahead. FearX have a relatively hard time converting early leads so they tend to slow it down until the midgame as well.\n\nThe key here will be the botside. FearX send a lot of attention that way, securing the early game and dragon count. T1 can be a bit psychotic at times, but when they are behind they let the opponents dictate the pace and force them to play perfectly to win the game. If they don't, they will snatch the victory away through sheer will. If FearX can get Diable ahead, and secure a few dragons, the over will be a breeze. Even if T1 get ahead early, FearX have shown they can stay and prolong games. I don't expect either team to get an insane lead early that snowballs out of control. Should be an exciting series.\n\n**Map 1 - Over or Exactly 31:30 Map Duration 2-Way (1.83) 2u to win 1.66u**",

With all the talk about the Seahawks 2 headed running game being slashed down to one, **LA have shown their own two headed attack is leaning one way themselves**.\n\nWe are going to challenge the best run D in the NFL - again. We are going to keep our faith in Kyren - again. I have to say, I’m no expert on line balance, but this number is genuinely 5/6 yards lower than I anticipated it would open at, and it has creeped there. **Personally I will be playing this as high as 75**.\n\nThe seasons work speaks for itself: **65 all purpose yards in ALL BUT ONE game this season. He had 95 on 23 touches last season, 96 on only 13 touches in week 11, and 85 on 26 touches 5 weeks ago**.\n\n*His rushing floor has been 46 yards which is low for this range*, but as I’ve emphasized a few times over the last few weeks he’s naturally become a part of the receiving game. **He’s had over 15+ receiving yards per game & 21 total targets in the last 5 weeks**. If Seattle DO show their run D card, Kyren is still showing himself as an option in Staffords progressions\n\nIf the Rams are winning, they are going to have to run the ball… if the Rams are losing the game, they will need to keep Kyren an option to keep Seattle guessing… basically either way **I can see Kyren easily getting 20+ touches tonight**.\n\nWhich means - once again - We’re going to fade the Corum effect. **He only had 6 touches last week**, and has been shaky in his on ball output when he’s gotten them in recent weeks. Playoff time means teams will rely on what they have faith in - **Blake hasn’t hit the ground running now in a few weeks**, as it feels like his inclusion into the overall game plan depends on how he starts. **As a result has clearly shifted into RB2 territory**. He’s still a threat to us, but it doesn’t feel as direct anymore.\n\nI feel like I’m repeating myself as alot of these details and stats have remained the same as the weeks have gone by. **Kyren has been a huge winner for me this year away from Reddit, to the tune of 91%**, let’s hope we can get one more.\n\nLast play review:\n\n***Fulham/Brighton BTTS (-155) 1.5u*** ✅\n\n(Game went to script essentially, a touch late to get there but it really never was in doubt.

With Wood still out, he's the team's penalty taker and usually the captain. He had a tough game in Europa mid week, while I played his SOT there as well, which cashed in the first 10 minutes, he missed a penalty and wound up with 3 SOTs in a big 0-1 loss. I see him coming back for blood today and taking his shots to make up for the mid week match. \n\nI also like this because Igor Jesus is still questionable, and with limited other options there's a non-zero chance they throw MGW back up front as the striker.

The Patriots are almost back to the Super Bowl. Stevenson has hit this in five straight, and I expect they'll rely on him heavily with Henderson struggling to be productive. The Broncos play a lot of man defense and blitz as much as anyone in the NFL (were leading the league late in the season with this). I expect quick throws and check downs from Maye. I look for the Patriots to capitalize on a mistake or two by the Broncos and jump to an early lead. They won't milk the clock early on, but slow meticulous drives to wear out the defense which favors more running back touches. Denver defense again the run (3.9 yards per carry for runbingbacks) is good, so I don't want to pick just the rushing prop as Stevenson has only gotten than three of the last five.",

Although the last 3 draws were the most recent, I think today Chelsea will break this small draw streak.\n\nBoth teams come into this contest in bad form, but luckily for Chelsea Rosenior fixed this at the right time. Lost just 2-3 against Arsenal and have won his other 3 opening games they come in way better shape than CP who are winless in 10 games.",

      "text": "Record: 11-4\n\n\nLast pick:Lamelo Ball over 6.5 assists, easy win, no sweat \n\n\nEvent: Patriots @ Broncos \n\n\nPick: Treveyon Henderson over 8.5 carries (-130)\n\n\nWrite Up: If this looks familiar, it's because this was my pick a week ago on this exact same total. Same reasoning applies here, only moreso than last week because the Broncos are starting a backup QB. New England will most likely be playing with a lead, so they'll be running the ball at least as often as they usually do. \n\n\nHenderson averages 9.5 carries per game, but in the last 12 that average has jumped to 10.5. He's cleared the 8.5 total in 11 of his last 12!\n\n\nThere was clearly a preference for his counterpart Stevenson last week against Houston, but the Patriots like to run the ball, especially with a lead, so there are plenty of carries for both of them, as we saw last week. Henderson has been the preferred back this year (180 vs 130 carries), but even if those percentages reverse again like last week, NE should be running enough to get Henderson double digit carries again. \n\n\nDenver does have a great run defense, and they allow only the 9th most rushing attempts per game with 24.2. A big part of that is playing with the lead though. In their 3 losses, they allowed 29 carries per game, and I do expect this to be a loss for them. The Denver defense is good, but the Houston defense was better than Denver, and they didn't have any issues falling behind so much that they had to abandon the run. I'm picking carries instead of yards to account for the possibility that NE hands it off many times in a row just to bleed the clock. Those runs are usually for 1 or 2 yards. \n\n\nEven if Stevenson gets most of the carries again (though he's averaging 2.5 fewer carries this year than Henderson), I don't think Henderson has any problems hitting his total again.\n\n\nThe other thing to note is that despite 50 more carries than Stevenson, he has only 1 fumble all year compared to Stevenson's 3. So if it comes time to milk the clock, ball security isn't an issue for Henderson.\n\n\nPatriots most likely win, so they won't be below their run attempts average from playing from behind, and if Henderson gets even a third of those 29 carries, he hits his over. Most importantly of all, again, 11/12 over this line, so I'm comfortable going back to the well. If Houston at full strength couldn't hold back Henderson from getting his carries, neither can Denver with a backup QB. \n\n\n\n\nTreveyon Henderson over 8.5 rushing attempts",

Never lost faith and hope you guys trust the process.\n\n2 winning days in a row too, this weekend is going extremely well. \n\nLet's keep riding this momentum.\n\n**Write Up:**\n\nFor today I am going back to the dutch league once again. It has been good to me so far and giving it some extra attention is the right thing to do and keep the streak alive.\n\nTelstar are 8-2 with o2.5 goals and BTTS at home. 9-1 in BTTS by itself.\n\nIn 10 games they have a record of 1-4-5, scoring 17 goals and conceding 22 times. They attract goals at home and this match will be the same.\n\nAZ Alkmaar away from home are 6-4 with BTTS and o2.5 goals. Only slightly favored for my pick.\n\nIn 10 games AZ Alkmaar has managed a 4-1-5 record. Scoring 14 and conceding 16 times.\n\nEarlier this season the game ended 2-1 in favor of AZ. I can see the same happening today. Chance of more goals is higher than less goals too.\n\nTelstar need every point to avoid relegation whilst AZ are in the race for top 3/4 and football in Europe next season.\n\nThis will be an open game and the streak will continue another day. It has been a very good weekend so far, time to end it on a high note too.\n\nFade or tail, BOL!",

Any time Seattle is at Lumen, that gives them a small advantage, aka the 12th man - I feel like we don’t need to go into a lot of detail here about these two things: Seahawks defense & Rams offense - Seahawks have one of the best defenses in the league, while the Rams have one of the best offensives in the league - This Seahawks offense is ranked 3rd in PPG while the Rams give up an average of 20.2 PPG - Seahawks D is #1 in the NFL in PPG on defense, while the Rams are #1 on offense for PPG - Unlike the 49ers vs Seahawks game, I don’t think Seattle’s D will be able to perform as good as they did against the 49ers here, where they themselves won Seattle that game - Between Mcvay, Stafford, Puka, and Adams, I see the Rams getting there’s regardless - but Seattle slows them down just enough - The one downside to this bet, is our man Sam Darnold - part of sits here and thinks about his playoff performances and how you can’t trust him, and the other part of me is thinking, well you have to give him the flowers where they are due, he has had a good year - Even if Seattle turns the ball over 1-3 times, their defense should still be able to limit the Rams offensive output - The stats and data point to a close matchup here, my gut tells me this comes down to a FG - again, if you cannot place this bet, please check the comment section for 2 alternatives \n\nPOTD History: https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/SoggyDatabase2348-bvjHUn\n\nBOL!\n\n**POTD: NFL 2 Pick Alt Line Parlay: Seattle Seahawks +5.5 Alt Line + LA Rams +9.5 Alt Line -119 (1U TO WIN 0.81U)**   \n\nTips are greatly appreciated - Proceeds will be going towards my student loans and my morning cold brews.

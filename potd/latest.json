The Knicks have been rolling at home — winning big, defending hard, and feeding off the Garden crowd. The Grizzlies can’t keep up offensively, and their defense has looked flat, especially against teams that move the ball as well as New York does. This one feels like another double-digit win for the Knicks.\n\nAs for the Nuggets, they’re simply the more reliable team right now. They’ve been efficient, steady, and take care of business against weaker defenses — exactly what the Kings have been lately. Sacramento gives up way too many easy looks, and Denver’s shooting and inside play should tear that apart. Both games line up perfectly for the favorites to handle business.",

They are 3rd and 4th in the standings and are both on a 100% win rate so far. But Wolfsburg have faced Valerenga and PSG, who are starting to look like they will eventually finish outside play-off spots. Whereas Lyon has faced and won against Arsenal and St. Polten. A win against Arsenal is quite impressive, as they won the CL last year. OL Lyoness also haven't lost in 16 games, since April this year. Wolfsburg lost this weekend to Frankfurt, even whilst having a player advantage for 60 minutes, and they play Europa Cup.\n\nBest of luck if tailing! 🍀\n\n**PS:** If you want you can check my record and units won on [https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/OliveCritical5134-qXXxJZ](https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/OliveCritical5134-qXXxJZ)\n\nIf you're enjoying the picks and write ups and are looking to support me you could do so here: [buymeacoffee.com/olivecritical5134](http://buymeacoffee.com/olivecritical5134)",

      "text": "Record: 14-7\n\nNet Units: +5.75\n\nROI: 27.4% \n\nPick: NBA Raptors v Nets \n\n1U Sandro Mamukelashvili O0.5 1Q assists @ $2.30 (+130 American), B365 \n\nWrite-Up: My initial bet was going to be Embiid 1Q points as I have that bet on speed dial but u/Busy_Presentation463 got in first (which I don’t think necessarily matters) BUT also had better odds than I can access in Australia - which *DOES* matter. So for the predominantly US audience reading this thread that may want to tail, I highly recommend tailing that poster as Embiid 6 1Q is a fantastic bet *BUT* do your odds shop! As we saw last game, variance happens in NBA, it’s a winning pattern bet but you will still lose sometimes, so much better to shop around and give yourself more of a chance in the long run. Every game he plays - I spam it with the best odds I can find. \n\nNow, onto my pick. Sandro (Raptors) has hit this line 8 games in a row, all for 3 pointers. See the list below of the first quarters he’s had in relation to who he assisted and what their basket was, plus minutes played & Poetl playing or not (as he generally comes on for Poetl). \n\nV 76ers - Shead 3 pt, 6 minutes \n\nV Hawks game 2 - Quickley 3 pt, 7 minutes, Poetl played \n\nV Bucks game 2 - Shead 3 pt, 7 minutes, Poetl played\n\nV Grizzlies - Shead 3 pt, 5 minutes \n\nV Cavs - Barnes 3 pt, 4 minutes \n\nV Rockets - Barnes 3 pt, 3 minutes \n\nV Spurs - Murray-Boyles 3 pt, 5 minutes, Poetl played \n\nV Mavs - Barrett 3 pt, 5 minutes, Poetl played \n\nV Bucks game 1 - miss, 5 minutes \n\nV Hawks game 1 - miss \n\nSo basically we have to rely on him kicking out for a 3 pointer and that player hitting, but I love getting >+100 odds for something that is 8 straight. Obviously it’s unlikely to continue forever but I don’t see a good reason why it will be the Nets who stop this play. The Nets concede 33.2 points on average in 1st quarters, 3rd worst in the comp. Their 3 point field goal % defence is EASILY the worst in the comp - 41% ahead of Spurs with 39.7%. So we have a team that gets scored on heavily and can’t defend 3 pointers, we have a player who assists heavily on 3 pointers on a team that is ranked 5th for 3 point %. \n\nHe is marked questionable with neck soreness but no big deal, he’ll either miss entirely and it’ll be void, or if he does play it seems unlikely he’ll be on a minutes restriction if he passes fit to play. \n\nYes he is a bench player but solidly gets on as 7th man I’d say for 5-6 minutes, plus Poetl averages 4.8 fouls a game and is always a risk to sit early by attracting 2 early fouls.  \n\nAs always, manage units responsibly as variance will inevitably occur, but fuck, if you don’t like these odds on a play like this, I don’t know what to tell you. Will see you all again next Raptors game if he doesn’t hit playing it again as hopefully in that case odds have only gone up further.",

      "text": "POTD Record: 11-4 (+9.6U)\n\nLast Pick: standard two leg 6.5 point teaser \n\n(Eagles +8/under 52) (-120) (1U) ✅\n\n[Teaser write up](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/s/0pBEQcyajD)\n\nThat game went exactly how we expected it to go, 0-0 at the half, both teams pounded the rock and Green Bay struggled to move the ball through the air!\n\nEvent: Texas tech @ Illinois (7:30pm central)\n\nPOTD: over 165 (-120)\n\n-everything is bet to win unit amount-\n\nWrite up: \n\nIllinois has looked every bit the part offensively to start the season. They’ve brought in a ridiculous amount of talent from across the globe, adding serious scorers to bolster their three-point percentage. The Ivišić brothers, both towering over seven feet, give Illinois a size advantage that Texas Tech simply cannot match — Tech doesn’t have a single player over seven feet. These bigs aren’t just rim protectors; they can step out and shoot threes themselves, stretching the floor and creating mismatches. On the other side, Texas Tech counters with star power of their own. JT Toppin may be the best player in the nation, and breakout sophomore Christian Anderson is proving to be a stud. This game sets up less like a grind and more like a shootout.\n\n\nIllinois ranks fourth nationally in offensive efficiency and plays at a much faster tempo than Tech, meaning they’ll control the pace and force the Red Raiders to keep up. Tech is no slouch either, sitting 23rd in offensive efficiency. Both teams are elite at converting possessions into points: Illinois is the number one team in the nation in floor percentage, while Tech ranks 31st. That efficiency ensures that every trip down the floor has a high chance of ending in buckets. \n\nDefensively, neither team has shown much resistance against weaker competition. Illinois sits 30th in defensive efficiency, Tech 68th, but those numbers come against opponents that don’t measure up to the talent they’ll face here. Translation: expect both offenses to shine.\nThe three-point battle is another reason to expect fireworks. Both teams rank inside the top 13 nationally in three-pointers attempted per game, and they’re hitting them at impressive clips — 39% and 41%. When two teams shoot this well from deep and take this many attempts, the scoreboard climbs quickly. Illinois’s revamped spacing and Tech’s shot creation will force defenses into rotations, opening up clean looks all night.\nShot volume tells the same story. Illinois has allowed opponents to attempt 70.5 field goals and 28 threes per game through just two contests, numbers that rank near the bottom nationally. FGCU still managed to score 70 points against them despite shooting only 32% from the field and 25% from three. Tech has been similarly permissive, allowing opponents 63 field goal attempts per game, ranking around 260th nationally. Sam Houston even dropped 77 points on them in Lubbock. If either team gives up this kind of shot volume again, the pace will resemble an NBA game more than a college one.\n\n\nMatchups only reinforce the expectation of points. Illinois’s size advantage with the Ivišić brothers should allow them to bully Tech inside, while still spacing the floor with perimeter shooting. Tech’s undeniable talent, led by Toppin and Anderson, ensures they can trade buckets possession for possession. Illinois’s faster tempo and elite floor percentage will drive a high-possession game, while Tech’s efficiency keeps them competitive throughout.\n\n\nMarket context supports the Over as well. Oddsmakers opened the total around 162.5, with Illinois favored slightly at home. Both teams have already cashed Overs in their early-season games: Illinois dropped 113 on FGCU with Kylan Boswell scoring 31, while Tech put up 98 on Sam Houston with Toppin scoring 31. Last season, Illinois averaged 83.6 points per game, and Tech consistently scored in the 70s and 80s. These trends show that offense travels and sustains even against stronger competition\n\nIf you enjoy these POTDS or write ups and you would like to leave a tip I am leaving a link to my Venmo, they are greatly appreciated!\nhttps://venmo.com/ben_wrigley",

Now granted, Akron is actually expected to be a pretty good team this year, but a 35 point loss in a game that was over at halftime doesn't project a whole lot of confidence. Akron scored any way they wanted, making 15 3s at a 41% clip and having 12 different players score ending at 104 points. Akron was expected to win comfortably but 35 points is tough considering Princeton was only a 12.5 point dog.\n\nMeanwhile Bucknell sits at 2-0 with wins over Mt. Saint Mary's and Delaware, two teams that are very similar in quality to Princeton. Not a whole lot to glean from the stats as we are so early in the season, this pick is more just based on a lack of confidence that Princeton is going to put forth a significantly better performance on a three day turnaround.\n\nBucknell #243 in KenPom\n\nPrinceton #247 in KenPom\n\nBucknell 2-0 ATS covering with average margin of +9.\n\nPrinceton 0-1 ATS not covering by a margin of -22.5.\n\nLet's go Bison!! 🐂",

      "text": "**POTD Record 43-38-2**\n\nWell fuck. A push might be my least favorite outcome in gambling. For me, the whole point is to feel something. The rush, the heartbreak, whatever. But a push? Nothing. Just irritation. At least a loss stings. A push is just empty. \n\nAnyways back at it, and write up will be shorter again, because I’m busy the next few days and my god does this slate blow. There is one game though that jumps out and a matchup I attacked earlier this season.\n\n**76ers -1.5**\n\nI bet this exact matchup at almost the exact number (-1) on Halloween. Philly got down big in the 1st Q, but rallied back with a chance to win it at the end losing by 1. I expect Philly to exploit Boston’s holes, and not get off to such a bad start.\n\nMaxey is a a rampage right now, avg 33.2 a game (2nd in NBA) with two 40pt games (also two games with 39pts). Embiid isn’t who he used to be, however is still very efficient / productive when on the court. VJ is a stud, and grimes is in the running for 6th ma of the year early this season. \n\nBoston is a team I’ve faded a lot this season; and have for the most part been on the wrong side. I know they have championship players, and Queta is a revelation. I mentioned this in my last post involving Boston, his +/- this season is +82, with the second player being +46. I mean aside from the numbers, when I watch this team they are a totally different team with him off the court. \n\nThe thesis for me of this play really centers around my belief that Boston will be a bottom tier team when the season ends, and that they’re talent and motivation just don’t align with the respect their given from betting lines. I’ve been wrong a lot fading this team, but also can’t ignore my feelings. Or maybe I’m just stubborn. Regardless Philly has impressed me, and I’m backing them again.",

They are also 1-9 SU this season and will continue to be without their primary scorer, Cam Thomas. This squad doesn’t really have a playmaker and doesn’t really have a scorer, two things that are kind of important in this sport. The Raptors meanwhile coming off a loss against the 76ers, a team they typically struggle against, but they had 4 wins prior to it, covering their spread in each of those. With Jakob Poeltl returning, the Raptors are at full strength here and I think they’re finally starting to show some promise with their starting 5 getting some minutes together. Let’s go Raptors!",

      "text": "Record 3-0-3 ✅️✅️❌️❌️❌️✅️\n\nPrevious: **Celta Vigo v Barcelona: BTTS @1.45**✅️\n\nTodays POTD: **Stockport County FC v Wigan Athletic EFL Trophy: Stockport County DC & u3.5 goals @1.82**\n\nWith qualification still hanging in the balance in Northern Section Group A, Stockport County host Wigan Athletic at Edgeley Park on Tuesday in what’s effectively a knockout clash for both sides. Stockport sit second with three points — a win guarantees progression, while a draw might be enough depending on results elsewhere. Wigan, meanwhile, are winless and need a two-goal victory plus a Salford win to stay alive.\n\nDave Challinor’s men were humbled 3–0 by Luton at the weekend, missing a penalty and seeing red, but that blip shouldn’t overshadow their recent form. Prior to that, they’d won four straight, conceding just once, and they’ve been solid at home, unbeaten in seven at Edgeley Park. Stockport’s previous EFL Trophy outing was a 3–1 loss to Salford, but their earlier 5–3 win over Wolves U21s shows they can score freely when needed. Expect a more disciplined, controlled performance this time as progression is at stake.\n\nRyan Lowe’s side face a mountain to climb. They’ve lost both Trophy matches 2–0 against Salford and 2–1 to Wolves U21s and have only managed two wins in their last ten overall. Goals have been the issue, as Wigan haven’t scored more than once in any of those ten games. Their away record against Stockport is dire, with no win since 1982, and Stockport have made Edgeley Park a fortress this season.\n\nStockport have more momentum, home advantage, and scoring depth. Wigan’s lack of cutting edge and poor away form make it unlikely they can win by the margin they need. Stockport’s steady defense and Wigan’s goal struggles point to a low-scoring affair. Stockport are likely to secure progression with a draw or narrow win.\n\nBest of luck.",

      "text": "Record: 160-137, -0.89 units\n\nLast Pick: Antoine Ghibaudo ML vs Clement Chidekh (-122, 1 unit): Win\n\nTennis | Montevideo Challenger | 11:30 AM EST\n\nToday's Pick: Roman Andres Burruchaga vs Federico Agustin Gomez | **Burruchaga ML at -200 (BetRivers). 2 units.**\n\nWrite-up: Not sure how to feel about that pick. In terms of CLV, it was one of my worst picks ever, as Ghibaudo was pushed all the way up to +144 by the market before the match. However, it was somewhat redeemed by the result, as Ghibaudo came back from being an early break down to secure a 2-0 win. In general, it obviously wasn't the greatest play, and I think I should have been more careful about analyzing how the player (particularly Chidekh) had recently been priced by the market.\n\nSouth American clay has always been Roman Burruchaga's favorite surface, and he's shown that over the past few months. In 6 SA clay tournaments since the US Open, Burruchaga has captured two titles (with just one set dropped between them), and gone 6/6 in first-round matches. Here in Montevideo, his history is mixed, as he defeated Tirante and Guillen Meza to reach the quarterfinals in 2023, but suffered a tough first-round loss in 2024. Still, Gomez has only played one career match here in 2024, in which he won just two games in the first round against Gustavo Heide. \n\nGomez, a talented player who has consistently battled injuries throughout his career, has had a tough run as of late. Fede has suffered a tough third-set loss in the first round of three consecutive tournaments, despite none of the draws he faced being particularly tough. In general, a lot of Gomez's best results this season of actually come on hard courts, where his aggressive game can shine and his lack of fitness can be masked to some extent. However, that lack of fitness was actually brought to the fore in the first round of the US Open, where he actually gave Jack Draper a run for his money but ended up gassing out in the fourth set.\n\nI considered taking the 2-0 here, but I decided that I preferred the ML odds instead. Still, I think that Burruchaga has the game to dominate this one from the start. The sun will be shining, as temperatures are expected to climb above 28 degrees Celsius, and wind gusts will reach above 20 mph, which should have some impact on Gomez's signature serve and forehand combination. To me, someone like Burruchaga, who plays with heavy topspin and can extend rallies at will, is simply not the type of player Gomez wants to face right now.\n\nFor the odds analysis, we actually have a pretty good comparison match: both players faced off against Juan Pablo Varillas last week in Lima, and while Gomez was priced at around even money (3-set loss, 7.21 performance rating), Burruchaga's ML closed at around -333, which implies that he should be closer to that number in this encounter (he did indeed end up winning 6-3, 6-2, with an 8.27/10). Burruchaga was similarly priced in the next round against Alvaro Guillen Meza, who I believe is in better form than Gomez, although he ended up losing that in 3 (7.12/10). Finally, Teelo's model gives Roman a 70.3% chance of winning this, which is higher than the 67.43% implied by his ML odds. \n\nIf the market ends up hating this pick as much as my last one, I might have to take a break for a bit. However, I can't say I'm expecting that, and the combination of value and risk level makes this a 2-unit play for me.\n\nNote: The [POTD Capper Tracker](https://potd.lol), which you may remember from its Google Sheet days, is finally back in a cleaner, more robust website format!

The UK/Louisville rivalry game is expected to be extremely high scoring. The Over/Under is currently 173 and opened at 169.\n\nOrtega Oweh is the returning top scorer from last years Kentucky team. Oweh cleared this 18.5 line in 7 of his last 11 games last season. Of those 11 games he cleared the line 7/8 games in which he played 26+ minutes. \n\nWith it being a rivalry game and spread being only 3.5 and an O/U of 173 i expect the high scoring and close game and can almost guarantee he will play those 26+mins. More like 32+ imo.\n\nAlso, Louisville just allowed 2 different guards for 276th ranked Jackson St go for 20pts & 22pts on a combined 60% FG. Another guard also went for 18pts in the same game. It seems like Louisville will struggle to guard the perimeter players against Kentucky.\n\nTake Ortega Oweh Over 18.5pts",

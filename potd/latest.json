At home they’ve been disciplined and hard to break down, while Milan haven’t always been convincing on the road. Even if the game stays tight or ends level, the handicap gives solid protection, and there’s a real chance Como can get something from this matchup at these odds.\n\nGood Luck! ✌️",

Orlando also has Tristan da Silva, so the logic is that Orlando, with 3 German players, will be more invested in the game than Memphis.

Posting here for record purposes.\n\n**POTD Record:** 25-26\n\n**Net Units:** \\-6.77\n\n**🏀 Amen Thompson o17.5 Points -110** vs the Oklahoma City Thunder\n\nAmen's poised for a solid performance against the Thunder. Recently, he's cashed in L2/3 of their matchups, shooting \\~50-60%.\n\nOverall, he's been on a roll, cashing this line in L8/10. Momentum has been toward his scoring, he's averaged 23.8 points per game in L5, over an 18.8 point average this season.\n\nThunder are ranked top 3 in Defensive Rating, but they're ranked 24th in allowing points to SGs. Thunder's constant pressure-based defense opens up room for downhill drives from Thompson. Meanwhile, Durant & Sengun will draw much of the Thunder's defensive attention.\n\nLastly, his minutes per game has been at an all time high lately, playing 40+ min in both of his last games. Any kind of usage that high is a major plus in scoring opportunities.\n\nFull stats if you'd like to do additional research: [https://www.statpick.ai/35499590/amen-thompson-points](https://www.statpick.ai/35499590/amen-thompson-points)\n\nBOL!",

If you watched them play they give up grade A chances every 2 minutes. According to their GM who just did an interview, everyone on the team is tradeable so their morale is at their lowest. Jackets meanwhile come with some momentum giving their new coach his first win last game and have won 2 games in a row.\n\nBOL!",

Lakers were generous with the turnovers (Luka had 7) and gave up a bunch of steals to opposing center, but sadly it was the backup Mo and not Onyeka. Seemed like a decent read but big misfire.*\n\n**Event:** NBA - OKC Thunder @ HOU Rockets (4:30pm PST)\n\n**POTD:** Rockets +4.5 (-118 on DK) - 5 units\n\nThird time's the charm?\n\nOKC started the season looking invincible, but went through a slump recently. While they are 4-2 in their last six games, that stretch included losing to a good (not great) Suns team, getting blown out by the Hornets, barely beating the Jazz in OT, and winning their game against Memphis by just 1 point. They are obviously still an elite team, but not looking as dominant.\n\nIf the Thunder have a weakness, it is rebounding, ranking #19 in total RPG (43.9). Their only strong rebounder is Hartenstein, who is still out with injury. And without him, their total RPG drops to 42.4 which would rank 25th in the league.\n\nAs it turns out, Houston's biggest strength is rebounding, leading the league. Houston also leads in 2nd-chance points, which is a good answer to OKC's elite defense and will give them a definite edge over a bottom-tier-rebounding OKC team sans Hartenstein.\n\nHouston has also been nearly unbeatable at home, going 12-2 on the season. The two losses came against elite teams, Detroit and Denver, both of which by 4 or fewer points.\n\n***Edited to add: while a small sample size, HOU is 3-0 ATS as underdogs.*** \n\nIn their only prior matchup against the thunder (played in OKC), the game went to double OT and OKC ended up winning by 1. ***Edited to add: HOU was +6.5-point underdog.***\n\nSo despite a large gap in the two teams' records and ranks, Houston matches up well against OKC especially at home. I expect a pretty close hard-fought game, with Houston seeing this opportunity to prove they are legit contenders, and so I'll gladly take the 4.5 points with the home team with the massive rebounding advantage and everything to prove.",

They're missing 3 starters in Kuol, Cooks, and most importantly Delly. In the 3 games without Delly (injury) this season, Davis has registered 8, 4, 11 assists. Another thing to note is that when Delly returned and had his minutes managed, while playing less than 21 minutes, Davis is over the line 5/5 avg 8.00 AST. Davis is the primary ball handler of the team, and without Delly's playmaking, Davis has to step up his passing which he has shown he can do in Delly's absence. Lastly, Brisbane concede a lot of assists to guards and it was proved again last week where Cairns player had 13 AST, giving me enough confidence for an unoffical ladder up to 10 AST.\n\n**NOTE: Please try and stick to a unit system, and only stake what you can afford to lose as there is no such thing as a guaranteed win.**\n\n**BOL!**",

I like going with the Georgia Southern Eagles because their offense is much better than this Old Dominion offense as they rank higher than them in points per game, field goal percentage, free throw percentage, and offensive rebounds per game. I really like how Georgia Southern has the home court advantage in this one as they are undefeated at home this year with a 7-0 home record while Old Dominion has played very poor on the road this year with a 1-10 road record. Also, Georgia Southern and Old Dominion have already played once this year and Georgia Southern won that game 93-86 on the road so I think they should be able to have repeat success at home in this one. I also like going with the Liberty Flames against the New Mexico State Aggies as the Flames have an edge offensively and defensively as they score more points per game than the Aggies as well as allowing less points to teams per game. The Flames rank 5th in the nation in field goal percentage with a 52.3 percent while the Aggies rank 261st in division one with a 43.8 field goal percentage so the Flames are much more efficient from the field than the Aggies. The Flames are also a top 5 team in the nation in turnovers per game as they are good at limiting mistakes while the Aggies are a middle of the pack team in regards to turnovers per game. I think home court advantage will be a big factor in this one as well as the Flames are undefeated in front of their home crowd while New Mexico State has not won a road game yet this season. I think both of these teams should be able to handle business at home in their games.\n\nPrediction: 74-67 Liberty, 89-81 Georgia Southern\n\nLast pick:🏀ETSU ML/Iona ML💩Jaylen Smith played 30 minutes and didnt make a shot all game and Brian Taylor ends the game with the most unclutch layup attempt and 2 missed free throws.\n\nBest of luck to everyone tailing and remember to bet responsibly! 💜🐉\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ipucw2rhlgdg1.jpeg?width=930&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dd6f6be2ed96154d62ada5e7e84badb0245026f2",

Convincing 3–0 away wins at Pisa and Lecce show how effective they are on the counter, while home victories over Udinese and a 1–1 draw with Bologna highlight their ability to stay organised and manage games when they need to control the pace.\n\nComo’s goals tend to come in controlled moments rather than flurries. They’ve scored more than once in just two of their last five matches, but their strong structure has limited opponents to very few clear chances. That balance shows in their season record, with only 13 goals conceded across 19 league games. At home, Como are especially difficult to break down. They focus on staying compact and well-spaced rather than pressing aggressively, which often keeps matches tight deep into the second half. Even when they concede first, their response is usually calm and measured, not rushed, which further points toward low-scoring games.\n\nAC Milan come into this match unbeaten in their last four league games, but recent performances have been more about control than outright dominance. Back-to-back 1–1 draws against Fiorentina and Genoa reflect that pattern, with both games decided by small moments rather than sustained pressure. Away from home, Milan have tended to play with caution. Their 1–0 win at Cagliari followed a similar script, while the more convincing 3–0 home victory over Verona stands out as an exception. Over the season, Milan’s matches rarely open up, as the combined average of goals scored and conceded per game stays below two, highlighting how controlled and tight their games usually are.\n\nLuka Modric is set to return after being rested, while Allegri can also bring Fikayo Tomori back into the side following his suspension. Tomori is expected to slot into a back three alongside Strahinja Pavlovic and Matteo Gabbia. Pavlovic has been cleared to resume training despite needing nine stitches after a collision against Fiorentina, but there are still doubts over Rafael Leao’s availability. If Leao misses out, Christian Pulisic could partner Niclas Fullkrug in attack, with Nkunku also pushing for a start after a strong run of form.\n\nNkunku has been particularly effective recently, registering four goal involvements in his last three league matches after managing just one assist in the 10 games before that. For Como, creative side of stuff rests largely on Nico Paz and Jesús Rodriguez. Both have provided six league assists this season, with Paz also adding six goals of his own.\n\nWhile this match looks more suited to a low-scoring game overall, both sides still have a good chance of finding the net given the quality in their squads. Earlier this season, Milan edged Como in two tight 2–1 wins, with both matches staying close until the final stages. That shows both teams are capable of scoring in this matchup. Even though BTTS isn’t the standout angle on paper, both sides will likely push to come away with something here. The game should remain controlled and tight, but there’s enough quality for goals at both ends.\n\n**NOTE: Please only stake what you can afford to lose; know that no picks are 100% guaranteed to hit. Stake Responsibly.**",

Franz Wagner is coming back into the lineup today from his injury, plus this is his home country. Should be on a minutes restriction. Also might not be. I was tempted to play his props, but I felt it was too risky, so I chose Black. Without Suggs in the lineup, Black has solidified himself in the starting point guard position, averaging over 30 minutes a game. Over his last 20 games, he has averaged 18.5 ppg. Without Suggs in the lineup and playing at least 30 minutes, he has hit this line in 12/14 games. Without Suggs and with Wagner, he is 3/5… not a ton of data. Even with Wagner coming back, I don’t see him taking a lot of Black's production, as he still averages 12 field goals attempted. Should have a good matchup here, as the Grizzlies rank 28th in points to opposing point guards and 29th in three-point shots made to point guards. When playing for at least 30 minutes and against teams that defend the point badly, he has grabbed 20 points every time. Almost feels like a trap line, but I don’t see how Franz comes back and eats into Black's usage rate that harshly. We will see.\n\n\n\nAs always, good luck, fellas. 🍀",

It's generally around the -150 mark elsewhere but anything in the -133 or better range strikes me as good value for the following reasons:\n\n\\- M80 have played two tournaments in 2026 whereas Gentlemates have played zero so they are coming into this match with a lot less official match time\n\n\\- M80 won their last tournament pretty easily and the players will be coming to Europe in high spirits/good form (they have traveled from Las Vegas to Europe for this match which isn't optimal but they are young and this match is scheduled for 11am)\n\n\\- Gentlemates had some good performances last year but at the end of the year their level dropped a bit and they ended the year with a record of 6 wins in 10 bo3 matches \n\n\\- M80 have a strong map pool: their best map is Mirage which they have a 83% win rate compared with 20% for GM. GM's first-choice map is Inferno which over the last 6 months they have won 60% of the time compared with 55% for M80 so it should be competitive. If the game goes to a deciding map it will be Ancient which both teams are good at.\n\nOverall, assuming no travel fatigue, I think M80 are the more promising team with the higher ceiling, they get to choose their map first, and I was surprised I could find odds close to even money here. As always best of luck and please bet responsibly!",

First up was ultra impressive, sitting midfield and winning by almost 2 lengths pretty softly. Now the form to come out of this race is amazing, with most horses running really well at their next starts, but it’s the runner up who really enhances this form, winning its next two starts by almost 3 lengths both times.    \n    \nToday we draw barrier 2, and with only one noted speed influence in the race, I envision us camping right of the leader and having a dream run throughout. Hopefully that’s all she wrote. Never won over the 1100m distance, however last starts finish suggests we’ll handle it just fine.     \n    \nOpposition is pretty moderate here. The second market elect BOLD RESPONSE has a 4kg apprentice on, so I’m not forecasting a great ride, and some of the others are drawn poorly. There is one danger, KYLE, who ran great last start and now draws a soft barrier. I’m hoping that it lands directly behind us, and has a hard time finding clear air.    \n    \nFor this bet, for every $10 you are putting on, you should be be paid out $23.50 ($13.50 profit). If yours is significantly less, you’ve place the bet wrong.    \n    \nNo other plays for today. GL    \n    \n[https://buymeacoffee.com/bstilled_](https://buymeacoffee.com/bstilled_)",

Nevertheless, that snapped four wins in a row for me, and I'm still up +3.06 units on the year, so I can't be too disappointed.\n\nThis Adelaide quarterfinal is one where I see one player having a significant edge. Ugo Humbert's results last year were significantly stunted due to a recurring hand injury, but he was still able to round in to form in the indoor season. Now, after a couple months of rest, he seems to be completely healthy again. Humbert has posted excellent performance ratings in all three of his matches so far (7.77 in a Brisbane loss to Norrie, and 8.0 against Atmane, and 9.04 against Griekspoor). In comparison, Shevchenko has made it through four matches here in Adelaide; however, these were against lower-level opposition, and he failed to score higher than 7.57 in any of them. Shevchenko plays a solid aggressive baseline game, but he doesn't have Humbert's weapons, and it's hard to see him finding a good gameplan in these lively conditions. Additionally, Shevchenko has a woeful 3-10 career record against lefties at this level, including an 0-2 H2H against Humbert. Looking at recent market prices, Humbert was priced similarly to where he is here against Atmane, who I view as more dangerous in these conditions despite his bad current form. Overall, Humbert's serve and forehand should make the difference here, and he's looking at a pretty reasonable title path if he moves on to the semis.",

Whitlock hit a buzzer beater 3 to send to OT and Lehigh wins by 2. \n\n**Event:** Milwaukee Bucks @ San Antonio Spurs\n\n**POTD:** Stephon Castle Over 17.5 Points\n\n**Write Up:** Castle enters the matchup with significant momentum and a favorable history against this specific opponent. He is coming off a stellar **20-point performance** against the Oklahoma City Thunder on January 13, and he notably dropped **20 points** on the Bucks in their last meeting. Currently averaging **17.3 points per game** for the 2025–26 season, Castle has become a primary playmaker for the Spurs, frequently logging **30+ minutes** and taking advantage of his aggressive drive-to-the-basket style. This plays well against a Bucks defense that currently ranks **22nd in the league** at defending points from the guard position and allows an average of **115.7 points per game**, making it a prime opportunity for Castle to exceed his season average. At home, Castle’s shooting efficiency often sees a boost, particularly with his aggressive rim-attacking style that leads to a high free-throw rate.\n\n* **Recent Home Highs:** 24 PTS (vs. OKC), 23 PTS (vs. GSW), 20 PTS (vs. UTA). \n* He is shooting roughly **46.1% from the field** on the season, but his \"per-36 minute\" home splits suggest a scoring ceiling closer to **21 points** when he sees heavy usage.\n* **The Matchup Edge:** Milwaukee’s perimeter defense has struggled to contain athletic, downhill guards. Given that Castle is averaging **6.2 free throw attempts** per game, he is likely to exploit the Bucks' tendency to foul in the paint, providing him with \"easy\" points at the line to help clear the 17.5 threshold.\n\nBOL if tailing, feel free to send a little love my way <3\n\nPaypal Link for tips: \n\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/15WqXqliqJLfcYklFr8qcXC6RpYqnIdY91mB6jFzNGhs/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15WqXqliqJLfcYklFr8qcXC6RpYqnIdY91mB6jFzNGhs/edit?usp=sharing)",

He was out in their last game due to illness, but was back at practice today.\n\nThey’re going up against a Calgary team that is 1-5 in January and has a pretty atrocious road record. I normally don’t look into that too much, but 7-12-3 on the road compared to 12-7-2 is a pretty big difference. I’m assuming that Calgary will be starting Dustin Wolf who has given up 4 goals in 5 straight games. \n\nGood Luck!",

Last season's H2H between Como and Milan also ended with 5-6 total corners in both games. Milan’s style relies on structured, central build-up rather than constant wing pressure, which means corner counts are often suppressed against disciplined, compact teams like Como.\n\nSome caution points: although Como has a very low corner count at home, Milan averages 9.1 corners away this season. I’m counting on Como’s disciplined style to suppress their usual numbers, but if Milan generates pressure quickly or scores early, the corner count could rise.",

He’s already shown this season that his game is in a really good place, especially at the Masters where he looked sharp, confident, and controlled from the first frame. The head-to-head also leans his way, and that matters in a short race like this. Higgins knows how to manage Zhao tactically, slow things down, and turn small mistakes into stolen frames. In best-of-11s, that experience and match awareness usually producing a win.\n\nNow it’s obvious Zhao Xintong is dangerous and can outscore anyone when he gets rolling, but Higgins’ current form plus his history against Zhao make all the difference here. Higgins doesn’t need to dominate; he just needs to stay solid, win the safety exchanges, and capitalize when Zhao overreaches. Over six frames, that kind of pressure and consistency is often enough, which is why Higgin should take his game to the Semi finals. And at plus odds I felt like it’s worth sprinkling a few units. \n\nA part of me wanted to take the spread at +1.5 frames but I trust that if it’s gets to a decider, Higgins locks in and takes it.

This is a type of game the Spanish league cup can readily cook up and I truly believe we're about to see more of that today as Racing Santander host Barcelona. Travelling from Saudi Arabia, where they'd just played an intense match against their bitter rivals, Real Madrid, a few days prior, and perhaps feeling **tired,** as well as **complacent, the Barcelona players are not going to be at 100%** for the clash with Santander. Moderate to heavy **rotation and minute management** of the star players are also expected, and that only nudges the odds further in our favor.\n\nRacing Santander, unlike Albacete, aren't struggling - quite the opposite, they in fact find themselves at the very top of the Segunda Division at the halfway point of the season, *though their recent form hasn't been stellar.* Still, they certainly aren't a pushover. They have some quality players, such as the talented **Asier Villalibre, who has already scored 10 goals and added an assist in 20 games this season** and will be looking to continue his fine run of form against a Barcelona team that isn't defensively bulletproof. I'm feeling a shock today, but even if Racing lose by a goal, the bet still comes through for us. So far, we've seen an uninspiring Atletico Madrid barely beat Deportivo 1-0, Athletic Bilbao needing extra time to dispatch Cultural Leonesa, and Real Madrid deservedly getting knocked out by one of the weakest sides in the Segunda Division in Albacete. What am I getting at? **All the big Spanish sides have struggled against second division teams so far,** and these teams are, on paper, much weaker than the one Barca are coming up against today. A shock is certainly on the cards, and I'm sending it with 3 whole units. Covering three outcomes *(win, draw, narrow defeat)* at these odds is just a pick I can't refuse.

Their starting 5 is all out attack.\n   * Even when Delly and Kuol were in, they were letting in 31 3P attempts per game. Melbourne got up 36 shots against them last round in the game Delly went down. That's a 20% increase over Melbourne's season average 3PA.\n   * Brisbane's two primary attack weapons right now are Moldonado (legend) and Terry Taylor. Moldonado attacks the rim and Terry Taylor plays from the key and backs his way to the rim. If the focus is on these two guys, there will be plenty of kick-out options.\n   * Ducas has attempted 140 3PA (5.6 per game) this season. That is more than **double** the 3PA of any other Brisbane Bullets player. Given the Kings tendency to give up the 3 ball, he will get plenty of looks tomorrow night.\n   * But he's not just a one trick pony. He's young and athletic and has good handles to attack the rim. In a high pace game, I can't see why he can't get one or two rim attacks in transition or when they run him off the 3.\n   * He might be averaging 9 points per game but with all the injuries and the 3 pt stats above, I think this line should be an easy clear for him.\n\nThese odds seems to be dropping quickly so please consider that when staking. At some point, his natural 11.5 point line @ $1.85 becomes the better bet. Your call but this is what I've locked in.\n\n  \nBOL",

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 23-23-5 (Avg Odds +128)\n\n**Previous Pick:** Enzo Fernandez 1+ SOT (+100) ✅️\n\n**Today's Event:** Spanish Copa Del Ray (Soccer) | Racing Santander vs Barcelona (12:00 PM PST)\n\n**Pick:** Total Goals Over 4 (-105) 1.05 units to win 1 unit\n\n**Write Up:** Enzo comes through for us a 6th time. Cashing 11 minutes in for a no sweat, no doubter. Back in the green as we've been trading wins and losses for the last week or so. Hopefully today is the day we break the curse and start the win streak. \n\nTosay we take a rare trip to Spain for an interesting cup match between Barcelona and 2nd division team Racing Santander. Racing is currently first place in the 2nd division of spanish football. What i like about this matchup is that Racing scores the most goals in the 2nd division and, outside of the bottom 2, concedes the most goals in the 2nd division. Their matches are the highest scoring in the league. \n\nBarcelona, as many may know, are currently the first place team in La Liga and also score the most goals on La Liga with an average of over 2.5 goals per match. While they tend to have a decent defensive record, they have been struggling on the road recently. Conceding 2 goals to Madrid in the Supercopa final, 3 goals to Real Betis a few weeks back, and 2 goals to Celta Viego before that. These sorts of inter division cup matches tend to be boom or bust with goals, usually hinging on how early the higher division team scores. The earlier they score, the more risks the lower division team takes, the more open the game is. I'm banking on an early Barca goal or two against the spotty Racing defense, which will hopefully lead to 5-6 total goals. \n\nTo clarify, over 4 is a push if 4 goals are scored. We win with 5 or more. I'm predicting 4-5 Barca goals and 1-2 Racing goals to win this one, let's say 5-2 Barca. \n\nBOL and have a great Thursday!",

      "text": "**Record 2-0**\n\n**POTD:** Orland Magic -4.5\n\nNow the reason why this one sticks out to me is because the game is actually held in Berlin, which is where Franz and Mo Wagner are from. Franz is actually a very critical part of this team because of how BAD this teams three point shooting is, Desmond Bane and Banchero can not shoot the three ball. Making the spacing on the floor horrible and predictable, not only this but the injuries have deeply hurt this team. The bench depth is very skeletal as Anthony Black does best on the bench but currently he starts meaning the substitute players that come in don't really bring in energy or that firing power. I expect Franz and Mo playing will be a good enough help, also considering that they are from Berlin will be extra motivation.\n\nMemphis on the other hand I believe are at an all time low so this could be a good bounce back spot for them. However I can't really see it atm . Ja Morant is arguing with team mates now and also commenting that he feels betrayed by team mates and Jaren Jackson also wants to be traded. Recent performance in last quarters has been horrid, they lost to a OKC team with no starters besides Jdub and nearly collapsed to a nets team without Michael Porter Jr.",

Will add some personal information in this write-up as well.\n\n• ⁠Model has Under 230.5 at 54%\n\n• Model projects Magic covering -4.5 at 52% while it also projects the game's total ending at 224\n\n• EV better betting 100$ = 7-8$ for this play\n\n• Rolling with 0.50U here because the NBA is just not fun to bet, always some stupid things happening, but there is not a lot on the board - As always, I try to get a play out for you all each day, whether there are a lot of games or barely anything - First thing that stands out here is that they are playing overseas, so fatigue should play a very small factor, different atmosphere, long flights/travel, and just a weird situation in general playing overseas - Second thing, injuries - Grizzlies are still without Morant and Edy - Magic are without Suggs, with Franz expected to make his return - Low scoring affair here, with the Grizzlies averaging just 114 PPG, which is not even top 20 in the NBA - the last 4 games for them have also gone under, which is something to note - Last time these two teams played, both teams healthy, the final score ended at 209 - The over has only hit 39% in all of the Grizzlies games this year, while the Magic's overs have hit 51% of the season - some key injuries on both sides, recent games going under, and the game being across the pond, I like the under 230.5 here \n\nPOTD History: [https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/SoggyDatabase2348-bvjHUn](https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/SoggyDatabase2348-bvjHUn)\n\nBOL!\n\n**POTD: POTD: NBA: Magic vs Grizzlies U230.5 -110 (0.50U TO WIN 0.40U)**\n\nTips are greatly appreciated - Proceeds will be going towards my student loans and my morning cold brews.

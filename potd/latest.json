Bayern have won all 15 matches to start this season, which is the first time any team in Europe's top five leagues has ever done this, and they have scored 54 goals while only letting in 8, showing they are unstoppable right now. Harry Kane has been incredible with 22 goals in just 15 games this season including 5 goals in 3 Champions League matches, making him one of the most dangerous strikers in the world. \n\nBayern lost the last meeting with PSG at the Club World Cup in July, Bayern were the better team in the first half and conceded both goals only in the second half after Jamal Musiala suffered a very bad injury just before halftime, which completely destroyed the team’s morale and rhythm. Bayern have beaten PSG in the last 4 UCL games and PSG has failed to score in any of those fixtures, showing they know how to beat the French champions. PSG are missing important players for this match, with Desiré Doué ruled out for weeks with a thigh injury and Ousmane Dembélé not expected to start the game even though he just returned to training, which weakens their attack badly. Bayern is coming in this match after beating Bayer Leverkusen 3-0 while resting most of their best players, proving how strong their squad is. \n\nIf you found these picks helpful, tips or donations are greatly appreciated as they support the time and effort I put into creating them: [buy me a beer🍻](https://buymeacoffee.com/hercules.son.of.zeus)",

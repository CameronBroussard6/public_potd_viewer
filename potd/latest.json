I expect them to score against a Nigeria side, which will be heavily rotated. However, the odds for over 0.5 is just short the minimum required to post here, so going a little greedy for the over 1 Asian line, where 1 goal by Uganda atleast guarantees money back.\n\nHope we continue the wins & BoL\n\n*Note : My record in Afcon has been pretty abysmal, so be careful before tailing my picks :)*",

I fancy the over match 180 mark in his contest with Rock later on. We go again today in AFCON. \n\nReasoning: Tunisia should control large spells of this match and spend plenty of time in the attacking third. A lot of their threat comes from wide areas and crossing situations, which naturally leads to corners through blocked deliveries and recycled pressure. Their dominance should see a comfortable 5+ corner mark over 90 minutes.\n\nBOL if tailing 🍀🫡",

Coach Eric Chelle is expected to rotate heavily, potentially resting stars like Victor Osimhen and Ademola Lookman. However, Nigeria’s \"B-team\" includes players like Chidera Ejuke and Paul Onuachu, who would start for almost any other team in the tournament. Uganda is desperate, but they have won only one of their last 10 AFCON matches.\n\nHence, in my humble opinion, Nigeria to win at 2.24 odds is a good value play",

If they are going to do this, it has to be before 5. January. And if they are going to do this, the word got out, and it makes not much sense to give these players lots of minutes, probably only some minutes to show to other clubs they are not injured.\n\nOne theory predicts an easy over on points in this game due to terrible defense from Partizan players in previous games,  and due to the fact that players on the way out of the club are not going to improve their efforts in a few games they have left in the club.\n\nAlthough I like this theory, and I am going to cover that also, the line moved 4-5 points already, and I am more comfortable with Payne, who had 14 points on his debut and 24 points in 23 minutes in the ABA league. I think he is the future first option for the new coach. They came into the club at the same time, and it makes sense they develop some sort of bond there.\n\nEven if it's all bs from my side, 14 points are too low as a limit here. Payne shot 4/6 and 8/12 for 3s in his first 2 games. Of course, he can't keep these numbers, but he shall get probably some 30 minutes and enough chances, so even with a slower night, he should get this.",

I don’t usually pick bench players but I thought the line had really good value.. we move.\n\nFor today’s pick I’m taking Cade for 10 assists. For his last ten games he has split this line 50/50 with four of those losses reaching 9 assists. In his last two H2H with the Lakers he has reached 11 and 10 respectively. \n\nThe Lakers tend to give up more assists than other teams as they rank bottom 10 in opponent assists per game. They are also bottom 6 in opponent assists per possession. The Pistons are a team that play with a lot more pace as they are top 10 in possessions per game. This gives Cade way more looks to drop some dimes. The Lakers also stand at 26th for assists to opposing point guards. Oddly enough Cade also tends to rack up more assists vs teams that cannot defend the three. (Lakers are 29th in opponent three point %)Which he has hit this line 63% of the time. \n\nHoping for a good matchup, a pistons win, and my first dub. Let’s get it",

I don't even know what to say. Randle finishes with 14 ASSISTS (my old model loved pumping out him for assists in like every other matchup...), and only 22 PR. And MIN blew out CHI so he didn't even play the final 6 minutes. AND on top of that, HOU was up 21 with 3:44 left. Then the whole bench for both teams came in. IND proceeds to go +14 in the last 3:44 to lose by 7, and this got hooked by half. Almost more happy Randle missed so I can't lose my mind over that hook. \n\nToday's Pick: Jaren Jackson o24.5 PR v PHI, Jaylen Brown o24.5 pt v UTA, -105 on DK at time of writeup, betting 3u\n\nI've been a little cold recently. But, I will continue to trust my model. We're going to keep betting on hot players in good spots. JJJ is continuing to play very good basketball. Jock Landale might come back, but I'm not too concerned about that. JJJ gets around 30 minutes every game no matter what. This guy is on a tear. I don't know why this leg is at -168. He has taken 18 shots or more in the last 6 non-OKC games. His volume is on a different level than previous games where he was taking 9-13 shots. Opponent is PHI, who allows 24th most PR to opposing PFs. Embiid may or may not play, I don't really care, I rather he did because he is a defensive liability and will create more total points in the game. He missed their last game, so he is probably more likely to play. Doesn't matter, JJJ is on fire. He's constantly hitting multiple 3s per game. KCP and Vince Williams are out. I watched most of the last MEM game, JJJ was just everywhere. In a close game (1 point spread) with a highish total of 232.5, this is not the opponent or situation where JJJ should slow down. Jaylen Brown has scored 30 or more points every game in December. He is playing an opponent in UTA who allows the 26th most points to SFs. UTA is playing at home, which makes a blowout less likely. UTA games at home always have a lot of points. Keyonte George is questionable, and it is an illness, but I think I've been seeing pretty much everyone who is questionable with an illness in the NBA end up playing. This is not the spot nor opponent for Brown to slow down. We only need 25. Let's get it. 3u play. BOL to all tailing. \n\nIf you've been appreciating and tailing my picks, tips are greatly appreciated! [buymeacoffee.com/emupicks](http://buymeacoffee.com/emupicks)",

Well he has now arrived. Slafkovsky has 8 points in his last 4 games, is used on the first powerplay unit and is now one of the coach's favorite to put on the ice when they need a goal (he scored the game tying goal vs Tampa last game). The coach had high praises for him after his 3 point game(2g,1a) saying he had made big steps in the way he plays and was now seeing the game more slowly and it shows.\n\nAnother reason why I like this pick is because Slafkovsky managed to get on the scoresheet in 6 games in a row vs the Panthers. They play a rough playoff style of hockey which Slafkovsky thrives in as he is a big fella who excels in board battles and likes to control the play.\n\nMontreal won their last 5 games against Florida so the chances that they get shutout is pretty low especially with Florida's backup goalie starting in net. Panthers also played the day before while Montreal didn't.\n\nBOL!",

Coming back from 1–3 down and surviving match darts to beat Wesley Plaisier 4–3 says a lot about where his head is at right now. That kind of win usually settles you into a tournament, and once Ratajski gets comfortable on the Ally Pally stage, he’s tough to shake. He might not blow you… away with pace, but his scoring been steady and he doesn’t panic on the outer ring when the pressure ramps up.\n\nI know history isn’t always a telling tale but he leads Woodhouse 4–1 h2h, including recent ProTour meetings, and that experience tends to matter in longer World Championship formats. Woodhouse has played well to get this far, but Ratajski’s been in these deeper rounds more often and knows how to grind sets out when legs get scrappy. If this turns into a tight, stop-start match, Ratajski’s composure, finishing under pressure, and proven ability to dig himself out of trouble should give him the DUB\n\nYou gotta believe, BOL is tailing and enjoy whatever happens on the Oche!",

He also leads on the seasonal numbers with a higher 12-month average (94.43 vs 92.74) and a stronger overall checkout rate (40.01% vs 38.85%), showing this isn’t just a short-term spike. Taken together, his superior baseline scoring and finishing clearly align with his current Ally Pally level, making him the justified pick.\n\nOdds: 8/11\n\nUnits: 2–3 units if you’re staking sensibly and comfortable with the variance that comes with darts.

One of the misses was against Houston, the #3 defense in the league. The other against Miami, a solid defensive team, in which he shot a season-low 1/11 from 3.\n\nYes, Detroit is a good defensive team, but they also **lead the league** in fouls per game and opponent FTs per game, and respectfully, Luka is a FT merchant. Further, Pistons' defensive rating is far worse on the road (115.3) vs. in Detroit (108.7). \n\nAnother factor is the absence of AR. which actually does not help us.

I’ve watched this game for decades, and I know when a side is ready to bite. Villa are tough, organised, and fearless, especially when written off. Arsenal like rhythm and comfort, Villa will give them neither. This is the kind of match where experience, hunger, and belief make the difference. I’ve seen giants fall many times before, and I tell you now, this has that same feeling written all over it.",

Bradford managed to get their goal eventually to cash us with a relatively comfortable victory. **FT: Bradford 1-0 Port Vale**.\n\n**Event:** EPL (Soccer) - West Ham vs Brighton (19:30 GMT)\n\n**Today's Pick**: Brighton to win @ 2.15 (1 Unit)\n\n**Write Up:** In all honesty today's slate really isn't all that great but I'm going with Brighton to win vs West Ham because I think they're generously priced and I fancy them to get one over on the Hammers despite being away from home. **Brighton sit 13th** in the premier league table whilst **West Ham sit 18th** and currently in the relegation zone, **5 points away from safety**. Statistically this game doesn't give that big of an edge to either side but we will go through them as we always do with my opinions sprinkled in alongside.\n\nOur home team today West Ham have won **none of their last 5 games** in the league picking up **2 draws and 3 losses** across those games. Their 3 losses have come from their last 3 games meaning a loss to Brighton today will make it **4 losses on the bounce** for Nuno's Hammers team. However 2 of those 3 losses have been to **2nd place Man City** and **3rd place Aston Villa** with their final loss coming against **10th place Fulham** in their most recent game. West Ham are the second worst home team in the EPL this season picking up just **6 points from their 9 games** played at the London Stadium, **scoring 10** and **conceding 21** in the process. This translates to **1.11 goals scored per game** which actually drops to 1.00 when playing away. Defensively this becomes an average of **2.33 goals conceded per game** at home which is great news for travelling Brighton. I see Nuno bringing veteran striker Callum Wilson into the starting lineup this week in an attempt to fire some goals in to help change their fortunes going into the new year.\n\nAs for Brighton they are coming off the back of an expected loss to league leaders Arsenal at the Emirates but they put up more of a fight than most would have expected but I will get to that in a moment. In terms of their last 5 they have exactly the same record as West Ham, **winning 0 drawing 2 and losing 3**. Their games have come against harder opposition in my opinion with losses against **Arsenal (1st)**, **Liverpool (4th)** and **Aston Villa (3rd)** and draws against **7th place Sunderland** and actually **West Ham earlier this month** which ended 1-1. This game is the first time in a little while that either team is facing an opponent in the bottom half of the table (other than earlier in December where they met each other) so both should be hopeful of a more positive result but I think Brighton are the better team on paper. Going back to that game against Arsenal, despite probably deserving to be 2 more goals down than they were, Brighton gave Arsenal a headache during the second half only being denied an equaliser through a world class David Raya save for the Gunners. On top of this, Welbeck is expected to come back into the lineup which will give Brighton some much needed firepower and defender Van Hecke was back in the matchday squad last time out so could be getting some minutes here today which is a big boost to Brighton's defense. In terms of the numbers Brighton are scoring a slightly low **1.11 goals per game** away from home this season whilst **conceding 1.56**. On their travels the Seagulls have picked up **8 points from 9 games** scoring **10 times and conceding 14.**\n\nThis game could be an absolute toss up but I think Brighton have had a harder run of games recently and I think they did look pretty decent against Arsenal especially considering that is the best defense in the league and arguably the entire world that we are talking about here. I am also banking on Danny Welbeck making a considerable difference coming back into the team after his injury as the Englishman has **netted 7 times** this season so far and if Van Hecke does also return to the lineup he will be a big help in keeping West Ham out. I'm going for something in the range of **2-1 Brighton**.\n\nLmk thoughts and advice in the comments and also let me know if you are tailing and if you are then BOL!",

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 6-17-3 *Zimbabwe were so close to giving me another win, but it just wasn't meant to be - sounded too good to be true, I guess. Another super tight match that sadly just didn't go in the direction I needed it to, with a narrow 3-2 defeat at the hands of South Africa. I've thus (perhaps a bet or two too late) decided that AFCON in fact isn't going to bring me much luck, so I'm switching to club football for now - eyeing up a tasty fixture. Let's get it done for reals*\n\n**Last Five:** ❌✅❌❌❌\n\n**Event:** Premier League, Arsenal v Aston Villa, 3:15 pm EST\n\n**POTD:** Aston Villa Win or Draw +162, 1 unit\n\n**Write Up:** Aston Villa might just be **the most in-form team in world football** at the moment, having notched up incredible **11 wins on the bounce,** and I back them to *(at the very least)* avoid defeat against Arsenal today. It's not going to be an easy one as Arsenal have been solid at the Emirates and sit at the very top of the table, but recent trends suggest this isn’t going to be a straightforward match up for them. **Arsenal’s last meeting with Villa saw them lose 2-1,** thanks to a last-minute winner, and Villa’s overall recent H2H record against the north London side has been more than impressive, with Villa picking up **three wins in their last five matches** against Arsenal.\n\nAs I said, Aston Villa’s current form is nothing short of remarkable. Under Unai Emery, they're riding an **11 match winning streak in all competitions,** showing consistency and grit that few sides can match this season. Their ability to grind out results, especially away from home, gives them a real fighting chance heading into the Emirates. Crucially, Villa have proven resilient in recent encounters, **recovering points even when under heavy pressure,** which is why I'm loving the look of today's POTD.\n\nArsenal, despite being favourites on paper, have **defensive injury concerns** and haven’t always controlled the game as comfortably as their league position would make you believe, **conceding in several recent games,** as well as **struggling to score from open play recently.** They've barely scraped by a historically awful Wolves side and even needed some **assistance from own goals recently.** Their **set pieces have also dried up,** not being nearly as threatening as they were at the starting point of the season. Meanwhile, Villa’s attack, led by the likes of **Ollie Watkins** and **Morgan Rogers** has been consistent and lethal, capable of breaking down even strong defensive units, and they should handle whatever Arsenal might throw at them.\n\nIn a match likely to be of narrow margins, Villa’s **momentum and edge in the recent H2H meetings** should see them through this fixture. At +162 odds I simply can't ignore the sheer value in this play. How the Villans are such heavy underdogs on paper is beyond me. Expect a competitive contest where Villa don’t just survive, but have every chance to leave with a point or more, troubling the Gunners at every possible opportunity. Just the one standard unit on this one. BOL and let's enjoy some club football again ☘️",

They average **\\~62% possession** at home and consistently generate high shot volume, indicating strong attacking control. While Arsenal have a few injury concerns (Havertz, Timber, and Mosquera listed as questionable), squad depth remains strong, and their offensive output has not slowed.\n\nAston Villa’s **away defense has been vulnerable**, conceding **22 goals in 9 away matches (\\~2.44 per game)** while scoring 14. The situation worsens with **key defensive absences,** including **Pau Torres (out), Matty Cash (suspended), and Boubacar Kamara (suspended)**.

Arsenal’s home attacking consistency, combined with Villa’s defensive issues, creates strong value at current odds. For bettors looking to **reduce risk**, a lower unit size (0.5–0.75 units) is an option, or waiting for **live betting**—if there’s no early goal, **Over 1.5 live** after 20–25 minutes often provides a safer entry with improved odds.\n\n🍺 **If this one cashes, a beer is always appreciated:** [buymeacoffee.com/willjack](http://buymeacoffee.com/willjack)\n\n**BOL if you are tailing.**",

Arsenal lost to Aston Villa away from home on December 6th and managed **9 shots on target** (hitting the post twice). Now Arsenal get a rematch at their ground while needing a win to create a distance with Villa. Also, they forced 5 shots on target in the first half against Brighton on the weekend and I expect a similar start.\n\n**Player information:**\n\nNo Matty Cash, Kamara, Pau Torres for Aston Villa -  3 massive defensive misses\n\nArsenal attacking-wise will be without Havertz, all other forwards being healthy.\n\n**---**\n\nArsenal at home is a game that prints money, and for good reason. They’re currently unbeaten at home this season, and it’s the kind of match you want to be involved in, especially under the lights.\n\nVilla have been in unbelievable form, but the underlying metrics tell a different story — one of a team that’s been lucky not to concede more while being extremely clinical themselves.

This play pushes at 1 SOT and wins if he gets 2 SOTs. You are placing two bets, one for 1+ SOT that adds up to your total units, and a smaller one for 2+ SOT. If your units are 100 for the sake of easy math- as of writing this 1+ SOT is -155 and 2+ SOTs is +310. So you'd place $61 on 1+ SOT to return $100, and the remaining $39 on 2+ SOT to return ~$160. This way you push if he only lands one and win if he lands 2. Let me know if anyone needs help with the math, and feel free to take 1+SOT at (-155) if you prefer. \n\nOn to the play. Semenyo has been the brightest spot on this Bournemouth team this year with 9 goals. He has had 1+ SOT in 15/17 matches this season. He has scored a goal in his last 3 matches, and had 2+ SOTs in 3 of his last 5, including 3 SOTs in the reverse fixture a few weeks ago vs Chelsea and 4 SOTs on Saturday @ Brentford. He has really kicked into another gear lately. \n\nThere are also a lot of rumors floating around that Semenyo will be sold to Man City here in a few days. This may be his last game for Bournemouth. Emotions will be riding high for the lad, and I expect him to give it his all and take a lot of shots. Bournemouth had 4 SOTs in the goalless draw against Chelsea a few weeks back, 3 of which were Semenyo. Chelsea just gave up 9 SOTs to Villa at home a few days ago, so they certainly are open for shots. \n\nBOL and enjoy the midweek EPL matches!",

On top of that, the fixture difficulty rating heavily favours Brighton, even away from home.\n\nThat said, West Ham’s home factor and a draw probability of around 32% make a straight away win slightly riskier than the raw numbers initially suggest.

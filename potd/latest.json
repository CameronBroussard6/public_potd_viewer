Mjallby were given two pens (one after twelve minutes!) and played over 40 minutes with an extra man. Absolutely cooked us. \n\nToday's Pick:  FC Machida to win vs Melbourne City and under 4.5 total goals 4u @ $1.72\n\nPick: Don't have time for a massive writeup today but there following things are true. \n\n- J League is significantly better than the A League \n- Australian teams don't travel too well in Asian competition \n-  Melbourne City needed some late goals to beat Thai side, Buriram United at home.\n-  Melbourne City lost both other Champions League games against Japanese opposition\n-  The away game that City played in Japan was a late 1-0 loss where they basically defended for 90 minutes \n-  Machida are way more game ready than Melbourne City. The J League is 35 games in, and the A League is 3\n-  Machida are undefeated in their Champions League games \n-  Out of all the games Machida have played this season (around 40), only two of them have cleared the o4.5 goal threshold \n\n\nI can't see City getting anything out of this. Nor can I see them copping 5.",

      "text": "Record: 155-135, -2.97 units\n\nLast Pick: Antoine Ghibaudo ML vs Saba Purtseladze (-185, 1 unit) \n\nTennis | Knoxville Challenger | 2:30 PM EST (estimated)\n\nToday's Pick: Oliver Tarvet vs Andre Ilagan | **Ilagan +1.5 sets at -120. 1 unit.** \n\nWrite-up: Thought that might end up being my first non-CLV play in a while, but some late odds movement pushed Ghibaudo to around -250. He ended up winning the match pretty easily, facing just one break point. \n\nInteresting match here between Oliver Tarvet and Andre Ilagan. Tarvet has proven himself against top-level competition in college tennis (and at Wimbledon), so it makes some sense that the market has been giving him a lot of respect since returning to the pro tour this fall. However, Ollie honestly hasn't been crushing it recently if you look at the raw results, and he comes off a really rough 6-1, 6-0 loss to Mats Rosenkranz in Charlottesville  (5.51 performance rating). He has quite a nice counterpunching game that he backs up with a solid serve, yet I don't necessarily feel that he's a master of indoor hard court just yet (he plays college tennis at UCSD, meaning that most of his tennis in the spring was outdoors). \n\nMeanwhile, Ilagan, who also played college tennis at Hawaii, isn't as well known as Tarvet and doesn't have quite the same ceiling. However, Ilagan has quietly been piling up some impressive results lately, taking sets off other top college guys like Jódar and Damm. One thing I want to highlight is that both players faced Iñaki Montes De La Torre last week in Charlottesville. Tarvet was a smaller favorite against Iñaki than he is here, and Ilagan was also favored by the market in that matchup, implying that the odds here should be a bit closer (in terms of results, both players found themselves in tough three-set battles, though Tarvet barely came out victorious). Is it a matchup problem? Maybe, but there's no clear evidence for that. Ilagan has a nice lefty grinding game, and I don't see him giving Tarvet tons of free points here. As I mentioned, Tarvet just got crushed by a different lefty, albeit one with a very different game to Ilagan, and it's hard to avoid taking a hit to your confidence when you win just 11 points in an entire match. Overall, Ilagan should be coming into this match with plenty of confidence that he can take a set. I will say that I honestly prefer the ML as a market (I think that Tarvet's form is quite questionable - there's a chance he comes in strong and wins 2-0, but he could easily play another bad match and lose outright). If you can get that at 3.50 or above I would go for it (can't take it here due to odds restrictions). For that reason, my official play is the set handicap, which I still think is worth a unit. \n\nNote: The [POTD Capper Tracker](https://potd.lol), which you may remember from its Google Sheet days, is finally back in a cleaner, more robust website format!

      "text": "12-5\n\n✅️✅️✅️❌️✅️❌️✅️✅️✅️✅️✅️✅️✅️❌️❌️✅️❌️\n\nPROFIT/LOSS = +13.67\n\nPREVIOUS BET = PSG to score over 2\n\nRESULT = My previous pick was really poor, PSG just didn't have it and only scored one. Took a short break from posting after that pick to try and build some momentum and after a few really successful days I'm back. \n\nTODAYS BET \n\nEVENT/S = Real Madrid VS Liverpool and Arsenal VS Slavia Praha\n\nPARLAY BET =  Kylian Mbappe to have 2+ Shots on target and Slavia Praha Second half Goals UNDER 1 (No goals second half for Slavia Praha) @2.00\n\nUNITS = 3U to Profit 3U\n\nSUMMARY = Mbappe has been smashing this market all season long. He has played 17 games including internationals and only missed this market twice. Once when he scored but Real Madrid got shut out against Atletico Madrid and another time where he just had an off game but still managed 5 shots. So 2 very possible games are the only thing stopping this from being a perfect record. Coming into this game Real Madrid are in great form winning every game apart from the previously mentioned loss to Atletico Madrid and Mbappe has actually grabbed a goal in every game apart from 2. Liverpool on the other hand have had a really rough time lately. They have lost 6 out of their last 8 games and looked really poor. They did win their last match out against Aston Villa which was a decent result but even Villa weren't completely shut out of the game, they had some decent runs of play and Liverpool still showed weakness which against Real Madrid should result in chances.\n\nArsenal have conceded 3 goals all season. 1 goal against Haaland in the first half, 1 goal against Newcastle in the first half and 1 world class free kick against Liverpool in the second half. They have been an extremely strong defensive side all season. Slavia play in the Czechia league so it's really hard to judge their attacking talent so all we have to go off of against top teams is their 3-0 loss to Inter Milan. They had 3 shots all game and had an XG of 0.11. I don't even see them getting a shot on target against Arsenal. Even if Arsenal rest some key players the style of play will still deny Slavia much of the ball and it should result in a convincing win for Arsenal. I feel this market is a lot safer compared to an Arsenal Win or Arsenal to score x amount of goals which is why I am not going for that.",

      "text": "Record: 48-28 (+40.4 units)\n\nLast 10 (most recent on right):  ✅✅✅❌✅✅✅✅❌✅\n\nLast Pick: West Ham +2 asian handicap corners vs Newcastle ✅\n\nEvent: EFL Championship ⚽️\n\nPick of the Day: Coventry City U6.5 corners vs Sheffield United 4U @ 1.80 (Bet365)\n\nWrite-up: Pretty big shock in the grand scheme of things as West Ham came away 3-1 winners to Newcastle for Nuno’s first win as manager. Despite the internal issues + fan protests the Hammers fully deserved that win looking a lot stronger than the Magpies throughout even when going 1-0 down. A corner-heavy first half saw Newcastle leading the count 5-4 before the game ended on 7-6 for West Ham for a sweat-free finish.\n\nCoventry are sitting at the top of the Championship with one loss recorded all season. Under Lampard they’ve been playing some very attacking football and though it’s early days could be looking at a first stint in the Prem since the 2001 season after years of financial troubles and hanging in the lower divisions. Meanwhile this season has been a nightmare for Sheffield United, finding themselves in 22nd spot. Having been so close to being promoted last year (3rd spot and made the finals of the playoffs) losing their first 6 matches of the season was unexpected and they’ve hired Chris Wilder (again !) to change their fortunes. The Sky Blues have averaged 5.8 corners at home over their last 20 whilst the Blades have only conceded 3.5 per away match in the same time period. Adjusting for pressure from Coventry and taking into account more recent data gives an expected 4.8 corners for the home team.\n\nThat gives this play an estimated 78% chance of winning. I would take the probability down a notch slightly more considering how offensive they’ve been looking but Sheffield really are corner suppressors. They’ve conceded even below 5.5 in 18 of their last 20 (+ 9/10) whilst Coventry have covered in 7/10 so I still very much like the value. BOL !\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4gkxj0ogc5zf1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7805883f9cc27423de957e47da6a0577bb5b6e29",

Bayern have won all 15 matches to start this season, which is the first time any team in Europe's top five leagues has ever done this, and they have scored 54 goals while only letting in 8, showing they are unstoppable right now. Harry Kane has been incredible with 22 goals in just 15 games this season including 5 goals in 3 Champions League matches, making him one of the most dangerous strikers in the world. \n\nBayern lost the last meeting with PSG at the Club World Cup in July, Bayern were the better team in the first half and conceded both goals only in the second half after Jamal Musiala suffered a very bad injury just before halftime, which completely destroyed the team’s morale and rhythm. Bayern have beaten PSG in the last 4 UCL games and PSG has failed to score in any of those fixtures, showing they know how to beat the French champions. PSG are missing important players for this match, with Desiré Doué ruled out for weeks with a thigh injury and Ousmane Dembélé not expected to start the game even though he just returned to training, which weakens their attack badly. Bayern is coming in this match after beating Bayer Leverkusen 3-0 while resting most of their best players, proving how strong their squad is. \n\nIf you found these picks helpful, tips or donations are greatly appreciated as they support the time and effort I put into creating them: [buy me a beer🍻](https://buymeacoffee.com/hercules.son.of.zeus)",

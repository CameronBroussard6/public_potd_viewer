      "text": "**Record:** 0-0\n\n**League/Event:** NBA – Detroit Pistons @ NY Knicks (4:30pm PST)\n\n**POTD:** Mitchell Robinson 7+ rebounds (-164 on DK)\n\n**Wager:** 5 units 🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀\n\nHere we have a chance to buy low on this line, likely due to Robinson’s below-average rebounding (6) in his most recent game and way below average (3) in the prior game vs. Detroit. It seems reasonable as Detroit is a top rebounding team that ranks #5 in fewest RPG allowed to opponents.\n\nHowever, Detroit will be without their first and second center, Duren and Stewart, due to suspension, moving Paul Reed to starting center position. Robinson, coming off the bench, will therefore be matched up against either 4th-string center (Tolu Smith) or a small-ball lineup with no true center. Either case should prove a favorable matchup for Robinson.\n\nBetter still is homecourt advantage, where Robinson’s rebounding average is much higher (9.7 home vs. 8.5 away).\n\nAnd in 22 home games this season, **he is over this line in 20/22**. In both of the two misses, Robinson was in the starting lineup, which brings down his rebounding numbers. In today’s game, he will be in his natural role coming off the bench, backing up KAT instead of playing alongside him. When coming off the bench in home games this season, **he is over this line in 14/14.**\n\nThe odds aren’t all that juicy but the line is well-supported this season in this spot.",

      "text": "Last 5 POTD : ✅️✅️✅️✅️❌️ \n\n**Previous pick**: Finland -1.5 (+125) ❌️ (Welp my analysis did say Switzerland could take the lead but Finland decided to score only at the end to comeback and win in OT very dissapointing sorry guys) \n\n**POTD Record**: 28-22 \n\n**Today's Pick:** Sweden vs Switzerland 8:40am EST (Olympics/Women's Hockey)  \n\nUnder 4.5 goals (+105) \n\nWent from +135 yesterday to now +105 today. I watched both women's semi-finals and boy oh boy was that painful to watch. Plenty of broken passes, low danger shots and messy plays that resulted in no real offensive chances. Felt like I was watching AAA junior hockey. Switzerland had **8 shots** against Canada(I know Canada is on another level). They literally could not generate any offense except on their lone goal. They scored by the way only 1 goal in every game since the start of the quarterfinals so their offense is not good at all. What they do have however is a great goaltending in Andrea Braendli. She kept Canada to 2 goals only with 44 saves. She did the same against Finland the game before with a shut-out with 40 saves. So I expect her to be solid in a game for a medal. Meanwhile for Sweden, they put up a good fight vs USA with 23 shots but team USA is simply the best women's team in the world right now. What I'm looking at though is the Swedish goaltender. Before the USA game, Sweden had only allowed 2 goals **in the whole tournament**. Their young goaltender is playing solid and honestly even during the USA game she did the best she could with some big saves but team USA is just too good right now. With the game being this important I expect a low score again tomorrow and their goalies to be solid for the chance to win a medal. Last 3 games for Switzerland went under the 4.5 goals line. For Sweden, before the USA game, their last 3 games were also under the 4.5 goals line. In other words, BASED ON THOSE PAST GAMES AND NOT MY HOCKEY EXPERT ANALYSIS, I feel like with the bronze medal on the line they both will be playing great defensive games like they both did for the whole tournament which worked really well for them until they met the powerhouse that are Canada and USA. \n\nBOL \n\nMY POTD RECORD WAS 23-21 BEFORE THE OLYMPICS DON'T LIKE MY PICK DON'T TAIL I  DO THIS FOR FUN AND I'M NOT AN AI TRYING TO MAKE YOU LOSE MONEY. GO PICK SOMETHING ELSE IF YOU DON'T LIKE MY WRITE UPS IT'S NOT MY JOB AND I'M NOT THE MESSIAH TO FOLLOW BLINDLY WHEN I GET 5 WINS IN A ROW\n\nIf I made you some money during these Olympics and you'd like to tip! \n\n[Buymeacoffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/lordestros)",

Vikingur at home don’t change their style, they attack, press high, and create chances in numbers. Against a team like Reykjavik that usually leads to an open game. Vikingur are deadly when there’s space and can easily score two or three themselves. If this turns into a back-and-forth battle, five goals is very live at this price.",

Huge thanks to everyone tailing the heat.\n\nPARIVISION has been a revelation this tournament. With Puppey’s veteran coaching and their new offlaner, they are sitting pretty at 7-1 at the group stage. Meanwhile, Yandex has been a disaster, struggling at 1-7. They just dropped a map to a Tier 2 Chinese stack and practically have one foot out the door. Mathematically, Yandex needs to win 4 maps in a row just for a *chance* at tiebreakers. The motivation gap here is a canyon. PARI is playing for top seed, while Yandex looks like they’re already checking out of their hotel and some possible EPT points xd. This is as close to a \"lock\" as you get in Tier 1 Dota.\n\nThe gap between Tundra and Execration is just too wide. Tundra is a legitimate contender for the Grand Finals and has looked clinical in their macro play. Execration, on the other hand, has been the group’s punching bag, losing every single map except for their series against the bottom-tier NA squad. I believe both these matches have over an 80% chance to hit. BOL",

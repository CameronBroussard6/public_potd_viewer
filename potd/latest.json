The Rockets, who have won their last 6, get a home matchup against an always strong Nuggets team. The big story for this game will be the injuries. The Nuggets will most likely be without 2 of their role players in **Christian Braun and Aaron Gordon**. Paired with the injury news, 2 of the Nuggets' 3 losses are on the road. And when looking back to the last 20, **that record drops to 10-10** in road games.\n\nThe last, and in my opinion most important, factor for this match is the young-star **Amen Thompson**. Amen has been playing outstanding defense this season, including a Wednesday matchup where he **held Donovan Mitchell to 21 points** in an impressive win over the Cavaliers. He should be able to slow down Jamal Murray and forcing Jokic to beat them by himself.\n\nBest of luck everyone, let's win some money!",

Bigs have been getting nearly 2 full rebounds above their average when playing Washington. While Barnes is more of a SF than a PF he does lead the team in rebounding. If Sarr is back he’ll pull Poetl out of the paint pretty consistently and Barnes will cover down and clean up on the boards. ",

Additionally, Wiggins and Jovic are out, which should drive up his minutes to over 20. He’s been in the 7-10 FGA range the last few games and I’d expect 10+ here, and for an elite 3pt shooter, getting over this line when the game total is a whopping 250 pts should be doable.",

Wiggins and Jovic are out for the Heat so Jaquez may see a few more minutes tonight BUT Bam is also back for them so that will take some points away from other players. GL!

With a big potential to actually pull off the upset. vegas says 13% chance for pacers to win, I believe it's only that low because of their rough start. They also should have increased their winning chance since 2 players are off injuries.  Looks like their chemistry without  Tyrese is improving significantly. People are forgetting they have a winning spirit in them after making it to game 7 of the finals months ago. And I think they'll be very, very hungry to prove their season isn't going to continue in its current direction with this game, so I'm sprinkling a little on the moneyline as well.",

These two sides have one of the strongest goal-scoring trends you’ll find, with 9 of their last 10 meetings going over 2.5. Tromsø at home always push the tempo, and Rosenborg away from home consistently create and concede chances. Rosenborg’s away matches average well over 3 goals, which is exactly what you want for this type of bet. The league itself is fast, open, and high-scoring, making overs naturally more likely. Both teams need to attack based on their table positions, so neither side will sit back or play safe. Statistical models have this game projected at around 2.8–3.0 total goals, which matches the market perfectly. Every major prediction site leans toward goals, with Over 2.5 as the top recommended play. When history, data, team styles, and betting markets all point one way, it’s usually the right side to be on. That’s why Over 2.5 in this matchup is my most confident bet in the next 24 hours.",

Their counter-attacking approach also increases the game’s tempo. With both teams likely to contribute, the Over 3 Goals Asian Handicap looks reasonable.",

They’ve been the standout team all season - elite midfield control, clean ball movement, and a defence that barely gives opponents anything. They’re winning stoppages comfortably most weeks and turning that into quick, efficient scoring chains, which is exactly what you want when laying a big line. Not to mention they are on a 25 game winning streak (absolutely ridiculous) and their closest win this season was by 29 points. \n\nMelbourne are solid, but they’ve struggled to slow down high-pressure teams, and North’s system is about as disciplined and suffocating as it gets in the AFLW. They rarely allow easy transition, and once they get rolling, they can pile on scores in bunches.\n\nWith North’s consistency, midfield dominance, and the way they’ve been putting weaker sides away early, this feels like a spot where they can control the game from the start and stretch the margin past 30 with a grand final spot on the line for them to go back to back.",

If the information from the media is correct, Nwora and Moneke are going to play in Valencia, with a chance of Graham playing aswell. Combine that with Jared Butler, Semi Oyeleje, Kalinic... Zvezda have enough players to play this through. Worrying data is that most games that Zvezda won, or played at all in the euroleague this season is at home, so we will see what a trip to Spain will turn out to be. BUT i am still fairly confident, because i think this game will be VERY close, and i dont feel that Zvezda will allow alot of points in, and that their defense will be top notch.\n\nNow to Partizan, i've burned myself when playing them to win and to lose, time and time again they continously block me, but hopefully this will be my day ;\\]. They are playing Fenerbahce at home, and Partizan is having a ton of problems. They are currently 17th on the table with losses against last placed ASVEL, blowouts from Paris & Olympiacos, losing against Barcelona 78-76 in a close battle, and ALMOST dropping a 20 point lead in the 4th quarter to Monaco, winning 78-76. They are currently in a very bad place, and i feel that today they will continue their losing streak, they have problems in the dressing room, players are showing a lack of effort in defence and in attack, playing nonchalantly and not giving it their all. Still, they are playing at home and it's never a good idea to write off Partizan, thats why i gave Fenerbahce a good 6.5 lead.\n\nBOL to everyone!\n\nEDIT: forgot to mention the games are starting in 8 hours from now",

He’s coming off a solid win, he’s been facing better opponents, and he’s fighting at home. Villa hits hard, but he’s been really inconsistent lately, and it’s tough to trust someone who’s still trying to bounce back from a couple rough losses. Over 10 rounds, the guy who keeps his shape and sticks to a plan usually comes out on top, and that’s Veron.\n\nGolden State +2.5 - Portland’s beat up, they’ve been playing pretty poorly, and going on the road with that many injuries usually goes badly. Golden State hasn’t been amazing, but they’re rested and at home, and they’re not likely to drop another one to the same team after getting blown out last time. Both picks are basically leaning toward the more reliable sides in each matchup. \n\nbest of luck if tailing.",

Castellanos has quietly been slinging it. He’s cleared this number in 6 of his last 7 and is sitting in the mid-240s passing on average over that stretch, so 235.5 already feels a bit short. Now he gets about as friendly a matchup as you can ask for: NC State’s secondary is banged up and has been getting cooked for ~300 passing yards a game, including 340+ in four straight. Both teams are 5–5 and fighting for bowl eligibility, so I don’t expect FSU to come in with a conservative game plan. They’re going to let their best playmaker attack the weakest unit on the field. Obviously there’s some risk of a blowout leading to a run-heavy 2H or FSU’s usual road weirdness, but if this stays even reasonably competitive, Castellanos should have enough volume to push into the 240–260 range more often than not.

      "text": "POTD Record: 0-0\n\nEvent: Portland Trail Blazers Vs Golden State Warriors 10:00 PM EST\n\nToday's POTD: Draymond Green Over 1.5 Steals\n\nOdds: +1.43\n\nWrite Up:\nThis is my first post for POTD, so hopefully I can start off by giving you guys a W. I consider everything, and I'll list them in categories so it can be easier for you guys.\n\nMatchup:\nWarriors host the struggling Trail Blazers in a pace-up game (both teams top 10 in possessions/game).\nPortland ranks bottom-5 in Offensive Turnover Rate and lacks ball security, especially from their young guards who handle heavy usage due to injuries (Scoot Henderson, Sharpe out). Golden State is elite at converting defense into transition points, especially at home.\n\nPlayer/Position Analysis:\nDraymond Green is the linchpin of Golden State’s switch-heavy, aggressive defense. He averages 1.6 steals per game and sees a bump in stocks when facing teams with weak interior and perimeter passing. Portland’s offense is dependent on creation from inexperienced ball-handlers—prime targets for Draymond’s well-timed help, strips, and hedges.\nGreen’s steal rate jumps against bottom-third turnover teams: 7 of last 10 games vs. such opponents he’s hit 2+ steals. He’s projected to play a full complement of minutes in a competitive game (Warriors favored by 6, close enough to keep starters on the floor late).\n\nStatistical Profile:\nDimers’ simulations give Green a 52.1% projected hit rate for 2+ steals, with an edge of 10.9% at current odds. Portland gives up the 4th-most steals to power forwards (PF) and centers due to their high screen-and-drive scheme. Warriors force the 2nd-most opponent turnovers in the NBA; expect extra possessions due to the game’s fast pace (projected ~207 combined). Green’s “stocks” (steals + blocks) trend up in home games and when facing younger guards.\n\nGame Script:\nWarriors expected to lead most of the way, but not by enough for fourth quarter bench mob, boosting Draymond’s minute floor. Portland’s high-variance, youthful offense will force passes and attempt risky drives in catch-up mode, where Draymond’s anticipation thrives.\n\nInjury/Rotation Notes:\nKey Blazers guards (Henderson, Sharpe) are out, so more rookie mistakes are likely. Warriors fully healthy; Green enters with no reported restrictions.\n\nHistorical Context:\nDraymond averages 2.0 steals in last 5 home games vs. Portland, including 2, 3, and 4-steal outputs with similar game scripts.\n\nSo Why This Pick?\nEvery factor—from team matchup, position vulnerability, season trends, advanced simulation, pace, and injury reports—supports inflated steal chances. The +143 odds reflect significant value for a near coin-flip outcome.",

      "text": "Record: 58-44\n\n**Mersin Bld - Karşıyaka** 🏀 Türkiye Basketball League UTC 16:00\n\n**Pick**: Karşıyaka TT Under (79.5) @ 1.60\n\nKarşıyaka is a club with a long history (two-time league champions but facing a major crisis in 2025). With only one win in eight weeks, they are in the relegation zone. On November 15th, they lost 69-80 at home to Manisa. They suffered six consecutive losses, and on November 9th, they parted ways with head coach Faruk Beşok. Following the 80-69 loss to Manisa Basket over the weekend, it was reported that Chiozza threw the towel at Vice President Denis Köse, who reacted to him from the stands, and Köse threw it back. This incident led to Chiozza's departure from the team. Samet Geyik (appendicitis surgery) and Egemen Güven (severe flu) will not be able to play this match. Young players from the youth academy (like Yalın Yıldız) have been brought in.\n\nMersin, on the other hand, is maintaining and strengthening its squad for the new season: Justin Cobbs has signed a contract extension, Hakan Sayılı (former Karşıyaka player), Ben Bentil (forward from ASVEL), Kuzey Signings like Livaneli have been made. They recently lost to Unicaja Malaga in the BCL (Basketball Champions League), but they're playing resiliently at home in the league.\n\nWith Samet Geyik and Egemen Güven out, Karşıyaka's paint toughness, rebounding/second-chance numbers, and low-post threats are significantly weakened. With Chiozza's departure, the ball-handling burden falls to a tight guard rotation, slowing down set tempo and limiting offense on mediocre shooting days. Mersin's big men (Bentil and Olaseni) have a physical advantage in protecting the basket and rebounding; they could force Karşıyaka to resort to more crosses and three-point attempts. Karşıyaka's missing players and the team's unrest will likely be reflected in their scoring.\n\n[Track my sport betting picks on POTD Since Sept 1st, 2025](https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/bigtime-operator-UqbzCr)",

Fire Flux are currently slated to get side choice so they should be picking 2nd in this match against Leo \n* Fire Flux have been on quite a hot streak with their new roster and honestly I am quite suprised they are underdogs in this match. They were on an 8 match winstreak where they went 16-1 in maps, then dropped two straight to CPH Wolves/BoomBoomPRO, since that they have won 4 of their last 5 and have looked solid overall\n* Leo has a good map pool and solid roster and have been playing together for a while now, they have been inconsistent as a team but are in quite good form as well coming into this game winning 6 of their last 8 maps, they also don't blow anyone away with a star player but have a really strong roster with no super weak link and have solid fire power across the full team\n\n**Veto:**\n\n* Veto is not a guarantee and will be a bit tricky, both teams have been perma banning Nuke, but Fire Flux have 0 officials on it while Leo have some, imo Fire Flux will be the ones to ban Nuke here. As for Leo's ban they have a few options imo, they have banned Inferno a lot in the past and has seemingly been  a map Fire Flux has been increasingly strong/confident on but is their least played map. Fire Flux are also very strong on Dust 2/Mirage which are Leo's worst two maps winrate wise. \n* Leo ban Inferno/Mirage, Fire Flux ban Nuke\n* Leo pick Train, FireFlux pick Dust 2/Mirage\n\n**Dust 2 Stats:**\n\n* Fire Flux are 63% winrate on 19 maps of Dust 2 in the L3 months\n* Leo are 38% winrate on 13 maps of Dust 2 in the L3 months\n* Fire Flux are 8-3 in the last month on Dust 2, winning 59% of rounds on the map while having won only 40% of pistol rounds\n* Leo are 2-5 in the last month on Dust 2, most recently they lost to HAVU and also have an ugly loss to Wildcard Academy\n\n**Mirage Stats:**\n\n* Fire Flux are 64% winrate on 11 maps of Mirage in the L3 months\n* Leo are 30% winrate on 10 maps of Mirage in the L3 months\n* Fire Flux are 3-2 in the last month on the map, Leo are 1-2 on the map",

Maybe he wants to have a better h2h. Maybe he just gets inspired. He showed this with the Turkey team on Eurobasket, where he scored 28 in a 95-90 decisive group stage game. That pushed Serbia to Finland, the game they later on lost.\nMaybe he really does think Jokic is the best player in the world, and he wants to show he can beat him and outplay him. Why not. A legitimate motivation there.\n\n- In the last seasons 3 games they played, he didn't have the chance to show his progress really, first 2 games Jokic didn't play, in the third one in April, he only scored 14 in some 20-25 minutes, terrible performance from Houston there, they were down 31 in the first 3 quarters. Jokic also didn't push it, 18 7 7, a minimum effort.\n- I have Gordon as questionable for the game. This benefits his chances here greatly, but even if Gordon can play, it stays more than solid.\n- It seems that Jokic doesn't really care for this non-existent rivalship or the one to be. He would probably swap his 0 points for a win immediately. \n- Finally, in his last 3 games, Sengun had 28, 30, 25, showing a great form.\n\n1.5u today - extra confidence, and I played an alt, point less than the standard limit, 22.5, which should also be fine.",

If you hopped off the train after 4 straight wins and a bad UConn loss then you done messed up!! We don’t lose two in a row baby! For those who remained on the train we cashed in tonight on a soft line!🤣🤣\n\nEvent: South Carolina vs Butler (NCAAB) (1pm central) \n\nPOTD: Butler -1.5 (-110) (1U)\n\n-everything is bet to win unit amount-\n\nWrite up: \n\nWhen you break this matchup down, Butler simply profiles as the more polished team heading into this neutral-site tournament. Through four games, the Bulldogs are averaging 95.8 points per game on 49% shooting from the field and an elite 40.2% from three. Every team that South Carolina has faced so far besides NC A&T who is 280th in the nation in 3 point percentage is below rank 300 and below 30% from three. Southern miss even took these cocks to overtime! Compare that to South Carolina, who despite their 4-0 start, are hitting just 39% from the field and 33% from deep. That gap in perimeter efficiency is massive: Butler is knocking down over 10 threes per game, while the Gamecocks are closer to 6–7 per game, meaning the Bulldogs can stretch defenses and create separation quickly. Butler also dominates the glass, pulling down 46 rebounds per game with a +15 margin, showing they’re not just a finesse team but one that controls possessions.\n\nTempo is another key differentiator. Butler plays at the 70th-ranked adjusted tempo, reflecting Thad Matta’s fast-paced style that emphasizes quick possessions and high shot volume. They average 65 field goal attempts per game, compared to South Carolina’s 60 attempts, and they convert those looks at far superior splits. South Carolina, meanwhile, ranks 270th in adjusted tempo, preferring slower, grind-it-out possessions. That’s a dangerous mismatch against Butler’s pace and shooting, especially on a neutral floor where early-season chemistry matters.\nContinuity matters in November tournaments, and Butler has it. Matta’s squad features returning contributors like leading guard Finley Bizjack, who have stepped seamlessly into bigger roles, and a slew of talented transfers in Michael Ajayi off a solid year at Gonzaga who is averaging a double double and Jalen Jackson (senior) who was a 20ppg player on a competitive IPFW team for two years while South Carolina is still piecing together rotations with transfers like Meechie Johnson, who has bounced between Ohio State and Columbia multiple times. That lack of stability shows in the Gamecocks’ reliance on depth—ten players averaging double-digit minutes—but depth doesn’t equal cohesion. Butler’s core has been built within the program, and their offensive chemistry is evident in their 21 assists per game compared to South Carolina’s 13.8.\nSouth Carolina’s bench explosion against Radford (50 points) looks impressive on paper, but Butler is a different animal. The Bulldogs’ defense is holding opponents to 43% shooting and just 28% from three, meaning those secondary scorers won’t find the same rhythm. Meanwhile, Butler’s offensive leaders are efficient: Bizjack is shooting 47.8% from three, Jamie Kaiser Jr. is at 42.1%, and Jalen Jackson adds another 40% from deep. South Carolina’s top scorer, Meechie Johnson, is hitting only 39% from the field, and while his 40% from three is respectable, he doesn’t have the supporting cast of consistent shooters to match Butler’s arsenal.\n\nThe one weakness for Butler has been turnovers—15 per game—but this is mitigated by South Carolina’s inability to force them. The Gamecocks rank 324th nationally in steals and average just 11 turnovers themselves, meaning Butler’s Achilles heel is unlikely to be exploited here. In fact, Butler’s pace and shot volume should magnify their efficiency advantage, while South Carolina’s slower style leaves them vulnerable to runs.\n\nFinally, Butler has already proven they can compete against continuity and talent, going on the road and losing by just two to an SMU team loaded with returning pieces. That performance showed Butler’s guards can handle pressure and execute in tough environments. On a neutral court, with their superior shooting, rebounding margin, faster tempo, and more cohesive backcourt, Butler’s continuity at the pg position should shine.\n\nBottom line: Butler’s shooting edge, rebounding margin, and program continuity make them the right side. South Carolina’s depth is smoke and mirrors against elite competition, and their slower tempo won’t hold up against Butler’s pace. My power ratings make this closer to -4, so laying -1.5 is tremendous value. Butler is the play. I would bet this right now! As every bet I submit the lines change shortly after. Nebraska was -6.5 when I bet it last night and closed at -8.5 this morning, and still won by double digits like I said! Let’s get a win with butler and take this momentum into another successful football weekend! As always, cheers 🍻\n\nUpdate: line has already moved to 2.5… not too worried there but definitely get in there before anything more",

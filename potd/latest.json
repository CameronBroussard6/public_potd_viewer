      "text": "Record: 178-148, +5.18 units\n\nLast Pick: Borna Gojo ML vs Tristan Boyer (-152, 1 unit): Win\n\nTennis | Davis Cup World Group I (Kazakstan vs Monaco) + Cleveland Challenger | Times TBD\n\nToday's Pick: Alexander Bublik vs Hugo Nys | **Bublik to win 2-0 at -500.**\n\nBorna Gojo vs Quinn Vandecasteele | **Gojo ML at -364.**\n\n**Combined odds: -192 (DK). 1 unit.**\n\nWrite-up: Gojo closed at -312, and while he faced a break point early in the first set, it was smooth sailing after that. \n\nReasoning for the first leg is pretty simple: Hugo Nys is a solid doubles player, but he hasn't stepped foot on the singles court in over a year. In fact, he hasn't been a full-time singles player since 2020, with his only singles appearances since then consisting of two as an alternate into ATP qualifying (this can sometimes happen when no singles players are available on site), two as a wildcard into his home Monte-Carlo tournament, and two Davis Cup appearances due to a lack of options for Monaco beyond Valentin Vacherot. In the 3 Monte-Carlo appearances, he faced Munar, Ruusuvuori, and Rinderknech, had higher odds than this in all of those matches (even though I think this is an even tougher matchup), and lost all of them 2-0. He did actually score one win over Morrocco's Yassine Dlimi at the 2024 Davis Cup; however, Dlimi is an ITF-level player, and Nys was still priced as a significant underdog. Bublik obviously has a massive advantage in this matchup, and the only concerns would be him not taking things seriously or Nys somehow servebotting his way to a set on indoor hard. In terms of Bublik's motivation, I feel like he's become a new player in that regard lately, and he'll be playing in front of a home crowd in Astana, one of his primary training bases. In addition, the surface being used (GreenSet Comfort) isn't known for being particularly fast, and it's hard to see Nys consistently holding serve, especially as he's far from the biggest server on the doubles tour. I expect Bublik to serve well and take control of this from the start. \n\nFor the second leg of this play, I'm going with Gojo again, this time to defeat Quinn Vandecasteele in the quarterfinals. As I mentioned in my last write-up, I think this could be a week where Gojo wins the title, and I don't see Vandecasteele being able to stop him. Quinn has had a long week, playing four matches back-to-back (6.68/10, 6.45, 6.61, 6.82), and I don't see him at the same level as Boyer. If you want evidence, he was a +175 dog against Cassone in R32; Boyer faced off against Cassone a couple weeks ago and was favored. As a result, I don't think these odds should be so close to where Gojo closed against Boyer. Vandecasteele is a solid grinder, but I don't think he has the weapons to keep up with Gojo on these fast courts.",

I see multiple reasons for Dalla to win this match\n\n1) He is leading their H2H with a 1-0, winning their last match 2-0\n\n2) He has played 4 good matches already and qualified to this tournament, while Romano got a wild card. I see him in better shape and form right now.\n\n3) He is ranked better and got more experience than the young Romano, who is only 20 years old.\n\nI see a good value in this bet and good luck!\n\n\\_\n\nIf you follow my bets, I would appreciate a little tip - I spend a lot of time analyzing the bets day to day.

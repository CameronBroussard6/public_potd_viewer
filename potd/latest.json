      "text": "POTD Record: 5-2 (+3.7U)\n\nLast Pick: Texans ML (-130) (1U) \n\n🤮🤮🤮what a disgusting fucking loss. 6 trips to the red zone, no touchdowns. CJ stroud gets hurt. Led the entire fucking game until the clock hits 0. The public cashed in big time and I couldn’t be more fucking sick. That’s life tho, and you know I ain’t losing two in a row.\n\nA loss is the reason your boy needs some damn therapy😂 \n\nEvent: Florida vs Arizona (7pm central)\n\nPOTD: Arizona +4.5 (-130) (2U) \n\n-everything is bet to win unit amount-\n\nWrite up: College basketball starts tomorrow baby! My best sport by far, and what better way than to have my second 2U pick since being on POTD (first one was rockets -15 last week and they won by 30). I love love love a good spot against the defending national champ in college basketball. I mean the public is gonna be all over Florida on the short spread of 3.5 (yes I bought to 4.5, sue me motherfucker). Look, this Florida team is going to have growing pains to begin, this is a completely new roster and they’re going to be traveling way out west to a place that’s very familiar to the wildcats, Las Vegas. Arizona fans are known for traveling well and the environment in T-Mobile Arena will be a home court feeling for UA in what is expected to be a sold out crowd. Arizona will be fully loaded again with four key returners in Jaden Badley, Tobe Awaka, Anthony Dell’Orso and Motiejus Krivas. Plus, Lloyd and his staff signed the No. 2 recruiting class according to 24/7 Sports. This is an early season game and guard play matters a lot, and veteran guard Jaden Bradley should be able to do enough to help will this team to a possible win. I truly do think this spread is a bit large even at 3.5, but I’m smashing a two unit spot so I wanted to give myself another leg with 4.5. Its been a very fun first week on POTD, I’m not gonna sit here and complain about a 5-2 record at all (although 6-1 would’ve been fucking sweet) and once again I’m blessed to be able to write another one for yall again… this is going to cash, and let’s get back on track fellas, cheers 🍻",

      "text": "Record: 18-7\n\nLast Five Predictions (Old - New): ✅❌❌✅✅\n\nNet Units: +25.44\n\nYesterday's Pick:  Naestved to win v FC Helsingor and o1.5 total goals. 3u @ $2 ✅\n\nNaestved scored within three minutes which was great. However there was a fair wait before the second goal which came in the 86th minute. \n\nHelsingor scored late into injury time. \n\n2-1 win. Happy days for us \n\nToday's Pick:  Mjallby to win at Varnamo and Under 3.5 total goals. 3u @ 2.60\n\nPick: I normally wouldn't go this high price-wise (if you want to be safer, you can just back the ML at about 1.50). \n\nMjallby have already won the league, and Varnamo are already relegated. \n\nSo in a way, neither have too much jeopardy in this game. \n\nIn their last game, Mjallby showed that they're not taking the rest of the season off. They copped an early goal last matchday and fought back to win 2-1. Plenty of teams would just half-ass that game... And tbh, not many would blame them. \n\nMjallby have been great away from home with a 11-2-1 record on the road. Well.... They've got the highest points total in league history, they've obviously been good.\n\nHowever, in those 14 games away from home only three of them have gone over the 3.5 goal line, and the last of those was early August. The other two were within their first 4 away games. \n\nEven in their home games, only two of those have cleared 3.5 goals. \n\nSo most of their wins haven't been complete goal-fests... Even against the bottom teams.  \n\nThis game they travel to last place Varnamo who have been dire this season. \n\nFor a team who are dead last, only having a -9 goal difference at home is somewhat tight. They've had a lot of draws at home which helps with this. \n\nOnly about 50% of Varnamo gone games have gone over the 3.5 goal t\n\nI think Mjallby win this, and I cant see them piling on the score. \n\nAgain, if you're after that extra safety, there's probably safer options in this match like just going the win. But for me the juice is worth the squeeze.",

      "text": "Record: 2-1\n\nNet Units: 1\n\nPrevious Pick: Broncos ML +105 ✅\nWell that was close! Hopefully Stroud makes a quick recovery.\n\nEvent: NFL Football Arizona Cardinals (2-5) @ Dallas Cowboys (3-4-1) 11/3 8:15 PM EST\n\nPOTD: Trey McBride TE anytime TD Scorer +110 (1 Unit)\n\nWrite up: This one is pretty simple. Trey McBride enters this Monday night matchup on an absolute tear, having scored 2 TDs against the Packers and another vs the Colts. Even following Kyler Murray’s injury and Jacoby Brissett taking the reins of the Arizona offense, McBride has remained a focal point. And if the Cardinals want any shot at pulling off this upset, they’ve gotta feed him the ball.\n\nBesides momentum, another factor on our side is the defense McBride will be facing. Dallas LOVES to give up points, and in every game this season their opponents have put up at least 20. I expect the Cowboys to win a close shootout, but look for McBride to find pay dirt. BOL to those tailing, let’s do some winning!",

      "text": "Record: 219-205 Net Units: -21.39 46-49 on 1.5u plays, 36-38 on 2u plays, 1-2 on 3u plays. All picks 1 unit, unless stated otherwise.\n\n\nLast event: Soccer/Football, [Netherlands Eredivisie] Heracles vs Zwolle\nLast pick: BTTS + Over 2.5 goals @ 2.00 win\n\n\nEvent: Soccer/Football, [Poland Ekstraklasa] Lechia Gdansk vs Radomiak Radom\n\n\nPick: BTTS + Over 2.5 goals @ 2.00\n\n\nTwo sides that average 3.5 and 3.9 total goals per game. In home games this season, Lechia have covered in 2/5 games, with misses against some of the lowest scoring sides in the league, when they get a suitable matchup they usually play out high scoring games. Radomiak have no clean sheets in away games and have covered this line in 5/7 games, matches that include plenty goals against opposition that is better than Lechia and also better defensively. New coach for Radomiak here, however he does seem good to continue the trend based on his stats.",

      "text": "10-9-0\nUp 4.5 units \n\nLast POTD: NFL, Bears-2.5 v Bengals -110 ✅\n\nWhat an ending. Sweatiest win of my life I think. 14 point lead blown. Cincy takes the lead with under a minute after Chicago lets them get an onside kick that doesn’t go 10 yards. Loveland runs through a tackle because the defender doesn’t wrap up and scores the game winner. Wow. \n\nToday’s POTD: NFL, Cowboys -3.5 v Cardinals +100\n\nUnits 3 units to win 3\n\nCardinals Offense \nTotal 22nd\nPassing 23rd\nRushing 20th\n\nCardinals Defense \nTotal 19th\nPassing 25th\nRushing 12th\n\nCowboys offense \nTotal 2nd\nPassing 1st\nRushing 13th\n\nCowboys Defense \nTotal 31st\nPassing 31st\nRushing 29th\n\nWe’re not over thinking this one. \n\nGame is in Dallas. \nDallas is 2-0–1 at home this season. \n\nDallas just lost last week to Denver in embarassing fashion. \nDallas hasn’t lost 2 straight this season. \n\nCowboys and Cardinals are both going to put up points. Dallas needs to get back on track after an egg of a game last week. \n\nDak was playing at a MVP level before last week and I anticipate he’ll get back to that this week. \n\nJacoby is starting for Arizona and what a great defense to face for him. They are the 31st defense in football so Arizona should get their points. \n\nWith that being said, Arizona has a mediocre defense and Dak and the cowboys will feast. Cardinals will score but they are just out gunned with a backup qb and a third string rb. \n\nI also really like the over here but, like I said, I don’t want to over think this one. \n\nCowboys 38-30",

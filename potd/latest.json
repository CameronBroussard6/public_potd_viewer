      "text": "Record: 12-3 \n\nUnits: +8.30U \n\nTotal Staked: 15U Total Returned: 23.30U \n\nPick: NBA Mavericks v Pelicans \n\n1U Cooper Flagg 5+ 1Q points @ $2.50 (+150 American), B365 \n\nWrite-Up: As much as I like to fade the Nets, I want to fade the Pelicans here & chase what I think is real value. The Pelicans have a league worst opposition 2FG % - 65%! Next worst is the Kings at 60%. This 5.5% (when not rounding) difference is the same as the Kings at 2nd worst & the Hornets at 18th. Essentially, the Pelicans defence is incredibly bad. \n\nSo why Flagg? He gets excellent 1Q minutes, averaging 8.1 this season and getting between 7-9.5 minutes consistently. Without AD, he has gone 3 points on 1-4 FG shooting (0-3 from 2FG) v Pistons and 9 points on 4-5 FG v Rockets. Both teams have a lot more serious defending & experience than the Pelicans missing Murray, Zion & potentially Missi. \n\nFlagg is averaging 8.5 2FG shots a game, and making 3.6 of them (42.3%) which is not great - however, I’m expecting an uptick in this % v the league worst Pelicans. Flagg has been playing as a guard, and the starting guards for the Pelicans are likely to be Fears (same draft year, no experience gap, 4 inches 12 pounds smaller than Flagg) and Poole (not a noted defender, ballpark similar size to Fears). The bigger starters for the Pels (Jones, maybe Looney) will be matched-up to PJ Washington & Gafford, even with any zone defence etc. The Pels also just burnt 37 & 36 minutes to beat a Hornets team without Ball or Miller on Murphy & Jones, and have to face a B2B so I really do expect the Mavs to score easily early. \n\nHis line is set at O3.5 @ $1.80 but I just don’t think 1 point is worth 70 cents, especially when he’s not a complete waste from 3pt range. I think I’m a much better chance to end up in profit in the long run taking that extra point for a lot higher odds - it’s not 1994 anymore, the 3-ball game is q huge factor! \n\nLastly, the Pels concede 31.4 points in 1Q on average so I do like the points here. \n\nObviously, I’ve picked a reasonably long odds pick by POTD standards here, so if thinking of tailing, do so carefully. You can’t expect to win on odds like this consistently, but I do think it’s a super value pick. I had my eye on this match (Pels B2B and Zion out, Mavs a bit fresher and at home), and think Flagg has the size & game to really show out here when he doesn’t quite get the same sort of experienced, big defences he’s been facing.",

      "text": "Record: 1-3 \n\nLet’s try this again huh…\n\nFixture(s): \n\nClub Brugge vs Barcalona (3:00pm EST)\n\nNewcastle vs Athletic Club (3:00pm EST)\n\nPOTD: Barcalona ML + Newcastle ML (+116 DK)\n\nUnits: 2.5 (to win 2.6)\n\nBarcalona ML pick:\nI really don’t understand how Barcalona ML is at a -185, I understand they’re facing injuries in the midfield with the recent one being Pedri out, also Lamine will probably not play the full 90 maybe not even full 60 considering he is going through an untreatable injury (pelvic injury) which he will have to learn to adapt to and nourish throughout his whole career. But still, Barcalona has an insane amount of quality and this is a champions league game. It is fair to assume that Hansi Flick could potentially be ready to not go “all out” on this game, however, if he were to go all out here a win would almost ensure a passing into the next stage of champs league, given that their last two games will be against Slavia Prague and FC Kopenhavn. Regardless of this though, even given Barca’s injuries and subpar expected starting lineup, I think they dispatch Club Brugge.\n\nPrediction: Barcalona 3-1 Club Brugge\n\nNewcastle ML: \nI’ll keep this one short. A weak and battered Athletic Club is visiting St James Park, one of the only stadiums that really becomes a “fortress”, having to play a relatively in form, and healthy Newcastle team. Although Gordon is projected to be out for this match, I think Barnes fills his place perfectly and we should see a Gordon substitution around the 60 minute mark if things are not going our way to change the tides.\n\nPrediction: New Castle 2-0 Atheltic Club\n\nAt the end of the day I’ve missed 3 picks and only won 1 and I fully understand if you don’t trust in my picks. If you fade me BOL, if you tail, I hope we win man fr🫶🙏",

      "text": "Record: 1-0\n\n\nNet Units: +2\n\n\nROI: 140%\n\n\nHOCKEY | NHL | 7pm / PST\n\nBest Bet Recommendation: Chicago Blackhawks Moneyline (+146) \n1unit\n\n\n\nThis recommendation is predicated on a significant market mispricing. The current line (Vancouver -178) appears to be an overreaction to a surface-level narrative—a rested home favorite versus a road-tripping underdog—while ignoring three critical, data-driven equalizers. The analytical model identifies that: \n\n1) The goaltending matchup is a statistical wash, with both teams deploying elite-performing netminders. \n\n2) The 5-on-5 performance and core offensive/defensive metrics are nearly identical, with Chicago holding a slight statistical edge in both goals for and against per game. \n\n3) The most significant, high-leverage mismatch in the game—special teams—provides a distinct advantage for Chicago. This analysis capitalizes on the public's likely bias against a team on a long road trip, creating substantial positive expected value (+EV) on the +146 underdog price.\n\nIn-Depth Rationale: Chicago Blackhawks Moneyline (+146)\n\nThis wager is a textbook example of identifying value. Value is defined as a significant discrepancy between the market price (the odds) and the true, data-driven probability of an outcome. The CHI@VAN matchup is a case where the market price (VAN -178 / CHI +146) 1 implies Vancouver has a win probability of approximately 64%. Our analysis, based on the provided data, concludes this probability is dramatically inflated. The true probability is much closer to a 50/50 \"coin flip,\" which means the +146 price (an implied probability of just 40.6%) presents an exceptional positive expected value (+EV) opportunity.\n\nThe case for this wager is built on four data-driven pillars that systematically dismantle the justification for the -178 price on Vancouver.\n\nA. Pillar 1: Deconstructing the \"Tired Dog\" Narrative (The Situational Fallacy)\n\nThe primary, and perhaps only, reason Vancouver is a -178 favorite is the situational narrative. The Chicago Blackhawks are in the midst of a \"season-high six-game road trip\" 2 and have been \"winless\" on that trip.3 This creates a powerful, and popular, public betting narrative of a \"tired, demoralized\" team traveling to face a \"rested, confident\" home favorite.\n\nThis model, however, distinguishes between acute fatigue and cumulative fatigue.\n\nAcute Fatigue: This is the most potent, negative factor in NHL modeling. It occurs when a team is playing on the second night of a back-to-back, especially if travel is involved.\n\nCumulative Fatigue: This is a less-defined factor from a long road trip.\n\nThe market appears to be pricing Chicago as if they are in an acute fatigue spot. But the data shows this is false. The Blackhawks last played on November 4.4 The Vancouver Canucks also last played on November 4.6 In terms of immediate rest, the teams are in an identical, non-B2B position.\n\nWhile the \"winless\" nature of the trip  suggests a \"demoralization\" factor, this is a non-quantifiable psychological variable. An alternative, and equally plausible, psychological narrative is that this is a \"get right\" spot. A long road trip can galvanize a team, and facing a heavy -178 line provides a significant \"chip on the shoulder\" motivating factor.\n\nBecause the acute rest is equal, the situational advantage for Vancouver is negligible and is being dramatically over-weighted by the market. This is the first and most critical mispricing.\n\nB. Pillar 2: The Goaltending Dead-Heat (Neutralizing the Favorite's Advantage)\n\nA primary path to victory for a heavy favorite is a significant advantage between the pipes. That advantage does not exist in this matchup. This game features a true \"ace vs. ace\" goaltending duel, which neutralizes the favorite and pushes the game's outcome onto the skaters.\n\nVancouver - Thatcher Demko: Demko is a top-tier goaltender. His 2025-26 statistics confirm this: in 8 games, he has posted a 2.41 GAA and a.917 SV%.7 He is the foundation of the Canucks' system.\n\nChicago - Spencer Knight: Knight has been equally elite. In 9 games, he has a 2.62 GAA and a.913 SV%.9 His advanced metrics show he has 5.81 Goals Saved Above Average (GSAA), confirming his performance is not a fluke.11\n\nThe statistical difference between a.917 SV% and a.913 SV% is negligible. Neither team has a discernible edge in net. This is crucial: it removes Vancouver's \"easy\" path to a low-scoring, 2-1 victory. The market confirms this understanding by setting a very low game total of 5.5 goals.1\n\nIf the goaltending is a \"wash,\" the -178 price must be justified by a massive superiority among the skaters. The data shows this superiority does not exist.\n\nC. Pillar 3: The 5-on-5 Statistical Mirror (The Teams are Clones)\n\nThe market price implies Vancouver is a far superior 5-on-5 team. The data shows this is definitively false. When comparing the two teams, they are statistical equals. In fact, a close reading suggests a slight advantage for Chicago.\n\nOffensive Production:\n\nChicago: 3.00 Goals For / Game 12\n\nVancouver: 2.86 Goals For / Game 12\n\nConclusion: Slight quantitative advantage to Chicago.\n\nDefensive Prevention:\n\nChicago: 2.92 Goals Against / Game 12\n\nVancouver: 3.21 Goals Against / Game 12\n\nConclusion: Slight quantitative advantage to Chicago.\n\nOverall Performance (Points Percentage):\n\nChicago: 5-5-3 record = 13 points in 13 games. 1.00 pts/game..500 pts%.4\n\nVancouver: 7-7-0 record = 14 points in 14 games. 1.00 pts/game..500 pts%.4\n\nConclusion: The teams are identical.\n\nRecent Form:\n\nChicago: Last 10 Games record is 5-3-2.13\n\nVancouver: Last 10 Games record is 5-5-0.14\n\nConclusion: Advantage to Chicago.\n\nThere is no quantitative, data-driven evidence to support the claim that Vancouver is 14 percentage points (64% implied vs. 50% true) better than Chicago. At 5-on-5, they are, at best, evenly matched. \n\n\n\n\nThe \"Morale\" Narrative is Real: The primary risk is that the \"winless road trip\" 3 is not just a narrative, but a tangible, non-quantifiable psychological factor. If team morale is truly broken, the team could \"fold\" after an early 1-0 deficit.\n\n\nSpecial Teams Variance: A bet based on a special teams mismatch relies on penalties being called. If the referees \"let them play\" and the game has few whistles, Chicago's primary advantage (PP vs. PK) is neutralized.\n\n\nGoaltender \"Theft\": While the seasonal stats for Knight and Demko are nearly identical, either goaltender is capable of a transcendent, \"game-stealing\" performance. Thatcher Demko (.917 SV%) 8 is fully capable of shutting down Chicago's offense entirely.\n\n\nHome Ice Advantage (Tactics): Vancouver is at Rogers Arena 4, which provides the home coach with the \"last change,\" allowing them to tactically match their top defensive pairing against Chicago's top offensive line (led by Connor Bedard 16)",

As predicted Man City ended up winning but Bournemouth netted one goal.\n\nToday's match: Inter vs Kairat Almaty (Soccer/UCL) & Oklahoma City Thunder vs Portland Trailblazers (Basketball/NBA)\n\nPick: Inter 60 min ML + Thunder ML (-148, MGM)\n\nOKC head into tonight's matchup against the Blazers with an undefeated record. I truly believe Shai and this OKC team just know how to win, they started the season with two double overtime games and came out on top in both of them and have taken care of business when they are expected to with their last 3 wins being won by an avg of 23 points each game. They played last night against the Clippers so this will be the second leg of a b2b but Shai got the luxury of sitting out the entire 4th quarter last game as the Thunder won by 19 after trailing the Clippers by 13 at one point in the first quarter. The Thunder have also owned this matchup for most of Shai's time in OKC with the Thunder winning 16 of the last 16 H2H matchups vs the Blazers since 2022. The only concern here is if they rest Chet on the b2b since last game vs the Clippers was his first game back from injury. If he sits I still think they still have more than enough depth to get the win but obviously I'd always prefer the true starter to be available.\n\nNow onto our next leg, this game is just a huge mismatch which you can already tell from the odds on all books with Inter being a massive favorite. Inter has not conceded a goal at all in UCL so far this year and won all their games comfortably. Kairat Almaty on the other hand has gotten blown out by Sporting Lisbon 4-1 and Madrid 5-0. Trusting in Inter at home to get a goal sometime before the 60 min mark and hold onto that lead which shouldn't be too much to ask for with the talent gap here. BOL and bet responsibly.",

Bayern starting powerful with 2 goals definitely helped us. If it wasn't for the red card they would've score 3 again I reckon. But the red card put PSG in the perfect position to make at least 1 and they did to make this pick hit!\n\n**Today's Pick:** ***Galatasaray or Draw(1.36) + Barcelona to win(1.48) @ 2.01 -- 3 units***\n\n**Write up:**\n\n**Galatasaray v Ajax**\n\nKeeping up with the picks against Ajax in the CL, they are dog in domestic matches let alone Champions League games. Meanwhile Galatasaray is in good recent form. Their only loss this season was against Frankfurt mid September. I dont think Ajax is in the kind of state to trouble Galatasaray currently. I've picked Double Chance here to minimize the risk.\n\n**Club Brugge v Barcelona**\n\nThis pick was mostly picked by me because I believe there is a big difference in the teams here. I am Always a bit hesitant with Barcelona if I'm being honest. But in this case I am, mostly because of their opponent. If you look at Brugge, they look to be in form: WWWLW. But I've looked into this. 3 of these wins were against teams that are in the relegation zone in Belgium: Dender(16th), Antwerp(15th) & Leuven(13th). Oh and in these games they haven't even managed to dominate once. The other win was in a cup game against an amateur team. The loss that stands inbetween those wins was the CL game against Bayern(0-4), where I picked Bayern over 2,5 goal in that game and so I analyzed Brugge in the games before that for that pick. I still remember it and I know for a fact Brugge was struggling at that point already as well, and they haven't improved from what I can find. Whereas Barcelona have improved recently because they've kind of managed to find their way of playing without Lewandowski and Raphinha. Especially against teams worse then them they seem to being able to outscore them. I was doubting between putting them over 1.5 goal but that odd is only 1.33. Brugge is worse then Barca so they should be able to outscore them again.\n\n**Best of luck if tailing! 🍀**\n\n**PS:** If you want you can check my record and units won on [https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/OliveCritical5134-qXXxJZ](https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/OliveCritical5134-qXXxJZ)",

The Ball State Cardinals enter this matchup following a disappointing 21-7 loss away at Northern Illinois. But taking a closer look at their record reveals an interesting trend: Ball State is undefeated at home so far this season, with wins vs FCS New Hampshire, Akron and even Ohio University. The Cardinals have taken care of business at Scheumann Stadium so far this season, and I don’t expect that to change.\n\nThe Kent State Golden Flashes enter this game having clinched their best record since 2022 (where they won 5 games) following wins against FCS Merrimack, UMass, and an upset win vs BGSU on October 25th. While Kent might not be the most impressive team in the country, they have routinely put up points against mediocre conference opponents this season (28 against Buffalo, 42 against UMass, and 24 against BG). I expect them to score tonight against an opponent of similar quality.\n\nUltimately I think Ball State is the superior side, and they will extend their unbeaten streak at home. But between the awkward Wednesday kickoff and Kent State’s recent momentum, I’m not expecting them to win by a massive margin. BOL to those tailing, let’s do some winning!",

Both of these teams suck. One of them sucks much worse. The Huskies are having a tough year, they sit at 2-6, aren't particularly good at anything, and were losers of 6 straight before their win against Ball State last time out. Let's compare some stats.\n\nToledo total offense: 31st (436.5ypg)     Northern Illinois total offense: 130th (276.1ypg)\n\nToledo scoring offense: 48th (31.8ppg)     Northern Illinois scoring offense: 132nd (13.4ppg)\n\nToledo total defense: 3rd (236.2 ypg)     Northern Illinois total defense: 46th (343.9ypg)\n\nToledo scoring defense: 10th (16ppg)     Northern Illinois scoring defense: 50th (22.12ppg)\n\nThe Huskie's offense is anemic, and trust me, as an Iowa fan, I know bad offense when I see it. They are literally almost the worst in the country at moving the ball and scoring the ball. They have more interceptions on the year so far than passing touchdowns. Their highest scoring game so far in eight contests is 21 points.\n\nNIU has played a team with similar elite defensive numbers as Toledo this year in San Diego State, I wonder how they fared?...They scored 3 points...\n\nIn all 4 of Toledo's wins, they have covered this 14.5 point spread comfortably, against very similar teams to NIU.\n\nI'm not concerned that Toledo got whooped by WSU last time out, WSU is somehow actually a respectable team this year. If anything, that should translate to a tough week of practice with them wanting to come out and right the ship and get back on track to bowl eligibility.\n\nToledo is 5-3 ATS this year and 4-0 ATS at home. NIU is 2-6 ATS and 1-3 ATS on the road.\n\nThe hook is annoying on a 14-point line but I think Toledo should be up double digits at halftime, so it surely won't come into play, right??? If you watch this game, you're sick in the head, good luck!",

As someone who has played, watched, and bet on a lot of sports for a number of years. I consider myself knowledgeable in the realm of sports and believe I can help some of you guys out with my most educated picks. \n\nOnce again, I am not a psychic (I don’t think). This is gambling at the end of the day so bet at your own risk. Loses will happen (maybe).\n\nWithout further ado. The writeup. \n\nI believe this is too small of a spread. Delaware State is projected to finish tied for 5th out of 8 teams in the lowly MEAC conference, which is a bottom-5 athletic conference in D1. I know preseason rankings don’t mean that much, however this is indicating that the Hornets do not have a very strong squad to match the quality of the Temple Owls, who play in the much stronger American Conference. Temple is a bit of a wild card as far as season outlook goes, bringing in 11 new players, but by all means Temple, led by Year 3 coach Adam Fisher, should have more than enough talent and experience to outmatch Delaware State and win this game by 20+ points. \n\n(Temple was also 3rd in the nation in FT% last year, so they should be able to knock down their freebies, a common issue faced when betting college basketball)\n\nBest of luck and I hope this is the start of something magical🧏‍♂️",

      "text": "**POTD Record 40-36-1**\n\nWhat a game!!! I said in my last post that this game was going to be gross, and I was half correct, however this game was also so god damn entertaining. I mean it had all you could ask for. I would be lying if I wasn’t standing in front of my TV one second screaming in excitement, to the next second about to smash a chair through it. 11-0 run to end the game and stole the W and covering the -1.5pt spread. My god was that fun.\n\nBack at it and I want to start off by saying that I don’t like this play compared to most of my plays. The card has teams in spots I like a lot, but the spreads are too scary to fire on, but given the options this is by far my favorite.\n\n**Spurs +2.5**\n\nBoth of these teams have been hot out of the gate. SA stormed out to a 5–0 start before finally getting their asses kicked in their last game vs PHX. The 5–1 Spurs have generally dominated by running teams off the floor in spurts and forcing contact inside. Los Angeles is 6–2 after beating Miami and Portland to close the road trip. The Lakers have piled up points (130 vs. Miami) but suffered losses to Golden State and Portland, and have played 4 of their last 5 games on consecutive nights. In short, L.A. is clicking offensively but on a short rest, while the Spurs had two days off after Sunday’s loss.\n\nSan Antonio has been relatively healthy on its core, but key role players are banged up or out. Dylan Harper is now out and will miss multiple weeks. Not to mention all the other guys they have out (Fox, Kornet, Olynk, & Sochan). In other words, the Spurs’ rotation is thinner than it looks on paper.\n\nBy the numbers, the Spurs’ offense and defense are both very elite. Like championship level. San Antonio at 118.2 offensive rating and 108.2 defensive rating, ranking roughly 7th–8th and 2nd in the NBA, respectively. In simpler terms, they score efficiently and have the league’s stingiest defense to date. The Lakers similarly score at a high clip (about 117.7 ORtg, roughly top-10) but their defense is middle-of-the-pack. Off the glass, San Antonio is one of the best rebounding teams (Wemby grabs 13rb on his own) and protects the rim. Pace-wise, the Spurs run a deliberate ~98 possessions per game, while the Lakers play a tick faster. I think this should favor San Antonio’s half-court style and bigs’ impact.\n\nAside from the data, I just saw what Wemby has done to teams this season. If he is really as special as we all think he is, he will for sure bounce back from his 9pt/9rb game the other night (also he had 4 fucking blocks…), and show out in LA on ESPN. This is a chance for him to make big splash. Reaves is currently questionable for lakers, however even without him they will have Luka, and any game Luka is playing in, I am a little nervous when I have the other side. Regardless, will be an exciting game and I cant wait to watch it.",

      "text": "Record: 156-135, -2.14 units\n\nLast Pick: Andre Ilagan +1.5 sets vs Oliver Tarvet (-120, 1 unit): Win\n\nTennis | Knoxville Challenger | 11:00 AM EST \n\nToday's Pick: Jay Clarke vs Stefan Kozlov | **Clarke ML at -142 (DK). 1 unit.**\n\nWrite-up: I don't actually think that was a great pick, as it was my first non-CLV play in a while (Ilagan +1.5 sets closed at around +100 on most books). However, Ilagan did end up playing a strong match and even held match points in the third-sets tiebreak. That brought me to 9-1 in my last ten picks, and pushed me even closer to getting back to break-even over a decent sample. \n\nInteresting matchup between Stefan Kozlov and Jay Clarke here in Knoxville. Kozlov is a former prodigy who never really panned out, but has continued to grind it out on the Challenger Tour with some success. However, this has been a bit of a down year for him, and he actually took a bit of time off the pro tour to play some prize-money open tournaments, where he won most of his matches against lower-level competition but still took a couple of questionable losses. In his first match back against Dominique Rolland, the market pushed him from a big favorite to just -161 pre-match, and he ended up winning in three sets (6.52 performance rating).\n\nMeanwhile, Jay Clarke was able to get the job done against Francisco Rocha in the opening round by a 4 & 1 scoreline (6.89 performance rating). I recently went against him in Charlottesville, but that was honestly more out of confidence in his opponent than a lack of confidence in him. Clarke's best results this year have come on clay courts, which reward his spin-reliant game, but he's still an all-court player in general. Even if he doesn't have any big weapons on this surface, neither does Kozlov, and so I expect this to be a bit of a grinding battle. \n\nGoing back to the Rolland price, Dominique is a solid but unspectacular college player who made one good run a few weeks ago in Tiburon. In that Tiburon tournament, Rolland closed at +333 against Tyler Zink, who Clarke was recently around even money against in Charlottesville. Honestly, I view Rolland as a similar tier player to Francisco Rocha, who Clarke closed at -333 against in the first round here. Obviously not quite an apples-to-apples comparison, but it should give you a decent idea of why this price seems a bit strange. Kozlov always has the talent to do some damage, and his form coming into this match is a bit uncertain, so I wouldn't take this too far past these odds. However, I still see 1-unit value here. Clarke comes into this match with more recent indoor match play, more confidence from the market, and a more convincing first-round win, so I like him even as a small favorite.\n\nNote: The [POTD Capper Tracker](https://potd.lol), which you may remember from its Google Sheet days, is finally back in a cleaner, more robust website format!

Looking back at the Villarreal game and the Monaco game in the Champions League he hit the 3+ line in those two games. Dortmund like to concede goals in the Champions League in their 3 games this season they've played Juventus who they shipped four goals to, they also scored four themselves, Athletic Club got a goal against them then Copenhagen scored two against them in their last time out in the Champions League.

Bet 2.5u\n\nWriteup: Let's add another sport to the list I barely talk about on here in basketball, specifically college basketball. I cannot get behind the NBA, but NCAA basketball I love. A lot of people may not like the way I do picks for NCAA basketball because they are very to the point and don't give a lot of information, but I've found it to be pretty effective. I keep it very simple - eye test, strength of schedule, and Ken Pom rankings.\n\nBoth teams had their season opener yesterday. NDSU played Oregon State, a team who is clearly better, and they only lost by 2. Not bad for a season opener for a team not in one of the power conferences. On the other side, UC Davis played the Menlo Oaks. Who? Exactly. That sounds like a high school. That game showed me nothing. \n\nIf you don't know about Ken Pom rankings, do yourself a favor and read into it a bit. His rankings are quite possibly some of the most consistently accurate pieces of sports statistics I've seen over a long period of time, especially during March Madness. Don't trust my word, just take a look at his results. Looking at Ken Pom aka the Holy Grail of sports analysis, UC Davis is ranked 261st with their offense ranked outside the top 300. NDSU is ranked 197th with their offense ranked inside the top 175. Ken Pom ranked UC Davis's first game with a -99 in strength of schedule, meaning that game proved nothing about if the team is any good. NDSU received a +5.87, which was top 90 in the country. \n\nYes, it's only been one game and we should probably wait until the first week is over. But waiting is boring. Throw some money on the ML too if you want, they're clearly the better team from the eye test and the analytics. \n\nRemember to only bet what you can afford, and BOL!",

Barcelona is playing at away and the Spanish league is levels above the Belgian league. Barcelona are in good form with convincing wins over Elche and Olympiacos and even though they lost one of their last matches to favorites Real Madrid they will be looking for a win here vs a much inferior opponent. On to the Inter game now Inter Milan should easily win over Kairat as they are the much better team and sit tied for 3rd in the UCL table with a perfect 3 - 0 record with wins over USG, Slavia Prague and Ajax. They are also unbeaten in 17/18 at home and are looking to go top of the UCL table which they will surely be motivated to do so after last season's devastating 5 - 0 defeat in the final.

No pressure on the defender in a stock-standard recycle of play. Defender looked up to see where the keeper was, missed him by about 25m and put the ball in his own net. \n\nCity had hardly touched the ball. \n\nFrom there, Machida completely dominated. I know it says Machida had 20 shots to City's 8, but that doesn't do it justice. There were so many dangerous balls across goal that nobody got on the end of etc. \n\nMachida scored after about half an hour and at that point I was very sure we'd get up. Kept pressuring the \n\nCity scored very late into injury time with a goal that needed VAR. Goal was originally ruled as play on and a massive five-minute VAR intervention ended up declaring the ball went across the line.\n\nFirst time an Australian team has beaten a Japanese team in 5 years. \n\nAnd to make it worse, I picked this over Arsenal -1.5, and Birmingham (-0.5 & -1.0) for some stupid reason.... That is on me. \n\nI'm off A-League clubs in potd from now on.\n\nToday's Pick:  Inter (-2.0) vs Kairat Almaty AND Galatasaray (+1.0) vs Ajax. 3u @ 1.91\n\nInter (-2.0) vs Kairat Almaty\n\nKairat might be worth a shout in some home games (travelling to Kazakhstan isn't an easy trip), but away from home the reverse is true... It's about a nine hour flight for Kairat, and while they've had a week without games, I still think that journey is a massive factor. \n\nTheir last away Champions League game was against Sporting who pumped them 4-1.\n\nInter aren't as good as they were last season (imo, but it's early), however they've had some big wins on the road in the champions league already... beating Ajax 2-0 and Union St Gilloise 4-0. \n\nGalatasaray (+1.0) at Ajax \n\nAjax are in pretty bad form this season and sit fifth in the Durch league. They sit fifth and have already dropped points at home to SC Heerenveen,and Az Alkmaar.\n\nTheir underlying numbers have been a little off. They're about mid table for xg conceded in the league, and have only kept two clean sheets. \n\nAlong with that, they are 7th in the league for expected goals, and 9th in the league for total big chances created.\n\nAjax's Champions League form has been dire too, with losses to Inter, Marseille, and Chelsea.\n\nGalatasaray are looking great this season in Turkey and sit top of the league and are 9-2-0 after 11 games. \n\nThey've also got two wins vs Liverpool and Bodo/Glimt in the Champions League. They did lose 5-1 to Frankfurt in their opening game, but honestly.... it was off 11 shots and 1.21 expected goals (.48 of which was for their fifth goal when Gala lost the ball in the box) - it's obviously not ideal, but I can see that as an outlier.",

In their last ten games, every Barcelona match has ended with more than 2.5 goals and their team scores an average of 2.4 goals per game while conceding 1.4, so goals are almost always guaranteed when they play. Brugge can be dangerous at home and are on a three-game winning streak domestically, but they were soundly beaten 4-0 by Bayern Munich and are not at Barcelona’s level in terms of defense or quality. Barcelona have never lost to Brugge in European competition (three wins and one draw in four meetings), and even with few players missing out, they still have lots of attacking options, Lamine Yamal and Marcus Rashford are in great form, and Hansi Flick’s tactics mean they create plenty of chances every match. Also all the UCL matches of both Barca and Brugge this season had over 2.5 goals. \n\nIf you found these picks helpful, tips or donations are greatly appreciated as they support the time and effort I put into creating them: [buy me a beer🍻](https://buymeacoffee.com/hercules.son.of.zeus)",

Qarabağ line up in a compact 4-2-3-1, sitting deep and soaking up pressure before launching wide counterattacks and targeting set-piece situations. This approach invites Chelsea’s full-backs to push high and overlap, leading to repeated sequences of blocked crosses and deflected shots that naturally produce corners. Chelsea, under their current setup, operate in a flexible 4-2-3-1 or 4-3-3, focusing on wide build-up play through aggressive wing-backs and inverted forwards. Their dominance in possession and emphasis on stretching the pitch often pins opponents deep, generating sustained pressure and multiple corner situations. Meanwhile, Qarabağ’s counterattacking transitions and reliance on crosses from advanced wide areas also create chances to win corners of their own. With both teams committed to attacking down the flanks and forcing play into the final third, this match profiles as one with strong corner potential — making Over +8.50 corners a convincing and value-driven bet.",

They now meet Johor, who dominate their domestic league completely, however they still generate a lot of corners, despite scoring huge - they've averaged above 10 corners for themselves and above 12 total per game. In the AFC CL, in 3 games played, Johor have covered in all 3, with 11 total vs Chengdu (another Chinese team), 15 vs Machida and 12 vs Buriram. Shanghai have done similar with 2/3 AFC CL games covering, failing only against Gangwon who are not a good corner matchup at all (with a 8.70 total average in South Korea).",

Sheffield United took the lead early which really wasn’t ideal as Coventry were already on 2 corners and would step up their pressure to salvage a result. Despite throwing attacking as well as they have all season, the Baldes weren’t backing down and the corner count surprisingly ended 6-3 to Sheffield at the half. Piling even more pressure and two goals not long after the break, the Sky Blues wouldn’t step their foot off the gas and we had to hold on for 10 minutes for no more corners as the count was at 6. Thankfully the seventh never came and Coventry ended up scoring a third deep in stoppage time.\n\nMoving from one Sheffield to the other, Wednesday aren’t faring much better than their rivals as they’re on… -5 points. One of the oldest clubs in the world, the situation is quite sad as they’ve entered administration for failing to pay wages. I have to commend the Owls as in spite of the obvious off-field issues and whole bunch of injuries woes the players have shown a lot of heart in their performances. Though they haven’t won since September they haven’t necessarily been playing terrible football - keeping games close in spite of all the issues and Hillsborough remains a tough ground to visit. The players seem fired up for a result and there’s finally some optimism as offers are close to being made to buy the club - a huge attendance is expected tomorrow to make good impression on potential new owners. What better way to bounce back than facing Norwich, who have had none of the issues yet all of the troubles just sitting a spot above Wednesday. That’s now no wins since August and for a team that usually yo-yo’s between the Prem and Championship they could very well end up being in League One next year for the first time since 2009.\n\nAnyways enough of the context, the Owls have averaged 5.9 corners for and 4.6 corners against in their last 20 home matches. The canaries have been averaging 3.7 for and 6.1 conceded in the same period on the road. Even using recent stats is flattering to Wednesday’s corners (both for and against) despite the financial troubles so no concerns on that end. I get an expected 6.3 corners for Sheffield and 3.8 for Norwich using all factors. Just a note though that in this fixture last season Norwich had more corners though was a year ago (exactly) so I’m not necessarily worried. That gives this play an estimated 75% chance of winning. BOL, let’s get to 50 wins !\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ijvhhh9y7czf1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=47815cf530cb8e0b6bffbdcdc874ef4c31aa967f",

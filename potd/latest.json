Lille are on the opposing end, having had a 5 game losing streak before ending it with a win over Freiburg in the CL. On the road they have been 4-1-4. H2H is looking very good for Lyon, where they hold the upper hand with a 7-2-1 record, Fonseca himself is even unbeaten against Bruno Genesio (3-4-0).\n\nThese teams have played each other 3 weeks ago where Lyon won it 1-2, a repeat result is the most probably outcome. Also, Endrick is in crazy form.",

That includes six victories by double-digits and all but two by eight or more points. To earn a 11th consecutive win on the road against a Top 10 foe will be no easy task, however, under head coach Brad Underwood, Illinois has earned six such victories over the last seven seasons—tied with Alabama for the most in the nation.\n\nAs for the Cornhuskers (20-1), they will rely on their stingy defense to bounce back after picking up their first loss of the season.\n\nThrough 21 games, Nebraska ranks 14th in the country in defensive efficiency (0.936). However, when the team has faced top offensive units—Illinois enters ranked first in the category (1.244)—the defense has struggled. In five contests against opponents that rank Top 40 in offensive efficiency, the Cornhuskers have conceded an average of 80.0 points on 47.8% shooting from the field (33.4% from beyond the arc). Furthermore, each opponent managed to shoot above 46% from the field and all but one topped 34% from long-range. That includes the Illini, who poured in 80 points on 48% shooting (34% from deep) in the previous meeting.\n\nThe X factor in this one is plain and simple: Keaton Wagler.\n\nThe freshman was pivotal in Illinois upset of then-No. 4 Purdue last week—46 points on 13-of-17 shooting—and he was equally as effective in the team’s 75-66 victory against Washington on Thursday, pouring in 22 points to go along with eight assists. The Illini will need hip to be on top of his game and get the rest of his teammates involved on Sunday.\n\nTrust Illinois to get revenge on the road.\n\nBOL if tailing, and as always, please do so responsibly. One bet should not have you crashing out all over Reddit.",

Will add some personal information in this write-up as well.\n\n• ⁠Model has Alcarez ML at 64% \n\n• Model has Florida ML at 59% \n\n• EV better betting 100$ = 13-15$ for this play\n\n• Rolling with 0.50U on this one because of Djokovic is the GOAT #1 but #2 because of injuries \n\n•I was stuck all day between Djokovic to win 1 set or Alcarez ML - rolling with his ML - Alcarez has the tools to beat Djokovic in this one, as he has showed us in their previous matches against one another - he’s faster, has more endurance, and a little more aggressive - Part of me is sitting here thinking the obvious, how much does Novak have left in the tank after the other day - On the flip side, I don’t think that applies much to him because he’s shown for years, he’s the top dog, and get through anything, like the match against Sinner - it’s going to be another strength vs experience in this one and I’m rolling with Alcarez on this one, hoping he doesn’t pick up an injury during the match - also stinks that it’s at 3:30am EST.. so I unfortunately won’t be able to watch \n\n•If Alcarez wins, and we get to the 2nd leg of the parlay, and Florida lets me down AGAIN, they will be headed towards the no bet list - I was wary about Florida after that Auburn game, but man, they answered questions on the road against South Carolina the other night - The first thing that sticks out to me in this matchup between Alabama and Florida is the rebounding edge that Florida brings - They are 1st in the country in RPG & ORPG - They are a top 50 team in the country in terms of defense efficiency, which should slow Alabamas high scoring offense down - On the flip side, Alabama’s defense is subpar at best - With a defensive rating not even in the top 200 in the country…….. To be continued…..\n\nRest of the writeup coming later this evening/early tomorrow morning - have a busy night ahead of me\n\nPOTD History: [https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/SoggyDatabase2348-bvjHUn](https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/SoggyDatabase2348-bvjHUn)\n\nBOL!\n\n**POTD: 2 Pick Parlay: Carlos Alcarez ML vs Djokovic + Florida ML vs Alabama -135 (0.50U TO WIN 0.65U)**\n\nTips are greatly appreciated - Proceeds will be going towards my student loans and my morning cold brews.

      "text": "**Record**: 9-5-1 (Wins-Losses-Pushes) (+17.5u)\n\n**Last Pick**: Leeds United vs. Arsenal BTTS-YES 4u ❎\n\nTough luck here. I think the line was good given this is Leeds second game all season not scoring at home so not overly upset about it. \n\n**Event**: English Premier League: Tottenham vs. Manchester City 8:30am PST\n\n**POTD**: Manchester City ML (-143) 2u\n\n**Write up**:\n\nManchester city have had a rocky season so far, but since the additions of Guehi and Semenyo they have looked much stronger. Pep has been rotating to squad and it seems like the lineup is getting somewhat finalized currently, plus having Nunes back has made them look much more comfortable in the back. I will preface this pick by saying I am a City fan, so I watch every single game. If this match was a few weeks ago I would never make this pick, but these new signings have been incredible. I will also note that the Bodo game didn't include either of these players and city were missing a couple good pieces due to injury who are now back. \n\nWith Arsenal dropping points to United last week, City are still in this title race. A win against Spurs puts them only 4 points off the top (not to mention they will still play Arsenal at the Etihad later in the season). This is a must win for city, and I think they can come out on top. With Doku now out, this is a game for Foden and Marmoush to really prove themselves in this squad. Not to mention Haaland only scoring in 1 of their last 5 games. As someone that's seen City in this position the last few years, this is where the season turns around. \n\nSpurs have been extremely bad at home, sitting 19th in home record only winning 2 games all season. Recently losing at home to a squad like West Ham is further proof of how poor they've been. I've seen my team get railed by Spurs away a lot recently, but with the massive changes to their roster the past couple years, and the likes of Van De Ven and Porto out, I see city stealing this match. \n\n**FRIENDLY REMINDER**: for people who comment hate AFTER the picks don't hit, don't forget that you're coming to this thread looking for help because you aren't able to formulate your own picks. It's pretty pathetic seeing people comment on my post or other peoples posts AFTER picks don't hit. Do your own research and gamble responsibly. You shouldn't be losing enough money to make you crash out on Reddit picks that YOU CHOSE TO MAKE\n\n**BOL!**",

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 27-36-5 (Avg Odds +126)\n\n**Previous Pick:** Enzo Fernandez 1+ SOT snd 2+ Shots (+172)✅️\n\n**Today's Event:** English Premier League (Soccer) | Man United vs Fulham (6:00AM PST)\n\n**Pick:** Samuel Chukwueze 1+ SOT (+125) 1 unit to win 1.25 units\n\n**Write Up:** Enzo comes through for us again, this time in heroic fashion with a stoppage time game winning goal for Chelsea. I really enjoy late wins, I know some people dislike sweaty wins, but to me they make the game extra fun when you can win up until the last minute. Whatever side of that fence you're on, a big plus money win is a great way to start the weekend!\n\nToday we've got what should be a great matchup betwen 6th place Man United and 7th place Fulham. Two teams in great form - United are unbeaten in 7 matches and Fulham have only lost 1 match in their last 8. I'm giving United a slightly edge at home, but backing a Fulham player to land an SOT.\n\nChukwueze is a Nigerian winger on his first season with Fulham, having joined from AC Milan in the fall. He has only had a few matches with Fulham, having joined after the season started and being away at AFCON. That said, he has looked very promising when he has played. He scored 2 goals vs Man City back in December and hit a great equalizing goal as a sub in their last match against Brighton. I'm expecting him to get a start here and find an SOT against United. Keep in mind, he has only started a handful of games this season, so while I believe he will start based on form, there's always a chance he does not. \n\nBOL and happy Sunday!",

Ajax play attacking football and consistently create many chances home and away. Excelsior matches are often open with defensive weaknesses regularly exposed. Recent meetings between these teams have produced high scoring results. Ajax need victory and will push forward from the start. With both sides favoring offense over defense, over 3.5 goals at 2.36 offers clear value tonight again.",

Volk’s constant pressure, feints, and volume striking force opponents to fight at his pace, while his wrestling defence and clinch control reduce the chaos Lopes relies on to create submissions or big moments. Over time, Volk’s consistency, experience in championship fights, and ability to make mid-fight adjustments should allow Alexander Volkanovski to outwork and outthink Diego Lopes, likely winning rounds through control, output, and composure rather than taking unnecessary risks. Additionally, Volk beat him in the last fight by unanimous decision.",

We saw him playing insane defense and controlled aggression. He’s gonna have to do that again and no sense in not backing that. I expect Alcaraz to come out hot and Joker to settle in. IMO the crowd can push Joker to winning atleast 1 set here and who knows maybe even the whole thing.

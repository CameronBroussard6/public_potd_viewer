He has won four Challenger titles in Asunción, Concepción, Sarasota, and Villa María, all on clay. He's on a 19-match clay winning streak this season; he's among the season leaders with four Challenger trophies this year.\n\nHeide missed 6-7 months in 2025 due to a back injury and hernia surgery, returning in the fall.\n\nThis is the first official meeting between the two players. Nava will use his clay court advantage to the fullest and win.",

      "text": "Record: 0–2 (–2u)\nPrevious Pick: 🏀 Hornets +5 @ Heat (1u)\n\nEvent: CFB – MACtion Wednesday | Toledo @ Miami (OH) – 4:00 PM ET\nPick: 🏈 Miami (OH) +4.5 (–110) | 5u to win 4.55u\n\nWrite-Up:\n\nMACtion’s back, and this one fits a setup my model loves. The system I run looks for games with early sharp movement one way and public pressure the other — and Toledo vs Miami checks every box. Toledo opened –3.5, took some early sharp money, and now sits at –4.5 with around 65–70% of bets still on Miami. That kind of split usually leads to value on the dog once the line inflates past the key number.\n\nToledo’s a solid team, but they’ve been awful on the road (0–4) and are dead last in penalty yards per game (71.9). That’s a nightmare for favorites covering spreads on the road. Miami’s defense is disciplined, top-25 in stop rate, and they’ve kept almost every game within one score.\n\nOn offense, Miami lost RB Kenny Tracy, but Jordan Brunson’s been running hard and QB Aveon Smith gives them mobility to extend drives. It’s not pretty, but it chews clock and limits possessions — exactly what the model likes when backing a home dog in a low-total game.\n\nWeather looks fine (mid-30s, light wind), no big advantage either way. Toledo’s defense will make plays, but their offense has dropped off lately — averaging barely 20 PPG in MAC play.\n\nSituational trends line up too:\n\t•\tHome dogs in midweek MACtion are 11–5 ATS since 2022\n\t•\tToledo is 2–8 ATS last 10 road games\n\t•\tMiami has covered 4 of the last 5 vs Toledo at home\n\nThis just feels like that classic midweek MAC game that gets weird late — penalties, turnovers, maybe an overtime field goal. My model’s projecting this closer to a pick ‘em, so +4.5 has solid value.\n\n✅ Play: Miami (OH) +4.5 (–110) | FanDuel | 5u to win 4.55u",

He had three rebounds in the first quarter and only got two the rest of the game against the Nets of all teams. Just a brutal beat.\n\nToday’s pick: Stephon Castle O 23.5 points and assists vs the Spurs (-112 at FD). \n\nCastle has been an absolute wagon lately, recording double digit assists in his last 3 games and has surpassed this total in 9/11 games this season, including his last 7. The Spurs are rolling and I don’t expect a frankly unimpressive Warriors team to offer much resistance here. ",

I don’t have any stats or feel about this game, I just believe in betting on these big programs with huge lines against much smaller schools to be generally profitable. I typically like to bet the 1st half spread because the line is obviously smaller and I think these big teams try to solidify their large lead early and coast through the 2nd half. Line for the full game is -41.5 which I like but I love the -24.5 for the 1st half better. \n\nBOL",

I am rolling back this pick for another day. I as mentioned yesterday Valanciunas us used to being a starter and is having excellent use of his minutes covering for one of the best players in the world. When Jokic rests Jonas enters - and he looks as fresh as ever. He lives under the basket and his fight gives everyone on the Nuggets more time to defend on the transition. He is an superb fit for the Nugget's bench. \n\nValanciunas has hit this 7 out of the 10 games this season. Since starting with Denver his minutes have increased as the weeks go on. Today is game 2 of a 3 game road trip and they are coming off playing less than 24 hours ago. Jokic may need more rest than usual. \n\nThis play is currently only on Fanduel (and a few other books). I expect it to be on all books around noon. \n\n**Previous Pick**: Jonas Valanciunas o7.5 points (Nuggets vs Kings) ✅\n\n***Track my sports betting picks on [POTD.LOL](https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/EthicalGambler-U6cnjV?utm_source=mdembed&utm_campaign=EthicalGambler) (since 09/01/25).***",

He doesn’t need 11 or 13, just 7. \n\nWarriors are coming off a B2B from playing the Thunder so hoping there’s some easier scoring routes with a bit of fatigue. They also concede the 4th least free throws per game in the comp, which is great as nothing more annoying than your assist play getting burnt on shooting fouls. The Warriors effective field goal (EFG) defense % is mid tier for the league, while the Spurs are 5th for attack for EFG %. \n\nAs long as he gets his usual minutes & usage, and the Warriors don’t get blown out too early, I think this is a neat pick, if potentially just a smidge too low odds ($1.75 would be ideal).",

Books continue to undervalue him this season, going to be hitting it for the foreseeable future.\n\nFor today I'm backing Ben Shelton to win over 12.5 games.  I also like his moneyline but like this one a little more because ultimately it comes down to this: is it more likely that the match is a quick blowout one way or another or that Felix beats Ben? In my opinion, with two of the top servers in the game both in excellent form in recent months (both legitimately playing the best tennis of their careers), I'm seeing a competitive match.  The worry here is that a) Felix has been great so he could definitely win this one, or conversely b) Felix has been injured and might not be 100% tomorrow.  That said, I still think this should cash if not in 3 sets then with Shelton winning something like 7-6 6-4.  Personally I will be playing a couple units on both this and the Shelton ML, but forced to choose just one for POTD I'm going with over 12.5 Games.\n\nShould be one hell of a match; I already have my alarm set.

What a game, and finally got a W betting against Boston . Theory didn’t hold up for why I’m fading them, but regardless a W. \n\nBack at it tomorrow, and keeping write up short again, but love this play. \n\n**Pistons -2.5**\n\nOkay, these are two teams have had basically completely opposite seasons so far this young season.\n\nDetroit started the season 2-2, losing to the Bulls in their first game, and my cavs a few games in, however they are currently on a 7gm win streak since that loss in October. I will say Detroit has been playing the bottom of the league in this streak, however a 7 game win streak is still impressive this early in the season.\n\nBulls on the other hand started the season 5-0, however now are 1-4 since then. The bulls have lost to the top of the league only losing by 10+ in 2 of those. Their 4 loses were against knicks, bucks, cavs and spurs. IMO those teams top 7-8 In the league. \n\nThe stats, also show the bulls are the better team on paper. The bulls are the top half of the league in almost all O & D categories, while the pistons rank towards the bottom in some of the key areas. For example, Pistons are 17th in opp 3pt %, while bulls are 4th in 3pt %. The one advantage I do think Detroit has in on the glass. The pistons crash hard on both ends, and are IMO the scariest O rebounding team in the league, and at home I see that being a big part of the game. \n\nWith all that being said; you’d think the bulls were the right side, however this is a bet on my belief that Detroit js in the same tier as the those teams. Yes, they’ve had a cushy road to this win streak, however that is exactly what a young team needs to start the season. Momentum.\n\nI know this isn’t the most conniving angle to boast a bet, but I just really think Detroit wins this at home tomorrow. I have paid close attention to Detroit all season, and just think this team is going to be a tough out and compete with the top teams in the league this season. I also think they bulls overachieved and we are getting value with their hot start this season. \n\nRight now Cade is Q, so I may regret making this play so early. Giddey is also Q for the bulls so hopefully he doesnt play, while Cade does.",

      "text": "POTD Record: 11-5 (+8.4U)\n\nLast Pick: Texas Tech @ Illinois over 165 (-120) 🙅‍♂️\n\n[Over write up](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/s/5NoX56whge)\n\nA lot of moments where I felt like it was going to go over and then the teams would just go blank for 4 minutes in a row. Tech was abysmal from 3 as well. Oh well, time to bounce back as always\n\nEvent: North Texas @ Oregon st (8:30pm central)\n\nPOTD: North Texas +3 (-120)\n\n-everything is bet to win unit amount-\n\nWrite up: \n\nYou know this is one of those games where I just think the wrong team is favored. My power ratings make this North Texas -1.5, and I’m gladly taking the points. We may as well call this squad the North Texas Vikings, because head coach Daniyal Robinson brought three starters with him from a Cleveland State team that consistently contended in the Horizon League. Robinson’s teams are gritty, pesky, and tough — his Cleveland State unit finished 73rd in defensive efficiency last season, and he’s clearly instilled that same identity in Denton.\n\n\nBoth teams this year have played at a snail’s pace, ranking in the bottom 30 nationally in tempo, which makes a close, grind-it-out game highly likely. That’s exactly the kind of environment where taking the points makes sense. Oregon State’s two wins this season have come by just 2 and 3 points, respectively.\nNow let’s talk numbers. North Texas has the edge in nearly every statistical category. They’re shooting 39.1% from three compared to Oregon State’s 31.6%. From the field overall, North Texas is hitting 48.3% of their shots, while Oregon State sits at 43.2%. On the glass, North Texas holds a rebounding percentage of 52.4%, slightly better than Oregon State’s 50.1%. Defensively, North Texas is allowing opponents to shoot just 32.7% from the field, while Oregon State has allowed 45.8%.\n\n\nThe rim protection disparity is massive. North Texas averages 7.0 blocks per game, while Oregon State is averaging just 0.7. That’s not a typo — it’s a real gap in interior defense. Turnovers are another key edge: Oregon State coughs it up 16.0 times per game, which ranks near the bottom nationally, while North Texas commits just 11.0 turnovers per game, well above average. On the flip side, North Texas is generating 7.3 steals per game, compared to Oregon State’s 4.5.\n\n\nStrength of schedule is relatively even, with Oregon State getting a slight nod, but not enough to offset the statistical dominance. North Texas also has an extra game under their belt, sitting at 3-0, while Oregon State is 2-0. Continuity matters, and that’s another edge for the Mean Green. Oregon State’s roster is still gelling — several players are underclassmen and international recruits who haven’t played together much. Meanwhile, North Texas has a core that’s already battle-tested and cohesive.\n\n\nAnd it’s not just the numbers — it’s how they’re winning. North Texas held Loyola to just 32.7% shooting in their last game, showing they can impose their defensive will on the road. Oregon State, meanwhile, allowed opponents to shoot 45.8%, which is a major liability against a disciplined team like UNT. North Texas also forced 12 turnovers and grabbed 8 steals in that game, continuing their trend of creating extra possessions through pressure defense.\n\n\nIn a game with a total set at 136, we’re expecting a low-possession, defensive slugfest. That favors the team with better efficiency, better rim protection, and fewer mistakes — and that’s North Texas across the board. I’ll gladly take the 3 with the Vikings of Denton. Let’s bounce back big fellas and preserve our record of no b2b losses, as always, cheers 🍻",

      "text": "Record: 161-137, +0.11 units\n\nLast Pick: Roman Andres Burruchaga ML vs Federico Agustin Gomez (-200, 2 units): Win\n\nTennis | Montevideo Challenger | 6:00 PM EST (estimated)\n\nToday's Pick: Vilius Gaubas vs Ignacio Buse | **Buse ML at -112 (DK). 1 unit.**\n\nWrite-up: Burruchaga closed at -335, and while he should have been able to serve it out at 5-4 in the second set, he was able to get the job done in the end. That win officially brought me back into the green for the first time in a while - I know that I've a lot of ups and downs as a capper, but at the end of the day, breaking even isn't the worst outcome in a world where most people lose money. I hope that I can stay in the green as the sample size gets larger, and my next goal is to reach my highest unit return ever again. \n\nThis should be a good matchup between two of the top performers in clay Challengers this season, Ignacio \"Nacho\" Buse and Vilius Gaubas. My reasoning here is actually pretty simple: I believe that the market is overvaluing the head-to-head. These players have faced off on clay twice this season, once in April in Menorca and once in Lisbon in September, with Gaubas winning two closely contested matches. What interests me, however, is that Buse closed at around -220 in both matches. In fact, Buse was pushed to those closing odds from an opening line of -189 in Menorca, meaning the market ultimately was not concerned by the first result.\n\nAs for the second match, it couldn't have been much closer considering that it was a straight-setter. Buse won 56.0% of his service points compared to Gaubas's 58.3%, and Gaubas also benefited from first serve percentages in that match. The performance rating told a similar story, with Gaubas earning a 7.31 while Buse earned a 7.16. The players seemed to be on pretty even footing, with Buse finding some nice attacking patterns to disrupt Gaubas's heavy topspin.\n\nHas anything happened since that second match to justify the price moving this much for the third? Not really, in my opinion. Gaubas followed up his Lisbon performance with a final in Braga, but then struggled after moving to South American clay, and didn't look all that great in the first round against David Jorda Sanchis (7.16/10). In comparison, Nacho has been playing in this conditions for a few straight weeks, scoring some decent results in two Lima events and then crushing Timofey Skatov in the opening round here (7.98/10). Buse's more attacking game is theoretically better on faster European clay, but the oddsmakers have still been pricing him as a high-end CH player here is SA, as he closed as a heavy favorite against solid players like Joao Reis Da Silva and Alvaro Guillen Meza. \n\nThe conditions tomorrow should be similar to what Buse experienced in Lima, with mild temperatures, moderate winds, and high humidity, and I think his big groundstrokes should still be able to shine even if the courts aren't the fastest. \n\nA lot of clay grinders, like Gonzalo Bueno and Sebastian Baez, have already struggled here in Montevideo, and I was even a bit surprised at how much difficulty Burruchaga had with Gomez's big serve and forehand. Overall, I have no reason to believe that Buse won't be able to use his superior serve and willingness to go for his shots to his advantage here, and I'm happy to take him at the best price he's been available at in this matchup. \n\nNote: The [POTD Capper Tracker](https://potd.lol), which you may remember from its Google Sheet days, is finally back in a cleaner, more robust website format!

Both teams are actually in decent form considering their league positions. Atletico are 3-1-1 in their last five, winning their last two games. This puts them second in the form table in the previous five games. Fortaleza are 1-3-1 in their last five, drawing three in a row. \n\nAtletico are a far better side at home, with 30 points at home compared to 13 away; They've also got a +10 goal difference at home compared to an even one away. \n\nFortaleza are one of the worst teams in the league away from home this season, with 9 points in 15 away games and a -15 goal difference. Compare this form to 21 home points in 17 games.\n\nFortaleza will also be without Matheus Pereira, who got a red card late last match. He's been in and out of the team, but if he's not starting, is usually one of the first off the bench and will be missed. \n\nAll in all, while there's not a lot on - I think Atletico should win this at home and the $1.61 price works for me.",

      "text": "RECORD 0-0 (+/- 0 UNITS\n\nFIRST POST, FIRST OFFICIAL PICK OF THE DAY... and  \nWell one might think that as an American I should stick to the sports I know and have been betting my whole life, for some reason I'm going to kick off with the sport of soccer and of everything, the classic \"sucker's bet\" of a parlay. In my defense, well there isn't much to say, except that I have watched a ton of soccer this year and I live on statistics. That said:\n\nPO.T.D.: BAYERN MUNICH +1.5 (alt. spread) + OVER 1.5 TOTAL GOALS IN GAME + P.S.G. TO TAKE THE MOST CORNERS (+160 on Hard Rock Bet)\n\nWAGER AMOUNT: 1 UNIT\n\nREASONING/PROJECTED ANALYSIS:\n\nFIRST LEG (Bayern Munich +1.5 alt. spread): Per the eye test, the professional analysts and even Vegas, it would seem that most seem to predict or expect a Bayern Munich win today despite the return of Dembele' or them playing at PSG, and it's hard to argue with any of that as Bayern Munich has been overwhelingly consistent all year at blowing out &/or beating every team which they're supposed to regardless of the circumstance or condition. Add to that a PSG which has been playing poorly, as of late, and one with injuries & a team which must be exhausted after last year's campaign and Ibelue e that a Bayern Munich 2-1 or even 2-0 victory is most likely. However, because I wager to win, I take the exceptionally safer added +1.5 cushion since it covers a 2-1 Bayern Munich loss, and I just can't see a P.S.G blowout nearly anyway I look at it.\n\nSECOND LEG (OVER 1.5 TOTAL GOALS IN GAME): To me, this is the \"gimme\" of the three legs with BOTH teams generally being offensive powerhouses and while I would have even taken the BTTS-Yes line, again because I want the safest route, I am just asking for over 1.5 goals however it happens.\n\nTHIRD LEG (this was my first choice, and is really why I made this bet. P.S.G. TO TAKE THE MOST CORNERS): This is the leg, which while the least certain, is the linchpin to this bed and why I took it. There's two reasons behind this; one I truly expect that Bayern Munich will be in the lead or score first and that PSG will be playing catch up and more offensively all game, attacking to the end to at least tie the score or catch up, if not try to win. The second reason is a bigger one and that's where the stats come in, in the last seven games, win or lose, PSG has taken the most corners, as they do almost 90% of the time in games. You combine that kind of consistency with playing catch up possibly and I don't understand how this has become so overlooked, especially when Bayern Munich can certainly score from anywhere, but I don't consider them an overwhelmingly corner based or corner set-piece scoring team.\n\nFINAL ANALYSIS: I can't lie, and while my experience with wagering on sports is decades deep & has been extremely profitable over that time, soccer has always been quite inconsistent for me up until lately and PSG has both let me down or upset my predictions probably more than any team in the last year so it would be par for the course for them to screw me in some way, yet again, but for whate er reason, I just don't see it happening today. I guess we'll figure out how big of a \"sucker\" I am.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/spbolun4f9zf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a73907adf2568c3dfa63e92313df5300b34b10f",

Team Lawes have been working all season to peak right around now. Their opponents, Team X Schwaller, are still very young and are often inconsistent. I like the edge for Team Lawes here because of the one blank rule being used in the slams. Team Lawes are very aggressive when their opponents have hammer and should be able to get a steal or two here when Team Schwaller are forced to convert their hammer. In their only previous matchup, Lawes won 7-5.",

Mainly had a role as a blocker never even targeted. There was three plays that looked like were designed to go Zay’s way last night but all 3 ended in sacks before Jacoby could even throw it. \n\nDuke -8.5 over Texas is a solid pick based on roster depth, experience, and performance in exhibition already this season. Duke returns several rotation players from last season’s Final Four team and addition to the Boozer brothers solidifying them as a top recruiting class. They’ve started the season with exhibition wins over UCF and Tennessee, showing balanced scoring and consistent defense. Head coach Jon Scheyer looks to have built a system that relies on ball movement and pressure, which has worked well early in the season.\n\nTexas enters with a new coaching staff and a lineup still adjusting to find their new identity. They finished last season 19-16 and lost in the First Four. In their last game, they gave up 86 points to Xavier and struggled to defend the perimeter. To add on to this Matas Vokietaitis, who Texas is expecting to get big minutes from at the 5, has been dealing with injuries which could cause huge problems with stopping Cam Boozer. I also like Cam’s over on 10 rebounds tonight. \n\nWhile the game is at a “neutral site”, it is in Charlotte, which is about 2 hours from Duke campus. I expect Texas to travel well, I think the tested experience from the exhibition for Duke coming back from behind and winning at Tennessee has them more prepared for this close to home game. \n\nPrediction: Duke 70 - Texas 58",

Bet 3.5u\n\nThis might be my first soccer bet on this thread, maybe second. Regardless, as much as I love football and the other sports I’ve posted on, I occasionally watch and keep up with the Premier League. This also includes teams recently in the Premier League, like Sheffield. This bet is more of an anti-Sheffield bet than it is pro-Coventry because this Sheffield team who almost got promoted back to the Premier League simply looks lost. They had a horrendous start to their season and have simply been trying to stay afloat since then. On the other side, I have not watched much Coventry as they haven’t been anywhere near a Premier League caliber team in some time, but after a bit of research they are a heavy attack team while also not taking a crazy high amount of corners - they attack the goal, but do so with purpose. On top of this, the one thing I’ve noticed Sheffield does well is limit opposing corner opportunities (many times being because they simply get scored on). I believe they have only given up about 4 corners a game. Putting these together, I expect Coventry to take care of the ball and attack efficiently, limiting corners by either scoring or maintaining possession. I wouldn’t be surprised if Coventry gets close to this 6.5 line given their attacking nature, but given the fact that Sheffield has looked so clueless for much of the season, I expect this to stay under the line more due to efficient offensive play by Coventry more so than effective defense by Sheffield. They’ll have under 7 in this one.\n\nRemember to only bet what you can afford, and BOL!",

A must-win to get into the top 8. I've looked at the odds for Arsenal to score over 1,5 goals as I see them scoring 2 goals or more against this opponent (1.40). The pick I picked is the same result really but for higher odds as I don't see Slavia Prague scoring 2 against an Arsenal who are yet to concede. With 4 goals against Atletico, 2 against Olympiakos and 2 against Bilbao they've covered this bet all 3 games in the CL so far.

PSG is missing Doue but they are expected to play Dembélé, Barcola and Kvaratskhelia.

Atl Madrid are in good form with convincing wins over Sevilla and Real Betis and even though they lost their last CL match to favorites Arsenal they will be looking for a bounce back here vs a much inferior opponent. On to the Arsenal game now Arsenal should easily win over Slavia as they are the much better team and sit atop the premier league table. There is simply no match here for Arsenal and anything other than an Arsenal win would be considered a huge surprise. ",

He’s gone 9, 8, 8 in his last 3, playing only 5-6 minutes. I don’t see any reason to jump off. Bulls are a good match-up for him, averaging 29.7 points a game against them in his career. \n\nThe main reason I’m running it back - O5.5 points is $1.71, 7+ is $2.15. I’m taking that extra point at 44 cents extra. I think he has to be close to a slight minutes growth, as he has gone 20-20-23-25 this season. If we get 27, we should get an extra 30 seconds to a minute which will be 1, maybe 2 extra shots. Now, the history is a little bit iffy, as he went 0-6 from the field against Vuc in the first 6 minutes in December 2024 (his first game back after a lay off when he clearly lacked touch early, but went on to score 31 points for the game), but he did cover this line the time before that that he played Vucevic (8 points in 4.5 minutes Dec 19 2023 including 2 shooting fouls on Vuc). \n\nDespite their 5-1 start to the season, the Bulls still give up nearly 30 points a 1st quarter. So I’m not worried about team performance. Should be easily enough opportunities to get 30 points for the team and while he’s on the court they will run the offense through him. The downside of this bet for me though is basically Maxey - if he gets hot there will be 1-2 FG opportunities for Embiid. I’m confident Embiid has his touch & range, just not fitness (hence targeting 1Q bets), but this is just as much Maxey’s team now. \n\nThere is a small degree of making hay while the sun shines here which doesn’t really have any bearing to Embiid but it does to my choice of POTD, in that while I have gone L-W-L-W the last 4 days, both the wins were >$2 (+100) odds so I’ve managed to increase my net units despite going 2-2. It’d potentially be safer to ride with the Embiid 6 1Q points @ $1.71, Pelicans ML @ $1.76 or even run Jalen Johnson back with 5 1Q points @ $1.86, but I wanted to target a slightly bigger return while the season is fresh and when there’s obvious key team plans to be followed - becomes a lot harder to read by game 60 of the season. \n\nDue to only just going over this line in the last 3 times, it’ll be a bit of a nail-biting 6 minutes but hopefully he stays out there for maybe 7 and I get that extra chance if he hasn’t already cleared it.",

Koa peat may just be that motherfucker, and the fact that people out there really thought that boogie fland and xavian lee could fill the gap that Clayton and Martin left is beyond baffling. I mean number 3 in the nation😂 that line was solely just influenced by last year. \n\nEvent: Texas vs Duke (7:45pm central)\n\nPOTD: under 154 (-120) (1U) \n\nLine was 135.5 on FanDuel at time of writing \n\n-everything is bet to win unit amount-\n\nWrite up: In an early season SEC vs ACC matchup I think we have a recipe for an under, and here’s why: let’s start off with Texas, this will be the first game of the Sean Miller era at Texas. Miller is known for running a physical aggressive man to man pack line defense that forces opponents out of the paint and into hard jump shots. Now knowing this, and looking at dukes current roster, I worry about their scoring identity, especially in their first game of the season. They simply do not have the volume shooters that they did last year. In fact, in their first exhibition game against UCF, they had 2 players that made over 1 three pointer, and in their second game against Tennessee, that dropped to only one player. Duke’s reliance on Cameron Boozer is going to be a problem at first, as impactful as the freshman will be this season, he cannot shoulder the weight of the team every night. I think it will take time for secondary players to develop comfort in the offense, causing Tuesday to be an unfortunate bump in the road for Scheyer’s squad. Isaiah Evans, Maliq brown, and these other role players have gaping holes to fill in guys like Flagg, konn, and proctor, and I think that in an early season game against a veteran led team under Sean miller, he is going to find ways to shut down this Duke offense at points and I can see periods where they may struggle to find an offensive rhythm. Not to mention, Sean Miller opted for Texas to play closed scrimmages instead of exhibitions, so he will have two games of film on Duke, whereas the same can not be said for John and his squad. Now, on the other end of the floor, Duke is going to be a matchup nightmare for Texas on the defensive side for most of the game. Let’s take a look at the backcourt for Texas, we got pope at 6’2, we got chendell weaver at 6’3, we got Simeon wilcher at 6’3, and tramon mark at 6’5 in what is probably your biggest guard. Now on the other end Duke will be starting Isaiah Evans at guard who is 6’6, they will be starting, Caleb foster at 6’8, and they will be starting Dame Sarr at 6’8. And that’s not counting the front court with boozer and Ngongba at 6’11. Now the way I see Texas handling boozer is going to be one of two ways. A. I see Sean miller letting boozer have his fun and shutting down the role players, or shutting down boozer with bigs Vokietaitis (7’0) and forcing the other guys into tough jump shots and daring them to beat em from deep which I simply do not think Duke can do over the course of the game. This is going to be a scrappy, tough game with physicality on both sides of the ball and growing pains with both teams. However the one thing I think that remains true is defense, and I think we’ll see stretches where both teams struggle to score.\nLet’s get another on the board fellas, cheers 🍻",

Aston Villa have played into Liverpool hands and allowed them to play freely. Liverpool defense has been very poor and I expect Real Madrid to easily breach it. As for Real Madrid, Their season so far has been great barring Atletico match. Impressive performance against Barcelona where, I felt, they should have scored more than 2 goals. I don't see Liverpool taking 3 points against Real Madrid at their current form.\n\nSecondly, the best vs the best. PSG are on the top of the Ligue 1 table and 3 out of 3 in the UCL so far. Whole PSG may not be in the form they were throughout the last season( especially at the very end), they're still in th  top 3 clubs at the moment. Bayern alongside Arsenal have been the best teams in the world. Kompany side is undefeated and are 14/14. I feel Bayern have a better chance of taking a point atleast with the squad they have. Most people tend to under- appreciate Bayerns squad but watch out for Laimer. He runs, runs and runs. Laimer, Olise linkup play will trouble PSG. Kane being kane. Deadly attack overall. And one more point that isn't match related but Upamecano contract renewal talks are in progress and he would want to perform at his best to get more out of those talks. He's an improved player since City match in 2023.\n\n\nAgain, this is sports and anything could happen but I see great value i backing away teams here. Good luck!",

And this Tuesday night clash between two Ohio schools should be a fun one. The Redhawks enter Athens, Ohio on a 5 game winning streak. Miami OH has taken care of business in conference play thus far, earning themselves a 4-0 conference record and making them 1st overall in the MAC. Meanwhile, the Ohio Bobcats have won 3 of their last 4, good enough for a 3-1 conference record. On paper these teams seem pretty evenly matched, but looking at their record tells a different story.\n\nThe Bobcats have had a season of highs and lows. They opened the season by nearly defeating Rutgers and then managed to upset West Virginia. However they followed that up with an expected loss to OSU and a surprising loss to Ball State a few weeks later. Despite their recent victories, Ohio has given up 20 or more points in 7/8 games this season (including 35 to FCS Gardner Webb).\n\nMiami (Ohio) began the season 0-3 against out of conference opponents. But following a blowout win vs Lindenwood, the Redhawks have won each of their last 4 conference games by at least 2 scores. Additionally, they’ve scored 20+ points in 6 of their 8 games this season. I think Miami OH will continue their hot streak on a cold and gloomy night in Ohio. This one will probably go down to the wire. BOL to those tailing, let’s do some winning!",

Hmm...what's a short two-hour drive from Charlotte?...Oh ya, Duke's campus. This will be far from a neutral site atmosphere, the dookies will travel and the Cameron Crazies atmosphere will be in full effect.\n\nTexas brings in Sean Miller who is a hell of a coach but in this day and age, year one of a new tenure is going to be rocky, and starting a new era of Texas basketball against a Duke team that is looking to make their way back to the Final Four this year is less than ideal.\n\nDuke welcomes 4 top 25 recruits in this class, which is something they are accustomed to. What they aren't necessarily accustomed to is one of them going off for the gaudiest of stat lines in an exhibition game a couple weeks ago. Cameron Boozier went for 24pts, 23 rebounds, 6 assists, 2 blocks, and a steal. Ok, that's cool, it was an exhibition game at home against central southeast who-cares community college right? Nope. This was against Tennessee, at Tennessee, with a full crowd, band, cheerleaders, the whole nine. Still an exhibition game so take it with a grain of salt but it was a highly competitive game in which Duke found themselves down at halftime, they ended up winning 83-76. Moral of the story is, Cameron Boozier might be a freak.\n\nTexas returns 2 starters, Tramon Mark and Jordan Pope, fine players, but neither jumps off the page really. After those two it's a bunch of nobodies. I think Texas is in for a long season playing in the stacked SEC and they do themselves no favors starting the year off with Duke.\n\nI can't pretend that Duke returns a bunch from last year's team because they don't, but do they ever? One and done players is what Duke basketball is built on and that hasn't changed much under the first few years of Jon Scheyer. That's what Duke does and that's what Duke is good at. I've been very impressed with Jon Scheyer so far as there has been almost no drop off in recruiting or results which seems impossible following Coack K.\n\nTexas has about a trillion dollars to blow on athletics so I'm sure at some point Sean Miller will have things running well, but I don't think that happens this year.\n\nThis game gets ugly early and Duke covers easily, IT'S GONNA BE AWESOME BABBBYYYYY!!!!",

Chicago under Billy Donovan toggles drop/ICE with Nikola Vučević at the level or below it, which yields those free-throw-line and mid-paint windows and invites early seals on the roll—exactly where Embiid’s diet sits.*\n\n*Joel isn’t listed on the Sixers’ injury report after sitting Sunday for knee-management; Paul George remains out, while rookie Jared McCain is set to debut—i.e., usage consolidates back to Maxey/Embiid. On the Bulls’ side, Coby White is out, Zach Collins (wrist) is out, and Ayo Dosunmu is on the report—Chicago’s perimeter pressure and big-man depth are thinner than usual.*\n\n*The Bulls are bottom-tier in opponent points in the paint so far, and when Vučević has to protect the rim without Collins as a relief big, whistles pile up and the short-roll lanes stay available.

With Chicago’s scheme conceding those mid-paint touches and Philly likely to spam Nurse’s empty-side actions to force Vučević in space, Embiid has multiple paths—FT parade, roll-seal, or face-up jumpers.*\n\n*Bulls have allowed the 6th most points to bigs on the season, while Embiid has covered this line in 16 of his last 17 games against them. Even on a minutes restriction (which is trending beyond the 20 minute mark with 23 and 25 minute performances), he's covered in the last 3 with an average of 23 points a game.*\n\n*With a softer matchup, a tight spread of (+/-1.5), and the highest game total of the night (239.5), expect Embiid to get his slice of the pie.*",

      "text": "**POTD Record 39-36-1**\n\nWell, fuck that Bucks game went exactly like the worst-case scenario I called out.  \nI was genuinely pissed when the Pacers went on that 11–0 run in the fourth and tied it late. I’ll admit, part of me wanted them to just lose outright. Then Giannis hits that turnaround jumper with two defenders in his face. Not his usual sprint-to-the-rim, whistle-drawing chaos, but a cold, patient, “I’m still that guy” midrange dagger. Holy shit. MVP-level moment.\n\nSo yeah, back to the drawing board. And I already know this next one is gonna make people cringe. But that’s usually where the good plays live. Deep in the mud.\n\n**Pelicans -1.5.**\n\nI’m making this bet early, and it’s mostly built on a theory: Zion plays. LaMelo sits. It’s not just a hope, it actually makes sense if you zoom out.\n\nThe Pelicans are 0–6, and every loss has looked worse than the last. They just wrapped up a brutal road trip where they lost every game and they head to Dallas tomorrow for a back-to-back. That makes this home game the perfect get-right spot.\n\nThey have to win this one. There’s no incentive to tank as they essentially traded their first-round pick (ATL gets higher pick of MILvsNO...) for the rookie, Queen, so losing helps them in absolutely no way. That’s key. This team isn’t built to play the “oops, maybe next year\" card. They’re fighting for relevance, and this is as winnable as it gets.\n\nCharlotte’s schedule actually lines up perfectly for this angle. The Hornets don’t play again until Friday, which gives them zero reason to rush LaMelo Ball back from his ankle injury. He already missed the Utah game, and with Brandon Miller also sidelined, they’ll likely lean on the side of caution especially against an 0–6 team that looks dead on paper.\n\nNew Orleans, on the other hand, can’t afford to coast. They’re the definition of desperate. They average just 107.7 points per game (30th in the NBA) while allowing 125.8 (dead last). Yeah, ugly.\n\nThe stats are all screaming “stay away,” which is exactly why I’m leaning in. Charlotte is 3–4, scoring 121.6 points a night (8th in the NBA), grabbing 45.7 rebounds per game, and shooting better from deep and the line than the Pelicans. New Orleans is 0–6, just 107.7 PPG, giving up 125.8, and getting crushed on the glass (7rb margin per game).\n\nIt’s brutal. But here’s the thing, most of those Pelicans games were on the road, and they actually haven’t been outclassed talent-wise. Zion’s averaging 22.8 points per game, and Jordan Poole (18), Trey Murphy III (15), and Jeremiah Fears (14) give them scoring balance . It’s just been a matter of putting it together.\n\nCharlotte’s got Miles Bridges (21ppg) carrying them offensively while LaMelo’s ankle limits his mobility. Without Brandon Miller spacing the floor, the Hornets’ offense gets predictable fast.\n\nThe Pelicans have the motivation edge. Full stop. They’re coming home after six losses, and they know they’ve got Dallas waiting tomorrow. You can’t go 0–7 and expect to show up in Texas with any confidence. Charlotte, meanwhile, has nothing urgent to play for tonight. Even if LaMelo’s close to ready, it makes zero sense to force him into a one-off against a desperate team before a three-day break. That’s why I’m getting in early. If Zion is confirmed in and LaMelo out, this line moves fast maybe from -1.5 to -3.5 or worse (i'd still bet it at that number too).\n\nLook, I know this is gross. You’re betting on a winless team that’s been getting smoked nightly. But it’s a classic buy-low spot. New Orleans is better than their record. They’ve been awful on defense, sure, but they’ve also faced multiple top-10 offenses. Charlotte’s banged up, still figuring out their identity without Miller, and likely down their star guard. Ugly. Gross. And hopefully right.\n\nPS: Bulls -1.5 tomorrow, because I just like the way this team is playing, and even with me being higher on Philly the first few weeks of the season than I was before it started, I think bulls win this at home.",

      "text": "Record: 155-135, -2.97 units\n\nLast Pick: Antoine Ghibaudo ML vs Saba Purtseladze (-185, 1 unit) \n\nTennis | Knoxville Challenger | 2:30 PM EST (estimated)\n\nToday's Pick: Oliver Tarvet vs Andre Ilagan | **Ilagan +1.5 sets at -120. 1 unit.** \n\nWrite-up: Thought that might end up being my first non-CLV play in a while, but some late odds movement pushed Ghibaudo to around -250. He ended up winning the match pretty easily, facing just one break point. \n\nInteresting match here between Oliver Tarvet and Andre Ilagan. Tarvet has proven himself against top-level competition in college tennis (and at Wimbledon), so it makes some sense that the market has been giving him a lot of respect since returning to the pro tour this fall. However, Ollie honestly hasn't been crushing it recently if you look at the raw results, and he comes off a really rough 6-1, 6-0 loss to Mats Rosenkranz in Charlottesville  (5.51 performance rating). He has quite a nice counterpunching game that he backs up with a solid serve, yet I don't necessarily feel that he's a master of indoor hard court just yet (he plays college tennis at UCSD, meaning that most of his tennis in the spring was outdoors). \n\nMeanwhile, Ilagan, who also played college tennis at Hawaii, isn't as well known as Tarvet and doesn't have quite the same ceiling. However, Ilagan has quietly been piling up some impressive results lately, taking sets off other top college guys like Jódar and Damm. One thing I want to highlight is that both players faced Iñaki Montes De La Torre last week in Charlottesville. Tarvet was a smaller favorite against Iñaki than he is here, and Ilagan was also favored by the market in that matchup, implying that the odds here should be a bit closer (in terms of results, both players found themselves in tough three-set battles, though Tarvet barely came out victorious). Is it a matchup problem? Maybe, but there's no clear evidence for that. Ilagan has a nice lefty grinding game, and I don't see him giving Tarvet tons of free points here. As I mentioned, Tarvet just got crushed by a different lefty, albeit one with a very different game to Ilagan, and it's hard to avoid taking a hit to your confidence when you win just 11 points in an entire match. Overall, Ilagan should be coming into this match with plenty of confidence that he can take a set. I will say that I honestly prefer the ML as a market (I think that Tarvet's form is quite questionable - there's a chance he comes in strong and wins 2-0, but he could easily play another bad match and lose outright). If you can get that at 3.50 or above I would go for it (can't take it here due to odds restrictions). For that reason, my official play is the set handicap, which I still think is worth a unit. \n\nNote: The [POTD Capper Tracker](https://potd.lol), which you may remember from its Google Sheet days, is finally back in a cleaner, more robust website format!

Took a short break from posting after that pick to try and build some momentum and after a few really successful days I'm back. \n\nTODAYS BET \n\nEVENT/S = Real Madrid VS Liverpool and Arsenal VS Slavia Praha\n\nPARLAY BET =  Kylian Mbappe to have 2+ Shots on target and Slavia Praha Second half Goals UNDER 1 (No goals second half for Slavia Praha) @2.00\n\nUNITS = 3U to Profit 3U\n\nSUMMARY = Mbappe has been smashing this market all season long. He has played 17 games including internationals and only missed this market twice. Once when he scored but Real Madrid got shut out against Atletico Madrid and another time where he just had an off game but still managed 5 shots. So 2 very possible games are the only thing stopping this from being a perfect record. Coming into this game Real Madrid are in great form winning every game apart from the previously mentioned loss to Atletico Madrid and Mbappe has actually grabbed a goal in every game apart from 2. Liverpool on the other hand have had a really rough time lately. They have lost 6 out of their last 8 games and looked really poor. They did win their last match out against Aston Villa which was a decent result but even Villa weren't completely shut out of the game, they had some decent runs of play and Liverpool still showed weakness which against Real Madrid should result in chances.\n\nArsenal have conceded 3 goals all season. 1 goal against Haaland in the first half, 1 goal against Newcastle in the first half and 1 world class free kick against Liverpool in the second half. They have been an extremely strong defensive side all season. Slavia play in the Czechia league so it's really hard to judge their attacking talent so all we have to go off of against top teams is their 3-0 loss to Inter Milan. They had 3 shots all game and had an XG of 0.11. I don't even see them getting a shot on target against Arsenal. Even if Arsenal rest some key players the style of play will still deny Slavia much of the ball and it should result in a convincing win for Arsenal. I feel this market is a lot safer compared to an Arsenal Win or Arsenal to score x amount of goals which is why I am not going for that.",

Despite the internal issues + fan protests the Hammers fully deserved that win looking a lot stronger than the Magpies throughout even when going 1-0 down. A corner-heavy first half saw Newcastle leading the count 5-4 before the game ended on 7-6 for West Ham for a sweat-free finish.\n\nCoventry are sitting at the top of the Championship with one loss recorded all season. Under Lampard they’ve been playing some very attacking football and though it’s early days could be looking at a first stint in the Prem since the 2001 season after years of financial troubles and hanging in the lower divisions. Meanwhile this season has been a nightmare for Sheffield United, finding themselves in 22nd spot. Having been so close to being promoted last year (3rd spot and made the finals of the playoffs) losing their first 6 matches of the season was unexpected and they’ve hired Chris Wilder (again !) to change their fortunes. The Sky Blues have averaged 5.8 corners at home over their last 20 whilst the Blades have only conceded 3.5 per away match in the same time period. Adjusting for pressure from Coventry and taking into account more recent data gives an expected 4.8 corners for the home team.\n\nThat gives this play an estimated 78% chance of winning. I would take the probability down a notch slightly more considering how offensive they’ve been looking but Sheffield really are corner suppressors. They’ve conceded even below 5.5 in 18 of their last 20 (+ 9/10) whilst Coventry have covered in 7/10 so I still very much like the value.

Harry Kane has been incredible with 22 goals in just 15 games this season including 5 goals in 3 Champions League matches, making him one of the most dangerous strikers in the world. \n\nBayern lost the last meeting with PSG at the Club World Cup in July, Bayern were the better team in the first half and conceded both goals only in the second half after Jamal Musiala suffered a very bad injury just before halftime, which completely destroyed the team’s morale and rhythm. Bayern have beaten PSG in the last 4 UCL games and PSG has failed to score in any of those fixtures, showing they know how to beat the French champions. PSG are missing important players for this match, with Desiré Doué ruled out for weeks with a thigh injury and Ousmane Dembélé not expected to start the game even though he just returned to training, which weakens their attack badly. Bayern is coming in this match after beating Bayer Leverkusen 3-0 while resting most of their best players, proving how strong their squad is. \n\nIf you found these picks helpful, tips or donations are greatly appreciated as they support the time and effort I put into creating them: [buy me a beer🍻](https://buymeacoffee.com/hercules.son.of.zeus)",

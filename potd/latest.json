San Antonio ranks 4th in the NBA for fewest rebounds allowed to opposing centers at home, and it’s no coincidence it’s Victor Wembanyama , league-leader in blocks, top-tier defensive rebounding, Towns has faced this Spurs frontcourt multiple times already and has gone under 12.5 rebounds in nearly every head-to-head (averagin’ around 9-11 boards against them, way down from his season 11.9 norm). Wemby’s length clogs the paint, contests everything, and limits second-chance looks",

      "text": "**POTD Record:**  102 – 66 - 11\n\n**Previous:**  Porto vs AVS - Both teams to score NO & Over 1.5 goals – WINNING!\n\n**Recap:**  Best team vs worst team in the table.  Results not surprising, a win to nil with more than 1 goal as expected.\n\n**New Event:**  Las Vegas Bowl - Nebraska vs Utah\n\n**Pick:**  Utah - Total Rushing Yards Over 207.5 @ 1.88  (Usual 3 units)\n\nSeveral aspects to take into consideration for this pick, but they all add up to a good chance for success.  While Utah’s head coach Whittingham has left to take over Michigan’s top job, their defensive coordinator, Scalley, will be Utah’s head coach next year and is taking the helm for this bowl game.  Their last game was over a month ago and both players and coaching staff have had plenty of time to prepare for this match and can look forward to coaching continuity for next year.\n\nThe thought process here is that Utah have a massive advantage at the line of scrimmage with the 2^(nd) best rushing offense in the country, while Nebraska’s offense is missing its starting QB and RB.  Unless Utah falls behind early and needs to desperately catch up, there will be no need to even attempt to pass the ball and the rushing yards will add up. \n\nAs we have seen in other bowl games so far, teams that have not played in 3 or 4 weeks are not having success with their passing game as much as rushing the ball.  This will certainly be the case in this match.\n\nA few bullet points to consider:\n\n* Nebraska’s Passing Defense ranks #2 in the country allowing an average of only 147 yards per game (ypg), while Utah’s Passing Offense is 91^(st), advantage Nebraska.\n* Nebraska’s Passing Offense ranks #79^(th) in the country while Utah’s Passing Defense is 14^(th) allowing only 179 ypg, advantage Utah.\n* Nebraska is dealing with numerous opt-outs and injuries most notably starting QB Raiola, and starting running back Emmett Johnson. \n* Nebraska will be starting freshman TJ Lateef at QB who has stepped up with mixed results the last few games of the season.  2 losses and a win when starting.\n* **Utah has the 2nd best rushing offense in the country and averages 270 rushing ypg, while Nebraska’s rush defense ranks 102nd** **allowing an average of 180 ypg.  Massive advantage for Utah.**\n* Additionally, Utah rush an average of 44 times per game, 67% of all plays and get over 6 yards per carry.  Nebraska have allowed an average of 5 yards per carry.\n* Utah’s QB Danpier was going to sit this game out, but has decided to play. He averages 62 yards per game rushing by himself.\n* Opt-outs and injuries exist for both sides, but seem quite significant for Nebraska.  Utah will be missing a couple of starting linemen, but their rushing prowess is not even close to being negated by Nebraska defense. \n\nThe Over/Under line for Utah’s total yards is at 415.5 while the line for rushing yards is 207.5.  For a team that rushes 67% of all their plays and gets 6+ yards per carry, 207.5 seems a bit light.\n\nAlmost forgot to mention, Utah is laying 14.5 so a beatdown is expected.  All I can see here is running the football down Nebraska’s throat all day.  Unless Nebraska has figured out how to stop a top rushing attack without playing a single snap in a month, this should hit. ",

This season, he has cleared this line 86% of the time. McBride is coming back from an ankle injury, but in his first game back vs the Pelicans, he grabbed 14 points (4-8 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 4-4 FT). Now, McBride should actually have an easier matchup against the Spurs, as they defend the PG position pretty weakly (30th) compared to the Pelicans (5th). \n\nWith Josh Hart being out, he has grabbed 8 points 6/7 times in the last two seasons and 2/2 this season. He also attempts more shots (9 FGA vs 12 FGA) and gets about an 11% boost in playing time. Hopefully, they let him play a little longer this next game, as I think they will need him. Two powerhouse teams - should be a fun game.\n\nBOL",

Over the season, the Lightning have a +25 goal differential and are an impressive 11-4-3 on the road this year.\n\nWe don’t know who the Ducks goalie will be. Dostal has struggled quite a bit since coming back from his injury and Mrazek has a .865 save percentage in his appearances. The Ducks have also struggled with their goalie problem. They are 3-6-1 in their last 10 and now have a negative goal differential on the season.\n\nThe Lightning are on the road on this one, but they have an extra day of rest with their last game on Sunday.\n\nGood Luck",

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 6-18-3 *Officially three times as many losses as wins. Yikes. Villa sold us hopes and dreams in the first half before proceeding to get blown out by the ruthlessly clinical Arsenal side in the second half. Despite all this recent madness though, I'm more than positive I can end the year on a high note with this next pick. Let's get an early one out of the way*\n\n**Last Five:** ✅❌❌❌❌\n\n**Event:** A-League Men, Central Coast Mariners v Brisbane Roar, starts in 6 hours and 54 minutes\n\n**POTD:** Central Coast Mariners Win or Draw -125, 5 units\n\n**Write Up:** A quick glance at the league table might make this one seem fairly straightforward, while it's anything but. The margins are actually much smaller when you see the games played and **how close the Mariners are to climbing all the way into the midtable,** and for that reason I'm willing to back the hosts to win or secure a cheeky draw. *While Brisbane Roar currently sit 8 places higher in the league standings* and have the better recent form, **this H2H matchup's often been competitive and unpredictable.** Across their broader history, Central Coast have picked up plenty of positive results, including a series of wins against the Roar in the last few seasons, reminding us that this fixture often favours the underdog *(and make it known, the Mariners are barely an underdog here).* For example, they've **won 3 out of their last 5 meetings** and the 3 wins have all been very comfortable.\n\nCentral Coast haven’t collapsed even when struggling in the table, and they still **create chances at home, scoring at least once in most matches this season,** and having **scored more goals than their next opponents.** Their attack, led by **Jason Cummings and Tulio,** has shown it can trouble defences through their sheer technicality even when results don’t go their way. Their only issue is really their leaky defence, which has **also seen some slight improvements in defensive organisation** and especially the ability to execute pressing correctly, which makes it harder for Brisbane to simply dominate from start to finish. Not to mention Brisbane Roar have been pretty dreadful in front of goal themselves, scoring just a measly goal per game.\n\nTaking into consideration the competitive historical clashes, Central Coast’s ability to score and keep themselves in games, and the fact that **this rivalry has produced its fair share of draws and Mariners wins**, I like the chances of **Central Coast Mariners getting a win or draw.** Sending it with 5 whole units and going to sleep soundly, knowing I'll wake up to almost double the pretty sizeable stake. BOL y'all, let's end the year with a bang and bring some better fortunes into 2026 ☘️🫡",

They've safely secured 3rd place, whereas Cameroon can choose to sit back and play more cautiously. In the group stage, this line cleared in both games with 4 corners, 29 shots for Mozambique vs Gabon and 3 corners, 19 shots vs Ivory coast who have some of the best defence. Cameroon also hit the shot line and allowed 5 and 7 corners to their opponents in both group games. Mozambique were amazing corner generators in the WC qualifiers, clearing in 8/10 games in the WC qualifiers with 7, 5, 5, 4, 5, 5, 8, 8 including games vs Uganda, Algeria, who are solid sides.\nOne last win for the year.\nEnjoy the new years eve and best of luck.",

The Ayton pick before that lost because the Lakers were down 25 in the 3^(rd), and the coach pulled all the starters.\n\n \n\nNext Pick: **LA Lakers -7.0 vs Charlotte Hornets @ 1.91**. 3U play.\n\nThe Hornets are 1-5 ATS in their last 6, also losing 5 of those 6 games. With Ball and Miller injured, Miles Bridges Questionable, and various other injuries, they are a very thin squad. The Lakers are coming off an unexpected demolition by a second-string Hawks team. JJ is going to expect his team to bounce back in a big way, and Luka and Ayton should both have big games here. AR is also upgraded to Questionable, so there is a decent chance he starts here as well. The quality between these team is simply too much, and the Lakers need to bounce back after their pathetic display while Hornets have little to play for. I will back the Lakers to get their mojo back here.",

      "text": "Record: 158-137, -1.71 units\n\nLast Pick: Daniil Glinka ML vs Darwin Blanch (-143, 1 unit): Loss\n\nTennis | Drummondville Challenger | 1:30 PM EST (estimated) \n\nToday's Pick: Antoine Ghibaudo vs Clement Chidekh | **Ghibaudo ML at -122 (DraftKings). 1 unit.**\n\nWrite-up: Glinka closed at -159 on BetRivers, though odds varied quite a bit on books. Unfortunately, Blanch was simply better player in that match. There was some drama in the second set where a critical point won by Glinka was replayed due to an issue with the balls, and he went up a minibreak at the start of the tiebreak, but it's hard to say he deserved to win that one. Definitely not a good pick, but I'm still happy with my overall form (8-2 L10 and getting close to break-even). \n\nToday, I'm going with Antoine Ghibaudo to defeat Clement Chidekh in Drummondville. Ghibaudo, who relies on a big serve + 1 combination, is always at his best on fast hard courts, and he's been showing that throughout this indoor season. He made one of his best runs of the year a couple weeks ago in Sioux Falls, defeating Martin Damm in the semifinals; in Knoxville last week, I didn't think he played badly despite a lopsided loss to eventual champion Mitchell Krueger. Ghibaudo has consistently gotten off to a good start in tournaments recently, having won his first match in his last 10 events played. \n\nClement Chidekh has always been known as a talented player, but he hasn't necessarily lived up to his potential this year. After a solid start to the year that saw him narrowly miss out on qualifying for the Australian Open with a wild loss to Hady Habib, his performance at this level has been inconsistent at best. Most recently, he played ITFs in Glasgow and Montreal and threw in a couple of rough losses to James Story and Duncan Chan.\n\nOverall, I feel that Ghibaudo comes into this tournament with a lot more momentum on his side. Chidekh has a good backhand and solid baseline game, but Ghibaudo has the bigger serve, and has spent months playing this NA hard-court swing. I feel that he comes into this tournament with momentum on his side, and should be a bigger favorite in this all-French matchup.\n\nNote: The [POTD Capper Tracker](https://potd.lol), which you may remember from its Google Sheet days, is finally back in a cleaner, more robust website format!

Led by star player tasman but overall a really strong fire power roster with no real weak links on the roster\n* Venom have been very inconsistent for a long time now, much higher ranked team but struggle heavily with  losing to worse teams and some inconsistency amongst their players. Led by star AWPer flayy, this team has had a relatively strong season overall and despite some disappointing results in the back half of the year should be relatively happy with the season they have put together\n\n**Veto:**\n\n* NOVAQ ban Overpass, VENOM ban Inferno\n* **NOVAQ Pick dust 2**\n\n**Dust 2 Stats:**\n\n* NOVAQ are 78% winrate on 18 maps of Dust 2, it is their most played map and highest winrate by a large margin\n* Venom are 25% winrate on 16 maps of Dust 2, it is their most played map as well but lowest winrate by far with their next lowest being Mirage at 43%. This map is often picked as a punish pick against Venom and they have struggled on it for a while now.\n* Venom are 2-5 in the last month on Dust 2, they are mostly getting carried by their 64% winrate on pistol rounds leading to much closer maps then they have played in the past. Venom are 12-21 in 2025 on Dust 2. Venom are 2-10 in their last 12 maps of Dust 2 they have played\n* Novaq are 8-3 in the last month on Dust 2, they are on a 3 map winstreak of absolute domination beating FORZE Reload 13-3/13-4 and SPARTA 13-5 all in the last 3 days. They have won 7 of their last 9 maps on Dust 2 and 5 of the last 6\n* One thing I love about NOVAQ on Dust 2, they are 61.2% winrate on T side, the weaker side normally for most teams",

Barely scraped by on this one, glad to finally get 2 in a row again and hit +30u! \n\nToday’s POTD: 🏈 Romeo Doubs 25+ alt receiving yards + Christian Watson 25+ alt receiving yards (-150).\n\nGame starts at 8:15pm EST. Bet 3.25u\n\nWriteup: Keeping this one simple. Now with Christian Watson back, Jordan Love can once again show off how much he loves throwing to these guys, especially with starting TE Tucker Kraft now out for the year. The Eagles passing defense is on the bottom end of yards allowed, and one of the worst in explosive plays allowed through the air. On top of this, one of the Eagles's top CBs, Jaire Alexander, will be out this game. I expect for this to be a close game or even have the Eagles as the underdog in the lead, so expect a lot of passing from Love in this one to his top guys. The Packers reminded us just how good Love is with these 2 guys against the Panthers last week, and I expect for us to see it again. WR1s and WR2s have been absolutely cooking this Eagles pass defense all season, and both receivers here can each respectively hit their O/U on receiving yards as well as their longest reception O/U, but I think 25+ yards for each of them is a great number.\n\nRemember to only bet what you can afford to lose, and BOL!",

Two team parlay (+130) (2U) ✅\n\n[Parlay write up](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/s/IrfEORvS0I)\n\nBLOWOUT MOTHERFUCKING WINNER. That’s how you fucking bounce back baby, we move to 3-0 on 2 unit plays and we preserve our perfect record of no b2b losses! 😤 \n\nEvent: Eagles @ Packers (7:15pm central)\n\nPOTD: standard two leg 6.5 point teaser \n\n(Eagles +8/under 52) (-120) (1U) \n\n-everything is bet to win unit amount-\n\nWrite up: \n\nLet’s start with the eagles +8 side of the teaser first. The packers just lost Tucker krack to an already banged up receiver group and things aren’t going to get any easier against an elite pass defense in Philly. The eagles are coming off a bye and have had two weeks to prepare for this mnf juggernaut game. This offense was trending in the right direction before the bye, Hurts has completed 71.1% of his passes for 1068 yards with 10 touchdowns and one pick over the last four games. Meanwhile, Barkley finally broke out with 150 rushing yards in Week 8. They are also number in EPA per play since week 7, exploding over those two weeks before the bye. In their nfc wild card matchup against the packers, the eagles got the best of Jordan love as he went 20/33 for just 212 yards and 3 picks. Philadelphia’s pass rush is ramping up as well, scoring seven sacks in the past two games (after only nine in the opening six outings), and it just added depth with edge Jaelan Phillips at the trade deadline. Brandon graham has also come out of retirement to help bolster this defensive unit even more. I expect Philly to come correct and at least stay within a touchdown with this also being a lower scoring contest which we will get to right now\n\nNow for the under 52… With Kraft sidelined for the season, Jayden Reed placed on injured reserve, and rookie receiver Matthew Golden nursing a shoulder issue, Green Bay’s aerial attack faces significant limitations.\nStill, the Packers boast a formidable pass defense, currently ranked eighth in the NFL for defensive dropback success rate. At Lambeau Field, they’ve been especially stingy, surrendering just 16.3 points per game. Even in last week’s surprising defeat to the Panthers, the defense held its ground.\nGiven the circumstances, both squads will likely rely heavily on their ground games to move the ball come Monday night. That strategy becomes even more crucial with temperatures forecasted to hover near freezing in Green Bay.\nNeither offense is known for its pace. The Packers rank 26th in seconds per play, while the Eagles sit even lower at 30th. This deliberate tempo, combined with a run-heavy approach, should keep the clock ticking and favor a lower-scoring outcome — making the Under an appealing play.\n\nI’m currently finishing up my senior year at the university of Alabama, balancing school and getting these potds in for y’all is something I take pride in so if you would like to leave a tip I am leaving a link to my Venmo, they are greatly appreciated!\nhttps://venmo.com/ben_wrigley",

      "text": "Record: 21-12\n\nLast Five Predictions (Old - New): ❌✅ ✅❌ ✅\n\nNet Units: +18.77\n\nYesterday's Pick: Erling Haaland to score vs Liverpool 3u @ $1.72 ✅\n\nReally happy with this one. Haaland missed a pen, but still scored within half an hour. Some added bonuses are the other bets I mentioned all getting up too. \n- Haaland to score and 2+ shots on target \n- Haaland to score and City to win/draw\n\nNice to have it covered within 30 minutes.\n\nOn top of that, I added a comment that if Wirtz starts then Doku could have a big game... Wirtz started and Doku was clear MOTM, scoring a goal in what was probably his best game for City. The was world class in this game. \n\nToday's Pick:  Esbjerg to win and u3.5 total goals v Middelfart. 4u @ $2.5\n\nNot many games today, but I like betting on this league. \n\nMid-table Esbjerg host bottom of the table Middlefart.\n\nMilldefart obviously has an elite name, but that's where it ends.... They're having a shocking season and sit last on the table; Losing The last 5.\n\nTheir away form has been terrible all season, drawing twice and losing their other five away from home. \n\nHaving said that though, they haven't been getting smashed. They've conceded 12 in their seven away games.... Which isn't great but considering they haven't won any of those games, it's about as good as possible. \n\nIn those games, they've only had two games go over the 3.5 goal barrier. One a crazy 2-2 draw where they pulled two goals from nothing, the other being a 4-0 loss. \n\nEsbjerg have been good at home with a 4-2-2 record after eight games. Again though, the games haven't been incredibly goal heavy with eleven goals scored and eleven again. \n\nIf you want to play it safer, Esbjerg to win outright is good odds too at $1.61.",

Last time in France he comfortably lost in straight sets to Droguet and he wasn’t playing well. However I watched his match against spizziri in his last match and I could see his old form coming back. Djere only lost this match because he was mentally drained after failing to finish the match with 2 match points. On any other day he would have won that match. This is why this time around I think he comfortably beats Blanchet. Now when you look at recent form Blanchet has lost 2-0 in the last 3 matches. His hard court form is pretty good but Djere will like this match up because I believe the fast indoor style of tennis will allow him to dominate especially against an out of form Blanchet.\n\nHope anyone who tailed this wins stress free and good luck!!\n\n-I appreciate anyone who buys me a coffee ☕️\n\n[https://buymeacoffee.com/matkonc9i](https://buymeacoffee.com/matkonc9i)",

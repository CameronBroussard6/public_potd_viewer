Easy sweat free cash! \n\nOnly one EPL game today, but it should be a good one as we see 7th place Brentford host 1st place Arsenal. This game has huge implications in both the title race and the top European spots. Both teams will want a win. We're targeting the top defense in the EPL, which may seem counter productive, but we've had decent success with this type of play and the value is definitely there. Keep this in mind though if you decide to tail, Arsenal is a risky team to go against. \n\nOuattara is a striker for Brentford, who joined the team this season from Bournemouth. He is in fantastic form as of late, scoring goals in his last 2 games and landing an SOT in each of his last 3 matches. With much of the defensive focus on Thiago, Ouattara has had more and more opportunities and is taking more shots. He has looked fantastic on the pitch, runs with a high motor, and is generally playing really well. I like him to continue his form and land an SOT here at home against Arsenal. \n\nBOL!",

Onto the next pick, which will be my last NBA pick until after the all-star break, don't be surprised to see some Olympic hockey action in the meantime. The Bucks will be travelling to OKC to complete their back-to-back. These two teams played a couple weeks ago, with the Thunder walking away with a comfortable 20 point win on the road. Now they're down SGA, but otherwise are regaining their health. Don't be fooled by their recent losses to Houston and SA without SGA, as those are both elite western contenders, and the Bucks are nowhere near the same caliber. Before those two losses, they had won 7 straight without the MVP, covering the spread in the majority. The Bucks ran a short bench tonight in their win against the Magic, and needed a 34 point bomb from Cam Thomas to pull through. After all their healthy starters played 30 minutes tonight before travelling to an early OKC tipoff, I expect a sluggish start that the OKC defenders will feast on, fueling the crowd and an early lead for the Thunder. \n\nBOL if tailing, lets make it 8 straight NBA plays! Any tips are highly appreciated, but of course not expected.  \n[https://buymeacoffee.com/ch1cken](https://buymeacoffee.com/ch1cken)",

Their form right now is scary, they have won 3 straight games beating Leeds, Chelsea, and Sunderland without conceding a single goal. Their defense is arguably the best in the world atm, allowing just 0.72 xGA over their last 5 matches. With Viktor Gyökeres firing upfront and the midfield fully healthy, they are clicking on all cylinders.\n\n​Brentford is coming off a chaotic 3-2 win against Newcastle, but don't let that fool you, their defense is leaky. They have conceded more goals at home than almost any other mid-table team this season. Historically, the Gtech Community Stadium has been a playground for Arsenal, the Gunners have won 4 games in a row at this stadium.\n\n​You have a title-contending team with the best defense in the league playing against a team that bleeds high-danger chances.

Why dwell on that game, though, when one of the most exciting clashes of the season is upon us? Let's dive into it right about now!!*\n\n**Last Five:** ✅❌❌❌✅\n\n**Event:** Copa del Rey, Atletico Madrid v FC Barcelona, 3:00 pm EST\n\n**POTD:** Atletico Madrid 0.0, +0.5 Asian Handicap, -111, 5 units\n\n**Write Up:** Oh yes, Barcelona are meeting Atletico Madrid in the semi finals of this year's Spanish Copa del Rey. This matchup rarely disappoints, with the most recent first leg in the cup (last season) ending 4-4 with **Barca infamously choking a two goal lead twice.**\n\nAtletico Madrid's league title hopes are more or less dusted and they're not exactly one of the favorites to win the Champions League either, so they've turned all their focus on the domestic cup competition. With their main rivals, Real Madrid, already eliminated, the only team that realistically stands in their way to silverware, is Barcelona. The idea that they're putting all their eggs in one basket, so to speak, is backed by their **quarter final performance, in which they thrashed a very strong Real Betis side 5-0.** On the other hand, **Barcelona are being stretched thin,** still fighting hard on all fronts, and **their Copa del Rey campaign has been unconvincing** to say the least.\n\nTaking all of that into consideration, plus all the **injuries on Barcelona's side** (de Jong, Pedri, Gavi, Raphinha and Christensen are all out), I can't see Barcelona taking the control of the midfield this time around, especially **not on Atletico's ground.** Atletico are going to have all the fan support behind them and should, at the very least, snatch a cheeky draw here. BTTS Yes is also a reasonable angle to take, though I don't exactly expect a goal fest here, as there's still a whole second leg left to be played after today. I wouldn't miss the chance to fade Barcelona for anything, and let's have some fun with a 5 unit nuke. Today, we're going to be hatwatching like never before. BOL and let's enjoy one of the most fiercely contested matchups in club football ☘️🫡",

      "text": "Record: 180-149, +5.80 units\n\nLast Pick: Olaf Pieczkowski ML vs Quinn Vandecasteele (+110, 1 unit): Win\n\nTennis | ATP Dallas | 9:10 PM EST (estimated)\n\nToday's Pick: Tommy Paul vs Miomir Kecmanovic | **Paul to win 2-0 at +100 (DK)**. 1 unit\n\nWrite-up: No CLV on that play, but that's about the only negative I can find, as Pieczkowski scored a nice 2-0 win.\n\nTommy Paul is one of the more consistent performers on hard courts, having recently made the fourth round of the Australian Open and lost to Alcaraz in a match that was closer than the scoreline makes it look. He has an excellent record on these indoor hard courts here in Dallas, having won the tournament in 2024 and lost to a red-hot Shapovalov in the semis in 2025. There were some concerns about how he would adjust to new conditions a few days after playing a Davis Cup tie against Hungary on clay. However, he managed to squeeze past Jenson Brooksby in R1 with a solid 7.51 performance rating, and he should be prepared for the second round now.\n\nIn comparison, Kecmanovic is a former top junior who never quite lived up to the billing, but has nevertheless managed to hang around the ATP tour for quite a while now. But Kecmanovic has had a really rough start to the season, going winless through four matches before scraping past Shimabukuro in R1 here (7.20). While that win may give him some confidence after a ton of tight losses as of late, his form simply doesn't suggest that he can challenge Tommy here. Prior to this year, Kecmanovic had an 0-2 record in Dallas, and it's been a while since he's shown the ability to beat against top players on any surface. Both of these players tend to stick at the baseline, but Paul will have the advantage in the serve and backhand departments. In general, most players who beat Tommy have some sort of \"special sauce\" or variation in their game that disrupts his rhythm. Brooksby is one of those players, and is in slightly better form than Kecmanovic, so I'm surprised to see Paul be a slightly smaller favorite here. I like the home player to move on in straight sets and get one step closer to a potential second title here.",

Wirtz even with a second for 9x the money\n\n**Today's Event:** ACL | Pohang Steelers vs Gamba Osaka | 11:00 GMT +2\n\n**Pick:** Gamba Osaka or Draw + BTTS:NO@2.69 (Betsmith) | **Stake: 1.5u**\n\n**Write Up**:\n\nI’m really not super sure about this game, but it definitely isn’t smelling of a lot of goals. Pohang Steelers ended the season with only 3 of their last 21 games seeing more than three goals… They also only scored in four of their last nine games and saw three wins from the last league games. It doesn’t look like they have lost any important players since last season.\n\nGamba Osaka has the benefit of having a competitive game under the belt in 2026, but it did end in disappointing fashion as they could not score against CIty rivals Cerezo, despite their opponent having player sent off in the 1st half. Gamba lacks a special player that can open things up when the opponent sits back and defends, it ended up just being a bunch of sideways passes outside of the box. \n\nGamba with a new manager in both meanings of the word, as this is also his first professional manager job. I think he might be a bit more careful here and be happy enough with a draw in the away leg and do the job at home next week. I was originally going to do Gamba draw no bet, but the odds have been sliced too much. My guess is 0-0 or 1-0 for the guests. \n\n",

Jakob Poulsen has repeatedly stressed the importance of consistency, mental sharpness and belief in his press interactions — emphasising that his side must “play their game and stay focused for all 90 minutes” and not assume anything is won before it’s earned, even against elite opposition. This reflects a clear tactical identity: Poulsen’s 3-4-3/3-5-2 setup is built around controlled possession, progressive wide play and overloads in transition, which has historically allowed AGF to generate superior expected-goals metrics against Midtjylland at Ceres Park. Meanwhile, FC Midtjylland arrive weakened defensively, with key defender Mads Bech out 4–6 weeks, and additional players sick or doubtful — a major disruption to their back line stability. The Wolves’ coach and leadership have talked more about survival and managing energy than domination — an indirect admission that FCM might be cautious away from home and prioritise avoiding defeat to take a result back to Herning. Danish coverage has highlighted Midtjylland’s reliance on structure and set-pieces rather than fluent attacking play recently, especially when missing personnel, while Poulsen’s setup is proactively constructed to exploit those exact weaknesses. With AGF chasing a historic first cup win in 30 years and visibly buoyed by their resilient late victory over OB — where substitutes changed the game — the psychological and tactical groundwork strongly supports AGF avoiding defeat, making +0.00 a convincing angle going into this semi-final tie.\n\n",

CST\n\nADM came out with a very tough R1 matchup here in Rotterdam against Arthur Fils but his overwhelming consistency and strong baseline game took care of business. In his next match, I'm expecting a pretty straightforward match here against a player well past his prime in Wawrinka. Not much of a H2H here with ADM winning the only meeting between these two with ease. This matchup took place in 2024 on clay where Stans game actually has been pretty solid but now, indoors, this should suit ADM much nicer. De Minaur has been playing exceptional tennis lately with his only loss in his last 8 appearances coming to Carlos Alcaraz. In the last two years in this event, his losses have came to Alcaraz and Sinner, which tells us he feels pretty comfortable in these conditions unless he is playing top class players, which Wawrinka is not anymore.

Bit sweaty on the O'Sullivan pick but he cashes us nonetheless. Took a break for a bit - as a Seahawks fan I couldn't be happier! Feeling good after the break lets get back to cashing some lays.\n\nTodays pick goes to the Switzerland Super League, FC Thun (1st) face off against Lausanne (7th), Thun are the home team here with a total record of 7-1-3 (W/D/L) but most recently winning their last 6 home fixtures. On the other hand are Lausanne going 3-4-4, recent away form of 2-2-2. Thun are simply in too good form for Lausanne, only losing 5 of their 23 fixtures and with the home advantage, coming in on a 7 game win streak and Lausanne winless in 3 I think the quality gap will see Thun through for another 3 points. \n\nFor the second leg O2.5 goals we have seen this in the last 7 head-to-head fixtures, Thun have seen this hit in the last SEVEN games. The away team have hit this 3/6 last matchups. Another good substitute for this line would be BTTS as Thun have gone 7/7 and Lausanne have gone 5/6 last fixtures, with 6/7 last head-to-heads. Given both of these lines have a good hit rate, in addition to both of their attacking form being relatively decent (despite Lausanne's results) I do see both teams scoring and both of these lines clearing with somewhat ease. I'm going to go with a 2-1 Thun dub. \n\nBOL and always bet what you can afford to lose!",

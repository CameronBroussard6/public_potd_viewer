      "text": "First time POTD\n\nI mainly bet on football (EPL and CL) and League of Legends\n\n**Record:** 0-0\n\n**Sport:** Football | England Premier League\n\n**Pick: Arsenal -1.5 Asian Handicap @ 1.85 @ 2U**\n\n**Reasoning:** Arsenal are in a tight title race and can’t afford to drop points in games like this. Even away from home, they control matches through possession, structure, and consistent chance creation. When they face mid-table sides, the quality gap usually shows over 90 minutes.\n\nWolves tend to struggle against elite opposition, often conceding territory and relying on limited attacking moments. In addition to that, Arsenal is the best defense in EPL\n\n**BOL!**",

The first tournament they added Zweih, they went 4-0 on Mirage, they beat Spirit, Falcons, Aurora and FURIA all without giving up double digits\n* This tournament has been a disaster for PARIVISION on Mirage, they have played the map 3 times and are 0-3 on the map so far this tournament losing each of the last 3 days in one sided fashion. They lost to G2 13-8, FaZe 13-2 and FURIA 13-8, while none of these teams are \"bad\" at Mirage, none of them are top teams/stand outs on the map in my opinion either. They have lost 69% of rounds in the last 3 days on Mirage and yet to win a pistol round on Mirage for the entire tournament, with low 30% winrate on both CT and T side\n* FUT are 86% winrate on 22 maps of Mirage in the L3 months, they are 7-1 in the last month overall. They are just coming off an insane 13 winstreak on this map, they lost to MOUZ today but I think their is a lot they can take from that series to help them here, I think FUT will look back at that game and feel like they beat themselves more then that MOUZ heavily outplayed them. \n* As said FUT were on a 13 map winstreak on Mirage before today, they have beaten multiple teams this tournament already on Mirage including Astralis, FURIA, Aurora, they also beat G2 and Astralis earlier in the month, these are two of the teams that PARIVISION have gotten destroyed by the last two days\n* Think the main two things lacking against MOUZ after they got their 7-2 lead was they got very sloppy/off script on T side, and got antsy on CT side and were trying to make too many plays and get too much info. These are things PARIVISION are great at punishing with Jame's system, so this gives FUT strong footage to review and use. On top of this, PARIVISION were the last game of the day and FUT knew that if PARI lost they would face them tomorrow, so they were watching today map 3 when FURIA and PARIVISION faced on Mirage and watched them get picked apart.

Arsenal are the only prem team playing midweek this week which after dropping points against Brentford would mean they have a quick opportunity to respond. Arsenal are coming into this after a 4-0 attacking display against Wigan and will look to carry that performance on with key players like Saka and Saliba returning from injury. I expect a similar performance to their away game against Leeds.\n\n\\---\n\nWolves are coming off facing 10 shots on target against 17th placed Nottm Forest who literally sacked their manager after the game… I expect home ground to give wolves a boost but this Arsenal side will look to be as clinical as can be and look for an early lead, force wolves to press up, and kill it off with a second. Also Arsenal set peices against relegation teams is just too good.\n\n**---**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t0t25rns15kg1.jpeg?width=1320&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9100002a294c80f44562d1004ac2b556f6ef55d3\n\n**BOL**",

Qualifiers) failing vs Barca and Arsenal. Atletico have given up 4+ in 7/12 away league games, and 3/4 away CL games. As for the 7.5 line, it's a low line that both sides cover almost always. Atletico also seem to be focusing on Copa del Rey, which doesn't mean that they won't try to win here but they've been underperforming in other competitions including CL.",

      "text": "Last 5 POTD : ✅️✅️✅️✅️✅️\n\n**Previous pick**: Switzerland vs Italy under 6.5 goals (+100) (Went exactly like expected, Switzerland put up a lot of shots but their firepower is not the same as Sweden or Finland to blowout the Italians!)\n\n**POTD Record**: 28-21\n\n**Today's Pick:** Finland vs Switzerland 12:10 pm EST (Olympics/Men's Hockey)\n\nFinland Puck line -1.5 (+125)\n\nStill perfect in these Olympics! These odds seems pretty high for a Finland win by 2. Like I said in the previous POTD, Finland has a **full NHL line-up** while Switzerland only have 9 NHL players and the rest of the team plays in the Swiss league. Combine this with the fact that Switzerland played today while Finland coaching team was watching them and finding ways to exploit their weaknesses it feels like an obvious win for Finland tomorrow. \n\nSwiss goalie Leonardo Genoni will be in net for sure and he's 38 years old. I know he didn't stop too many shots today vs Italy but tomorrow vs Finland it will be way different. There's a big difference between an NHL shot and an Italian player shot and I don't think the old goalie on a back-to-back will be ready to stop this Finland offense that destroyed Italy 11-0 and Sweden 4-1. Meanwhile Finland will have Juuse Saros in net a proven number #1 goalie in the NHL that has played better and better each game and now hasn't allowed a goal in the last 95 minutes he was on the ice.\n\nFor me it goes to 2 scenarios that could happen. First one is Finland destroys a less skilled team that played the day before and just can't keep up with them. Second one is Switzerland keeps it close but Finland the much better team and greater NHL experience manages to take the lead and then Switzerland pulls out their goalie and Finland ends it in an empty net. I just don't see Switzerland taking the lead tomorrow in any way except maybe in the first period when it's 0-0. Finland is on a 2 win streak where they dominated their opponents so they come with full confidence which will be important in a win or go home situation. They also have big expectations in Finland with the country winning the gold in 2022's Olympics so a quarterfinals loss would be nothing but a big dissapointment for them. (I know it's not the same roster from 2022 but still this roster is definitely confident enough that they can aim for a medal)\n\nBOL!\n\nIf I made you some money during these Olympics and you'd like to tip!\n\n[Buymeacoffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/lordestros)",

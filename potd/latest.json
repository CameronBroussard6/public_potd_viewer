Let’s keep stacking wins.\n\nToday’s Pick: Pittsburgh Steelers -3 (-119) 1 Unit\n\n12/27/2025 10:00am PST / NFL / Pittsburgh Steelers @ Cleveland Browns\n\nNarrative: The Steelers should be favored more here, but aren’t because of the weather forecast. Heavy rain and strong winds call for an unpredictable game… A lot of running… And missed field goals… But what is predictable is who has motivation to win as the NFL regular season wraps up. PIT motivated to win for a chance at home field advantage in the playoffs. CLE motivated to lose for a chance at the worst record in the league and a shot at the #1 draft pick. Sure, Browns defensive star Myles Garrett is chasing a sack record. Sure, Pittsburgh receivers Metcalf and Austin are out—but with the weather, they won’t be passing anyway. No need to overthink this one. GG!",

      "text": "Record: 0-0 (0 Units)\n\nGame: Philadelphia Eagles at Buffalo Bills (NFL | 4:25 PM EST)\n\nPick: Philadelphia Eagles ML (+100 | 1 unit)\n\nLong time lurker, first time commenter. Eagles ML bettors are in excellent position to take advantage of this line to pull out a relatively stress free win. \n\nFirst and foremost, the Eagles are extremely healthy right now, and will see both Jalen Carter and Lane Johnson return to the field tomorrow. Meanwhile, the Bills are struggling with injuries on the defensive side of the ball, mainly in their secondary, and are also missing two defensive tackles in Daquan Jones and Jordan Phillips. \n\nWhile the Eagles offense hasn’t been great this year, Kevin Patullo has finally started to incorporate some complexity into his game-plan over the last 3 weeks. The Eagles had led the league in curl routes and overall predictability until they played the Chargers. Since then, the Eagles have averaged around 400 yards of offense a game and have been much more fluid/consistent in general. This unit is up against a Bills defense that is not only banged up, but has let up 30+ points in 2 out of their last 3 games, and let up 20 points in that third game to a terrible Browns offense.\n\nThe real mismatch here is the Eagles defense vs the Bills offense. Cooper Dejean and Quinyon Mitchell have both been playing at a pro bowl level this year and are arguably the best cornerback duo in the league. The Bills simply dont have the firepower they need on the outside to stress this secondary out at all. Also, both Bills TEs Dawson Knox and Daulton Kincaid are still questionable to play in this game. James Cook and Josh Allen are obviously positive offensive factors for the Bills here, but this Eagles defensive unit led by Vic Fangio has faced and conquered tougher challenges than the Bills offense this year.\n\nLastly, the Bills have had one of the easiest schedules in the league so far, racking up wins against teams like the Jets, Dolphins, Browns, Saints, and Bengals. They also lost to the Dolphins and the Falcons in embarrassing fashion. The Eagles on the other hand have had one of the toughest schedules in the league, and despite their early struggles on offense, still managed to beat the Rams, Bucs, Packers, and Lions while keeping games against the Broncos and the Bears close.\n\nBoth teams are playing to win, the Eagles can still snag the second seed if they win out while the Bills are fighting for their division. This line is likely leaning toward the Bills for two reasons, they are at home, and because of Josh Allen’s ability to take over a game. \n\nObviously, anything can happen on any given Sunday, but don’t be surprised if the Eagles win convincingly tomorrow. If their offense continues to gain momentum they will be an incredibly difficult team to beat.\n\nTLDR; The Eagles defense is elite, their offense is gaining momentum, and they are very healthy. The Bills on the other hand have been having somewhat of a down year, dropping games they should have won, and are dealing with a plethora of injuries on both sides of the ball. Despite similar records between these two teams, the Eagles have faced much tougher competition.\n\nBOL",

This is a *gut play*, but I like trendy math. CMC has been **over this line in 4/5 games, with 20+ carries in his last 4 games**. Depending on how you feel about “spotlight guys”, he’s **easily covered this line in his last 3 prime time games**.\n\nI honestly don’t see a *roadblock* as much as a *speed-bump* this game - if Chicago do find a way to clog the middle, he may go back to being more involved in the passing game. His targets are “down” than they have been to start the season, but they have still been above average for a workhorse running back. **He’s has 105 touches the last 4 weeks**, so fatigue for a guy with injury history could be a factor as players try to ease into the playoffs - but I don’t see that here. Too much to play for.\n\nPlus - Chicago have been a **bottom 10 rush D all season**, and have also found themselves caught up in shootouts - that could leave those CMC trademark 10-15 yard runs to become more available to counter the deeper pass options. This game is the **highest total of the weekend**, so I expect alot of drives for us to cover this.\n\n**Last play review:**\n\n*NCAAF - Drew Mestemaker o280.5 PassY (-110) 1u* ❌\n\n(What, a, frustrating loss that was… 20 incompletions, 2 drive killing interceptions, the run game went for 368 yards on 48 carries… the game has ALL the ingredients to cover, but the details to fail. Hopefully Drew cleans up his loose ends if he’s gonna make a move to a bigger school, but a fantastic season by him and North Texas)\n\n***BOL if you’re tailing, and if not BOL in general.***",

He clearly still knows how to read a field and make the throws he needs to.\n\nThe Jags run almost exclusively zone defense, and most decent QBs have had minimal trouble throwing for good yardage against them: Nix - 377, Brissett - 317, and Geno Smith - 284 to name a few.\n\nThe Jags defense has been better during the last month, but I believe that Rivers is the exact kind of QB that can exploit the soft spots in the zone. I believe Rivers can easily pass this relatively low line.\n\nI will also be in Indy for the game for an additional vibes bonus.",

      "text": "Record: 3-4\n\nLast Pick: Aston Villa Double Chance  @ 1.99 odds (3u) ✅ \n\nSport: Basketball | PBA Philippine Cup\n\nEvent: Converge FiberXers vs. Barangay Ginebra San Miguel | 6:30 AM EST\n\nPOTD: Barangay Ginebra San Miguel -2.5 vs. Converge FiberXers @ 1.84 odds (3u)\n\nWrite Up:\n\nI’m taking Ginebra here because their system is the perfect counter to how Converge wants to play. If you watch how these two teams play, Ginebra is just a nightmare for Converge.\n\nConverge relies heavily on a \"run-and-gun,\" high-pace offense where they try to overwhelm you with speed and volume three-point shooting. The problem is, Ginebra is arguably the most disciplined half-court team in the league. They dictate the tempo better than anyone. They don't let you run; they force you to play their game, which is slower, physical, and executed through efficient set plays.\n\nDefensively, Ginebra has the length on the perimeter to bother Converge’s shooters, and they have the size advantage in the paint to control the boards. When the game slows down in the 4th quarter, Ginebra’s veteran composure usually takes over against a younger Converge squad that tends to panic when their shots aren't falling.\n\nYou also can't ignore the intangible factor of the \"Never Say Die\" crowd. It’s a Sunday game, and the Ginebra fanbase acts like a massive 6th man, especially when they have momentum. Between the crowd energy and Ginebra’s veteran composure in the 4th quarter, I trust Ginebra to control the pace, punish them inside, and cover this spread much more than a young Converge team trying to bounce back.\n\n\nBOL!",

They’ve won 3 straight games and have looked better on offense and defense each week. They are no longer tanking for next years draft picks as they are starting to see a lot of promise in their rookie QB Tyler Shough and the rest of the team. His connection with top WR Chris Olave is only growing each week. They go up against a lowly Titans team who have lost 8 of their last 10. Those two wins were against a Patrick Mahomes-less Chiefs, and the Browns. They are without their top WR option in Calvin Ridley and safety Xavier Woods.\n\nThis is simply a pick of taking the better team who want to prove themselves against a worse team who are still in the running for the #1 pick in the draft. \n\nRemember to only bet what you can afford to lose, and BOL!",

Benfica arrive far more compact and controlled than earlier in the season, showing a consistent ability to neutralise possession-heavy opponents — particularly relevant against a Braga side that leads the league in ball retention but often struggles to convert dominance into control against top opposition. Injury-wise, Benfica travel in a healthier state than in previous months, while Braga have been carefully managing key players with heavy minutes, a concern their coach has publicly acknowledged by stressing the need for “balance” over intensity. From a tactical standpoint, Mourinho has reinforced defensive spacing and transition coverage, allowing Benfica to absorb pressure without losing structure, which naturally reduces defeat risk away from home. Braga’s own coach has admitted that his team must reach an exceptional level to overcome Benfica, underlining the fine margins expected. With Benfica approaching this fixture as a must-not-lose match in the title race, their maturity, organisation and physical condition make avoiding defeat a logical and well-supported outcome rather than a speculative one.",

Bologna have developed into a consistent attacking side, regularly scoring while still allowing chances due to their high-tempo, forward-leaning approach. Sassuolo continue to profile as one of the league’s more reliable BTTS contributors, combining attacking intent with a defence that concedes frequently against teams willing to press and transition quickly. From a data perspective, both sides rank well for shots in the box, xG created, and goals conceded per match, creating a game state that naturally supports goals at both ends. Recent meetings and overall match profiles point toward open phases of play rather than sustained control from either side.",

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 6-15-3 *Well, that fun sure was shortlived as I go back to default settings it seems. In a game of fine margins, it was Benin that came out on top, killing our hopes of a crazy winning run before they even really started. We go again though, and I'll try my best not to notch up 7 losses in a row this time around*\n\n**Last Five:** ❌❌❌✅❌\n\n**Event:** AFCON, Gabon v Mozambique, 7:30 am EST\n\n**POTD:** Mozambique Win or Draw + Under 3.5 goals +124, 3 units\n\n**Write Up:** Gabon might be the favourites on paper, but I feel like the teams are way more evenly matched than the odds suggest and there’s a bunch of reasons for backing Mozambique to get something out of this crucial Group F encounter. Both teams began their AFCON campaigns with narrow 1-0 defeats, with Gabon losing to Cameroon and Mozambique falling to the Ivory Coast.\n\nHistorically, *Gabon do admittedly hold a slight H2H edge, having won more of the previous seven meetings.* However, the numbers aren’t overwhelmingly lopsided and include **two wins for Mozambique and a draw**. That balance alone suggests this matchup isn’t as one-sided as the odds imply and I'm here to take full advantage of that.\n\nMozambique’s tactical setup and squad have strengths that make a win or draw plausible. Players like **Geny Catamo** and **Stanley Ratifo** provide real attacking threat, and the Mambas are likely to adopt a **compact, counter-attacking approach** that's meant to sustain any pressure Gabon might throw at them and even more, suffocate their build-up play before the danger can even occur. In their opening game, Mozambique showed discipline and resilience, completing a high number of passes on both halves of the field and limiting clear chances against the heavyweights in Ivory Coast. There are also question marks over **Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang** and **Mario Lemina's** starts - expect the odds to be tipped even more in Mozambique's favor **if they don't start.**\n\nGabon, while traditionally considered to be the stronger of the two, **struggled to convert their possession and 12 shots** against Cameroon into goals, highlighting an **ongoing finishing issue.** With **Gabon’s recent inconsistency** and Mozambique needing points urgently, I can absolutely sense a tight game with Mozambique holding firm for a draw or even grabbing the win from a counter or Gabon's defensive mishap. The Mambas’ resilience and tactical discipline could easily see them avoid defeat in a potential competitive, low-scoring affair, hence **adding a cheeky Under 3.5 goals** leg to sweeten the odds some more. If you want to lower the match goals to Under 2.5 or take the BTTS Yes instead, I don't mind that either, but ultimately, the pick I feel the most confident in is the one I went with. Feeling pretty good about this one after about an hour and a half's worth of research that primarily went into the underlying data, historical context and tactical configuration, so I'm stacking 3 units on this promising play. I feel like a win here could potentially mark a crucial turning point in my fortunes. BOL and let's have us some more unforgettable AFCON fun y'all ☘️",

The Buffalo defense is one of the worst defenses in the league against the run and Saquon has scored TDs in his last 3 games and has been averaging 4, 6, 3.5, and 6 YPC in his last 4 games. \n\nThe Eagles still have a chance at the 2 seed if they win out, so this is a game that matters for them. I wouldn’t be surprised to see a long run here from Saquon.\n\nFor the Bills, ignoring last week when Judkins got hurt, Trayveon had 148 and 2 TDs, Chase Brown had 2 TDs, and Jaylen Warren had a TD in their last 3 games.\n\nGood Luck",

Desperation leads to high lines and counterattacks that print offsides. Whatever the scoreline, as the clock winds down, either both teams will feel time slipping away — or one will be truly desperate.\n\nTottenham and Thomas Frank have been under heavy scrutiny lately, and rightly so. Performances have been below par, with just one win in their last seven games.\n\nMeanwhile, Palace — who looked so promising earlier in the season — are beginning to realize that the squad depth they thought they had doesn’t really exist.\n\n**---**\n\n**Offside stats: Last 7 Prem games**\n\n**Tottenham: Average - 5.0 per game**\n\n**7, 5, 3, 4, 7, 4, 5 - Hit 6/7** \n\n**Crystal Palace: Average - 4.14 per game**\n\n**5, 5, 5, 3, 3, 5, 3 - Hit 4/7**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/il5rlkue7u9g1.jpeg?width=1259&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b94a9af18459b66da67097f92274d08446c7f565\n\n**BOL**",

He had quite a few chances and it's disappointing he didnt convert for us either way. Confused and maybe a touch frustrated, we move on. Sorry friends, we've gone cold. \n\nToday we have a match between two teams promoted this season, both of which have been pleasant surprises, as 7th place Sunderland host 16th place Leeds. Sunderland have picked up many of their points by playing a stingy defense and have actually conceded the 2nd fewest goals this season (tied with Man City). They are also incredibly tough at home, having gone unbeaten thus far with a record of 5-3-0. Theyve conceded 7 goals in these 8 home games as well. Despite all of this, I'm backing a Leeds player to net against them. Here's why:\n\nCalvert-Lewin, the ex-Everton striker, has been in the form of his life. He has scored in 5 consecutive match, scoring 6 goals in theses 5 games. What makes this extra impressive is that only one of these goals was a penalty kick. He also hasn't been scoring against bottom tier competition, he has scored against three of the top 5 teams in the EPL (Liverpool, City, Chelsea), and against three of the top 5 defenses in Palace (2 goals), Chelsea, and away at Man City. \n\nI've been backing Calvert-Lewin over in the soccer thread for the past 3 weeks while he has been on this tear. Our guy is finding the back of the net through any means necessary and I like him here again at good plus money, against a tough defense. I've been cold so tail with caution, BOL to everyone and have a great Sunday.",

Sunderland have a solid home record and also seem to score and concede a lot. \n\nSunderland average total goals at home 2.75.\nLeeds average total goals away 3.25.\n\nExpect a 2-1 win to Sunderland but I’m happy to take the push if it ends 1-1 or 2-0 because we get good odds on this anyway.\n\nBol!

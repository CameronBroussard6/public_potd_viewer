Pisa are still struggling to find consistency, while Como arrive full of confidence with a clear game plan. Como head into the game after two straight wins without conceding and are pushing for a top-four spot and European football. Pisa, on the other hand, have managed just one win all season and are already facing a tough battle to stay in the league.\n\nPisa have drawn three of their last five games, including 1–1 away at Genoa and 2–2 at Cagliari. These results show they can stay competitive, but often struggle to see games through. They’ve scored just 13 goals in 18 league matches, which explains why tight games usually don’t go their way. At home, losses to Juventus and Parma without scoring highlight their attacking problems.\n\nPisa have failed to score in three of their last five matches and conceded first in four of them. Even when they’re well organised, goals are hard to come by. Nine draws from 18 games show resilience, but also a lack of cutting edge. Against a more clinical and in-form Como side, that pattern could prove costly.\n\nComo’s recent form has been well balanced. They’ve won three of their last five matches, including clean-sheet victories over Udinese and Sassuolo. Even their losses to Roma and Inter Milan were more about facing top opposition than any drop in performance.\n\nDefensively, Como have been one of the standout teams in the league, conceding just 12 goals in 17 matches. That strength carries over away from home, highlighted by a convincing 3–0 win at Lecce where they stayed in control and took their chances. They’ll also take confidence from past meetings, having beaten Pisa 3–1 in March 2024 and remaining unbeaten in the last five head-to-heads. Overall, Como look more settled and reliable at both ends of the pitch.\n\nPisa struggle to score and often fall behind early, which makes this a very tough game for them. Como are organised, confident, and strong at the back, giving them a clear advantage. Based on the form and stats, Como should be comfortable winners here.\n\n**NOTE: Please only stake what you can afford to lose; know that no picks are 100% guaranteed to hit. Stake Responsibly.**",

Big chances for Egypt with a banger goal to go up 1-0. Sadly Benin had a reflection that gave them the tie to get ET. POTD isn't going great but it can only go up from here. Right?\n\n**Write Up:**\n\nRangers are coming off of an amazing away win vs Celtic. The last 3 times they've won away at Celtic a win followed in the next fixture\n\nAberdeen are out of form away from home. Winning 4 and losing 6 games with no draws. Scoring 7 goals in those 10 games combined. This includes a 3-1 loss away at Celtic recently who just lost to Rangers\n\nIt doesn't bode well for Aberdeen this game with Rangers being the in form team having won 4 out of L5 games except against surprising league leaders Hearts. They also boast an impressive 5-4-1 home record. They rarely lose at home with the only loss being against Hearts earlier in the season\n\nRangers have also had the upper hand in this fixture in recent years. L10 went 7-2-1 in favor of Rangers\n\nThe 23rd of December Sporting CP beat Vitoria 1-4 away from home. I don't think things have changed enough for Vitoria to get their hopes up\n\nVitoria in the league have played 8 games away from home, only scoring 4 in the process\n\nSporting have scored 27 goals in 8 home games whilst only conceding 3\n\nIt might be a cup game but those numbers are very telling of the way this game will probably go\n\nThe H2H earlier including home+away form is enough for me\n\nBOL everyone!",

Regarding the first leg, both teams are of similar skill level, though the bookies are giving a slight edge to the Mongolian side. The ML feels risky, but i expect the series to atleast go to 4 maps or even 5, since neither team is at a level to blank the other. For the 2nd leg, DDP is in the form of his life,   has crossed this run mark in the past 4/5 matches + he needs to keep this performance to get selected to the national side. Will likely cross this, unless the pitch is utter crap or he has a stinker of a game.\n\nHope we slowly string up wins & BoL\n\nNote : The odds & stakes are as on betwinner, 1xbet, etc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u2c2hbwpvmbg1.png?width=747&format=png&auto=webp&s=4243e9b0be82f833f7b25e3a072509645bbeb882",

He’s had a good year so far (.910 save percentage and 2.55 GAA). The Islanders are underdogs at home, despite being 13-8-2 this year and they get their star goaltender back.\n\nThe Devils will be starting Markstrom most likely. He has been good over the last month, but this is still a matchup that favors the Islanders. Markstrom started against the Islanders on 12/23 and only allowed 2 goals on 25 shots. \n\nBut the issue with the Devils is scoring goals. They are near the bottom of the league in goals scored per game and are going up against one of the best goalies in the league, and the Islanders are + money.\n\nGood Luck!",

In that match in Paris I backed Dimitrov against Mpetshi Perricard and it was an easy win. However, he withdrew from the second round. It's been more than couple months since them and I guess he is match fit. He should especially be match fit in his first match of the tournament/season, and I'm much more inclined to back him in R1 than later.\n\n\n\nCarreno Busta played two Q rounds here, managing to win Bellucci in 3rd set tie breaker and then Cazaux retired in first set. Should be better prepared for conditions here, but quality difference at this age is bigger than ever and surface advantage should be huge. Odds are going down on Dimitrov, but since I expect him to cruise here I like this line. Dimotrov has a SF and a title here last couple of years.",

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 7-23-3 *Can you believe it, the curse is lifted at last and once again, it's the AFCON that does it for us! Some luck finally came my way as Egypt scored first, but they were quickly stunned. The BTTS pick that I suggested also came through for us. What a day, but now's the time to build on this, and two hours later I've identified just the right match to get us over the line. Onwards and upwards, there's still a very long way to go if I want to properly recover the good old bankroll*\n\n**Last Five:** ❌❌❌❌✅\n\n**Event:** Serie A, Pisa v Como, 9:00 am EST\n\n**POTD:** Pisa Win or Draw +100, 1 unit\n\n**Write Up:** We're backing the underdog again in the always unpredictable Serie A *(or rather, the only predictable thing about it is that the matches are going to be dry as hell).* On paper, Como’s league position and recent form make them look stronger, but there are some reasons as to why I think Pisa are getting something out of today's game. Hear me out.\n\nFirstly, Pisa are very tricky to play against, constantly suffocating the opposing forwards and **grinding out draws at home,** thanks to their physical and well organised defence. The narrative that Pisa are easily beaten ignores how hard they’ve made games tough at their ground. Despite flirting with relegation, they've proven they can absolutely grind out results as they've just earned an impressive 1-1 draw away at Genoa, and **five of their last six away trips have ended in draws or narrow results.** Their ability to keep matches tight makes them a strong pick against a Como team that isn’t unbeatable. Frankly, I find this team overrated, the media and people genuinely seem to have inflated their value because of the vibes (Fabregas is the manager, they've signed well known semi washed players as well as a wonderkid in Nico Paz, the location is rich and aesthetic etc.) and the \"small club making it in the top flight\" narrative, even though they've spent crazy amounts of money for their size just to languish in upper midtable and be questionable in a match against Pisa, with all due respect to Pisa (I want them to do well as I'm backing them).\n\nYes, Pisa have struggled for goals *(only one scored in nine home league games),* but they’ve often frustrated opponents and forced teams to slow down the tempo. Against a Como side that has been more vulnerable on the road and **missing some key players** (more on that later), Pisa’s organised defence is there to limit chances and raise the likelihood of a draw or narrow win for the hosts. They generally concede fewer high-quality chances than raw tables suggest.\n\nNext up is the H2H that includes several draws and tight contests. Pisa aren't a side that would collapse against Como out of all the teams; past meetings have often been close. In the past **3 years, Como have only registered one league win against Pisa,** while two matches ended in a draw.\n\nWhat also gives Pisa hope ahead of this clash is that Como's key man, **Nico Paz is just returning from injury and therefore won't be at 100%,** some minute management is also likely. The pacey **Assane Diao is also out,** as is Alvaro Morata, while Jayden Addai remains questionable. The Douvikas-Paz partnership has been fairly fruitful for Como this season and with the latter not being at full strength, Pisa's defence shouldn't be tested quite as much.\n\nAll in all, I think Como have just been punching over their weight class this season and they're bound to drop points against a resilient side in Pisa, who will be looking to escape the relegation scrap in front of their diehard fans. The odds of +100 that cover a win and a draw are just too good to ignore here. I also like the BTTS No and the Under 2.5 Goals narrative if you're up to some experimentation, *but I've just focused on match results after the Mozambique debacle*. Going with just a unit once again as I'm saving my bankroll for a huge play on Wednesday. BOL and let's get a streak going ☘️🫡",

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 19-18-5 (Avg Odds +129)\n\n**Previous Pick:** Jordan James 1+ SOT (+125) ❌️\n\n**Today's Event:** English Premier League (Soccer) | West Ham vs Nottingham Forest (12:00 PM PST)\n\n**Pick:** Neco Williams 1+ SOT (+240) 1 unit to win 2.4 units\n\n**Write Up:** Tough loss yesterday as James took 3 shots, two of which were very close to finding the target. He also logged an assist instead of shooting inside the box, which was not ideal for us. Still like the read and would play it again, just unfortunate luck this go around. We move on.\n\nA proper relegation battle here as 18th place West Ham host 17th place Forest. Neither of these teams are good, but both desperately need a win here. Forest are 4 points ahead of West Ham in the League, a win for them brings them 7 points clear of the danger zone. Conversely for West Ham, a win here brings them within 1 point of the safe zone. Huge implications at this point in the season, as both teams are losing to every team above them. \n\nNeco Williams is the 1st choice fullback (plays both left and right) for Forest (and Wales). Yes, I'm playing another defender in a shot prop. This is another combination of current form and data. Neco has been in great form, landing a SOT in 4 of his last 5 matches including vs Man City who allow the 2nd fewest SOTs in the league. He's also had 6 SOTs in his last 7 matches. Coach Dyche has been encouraging him to play further forward and take shots, and I expect that trend to continue here. \n\nWest Ham conversely are the worst defensive team in the league. They have conceded the most SOTs in the EPL this season with 105, 2nd most shots in league with 300 (avg 15 per game), and the most goals with 40. They also look like a team defeated, giving last place Wolves their first win of the season over the weekend 3-0. In that match, they let in 9 SOTs. Interestingly, the entire back 3 for Wolves each got an SOT in that match. Backtracking one more game where West Ham hosted Brighton (who play a similar shape to Forest), West Ham conceded a SOT to each of the two Brighton wingers, including a goal. The point here is that West Ham are weak against fullbacks, that combined with Neco's current form and playing further forward in a wingback-type role put this pick on my radar. \n\n**The odds are high on this for a reason, so mind your units here.** There's always risk in these plays as the odds climb, but we've hit a +245 play before here when Woltemade cashed us with 2 SOTs, so they can hit and I love the value this one brings. \n\nBOL and happy Tuesday!",

      "text": "Record: 170-138, +8.33 units\n\nLast Pick: Wu to win first set vs Marozsan (+110, 1 unit) ✅\n\nTennis | ATP Hong Kong | 5:00 AM EST (estimated)\n\nToday's Pick: Jan-Lennard Struff vs Botic van de Zandschulp | **Struff to win 2-0 at +175. 1 unit.**\n\nWrite-up: Jan-Lennard Struff comes into this first-round Hong Kong match in a strong position. He already won two qualifying matches against Zsombor Piros and Nishesh Basavareddy, which means that he should be more accustomed to these conditions than Botic. It was hard to find a streakier player than the German in 2025, but his highs, which included US Open wins over Holger Rune and Frances Tiafoe, were certainly high. One pattern, however, is that the faster the courts are, the better Struff's aggressive shot selection and willingness to come to net work out for him. From what I watched of yesterday's action, these courts seemed to be extremely quick, with big hitter Cilic scoring an easy win over the crafty Mannarino and most players performing well on serve. \n\nMeanwhile, I'm a bit less certain that Botic can take advantage of the conditions. Unlike Struff, he ended last year on a downswing, and it's been a while since I've felt as if he was fully committed to a tournament. I don't doubt that Botic has the tools to be performing better, and the new year can always inspire fresh motivation, but I don't think this is the tournament where he turns things around. In general, his heavy forehand is most effective on slower hard courts, and Indian Wells/Miami in March has historically been when he finds his stride. With that in mind, it's hard to ignore Struff's preparation advantage and strong qualifying performance to back someone who ended last year on very uncertain terms. \n\nKeep in mind that I like Struff's ML as well if you can get it at -150 or better. This is my personal play simply because the odds are more favorable, and I think there's a good chance that Struff can take control early and roll from there. There's not really an inherent level gap between these players, so I wouldn't feel confident in Struff coming back or outlasting in a third set if Botic does come in strong.",

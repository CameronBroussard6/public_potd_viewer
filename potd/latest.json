Only two teams managed to complete the day with two wins, one of which was Denmark. Denmark beat Türkiye 6-4 in the late draw and beat Czechia 10-4 in their opener. Their opponent tomorrow is Scotland, who are still looking for their first win. Denmark looked like the best team at the event during the first day, while Morrison struggled big time for Scotland. I had Denmark slightly higher in my power rankings coming into this event and recent play makes me even more confident in this pick. On the season, Denmark are 36-10 to Scotland's 18-10. Against intermediate level teams, Denmark are 5-4 to Scotland's 7-8.",

Onto the next pick.\n\nPrevious Pick: Detroit Pistons -8 @1.91, 3U. ✅  \n\nRecord: 3-0  \n\nPOTD: New England Patriots -7 @1.84, 2U  \n\nNFL: Cincinnati Bengals VS. New England Patriots.  \n\nWrite Up: Gonna change things up for today since it’s Monday Night Football. And as per usual, another day, another strange spread. From the few Bengals games I’ve actually watched, they have looked extremely volatile and lost. Joe Flacco has been really inconsistent, as demonstrated by his strong start to the season followed by a decline in quality, highlighted by his glaring performance last week against the Steelers. The only consistently good part about their offence would probably be their receivers, most notably Tee Higgins and Ja’Marr Chase, the latter sitting this game out due to a suspension for an incident with Jalen Ramsey against the Steelers. Now, time to address the elephant in the room, because the offence isn’t the worst part about the Bengals. Their defence is abysmal, ranking first in most defensive yards allowed and touchdowns allowed. And if things couldn’t get any worse, a portion of their defensive line is not playing this match due to injuries, somehow managing to dig a deeper hole for themselves (if it wasn’t deep enough already). On the other hand, the Patriots have been excellent this season, led by MVP candidate QB Drake ‘Drake Maye’ Maye and very solid offensive units like Stefon Diggs, Hunter Henry, and DeMario Douglas. They rank top 10 in both total yards made and passing yards made. Alongside their great offence, their defence has been nothing short of amazing, placing 7th in least amount of yards allowed. Not to mention, They have a perfect record on the road, going 5-0 in all their away games (Dolphins, Bills, Saints, Titans, Bucs). I expect them to exploit both the Bengals’ limited offence and garbage defence. Therefore, I’m taking the Patriots covering the 7 point margin.",

This week they face the Tennessee Titans who are one of the worst teams in the league. Seatle has one of the most efficient offenses in the league, especially early in the game.\n\n\nSeahawks lead the NFL with an average of 8.0/points in the 1Q. Ahead of the Colts (7.0), Rams (6.9), and Lions (6.6). They've averaged 10.3 points in the 1Q in the last 3 games. For the non NFL fans, this means they usually get in two scoring drives in the first quarter.\n\n\nJSN has hit this line in 7/10 games this season (they've played 10 games). He's hit in the last 4/5, with the miss being against the Texans, who are one of, if not the best defense in the NFL. JSN is tied 2nd in the league with most catches in the 1Q with 19 in those 10 games.\n\n\nTitans do have a poor run defense, but they are middle of the pack against the pass (18/32 teams), so I still suspect the Seahawks to be throwing it early as usual to get the offense going\n\n\nPartially a degen wager as it's limited to the 1st Q, but what are we here for.\n\n\nFirst time poster, long time lurker. Best of luck!",

Seattle is favored by 12 and against weaker teams have gone up big and early on the backs of their stellar defense and JSN. This leads to a lot of rushes that are split between KWIII/Charbonnet. 2 weeks ago against arizona the duo had 14 carries each for a total of 28 carries and 150 yards. against Houston 29/115, TB 19/121, AZ 31/120, Pitts 28/120, etc. Issue is its hard to predict who between them will go off in any given week.\n\nRather than pick one, taking the chance of a bad day/minor injury/huge run by other - this pick picks both. We're basically asking them to clear 100 yards total against one of the worst run defenses in the league with very favorable game script.\n\nI was debating between this bet and Gibbs/Montgomery combined rush yards against the Giants - which is quite similar in many aspects. decided on this for the POTD since odds are much better (Gibbs/Montgomery is -170 for combined 125+ yards) and I think taking Gibbs' individual props are better in that situation.\n\nso Kenneth Walker III + Zach Charbonnet 100+ combined rushing yards (-130) on DK.

These two teams do not like each other to say the least and their stadiums are 25 minutes apart. Arsenal is the heavy favorite here as they play tough at home, but I'm staying away from ML as my main pick (as usual). This matchup is always unpredictable and fun to watch, we could see a 4-4 slugfest or a 1-0 defensive battle. \n\nI have to be honest, I really don't like rooting for Arsenal. Most of their players have big egos, flop frequently, and complain with flailing arms when things don't go their way (sorry Arsenal fans). But Declan Rice does not fit that mold - as he's a great guy on and off the pitch. I like this play because Rice has really been in shooting form recently. He has had 1+ SOT in his last 3 EPL matches and 4 of his last 5. He also found himself in the box a ton for England during the break, with 3 potential SOTs (two called back for borderline offsides). He again fits my mold of hard working midfielders that I love to back. He takes free kicks more often than not (and scores from them!) and has been playing much further forward in the box attacking over the last 5 matches. Keep in mind he does take corners from the left side, so not a lot of corner shot attempts from him. \n\nI like Rice here to maintain his shooting form and land a shot on target here. BOL if tailing and have a great Sunday!",

Brentford with a disgraceful performance after scoring the opener through Igor’s penalty and were leading the corners 3-1 at that point. After that though they parked the bus. I will never understand why teams do that so early as it almost always leads to them losing their advantage with 60 minutes of pressure piled on. That pressure from Brighton paid off with Minteh especially wreaking havoc, getting an incredible assist for Welbeck before Hinshelwood sealed the deal not long after. The Seagulls had 80% 2H possession at that point (which is insane) and ended on 7 corners to the Bees 4. Igor missed a last minute penalty and Brighton got a very deserved win against a disorganised team.\n\nGoing to keep this short and sweet, Viking are neck-and-neck with Bodø/Glimt and a win today would take them top with a game remaining. Fredrikstad are a steady sixth, which is where they also finished last year. Viking has averaged 4.6 corners conceded over their last 20 away matches while Fredrikstad has won an average of 5 at home over the same time period. Using all the stats I have and including recent corner form I get an expected 4.9 corners for the home team. That gives me a 71% chance of the play winning. This same fixture produced 7 corners for them last season (and the reverse fixture saw 6 this year). Fredrikstad have covered the line in 15/20 and Viking’s opponents in 13/20 at home. Looking at opponent-specified data shows me 13/16 times the line covered when Viking faced top 10 opposition and 11/15 for their opponents so both are in line with my estimation. BOL !\n\nI’m raising money for Movember, ALL proceeds will be going to a good cause. Donations aren’t expected but very much appreciated so if you have profited from my picks please do consider donating, a little goes a long way.

I am not sure many people followed it but it was a winner! \n\nSticking with the rugby theme for Sunday. \n\nScotland playing Tonga at home to finish the internationals. The line is actually set at -38.5 which I think can easily be covered but is also quite high. Therefore I am going for the alternative spread of -29.5\n\nThis game should be a walk in the park for Scotland and they will be looking to correct their failure last time out against Argentina where they blew a 21-0 lead. Despite playing a low ranking  opponent they have named a very strong side and can see them easily scoring 50+ points. However, these games can flow weirdly when it is 1-sided, hence me going for the alternate handicap.\n\nPart 2 is England to win ML. Again the spread is tempting at -9.5 but Argentina are a good side and I expect it to be close , even tho it should cover. Probs gonna take a piece of the spread at lower units. \n\nEngland have won 10 in a row and are in their best form for years - beating New Zealand last week. They will be looking to round off the perfect autumn series with another win against Argentina. \n\nArgentina on the other hand showed their frailty going 21-0 down to Scotland last week , and against a stronger more consistent side in England - it is hard to see this not ending with a home win.\n\nI was shocked when I saw the odds for this was -122 hence the 3unit stake. \n\n(I hope this write up format is ok and happy to take any tips for useful info to include going forward!) \n\nLet me know if you join me ! 😁",

Betting these away favorites has worked well for us so far. Got another one locked and loaded..\n\n \n\nNext Pick: **Los Angeles Lakers -8.5 vs Utah Jazz @ 1.91**. 3U play.\n\nThis Lakers team has been a really fun watch all season, led by a combination of Luka, Reaves and Domin-Ayton. Now Lebron is in the mix, and this team looks like an absolute powerhouse on offense and above average on defense. They play the tanking Jazz who are prone to getting blownout, including losing to the Lakers 4 days back by 14 pts. The Jazz can be a fun team with different guys popping off, and Lauri is still quality, but the gulf between these teams is too much. I’d play it to -10.\n\n \n\n*If you’ve enjoyed these picks, tips are always appreciated:* [Coffee Link](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/TheBrat)",

I wouldn't let last week fool you. The Jaguars have been a bottom-5 unit against the pass this season, allowing an average of 237 passing yards per game, 253 per game if you remove last week's outlier. They are also going to be without Travon Walker this week, which will *severely* inhibit their ability to get pressure on the QB.\n\nJacoby Brissett has been **slinging** the ball in his starts this season, averaging 28 completions and 314 passing yards per game. He has thrown for *at least* 258 yards in every start this year, including his monster 452-yard performance last week. The Cardinals running attack has been poor most of this season due to injury, and this plays right into the Jaguars' top-5 running defense.\n\nThe Jags, of course, have also been famous for getting killed by backup QBs over the last few years (Jacoby may not *reallllly* be a backup, but he is technically). Jake Browning and Davis Mills had field days this season, and Brissett is the exact archetype of player that just shreds their pass defense.\n\nI really like this line and expect him to clear it, and it will not surprise me if the line continues to jump up by the time you read this post.",

Nico had 3 catches on 3 targets for 55 yards in the first half, then absolutely no looks in the second. One more catch (for his game average) would have been right at the 74 yard number. I should have known better to make my first pick on a Thursday night game, but I'm not gonna let it keep me down.\n\nEvent: Patriots @ Bengals 1:00 PM\n\nPOTD: **Hunter Henry over 39.5 yards receiving (-110) (2U)**\n\nHunter Henry is set to have a decent game because the Bengals are **literally the worst team in the league at defending tight ends**, giving up over 4 catches and almost 60 yards a game to TEs. Their linebackers and safeties keep losing underneath and over the middle, which is exactly where Henry eats. He’s efficient with the targets he does get, so it doesn't take much volume for him to put up solid yardage.\n\n(And as a bonus, he’s got a real shot to find the end zone too. He and Diggs basically split red-zone work evenly, and Cincinnati has been getting cooked by tight ends near the goal line all year. They have given up the most TDs to TEs as well. Henry ATTD is also a solid play at +180.)\n\nBOL",

This season Pickens has cleared this yardage in 8/10 games and has hit this mark in his last 5. \n\nAt this point in the season Pickens has been a major contributor in the passing game and has become the greatest WR2 in the NFL. Pickens averages an impressive 8.3 targets average in games this year and ranks 7th in the league in yards average per catch (15.7).\n\nI believe Pickens will continue to have many opportunities to be involved in this high-powered and well orchestrated offense at home this week. The Cowboys have been very dominant in Jerry's world and average 282 yards per game through the air.\n\nEvery game moving forward will be a must win for Dallas.

      "text": "POTD Record: 20-7 (+14.3U)\n\nLast Pick: Standard 6.5 two team teaser (Oklahoma +1/ Under 49) (NCAAFB) (-120) (1U) ✅\n\n[Teaser write up](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/s/biOCloDgv3)\n\nThat game went exactly how we said it would, Oklahoma shut down Missouri’s entire run game and offense, they themselves struggled a bit offensively for stretches but they did enough to win the game like we thought and the total didn’t even come close to 49, thank y’all for the support once again it’s been a very fun last 10 days on POTD!\n\nEvent: Eagles @ Cowboys (NFL) (3:25pm central)/ South Carolina vs Northwestern (NCAAB) (4pm central)\n\nPOTD: Two team parlay (Eagles ML/Northwestern ML) (+110) (1U)\n\n-everything is bet to win unit amount-\n\n(Except here we are placing 1u to win 1.1u)\n\nWrite up: \n\nEagles:\n\nFor two weeks straight, the Eagles have been bombarded with criticism about their offense—questions about stagnation, lack of explosiveness, and whether Jalen Hurts can carry this team down the stretch. But the reality is that before their bye week, this offense was firing on all cylinders. In the two games leading into the break, Philadelphia averaged over 27 points per game, Hurts completed nearly 67% of his passes, and the rushing attack was balanced and efficient with Saquon Barkley pounding out chunk gains behind one of the league’s best offensive lines. The narrative of a “broken offense” simply doesn’t hold up when you look at the numbers in context.\n\nThe recent dip in production came against two of the NFL’s most suffocating defenses in brutal weather conditions. Detroit ranks 6th in the league in yards allowed per game, while Green Bay sits right behind them at 7th. Playing outdoors in freezing temperatures against those units is a completely different challenge than what awaits in Dallas. The Cowboys’ defense, despite a spirited showing against the Raiders, ranks near the bottom of the league in both points allowed and yards surrendered. That Raiders game was more about emotion than quality—the Raiders are bottom-tier in nearly every offensive and defensive metric, and Dallas fed off the atmosphere of a desperate opponent.\n\nNow the Cowboys return home on a short week, while the Eagles come in rested, healthier, and motivated to silence the noise. Playing inside the dome at AT&T Stadium eliminates the weather factor and sets up perfectly for Philadelphia’s offense to reassert itself. The Cowboys want this game to turn into a shootout, but that’s not how it will be decided. The Eagles dominate in the trenches, and that gives them multiple outs to win—whether it’s Barkley grinding down the defense, Hurts exploiting mismatches in the passing game, or their own defensive front collapsing Dak Prescott’s pocket. This is the perfect spot for the Eagles to prove the critics wrong and remind everyone why they remain one of the NFC’s most complete teams. Not to mention  the cowboys have given up the 9th highest rate of explosive plays and I wouldn’t be surprised to see saquon break one off to the house tomorrow. \n\nNorthwestern:\n\nAt the Greenbrier Tip-Off, both Northwestern and South Carolina are staring down the possibility of leaving 0-2. That desperation raises the stakes, but Northwestern has the clear edge. My power ratings make this game closer to -6.5, while the market sits at -5.5, giving us immediate value, however the pace by both teams might make this a little tighter in the end but I am not worried about northwestern, they will be getting the job done.\n\nThe Wildcats’ offense is built around Nick Martinelli, who has emerged as the best player on the floor in this matchup. His efficiency and ability to score at all three levels force defenses to collapse, opening opportunities for Arrinten Page and Jayden Reid. With Page providing a reliable interior presence and Reid distributing while scoring in double figures himself, Northwestern now has three legitimate scoring options. Their shooting splits reflect that balance: the Wildcats are hitting over 46% from the field and nearly 44% from deep, numbers that far outpace South Carolina’s streaky perimeter shooting. Carolina has meechie Johnson and really that’s about it, and they only shoot 45% from the field compared to northwesterns 51%. They simply don’t have as much continuity and fluid options in their offense to match martinelli and co and martinelli will be the best player on the court tomorrow, and he’s coming off a down game with just 8 points in a close loss to a solid Virginia team. \n\nRebounding has been Northwestern’s Achilles heel, highlighted by the lopsided 49-23 margin against Virginia. Yet even in that game, they led for stretches and lost by just five despite being +4.5 underdogs. That shows how dangerous their shooting can be when they’re clicking. Against South Carolina, the rebounding battle is far less intimidating. The Gamecocks average around 36 boards per game—similar to Northwestern—and were bullied on the glass by Butler. With Page and Martinelli anchoring the frontcourt, Northwestern actually holds a size advantage here, something they didn’t have against Virginia.\nSouth Carolina’s offense leans heavily on perimeter shooting, but they lack the efficiency and depth Northwestern brings. Combine that with the Wildcats’ superior shooting splits, their trio of scoring threats, and the fact that South Carolina has struggled to impose themselves physically, and the edge is clear. Northwestern has the tools to control this game, and with both teams desperate to avoid 0-2, the Wildcats’ balance and size should carry them to a win.\n\nIn summary:\n\nThe Eagles face a soft Dallas defense in ideal conditions after weeks of criticism, while Northwestern’s efficient offense and size give them the upper hand against South Carolina. At +110 odds, this is a plus-money play that I think puts us in excellent place to cash. As always, cheers 🍻",

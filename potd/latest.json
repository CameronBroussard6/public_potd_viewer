We now have a 3 game winning streak on favorites spreads, going to continue riding this wave.\n\n \n\nNext Pick: **Atlanta Hawks -3.5 vs Sacramento Kings @ 1.91**. 3U play.\n\nThe Kings play the Nuggets later tonight, and then play the Hawks tomorrow on a B2B. The Kings have an aging squad and given the late tip off tonight, I fully expect fatigue to play a role against the Hawks. Even without that factor, the Hawks have looked good, most recently pulling the big upset against the Lakers and beating the Clippers. Trae remains out, but the squad has adapted to his absence and are playing some good basketball. The Kings squad is a mismatch of aging talent and while a few guys can pop off, they are nowhere near as fluid and consistent as the Hawks.\n\n \n\n*This line is available on DK. I’d play it to -4.0.*",

      "text": "Record: 161-137, +0.11 units\n\nLast Pick: Roman Andres Burruchaga ML vs Federico Agustin Gomez (-200, 2 units): Win\n\nTennis | Montevideo Challenger | 11:30 AM EST\n\nToday's Pick: Ignacio Buse vs Vilius Gaubas | **Buse ML at -112 (DK). 1 unit.**\n\nWrite-up: Burruchaga closed at -335, and while he should have been able to serve it out at 5-4 in the second set, he was able to get the job done in the end. That win officially brought me back into the green for the first time in a while - I know that I've a lot of ups and downs as a capper, but at the end of the day, breaking even isn't the worst outcome in a world where most people lose money. I hope that I can stay in the green as the sample size gets larger, and my next goal is to reach my highest unit return ever again. \n\nThis should be a good matchup between two of the top performers in clay Challengers this season, Ignacio \"Nacho\" Buse and Vilius Gaubas. My reasoning here is actually pretty simple: I believe that the market is overvaluing the head-to-head. These players have faced off on clay twice this season, once in April in Menorca and once in Lisbon in September, with Gaubas winning two closely contested matches. What interests me, however, is that Buse closed at around -220 in both matches. In fact, Buse was pushed to those closing odds from an opening line of -189 in Menorca, meaning the market ultimately was not concerned by the first result.\n\nAs for the second match, it couldn't have been much closer considering that it was a straight-setter. Buse won 56.0% of his service points compared to Gaubas's 58.3%, and Gaubas also benefited from first serve percentages in that match. The performance rating told a similar story, with Gaubas earning a 7.31 while Buse earned a 7.16. The players seemed to be on pretty even footing, with Buse finding some nice attacking patterns to disrupt Gaubas's heavy topspin.\n\nHas anything happened since that second match to justify the price moving this much for the third? Not really, in my opinion. Gaubas followed up his Lisbon performance with a final in Braga, but then struggled after moving to South American clay, and didn't look all that great in the first round against David Jorda Sanchis (7.16/10). In comparison, Nacho has been playing in this conditions for a few straight weeks, scoring some decent results in two Lima events and then crushing Timofey Skatov in the opening round here (7.98/10). Buse's more attacking game is theoretically better on faster European clay, but the oddsmakers have still been pricing him as a high-end CH player here is SA, as he closed as a heavy favorite against solid players like Joao Reis Da Silva and Alvaro Guillen Meza. \n\nThe conditions tomorrow should be similar to what Buse experienced in Lima, with mild temperatures, moderate winds, and high humidity, and I think his big groundstrokes should still be able to shine even if the courts aren't the fastest. \n\nA lot of clay grinders, like Gonzalo Bueno and Sebastian Baez, have already struggled here in Montevideo, and I was even a bit surprised at how much difficulty Burruchaga had with Gomez's big serve and forehand. Overall, I have no reason to believe that Buse won't be able to use his superior serve and willingness to go for his shots to his advantage here, and I'm happy to take him at the best price he's been available at in this matchup. \n\nNote: The [POTD Capper Tracker](https://potd.lol), which you may remember from its Google Sheet days, is finally back in a cleaner, more robust website format!

      "text": " Record: 22-13\n\nLast Five Predictions (Old - New): ✅❌ ✅❌✅\n\nNet Units: +17.17\n\nYesterday's Pick: Merthyr Town vs South Shields BTTS and o2.5 3u @ $1.80✅\n\nCovered before half time, which is always good. \n\nToday's Pick: Atletico MG to win vs Fortaleza 3u @ $1.61\n\nAgain, not a lot on today (midweek during international breaks can be grim... to the point where I'm even backing Bahamas to win) but I don't mind this...\n\nMid-table Atletico MG hosts second-last Fortaleza in Brazil. Both teams are actually in decent form considering their league positions. Atletico are 3-1-1 in their last five, winning their last two games. This puts them second in the form table in the previous five games. Fortaleza are 1-3-1 in their last five, drawing three in a row. \n\nAtletico are a far better side at home, with 30 points at home compared to 13 away; They've also got a +10 goal difference at home compared to an even one away. \n\nFortaleza are one of the worst teams in the league away from home this season, with 9 points in 15 away games and a -15 goal difference. Compare this form to 21 home points in 17 games.\n\nFortaleza will also be without Matheus Pereira, who got a red card late last match. He's been in and out of the team, but if he's not starting, is usually one of the first off the bench and will be missed. \n\nAll in all, while there's not a lot on - I think Atletico should win this at home and the $1.61 price works for me.",

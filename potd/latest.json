In his last 10 games he's averaging 14 points a game, and he's cleared this line in 9 of his last 10.\n\n\nHe is somewhat reliant on the 3PT shot, which is concerning in road games, but even in games where he isn't hitting, he gets enough free throws and 2PT shots to clear this small line. \n\n\nYou might say that Houston has a top defense, and you're right, but JC has scored 27 and 22 points in his 2 games against Houston this year, and they're middle of the road at defending small forwards. \n\n\nSA is coming off 3 days rest, so everyone should be fresh. I think JC can hit his \"starter average\" or at the very least his season average that includes games where he wasn't starting. \n\n\nJulian Champagnie over 10.5 points ",

In the previous 3, the goal has not exceeded 34.5 games. Shelton has yet to win a set against Jannik in a slam and is 1-8 H2H against him. He won the first time they played and then has lost 8 straight. In those 8 straight losses, he has not won a set.\n\nThis match is the night match, so there should be less of a concern with the heat that Sinner struggled with in Round 3. Shelton has had a good tournament, but Sinner is just on another level right now on hard courts and really against anyone not named Alcaraz\n\nGood Luck!",

I was only able to watch the first 15 and last 15. Fiorentina had some early chances even before their goal. Como eventually settled in and dominated in shots and shots on target. They put the game away in stoppage time with a tap in by Morata. He managed a goal and YC coming in at the 86th. Three game win steak let's keep it going with Champions League tomorrow.\n\nWrite Up:  I'm surprised this pick is plus money for Juventus. Juventus has advanced but is fighting for a top 8 spot (possible but unlikely) while Monaco needs points to hold their spot to advance to the playoff qualifier. I guess you could say Monaco needs this win more but they have just been horrible as of late. Juve's last 10 games have 8 victories, 1 defeat and 1 draw. Monaco's last 10 games have 2 wins, 6 losses and 2 draws. Monaco have lost four of six previous meetings with Juventus, winning just one. Juventus has been playing very well recently with their only loss being last time I bet on them against Caglari.",

Unfortunately, it is an evening match with lower than usual temps so roof will not be closed. Still, Sinner has shown he can serve a lot of aces. He's got 18, 17 (closed roof mid game) and 19. Gaston match was 6 aces, but he retired so thats about half a match. In Turin, last tournament, he had 11 vs Shelton in a 2 set match. I expect this to be a 3 or 4 set match. I dont see why he would he miss.",

You can't make this stuff up. \n\nOff to the final day of Champion's League lewgue play and we have a doozy here. PSG host Newcastle in a march to secure a berth in the top 8. Winner takes a top 8 spot and loser will likely fall out of the top 8. If they draw, they likely both miss out on top 8. So expecting attacking focus here for both teams. Top 8 means an automatic place in the knockout stage, below that teams have to play a 2 leg playoff to make it to the top 16 knockout. Basically the loser has to play 2 more games, which is huge this point in the season.\n\nYou guys know Big Nick/The Lanky German/Woltemade is one of my favorite players to back. Checks all the boxes I look for - chases everything, loves to shoot, great in the air. He has fallen out of favor as Wissa has come back from injury, but I'm banking on him getting a start here and Newcastle stretching the pitch (maybe even starting 2 up front?). He is well rested and makes sense here. The other reason I love this is that PSG's tallest defender is 6'2, their other starting center back is 6' even. Woltemade is 6'6\" tall, he is going to tower over the PSG defenders and cause a lot of problems in the air. Love him in this spot, hopefully coach Howe sees it the same way and starts our guy up front. As always for these SOT plays, feel free to wait for lineups if your book doesn't void for players not starting. I like this play even if he comes off the bench though. \n\nBOL and happy Wednesday!",

Massive margins through the field, and the race rated through the roof. Horse doesn’t need to improve at all to be winning here, but at start number 2 some improvement can be forecasted.      \n      \nBarrier of no concern, will go straight to the front (or nearish enough) and there isn’t much pressure in the race, so should be able to do its own thing.     \n       \nSome nice types engaged in this race, but with most of them first up it’ll be a hard task to run us down. Second favourite JAMESJOHNO is definitely a threat on current ratings and form, however I’m thinking we’re progressive and can take the next step.     \n     \nGL!",

If you look at their away games in the knockout stage of the Europa League last season; Haikin had to make 4, 8, 5, 5 saves. \n\nAtletico Madrid are chasing a spot in the top 8 while being completely safe from falling out of the top 24, so they have no reason to play safe and boring, which is maybe something you would associate with Diego Simeone. Against Mallorca at the weekend the guests made seven saves at home and over half of Atletico Madrid’s home games has seen the guests make 5+ saves. \n\nGlimt with their massive win over Manchester City last week, still has a decent chance of making it if they win this one, so they have to take risks going forward which again should allow for Atletico to have more chances to get attempts off.",

First tournament for Zweih since leaving Spirit and he showed out in a big way\n* This line is strictly set looking at L3 month KPR which both players have similar numbers with Zweih at .60 and Susp at .61, however Zweih only joined PARIVISION a month ago and is playing completely different spots then from when he was on Spirit so this data can basically be thrown out. Zweih is averaging a .75 KPR in the last month since joining PARIVISION and has been their highest rated and best player so far.\n* Susp on the other hand has been HEROIC's lowest rated player amongst starters since the roster change as mentioned above at a .61 KPR. On top if this already massive KPR gap, PARIVISION are the favorites in this series at -250 odds making this a huge KPR gap and strong favorites as well making it a fantastic spot to target.\n* PARIVISION are picking their map 2nd, see no other map they would pick here besides Dust 2. It is HEROIC's second lowest winrate map as a roster, a map 2/3 of their players heavily struggle on, and PARIVISION are 100% win rate on the map in the L3 months as a roster\n* Susp has always struggled on Dust 2 averaging a .47 KPR since joining HEROIC and a .53 KPR in 2025. He typically plays B anchor and has struggled heavily on the map for that reason as B anchor is one of the worst spots for kills in the entire game on any map\n* Zweih has been fantastic on Dust 2 since joining PARIVISION while only a small sample, he has averaged a .95 KPR, a +.20 KPR increase overall, while his T sides specifically have been insanely good with a 1.04 KPR on T side (offense) where he would start on the map",

Never again. \n\nDjokovic is the freshest he’s been at a major quarterfinal. He’s won in straight sets every match and got a withdrawal from Mensik in the round of 16. This is the best chance for Djokovic to win a major in the last few years and he knows it. \n\nMusetti has played well this tourney but not as well as the general public would have you believe. Fritz was an absolute embarrassment last round and Djokovic is a great step up in class. \n\nI expect Novak to grind out rallies and dominate cross court backhand battles with Musetti. Musetti can hit some great shots with his 1 handed backhand, but when pressured throughout a match it can get shaky. Give me the king in this matchup.",

Not quite bad enough to make me want to take a big break (after all, Negritu threw away the first set and won a higher % of service points), but I am planning to start being more selective and taking more days off, as I did yesterday.\n\nToday, I'm jumping into the two-leg game for the first time. This is not something I expected to do, but I've realized that it just opens up so many more options. This is especially true for Challenger matches, where many markets aren't open  until shortly before the match, and there's no great way to play matches involving big favorites within odds restrictions. \n\nThe first leg, Korda 2-0, is definitely the \"safe\" leg in this parlay, but I'm not only taking it as an odds booster. Korda has had disappointing results in his last two tournaments, losing to Kokkinakis in Adelaide and Zheng at the Australian Open, but he still comes into this Challenger 100 as the clear title favorite. Even if Korda has some unresolved issues in his game, I do believe his raw ballstriking should be enough to take care of business against Milavsky, who mostly plays ITFs and tends to rely a lot on his serve. \n\nPatrick Kypson comes into this tournament after a four-set loss to Comesaña at the Australian Open, but I don't feel like that's any kind of embarrasing result, given how much Fran tends to raise his level at Slams (he even took a set over Tiafoe in the next round). Kypson was one of the more consistent players on the US Challenger circuit last season, winning Little Rock and Sioux Falls along with SFs in Tyler and Cary. In fact, he actually faced Zink in Little Rock, and was able to score a pretty comfortable 6-4, 6-4 win. Zink's form has really dipped to start the year, and given his long odds against Piros and Kozlov, I have to think that Kypson should be an even bigger favorite here. Zink has a consistent game with a strong backhand, but he tends to look outclassed when he plays high-end CH players, and Kypson's serve and forehand should be deciding factors here.",

First up are the bottom two teams in their respective groups, HANJIN BRION and DRX.\n\nHANJIN BRION (0-4) have been a punching bag ever since their entry into the league. They're consistently a bottom 4 team and seldom make the playoffs in any of the splits throughout the year. They are a fan favourite though, because they have the very annoying tendency to upset the best teams in the league. They've not had the best start to the season but they've been competitive, taking a game away in 3 of 4 matches they've played.\n\nDRX (1-3) are looking pretty good, the match record doesn't really reflect it, but like BRION, they've taken games away in 2 of 3 series they lost and won a series 2-1. Both teams today were the underdog on almost every series they've played.\n\nBRION average 4.27 total dragons/game, DRX average 4.36, which is quite high considering they are almost always behind and cant contest dragons. On Map 1, BRION average 4.5 total dragons, DRX average 4.25 total. In Week 2, BRION hit the over on the same line on 4 of 6 games, DRX hit the over on 3 of 6. Despite being severe underdogs, both teams are managing to contest dragons to clear the line.\n\nThis is probably the most even matchup for both so far and evenly matched teams tend to go long. Longer games = more chances to take dragons and up the count. A win today would massively increase the likelihood of either team being in contention for the playoffs, so there's extra emphasis to perform. As with every Map 1 bet, these games tend to be slower, teams don't want to jump the gun only to fall flat and go down 0-1 in the series. Since both teams are not quite as skilled, they'll rely on neutral objectives to help finish the game. It is crucial for them to contest and not allow one or the other to snowball the dragon count for this same reason. I expect a close fight to open this Best of 5 and allow the dragon count to rack up and clear the line. BOL!\n\n**Map 1 - Over 4.5 Total Dragons (1.72) 2u to win 1.44u**",

The two sets Shelton won was in their very first meeting back in 2023. Since then Sinner has became one of the op 2 players in the world and has progressed his game significantly. Shelton is going to have to play a near perfect game just to take a set. He almost did this last year in their AO matchup with Shelton actually having two set points against Sinner on his own serve. In my opinion this all comes down to the first set. If Sinner takes it, I expect him to run away with this one.

Oviedo kindly gifted them two and then Yamal scored a crazy bicycle kick from the edge of the box (because of course he did) to slam another L on the board. I took a couple days off because I didn't like the look of any games out there, but the Champions League is back, and so am I*\n\n**Last Five:** ❌❌✅❌❌\n\n**Event:** Champions League, FC Barcelona v FC Copenhagen, 3:00 pm EST\n\n**POTD:** FC Copenhagen +2.0, +2.5 Asian Handicap, +110, 4 units\n\n**Write Up:** This bet does ring a bell, but we lost the last one because of some 1/100 type goals and I doubt Barcelona are pulling off more black magic this time. Copenhagen are a very respectable team and they have everything to play for as they chase a qualification spot. Barcelona need a win, preferrably by at least 2 goals to stand a chance of finishing in the top 8 spots and securing an automatic pass to the round of 16. I don't back them to win by a big margin though. They're going to be vulnerable on the counters and they've already proven **their defence in the Champions league is more than shakey.** They **conceded twice to a team from the Czech Republic that hadn't played a competitive match in over a month** and let's not even bring up what happened when they **visited the Stamford Bridge.**\n\nMake no mistake, *Barcelona are clearly the favorites for this clash,* but it's not going to be straightforward. **Copenhagen are in some pretty good form** themselves, remaining **undefeated in the last three CL games,** with two wins and a draw, and they're **undefeated in the last five games in all competitions,** which is nothing to scoff at.\n\n**Barcelona also miss many key players,** for example, their whole midfield is out. Yes, **Pedri, de Jong, and Gavi** are all set to miss today's fixture, and the team always plays worse without them. Meanwhile, **Raphinha still doesn't seem to be at 100% fitness.** His intensity and pressing are crucial for Barcelona's gameplay and he might not be able to provide that to the usual full extent.\n\nOverall, I have a faint suspicion Barcelona are taking the three points today, but it's going to be a narrow one and I could even see them being stunned by the talented Copenhagen team. All in all, Barcelona are definitely there for the taking, so I'm going in with 4 whole units for this one. BOL and let's enjoy another Flick masterclass ☘️🫡",

It’s quite literally Sincaraz vs the field at the moment. Out of the up-and-comers the only two players I could see challenge them and win one for even just one slam in the next few years would be Draper and Fils (+ Djokovic on a good day currently). Surprising selections to some maybe but despite their fitness issues are the only players that imo can consistently take the game to their opponents. \n\nAnyways this is proving to be a very difficult match-up for Shelton having lost his last 19 sets against the Italian (8 consecutive straight set losses, 3 in slams). Ben can count himself lucky to have won their first encounter in 2023 as I would fear a De Minaur-Sinner lopsided H2H remake between these two. Jannik has shown some weakness at a tournament for once to prove he’s in fact human when he was very close to retiring down a break in the third set against wild card Spizzirri in round 3. That was down to cramps though as a result of the insane heat in Melbourne and there won’t be such issues for this match. Other than that it’s pretty much been business as usual having benefitted of Gaston’s retirement in round 1, a beatdown of Duckworth in round 2 and a comfortable victory over Darderi last round, who despite playing out of his mind towards the end of the third set still lost in straight sets. \n\nShelton meanwhile has been playing very well having only dropped a set thus far against Ruud in the fourth round. He’s one of the best servers in the world and has a very explosive forehand. Unfortunately that’s just not enough to truly trouble Sinner which is kind of nuts. Ben’s return game is simply not good enough to be competitive on Sinner’s service game and Jannik’s return game (being the best on tour) is too good to make the American’s serve a deadly weapon. The problem with that is that Shelton therefore can’t get enough free points from his biggest strength to hold comfortably (unless serving first serves at an unsustainable rate which is his only chance) and causes rallies to take place, more so as the match goes on. At that point Sinner largely has the upper hand being the perfect blend of power and consistency from the baseline we have ever seen. On the other side you have a Shelton whose rally tolerance is miles worse than Sinner’s and you have a recipe for the No. 2 coming on top of the majority points if the serve is returned. A really bad match-up for Shelton, whose lefty game catches Sinner’s incredible backhand, and was broken 6 times in their match-up last year in their semi final match in Australia. I would say fair odds should be closer to 1.66 as Shelton’s serve could catch fire for a set and scam a tiebreak but even then has easily lost his last 7 TB’s against the Italian and I strongly suspect we will see another routine win for Sinner.

Those numbers only get more impressive against Top 10 visitors, as the team has won six of the last nine. That includes then-No. 2 Houston in a 68-67 thriller back in 2024. In fact, the Horned Frogs (13-7) have won four of the last five meetings at home against the Cougars (17-2). And although Houston has not lost back-to-back games since the 2023-24 season, the last time the team did so was against Iowa State and…yep, you guessed it… at TCU. \n\nI can hear you all now: Sooooo why exactly are we waging our hard-earned coin on this?\n\nThere certainly is some cause for alarm, but hear me out. Following a lackluster defensive effort against Arizona State, the Cougars defense was almost non-existent in a 90-86 loss at No. 12 Texas Tech on Saturday. And with the 90 points allowed being the most conceded by Houston since February of 2018, you can bet head coach Kelvin Sampson will have his squad locked in for this one—especially given the recent history at TCU. Not to mention, since the start of the 2024 season, his team is 8-1 straight up following a loss, including seven double-digit victories while only allowing opponents to average 55.6 points. \n\nIf the Cougars expect to right the ship, they will need to rely on its elite defense to return to form. \n\nThrough 19 games, the unit ranks 1st in scoring defense (61.6 PPGA), 4th in defensive efficiency (0.904), 17th in opponent field-goal percentage (39.4%) and 66th in opponent three-point shooting (31.2%). That should lead to tough sledding for a Horned Frogs offense that finds itself among the middle of the pack, ranking 85th in scoring (80.0 PPG), 102nd in field-goal percentage (46.2%), 105th in offensive efficiency (1.096) and 165th in three-point shooting (34.2%). It’s a unit that thrives in transition, ranking 17th in fast break points (15.8 PPG; 96th percentile). Unfortunately for TCU, Houston just so happens to be stellar in defending just that, ranking 8th in opponent fast break points (5.5 PPG; 98th percentile). \n\nOn the other end of the floor, a resurgent Cougars offense should make a difference. \n\nAlthough the unit has been solid overall—38th in offensive efficiency (1.160), 96th in scoring (79.1 PPG), 148th in field-goal percentage (45.1%) and 152nd in three-point shooting (34.4%)—it has certainly raised its level of play as of late. Over the team’s last three outings, Houston has averaged 88.7 points on 49.7% shooting from the field (38.6% from beyond the arc). In fact, since the turn of the calendar year, the team actually ranks 3rd in adjusted offensive efficiency (129.8), per Torvik. Coming off a stellar 42-point showing on Saturday, look for freshman guard Kingston Flemings (17.0 PPG) to lead the effort to pick apart a stingy TCU defense that enters ranked 31st in defensive efficiency (0.964), 79th in scoring defense (70.4 PPGA), 107th in opponent field-goal percentage (43.0%) and 146th in opponent three-point shooting (33.3%). Second-chance opportunities will go a long way in this one, as the Cougars rank 24th in second-chance points (14.5 PPG; 93rd percentile) while the Horned Frogs rank just 134th in opponent second-chance points (10.6 PPGA; 63rd percentile). \n\nFinally, the turnover battle should be the X factor on Wednesday night. \n\nForcing opponent miscues has been somewhat of staple for this Houston defense, as the unit ranks 5th in turnovers forced per possession (22.4%), 8th in turnovers forced (15.3 per game) and 34th in steals (8.7). But what makes the team even more dangerous is how it converts those opportunities into points, ranking 7th in points off turnovers (20.2 PPG; 98th percentile). That could be an issue for a TCU offense that has been careless as times with the basketball, ranking 95th in turnovers per possession (15.4%), 127th in turnovers (11.3) and 129th in opponent steals (6.3). And while the Horned Frogs do a good job forcing turnovers themselves—33rd in turnovers forced (14.5), 35th in turnovers forced per possession (19.8%) and 87th in steals (7.7)—the Cougars are among the nation’s best in limiting such mistakes, ranking 1st in opponent steals (4.6), 2nd in turnovers (8.5) and 6th in turnovers per possession (12.5%).\n\nLook for Houston to get back in the win column with a convincing effort.\n\nBOL if tailing, and as always, please do so responsibly. One bet should not have you crashing out all over Reddit.",

They just dropped a series to Nemesis and struggled big time against Kukuys. This YB squad has veteran star power like BoBoKa, flyfly, but their coordination has been hit-or-miss. Rekonix, led by inYourdreaM and Fbz, has been a far more cohesive unit. Even with the loss to Vici Gaming who are arguably the tournament favorites, Rekonix plays cleaner, more disciplined Dota, and their overall macro play has been sharper than YB's current brawl-heavy style. I'd rather trust Rekonix's system than flip a coin on YB figuring it out today.\n\nOn the other side, Vici Gaming is the favorite on paper, but they haven't been invincible they dropped a map in their recent 2-1 series against Rekonix. Team Nemesis, on the other hand is coming off a massive confidence boosting 2-0 win over Execration. Their roster is stacked with individual talent, specifically 23savage and Mac, who have the carry potential to take over a game single handedly. Nemesis might not win the series, but they have enough firepower to punish Vici’s drafts and secure at least one game.

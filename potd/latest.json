Haaland didn't have a single shot all game, as everyone else was taking the ball on instead of finding him. Lot of mouths to feed at City now, will be tough to call going forward. \n\nBack to out favorite play today as Chelsea host Arsenal in the EFL Cup semis. In addition to all the normal reasons, I love this play today because Enzo is well rested after only playing half of their last EPL game and about 20 minutes of their FA Cup match. Interestingly in that FA cup match, Enzo came on and had 3 SOTs in 20 minutes. I like him to ride that momentum here today, granted against a much better team. \n\nChelsea will want to take it to Arsenal at home under their new manager. And I expect Coach Rosenior to throw everything at Arsenal today. Expecting a lot of attacking by the blues. Notably Arsenal do not concede a lot of SOTs, but this play did hit when we played it during the clash of these teams in the EPL a few weeks back. I am predicting the same here to get us back on track. \n\nBOL and have a great Wednesday!",

What an* ***insane*** *result. Loyola (5-12) played without four of its top six scorers - including their best player. The Ramblers used a senior making his first career start. They had a freshman averaging 10.7 minutes not only start, but drop eight first-half points on 16-1 George Mason. They had one legitimate sub. Let me say that again: one sub. Two others - with 112 combined minutes of action this season - each played three minutes, and even THEY got in the scorebook. Loyola shot 59 percent from the floor, 50 percent from 3, and had fewer turnovers than GMU. Loyola's 47 first-half points is only 21 off its full-game scoring average, and it's the third-best first-half output of the season. Why hasn't Loyola started this group all season?! These guys looked like world beaters. I watched the whole thing speechless, jaw on the ground. So it goes... Quick aside: My only POTD losses have been college first-half bets. Is that a sign?* \n\nI've been writing novellas lately, so I'll make this short and sweet. Western Carolina is 4-1 at home, but two of those wins come against non-Division I schools. KenPom has WCU (5-10) ranked 282nd with a 272 rating for both offense and defense. ETSU (12-5) is ranked 116th overall and enjoy offensive and defensive ratings in the 120s. WCU is 4-9 against the spread, and didn't cover their last two games. They're also 1-2 ATS at home. ETSU isn't great ATS this year - only 8-7 - but they've covered two of their last three games against WCU. Also, ETSU has won four in a row as they've maneuvered atop the Southern Conference standings. I'm going with better team numbers, and WCU's inability to cover this year. It's a simple play, but then... so was George Mason against the Loyola JV team, and we see how *that* worked out.\n\nGood luck and Godspeed!\n\nIf I've made you a few bucks through fades, it's just gonna ask you a few questions: [https://buymeacoffee.com/seventh\\_\\_place](https://buymeacoffee.com/seventh__place)",

Dortmund cruised to a 3-0 victory, holding Bremen to only a couple of legit chances early on. Atletico controlled the match for the most part with a somewhat reduced side, and held on to a fairly comfortable 1-0 victory. Cash money lads.\n\n**Today's Write Up:** Today we are riding with two separate juggernauts in European Women’s soccer. FC Barcelona (W) and OL Lyonnes (W) are the two best women’s club teams in the world. They both absolutely dominate their individual leagues (Spanish La Liga F and French ​​Première Ligue). FC Barcelona is 14-0-1 with a +70 goal differential this season. They have scored 74 times in 15 matches and only conceded 4 times. OL Lyonnes is 11-0-0 on the season, scoring 49 times in 11 matches and only conceding 5 total goals through those matches.\n\nThe last time FC Barcelona faced Atleti, they dominated 6-0 away from home. Now they will face Atletico Madrid at home, coming off a 12-1 win of their own. In Atleti’s last match they gave up 5 goals to Real Sociedad who sits 3rd in the table with 32 goals on the season. FC Barcelona has scored more than 2x as many goals as Sociedad, who just netted 5 times against Atleti. Give me FC Barca to score 3+ goals in this match. Predicting a final score of 4-0 or 5-1.\n\nOur second leg is OL Lyonnes at home taking on Lens. OL Lyonnes is the second ranked women’s club team in the world and also absolutely dominant (undefeated on the season). OL Lyonnes has scored 49 times this season (most of any team), and Lens has conceded 30 goals through 11 matches (most of any team). Last time these squads met, OL Lyonnes won 8-1. They will be looking to get into their groove before their match against Paris FC this weekend. Give me OL Lyonnes to score 4+ goals in this match. Predicting a final score of 5-0 or 7-0.",

UNLEESHING $1.70                 \n**Write Up:** And we back today with UNLEESHING having its third run for the prep and ticks every box here. Bit injury plagued this horse has been, and has never got far enough into a preparation to get out over its ideal distance, which it sees today. Both runs this prep have been grouse without winning, first up was a deadset sit and sprint which did us no favours, however still was beaten under a length; and then last start was a bit of horror watch, but again we flashed home to be narrowly beaten.    \n    \nNow today we go up in distance another 150m, down in grade from a Saturday class race to a Wednesday, stay in fillies and mares grade, and to top it all off we draw barrier  2 with the worlds greatest jockey aboard.    \n    \nStable is extremely confident, and the reason for the drop in grade is purely to knock off a confidence boosting win before taking on better targets in the future.    \n    \nMy only knock/worry is the potential position in run. From barrier 2 I’d like to be 2nd pair, however the trainer has said he doesn’t care where the horse is (even 3 pairs back the inside) that it should be winning. Now if we do get a fair way back there is always the possibility of bad luck, so I’m hoping the goat jmac shows some positivity out of the gates.    \n    \nAll that being said, UNLEESHING is different gravy to the other horses here, and provided the breaks come (faith in the best jockey), I think we should be way too good.

Bayern is just playing at an absurd level right now. They are unbeaten in the league with 14 wins and 2 draws, and every single Bundesliga match this season has gone over 2.5 goals. Köln sit 11th in the table and their recent form is far from convincing: 4 losses, 5 draws and just 1 win in their last 10 league matches.

Giving Cologne a 2 goal headstart just to make the pick a bit more secure (in case Bayern don’t rotate or their attack clicks again) and I certainly back them to get it done. Bayern aren’t immune to narrow results and complacency could set in after an 8-1 hammering of Wolfsburg. If you want to take the BTTS Yes, I certainly don’t mind that either.

He's done very well though and it's all behind a very strong first service game. Being able to generate 5 BP opportunities off the Blockx service game shows the kinda form he's in.\n* Kjaer is a young up and comer making his first attempt at the AO. He's covers the court very well and is a strong ball rallier, evident with him regularly taking more than 50% of his opponents 2nd service games. He's had much less prep than McCabe for this one and given more games leading in, I think he'd easily win it. His recent victory over Watanuki tells me he's almost there and is still a very good chance of winning this and deserves to be the favourite.\n* At their best, McCabe is nowhere close to Kjaer in terms of talent but I think his service game is so strong right now and the fact that he's had more time on court to start the year and is playing in his home country gives him enough to come close in this match.\n\nI can't decide who's going to win this match, which is a good indicator for me it could go the distance.\n\nBOL",

Coach Ole Werner has publicly framed the match as a chance to “restart the season with rhythm” and stressed that Leipzig are “well-prepared” despite the unusual break caused by the snow cancellation — his words underline a desire for a dynamic, high-tempo game rather than cautious play. Werner also hinted that attackers like Timo Werner might feature, as he remains “in discussions” with the club and could return to the squad, giving Leipzig additional firepower up front.\n\n\\- Defensively, Leipzig’s setup remains stretched: injuries to Kampl, Klostermann, Nusa, and Bakayoko force structural adjustments and weaken their ability to cope with transitions once their press is bypassed — an issue critics in Germany have repeatedly flagged as leading to goals conceded. Freiburg coach Julian Schuster, meanwhile, has emphasised his side’s confidence and offensive rhythm, praising his squad’s ability to respond and contribute goals, especially through substitutes — which underscores his intent to keep attacking rather than sitting back.\n\n\\- Schuster’s remarks and recent team news also highlight that Freiburg will not shy away from an open contest; while they struggle historically away at Leipzig, Schuster has publicly spoken about focusing on Leipzig’s strengths and exploiting spaces between the lines — language typical of coaches who plan to counter-attack and invite pressure as a pathway to goals.\n\n\\- Finally, German previews note that Leipzig’s home offensive numbers are among the league’s strongest, while Freiburg’s defensive record away is far from secure, adding a statistical backbone to the tactical picture that supports multiple goals.\n\n\\- All told, with both teams motivated to push forward, Leipzig’s injury-forced defensive shifts, Freiburg’s attacking confidence, and coaches indicating a proactive rather than cautious mindset, the conditions are aligned for a match exceeding 2.5 goals.",

They just destroyed Wolfsburg 8-1 this past weekend. Their offense is clicking perfectly with Harry Kane and Olise scoring for fun, and they are averaging nearly 4 goals per game.\n\nOn the other side, Köln is struggling bad. They are winless in their last 5 league games and have conceded a goal in 11 straight matches. Their defense is leaking, and they already lost 4-1 to Bayern in the Cup earlier this season.\n\nBayern is fresh off a blowout, fully healthy, and chasing records. Köln is just trying to survive. Expecting another comfortable multi-goal win here.\n\nLet’s get that bounce back. BOL!",

Quick has given up 3, 4, 6, and 3 in his last 4 starts.\n\nOn the other side, Ottawa has been starting their backup Leevi Merilainen who has started in 9 straight games (tonight is his 9th straight). He has even been playing in back to back games. If Merilainen doesn’t make his 10th straight appearance on Wednesday, it would be Hunter Shepard in goal, who was called up from the AHL over the weekend. Merilainen has given up 3 goals in 4 straight starts and has a .854 save percentage in his last month. \n\nGood Luck!",

      "text": "Record: 4-3-1\n\nLast pick: Julian Brandt 1+ Shot on Target stake returned (did not start)\n\nSoccer | Bundesliga 🇩🇪 | FC Köln vs Bayern Munich\nDate: 14 January 2026\nTime: 20:30 (Amsterdam time)\nPick: Bayern Munich -2 Asian Handicap @ +100 (Bet365)\nStake: 2 units\n\nWrite Up:\n\nLast pick didn’t get settled since Brandt didn’t start, stake back, and we move on.\n\nI’m backing Bayern Munich -2 Asian Handicap away at Köln.\n\nBayern are on a completely different level compared to Köln and the recent form is scary. In their last five games they’re averaging 4.4 goals scored while conceding just 0.8. On top of that, they just sent a message this weekend by thrashing Wolfsburg 8-1 at home. When Bayern get rolling, games can get ugly fast.\n\nKöln really struggle against top teams, especially defensively. They give up a lot of chances and don’t cope well with sustained pressure, which is exactly what Bayern bring for 90 minutes.\n\nWe’ve also seen this matchup recently. On 29 October 2025, Bayern went to Köln in the DFB Pokal and won 1-4, again showing how big the quality gap is.\n\nQuick explanation of the line: Asian Handicap -2 means Bayern need to win by three goals or more for the bet to win. If Bayern win by exactly two goals, it’s a push and the stake comes back. Anything less and the bet loses.\n\nYou could wait for the line-ups in case Bayern rotate a bit, which is always possible with their schedule. That said, even if they do rotate, they still have ridiculous depth with players like Lennart Karl and Nicolas Jackson potentially coming off the bench. Just keep in mind that if you wait for line-ups, the odds will likely drop.\n\nAt +100, I’m happy to take this now. A 3-0, 4-1 or even bigger scoreline wouldn’t surprise me at all.\n\nBayern Munich -2 Asian Handicap\n2 units\n\nLet’s keep it rolling.",

      "text": "**Record:** 36-18-1 (+17.32u)\n\n**Last:** (CBB) Michigan State -6.5 (1.5u) - ✅\n\n**POTD:** (CBB) No. 13 Illinois (-9.5) at Northwestern \n\n**Start Time:** 8:30 PM ET (BTN)\n\n**Odds:** -102 (FanDuel)\n\n**Units:** 1.5U\n\n**Reasoning:** Superman has his kryptonite. Achilles has his heel. Illinois has… playing on the road at Northwestern?\n\nYes, the Illini (13-3) have posted an impressive 145-45 all-time record against their Big Ten foe. Sure, under head coach Brad Underwood, the team is 11-5 in the series. However, Illinois is just 3-4 over its last seven trips to Evanston, including dropping each of the last three. That includes a frustrating overtime defeat last season in which the team coughed up a double-digit lead late in the second half.\n\nFortunately, this year’s Wildcats (8-8) have made a living snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. \n\nIn six of its eight losses this season, Northwestern has held leads of seven or more points with under 13 minutes to go. The proof isn’t that hard to find, as the team saw second-half leads disappear in each of its past three games against Minnesota (67-60 w/ 4:39 remaining), Michigan State (45-38 w/ 12:36 remaining) and Rutgers (65-59 w/ 2:33 remaining)—the Wildcats lost all three contests. With a March Madness bid all but gone, and staring down an 0-6 start to conference play, the team appears ready to be put out of its misery.\n\nLook for a revenge-minded, lethal Illini offense to deliver the kill shot. \n\nThrough 16 games, the unit ranks 2nd in offensive efficiency (1.234), 30th in scoring (86.0 PPG), 55th in field-goal percentage (47.7%) and 122nd in three-point shooting (34.8%). It’s become a game of “Pick Your Poison” for opposing defenses, as Illinois boasts four players averaging 12.4 points per game or better. That has disaster written all over it for a suddenly-reeling Northwestern defense that ranks 63rd in opponent field-goal percentage (41.6%), 94th in scoring defense (71.2 PPGA) and 113th in defensive efficiency (1.014). Not surprisingly, those numbers have ballooned to 79.0 points per game conceded on 47.6% shooting over the team’s three-game slide. \n\nConversely, the Wildcats have the nation’s leading scorer in Nick Martinelli (24.1 PPG) and not much else. \n\nOn the season, the team ranks 54th in field-goal percentage (47.7%), 67th in offensive efficiency (1.127), 100th in scoring (79.1 PPG) and 294th in three-point shooting (30.8%). Over the last three games, those numbers have dropped to 73.0 points per game on just 42.7% shooting (26.9% from beyond the arc). Things won’t get any easier against an Illini defense that ranks 20th in opponent field-goal percentage (39.5%), 34th in scoring defense (67.4 PPGA), 44th in defensive efficiency (0.968) and 66th in opponent three-point shooting (30.9%). The unit has been more suffocating as of late, only conceding just 58.4 points per game on a meager 35.2% shooting (24.3% from deep) over its last five games. \n\nLook for Illinois to impose its size advantage on Wednesday night.\n\nPer KenPom, the team ranks 1st in average height and 4th in effective height. That advantage has been evident on the glass, where the Illini rank 9th in total rebounding (42.3 per game), 13th in defensive rebounding (27.2) and 20th in offensive rebounding (11.9) while ranking 8th in opponent defensive rebounding (18.5), 28th in opponent total rebounding (31.3) and 208th in opponent offensive rebounding (9.3). Furthermore, the team also ranks 16th in blocks (5.4) and 18th in second-chance points (15.3). That all adds up to what could be a long night for a Northwestern team that ranks 233rd in opponent second-chance points (11.8), 247th in total rebounding (33.6) and 288th in opponent offensive rebounding (10.2). \n\nBut the X factor in this one might just be Illinois’ ability to get to the charity stripe. \n\nThus far, the team ranks 28th in drawing fouls (20.6 per game). But not only that, the Illini makes good on those opportunities, ranking 4th in free-throw percentage (79.8%). That includes shooting 27-32 (84.3%) from the line over its last two games. Conversely, the Wildcats rank 229th in fouls committed (18.5). \n\nLook for Illinois to finally conquer its own personal House of Horrors and cruise by double-digits. \n\nBOL if tailing, and as always, please do so responsibly. One bet should not lead you to crash out all over Reddit.",

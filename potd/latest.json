Apologies for the late pick, I have a final exam tomorrow morning so been pretty busy.\n\n**Event**: Spain La Liga: Rayo Vallecano vs Real Betis 12:00pm PST\n\n**POTD**: Real Betis Draw no Bet (-120) 2u\n\n**Write up:**\n\nTo start I'll explain the reasoning as to why I chose this over double chance or a straight moneyline. I think Real Betis have been a very good team this year and haven't been getting props for it. With that being said, Vallecano are an annoying team that just scrape scrape scrape draws at home.\n\nAlthough they're 18th in the league at home, they've only lost 1 game, against Bilbao. They drew with Barcelona and Real Madrid at home, only scoring and conceding 4 goals in 6 games at home this season. This probably shows you why I'm so weary of betting the straight ML here. I definitely don't think Vallecano can win this game, but I do feel like they can scrape a draw somehow. The double chance for Betis is -250 making it pretty bad value, so I like the DnB for the push in case they draw. When talking about overall form, Vallecano are quite bad. They're 0-3-2 in their last 5 games, only scoring 1 goal and conceding 6. \n\nOn to Betis, they do have a few vital players out, but as shown in their away game at Zagreb midweek, these losses aren't huge for them. Betis are undefeated away this season, also enjoying drawing games. They're 2-5-0 away this season in La Liga, and have a goal difference of +3. Betis have been flying recently, getting a great away win 1-3 at Zagreb midweek, and coming off of a nice La Liga form besides the crazy 3-5 loss against Barcelona.\n\n**Long story short**: I think Betis win this game, but given both of these teams love a draw, I want the safety of the DnB.\n\nBOL!",

It’s so frustrating because quite literally everything indicates the play will win yet it’s simply not happening (yes I realise that’s what betting is all about). Carvalho didn’t even shoot in an awful showing by Estoril who lost 4-0, meanwhile the left winger had 3 SOT’s. To make matters worse he was hooked off in the 63rd minute to mark his first substitution since August. The fact my plays are purely statistically driven makes it easy for me to keep posting but it sure is infuriating which I really hope to turn around. I’ve turned to the dark side with a parlay, if done right they can be profitable.\n\nLeg 1 - Liam Thompson 1+ tackle vs Sheffield Wednesday\n\nThompson missed over 2 months of football with a knee injury and has been eased back into the lineup. He is predicted to start (and should be playing most of the match after he managed to play 85” last game). In his short season he’s averaged 1.25 tackles per game, clearing the line in all four games. If we go back to his last 18 Championship matches which is a more accurate representation of what to expect he’s covered the line in 18/18, averaging 1.47 tackles per match and clearing the line in 10/11 away matches. Sheffield United allow 3.4% more tackles than league average and players playing in Thompson’s position have averaged 1.8 tackles per game at the Hillsborough (covering in 9/10).\n\nLeg 2 - Jesus Rodriguez 1+ SOT vs Tondela\n\nRodriguez is leading the line for Nacional and has averaged 1.54 shots on target this season, hitting one in 11/13 (85%) games and in his last 8 matches. When playing at home, he averages 1.67 and has cleared the line in 5/6. Tondela allow 41% more SOTs than league average which is a lot and a huge boost to Jesus’ chances of shooting on target. They’ve conceded 1.29 shots on target to strikers away from home, the line having been covered in 5/7.\n\nNote: on the off-chance that Thompson and Rodriguez don’t start, choose a book that voids the pick. It could save you a lot of money. BOL !\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f6j1eik4w97g1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f73cfcd0dbb66cc39e3116d7f79482d7bd6074a2",

Surprisingly he hasn’t been as involved in the passing game for the last couple of games. I think that turns around tonight. The colder weather makes me think we get more short throws this week for Tua, which is right in Achane’s area of the field. And it seems like he’s guaranteed for a big breakout run. And of course, TJ Watt being out is a big deal for Pittsburgh’s defense. The total is at 42.5 right now, but I could see it being a bit higher than that. \n\nGood luck!",

Boosted by an extraordinary Europa League comeback against Feyenoord, Elias Charalambous and Mihai Pintilii are expected to set FCSB up aggressively, pushing their full-backs high and sustaining pressure in the final third to capitalise on their momentum and close the gap to the play-off places. Despite ongoing injury concerns — with Bîrligea, Alibec and Dawa not fully fit and AFCON absences forcing defensive reshuffles — FCSB still rank first in the league for total shots, underlining their volume-based attacking approach that naturally generates corners. Olaru’s return further increases ball circulation and wing dominance, while Unirea Slobozia arrive in a deep crisis, eight straight defeats, a struggling goalkeeper situation with Rusu still injured, and a clear mental block admitted by coach Jean Vlădoiu. Expect the hosts to defend very deep in a low block to stop the bleeding, inviting sustained FCSB pressure, repeated wide deliveries and recycled attacks — a game state that strongly favours FCSB consistently winning corners and clearing the +5.5 line.",

Unfortunately, I think Maye would've cashed for us if Henderson didn't break those two long runs. Shai two nights ago sat the first 6 minutes of the 4th quarter when he only needed 7 more points for the cash. It's a part of the game, key thing here is to stick with the model, and keep going... loses are going to happen, but it's the long game that we want! Let's get back on track here with our boy Achane.\n\n• ⁠Model has this hitting at a nice 59% on the dot\n\n• ⁠Model likes the under in the game, which shadows the slow pace, rushing heavy offense\n\n• Model shows that Miami may elect to run the ball on some fourth downs instead of kicking FG's because of the weather in Pittsburgh which should give Achane a few more opportunities \n\nNeed to see one go through the basket, so let's roll Achane. Good luck, and again, tail with some caution, the model has hit a small cold streak - will be diving into the model to tweak some things during the game tomorrow - may be going back to the 2-leg parlays that were money for us and put more of a heavier focus on those moving forward.\n\nBOL!\n\n**POTD: NFL De'Von Achane Over 16.5 Rushing Attempts -131 (2.50$ TO WIN 1.90$)**\n\nTips are greatly appreciated.

I stumbled upon this competition yesterday. I have no idea why they play it now, especially when competitions are still being played in their leagues, thus going for other sports too.\n\nI already played the Philippines against Malaysia in the first round. They won by 25 and barely covered the spread by 1 one point, but they did it. Now Malaysia already played the first round game with Vietnam, they won 89-63.\n\nSo Malaysia entered the game with the Philippines with some boosted confidence with this big win behind them, and the Philippines just got to Thailand, still adjusting.\n\nAnd they won easily by 25. And now they face a team that lost by 26 to the team they have beaten.\n\nI know this is an oversimplification, but sometimes you don't need to analyze stuff too hard.\n\nThis spread seems to be set too low, I would think twice if it was between 45-50, but this looks really doable. 1.5 units on this one.",

      "text": "POTD Record: 29-14 (+18U)\n\nLast Pick: Ravens +5.5 (alt line)/ over 44.5 (alt line) 2 leg parlay (-120) (1U) 🙅‍♂️\n\nShould’ve just went with ravens -2.5. Not too happy with the way the streak ended I felt like there were better options. Got a little too cute with that 💩 That’s on me guys. Let’s get back on track!😤\n\nEvent: Kings @ Stars (NHL) (7pm central)\n\nPOTD: SGP Kings +1.5/Under 5.5 goals (+140) (1U)\n\nWrite up:\n\nUnder 5.5:\n\nThe stars are coming off two losses in a row in which they lost 4-0 and 5-2. However 3 of those 9 goals allowed were empty netters. I believe back at home in Dallas the stars will look to get back to their old ways and that requires locking down on defense. However over their last 3 games the stars haven’t crossed the 20 mark on shots on goal. The kings are coming into town riding a two game losing streak themselves allowing 5 total goals over that span. This matchup sets up beautifully for an under. Over their last 10 games, the kings have the 6th worst goals scored per 60 mins at only 1.94 and the stars are a little bit better at 2.34 goals for per 60, however whe we dig deeper the stars have the 3rd worst expected goals for per 60 over this same period. The kings are 1st in the nhl over this last 10 game period allowing just .97 goals for per 60! While the stars are worse but still only allowing 2.2 goals for per 60 over this same period. The expected stats remain the same there as the kings are performing exactly how they should on defense which goes to show this defense is legit! Both teams are bottom 5 in the NHL in shots on goal over their last 10 and both are middle of the pack at 13th and 15th in shots on goal allowed. As far as high danger shots allowed, the kings are on fire allowing just 10 high danger shots on goal over their last 10 while the stars have allowed 21 which is double the kings number but still the 8th best mark in hockey over their last 10 games. (I like to use 10 game span because in long seasons like this it is best to go off how teams are playing at the moment). \n\n\nKings +1.5:\n\nAs I mentioned that the stars have averaged 2.34 goals for per 60 which is good for 15th best in the league so just mediocre in their last 10 but are really expected to score the 3rd worst mark in the league. This is due to the fact that the stars haven’t put up a lot of shots on goal recently (worst in the entire league in their last 10 games) and yes they have been shooting well (10th best in the league in shots on goal shooting percentage) this will be SIGNIFICANTLY harder against a kings team with the number 1 save percentage on shots on goal over their last 10 at a staggering 96%! In a game in which I expect to be low scoring already, I think that’s the kings +1.5 bolsters our payout but on top of that I wouldn’t be surprised at all if the kings come out of here with a win. After all these same two teams met on October 23rd in Dallas and the kings won 3-2. And the stars are in a bit more of a slump now than they were then. \n\nLet’s get back to our winning ways. As always, cheers 🍻",

      "text": "__POTD Record:__ 64-30-1 (+76.25u)\n\n__Previous Pick:__ [✅ Nico Collins o73.5 receiving yards (-115), 3.45u](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/s/Guwlxr3xeY)\n\n__Event:__ NFL: Dolphins @ Steelers 8:15pm EST\n\n__POTD:__ De’Von Achane o78.5 rushing yards (-110), 4.12u to win 3.75u\n\n__Write Up:__ The (6-7) Miami Dolphins are traveling to Pittsburgh to take on the (7-6) Steelers on Monday Night Football in an AFC matchup. The AFC North leading Steelers started the season off 4-1 and looked like one of the AFC’s top contenders. But then they went on to lose 5 of their next 7 games, with some fans calling for head coach Mike Tomlin’s head. He responded last week with a huge 27-22 road win over the Ravens that gave the Steelers a 1 game lead in their division. Steelers QB Aaron Rodgers threw for a season high 284 yards & a TD, with 5 completions of 25+ yards. __Bad news struck the Steelers this week though as they will be without their star player on defense, 7 time Pro Bowl linebacker T.J. Watt, after he underwent surgery to repair a collapsed lung this week.__ This is a huge game for Pittsburgh, with a win they have a 72% chance to make playoffs, but a loss knocks them down to 54%. They’ll have their hands full with a team that is coming in hot. Miami fell to 2-7 after a 28-6 loss to the Ravens in Week 9, & it looked like not only was their season done, but also their time with head coach Mike McDaniel & QB Tua Turnindaballova. Both were on the hot seat. The Dolphins responded with a stunning 30-13 win over the Super Bowl contending Bills in Week 10. They’re now on a 4 game win streak & have a tiny chance at making playoffs. Miami's win streak is the franchise's longest since 2022. Their success has came from an elite running back that hasn’t been able to be stopped.\n\nMike McDaniel found the recipe for success for the Dolphins: De’Von Achane. __The Dolphins are 5-1 this season when De’Von Achane runs for at least 85 yards. They are 1-6 when he rushes for fewer than 85 yards.__ So McDaniel has continued to feed the hell out of him & tge entire offense’s focus has been shifted to the run. This focus on the run was evident in last week’s 34-10 win vs the Jets, where Miami rushed for season highs of 239 yards & 3 TD’s on 41 carries. Look at the differences between their rushing in recent games vs earlier season games.\n\nWeeks 1-9: 21.9 carries per game, 97.2 rushing yards per game, 4.44 yards per carry, 35.6 rush success rate, 4 rushing TD’s, 2-7 record\n\nWeeks 10-14: 34 carries per game, 192.3 rushing yards per game, 5.65 yards per carry, 48.4% run success rate, 7 rushing td’s, 4-0 team record \n\n__The Dolphins 48.4% rushing success rate over the last 4 games is higher than any team’s season long success rate, run or pass. \nDolphins have run for at least 160 each of past 4 games (first time since 1977).__ That success stems from Achane being a cheat code on the field. He is one of the most explosive backs in the league. __Achane has ran for 92+ yards in 4 straight games, including 120+ in three of those. Since Week 9, Achane leads the NFL with 147 scrimmage yards per game. Achane ranks 1st in the league with 5.8 yards per carry & 4.4 yards after contact. With his recent surge, Achane achieved his first 1,000 yard rushing season & has averaged 5.68 yards per carry over his 41 career games. The only player with a higher rushing average through 41 games is Lamar Jackson (5.81, minimum 10 rushes per game). Over his last 4 games he has rushed for 7.2 yards per carry. He has a run of 10 or more yards on 18.1% of his attempts. No back with as many runs as he has a higher rate. Miami has 32 runs of 10 or more yards since Week 8, the most in the league.__ Now he faces a Steelers defense that has had issues with explosive backs lately. Pittsburgh allowed Chase Brown to average 9.8 & 5.5 yards per carry in his 2 games, Kimani Vidal to rush for 95 yards & a TD, James Cook & Ray Davis to combine for 206 rushing yards in Week 13, & Derrick Henry & Keaton Mitchell to combine for 172 yards on Sunday. They have been a run funnel defense doing well vs the pass. __Pittsburgh has not allowed an opposing passer to reach 7.0 yards per pass attempt in a game since Week 8. Which fits the Dolphins run scheme well since Tua has thrown the ball 26 times or less in 6 of his last 7 games. Only 48.7% of Miami's yardage over their last 5 games has been via passing, the only team below 50% over that span.__ Also the weather is a huge factor in this one. The Dolphins have historically had trouble playing in the cold & the kickoff temperature on Monday is forecasted to be below 20 degrees Fahrenheit. Dating back to 2016, Miami is 0-13 when the kickoff temperature is below 40 degrees (including postseason). Tua is specifically bad. He is 0-5 in his NFL career when the kickoff temp is below 40 degrees. He has 6 TD passes & 5 INT’s in those games with a passer rating of just 78.8. The Dolphins lost those games by an average of 19.2 points. It also helps that the Steelers have allowed opponents to run 69 plays per game, most in the league. This should provide plenty of opportunities for Achane. In the Week 14 win over the Jets, Achane suffered a rib injury and did not return. Dolphins OC Frank Smith said De'Von Achane \"looked great\" in practice & nothing should hold him back this week. Achane was taken off the injury report & was deemed a full go this week. On top of TJ Watt, Steelers could also be without 1st round rookie DT Derrick Harmon who has missed the last 2 games with a knee injury & is questionable for Monday night. Also the Dolphins defense has stepped up lately. Miami has allowed 1.59 points per drive over their past 8 games, 4th in the league. They could keep this one competitive. Regardless of the score, the Dolphins are going to feed Achane as he is their whole offense.\n\nTua Turnindaballova is bad. Achane is good. TJ Watt is out. All signs point to Achane going for 100+ again.\n\n__De’Von Achane o78.5 rushing yards__\n\nAppreciate the love!

Bit of a sweat, but the game played out more or less as expected and the big Norwegian came through for us again. Great way to end the weekend! \n\nToday we head north to Manchester as 8th place Man U host 15th place Bournemouth. The middle of the table is jam packed this year, as only 5 points separate these teams. A win for Man U puts them back in the top 5 and a win for Bournemouth puts them up to 11th. Man United have really turned it on over the last few weeks, they've only lost once in their last 9 matches, going 5-3-1 in that stretch. Bournemouth are trending the opposite direction, winless in their last 6 going 0-2-4. I'm expecting Man United to control possession here, take a lot of shots, and score a lot of goals.\n\nBruno Fernandes is the captain for Man U, takes their penalties, takes their free kicks, and takes corners from the left side. He's their playmaker. He leads the PL in assists this season with 6. He has really turned it on over the last few games, with 5 goals/assists in his last 3 matches and 7 in his last 6. The fact that this is even money with his (and his team's) current form seems like a steal to me. \n\nBournemouth as I mentioned is in poor form all around, but especially defensively. They have conceded at least 3 goals in each of their last 4 away matches to Sunderland, Villa, City, and Palace. Yes, you read that right. I like Man United to continue that unfortunate trend for Bournemouth here and think Bruno will be in the middle of the action as usual. \n\nBOL and I hope you all have a great start to the week!",

      "text": "💎POTD: Winnipeg Jets ML\nOdds: -128 on FanDuel\nWager: 1.5 Units\n\n⭐️Had a GREAT CALL ON BILLS ML last POTD by the way❗️)\n\nRecord: 5-3\nNet Units: + 1.90 ✅\n\n🏒NHl, Senators at Jets, 12/15/25 Mon, 7:30 pm Eastern Time\n\nExplanation: I favor Winnipeg because against the Senators, they have the advantage in the two areas that usually decide one-goal NHL games: 1) goaltending stability and 2) penalty-kill leverage.\n\nOffensively, both teams are averaging 3.06 goals per game, but Ottawa has been weaker defensively (they’ve allowed 102 goals in 31 games, a -7 differential and a team .872 SV%) compared to Winnipeg sitting basically even in goals for/against (95–95) with a better team save profile.   The special-teams gap is where Winnipeg can really separate: Ottawa’s power play is strong (26.3%), but their penalty kill has been a major problem (69.8%), which is the kind of weakness that gets punished against a competent PP like Winnipeg’s (20.9%)—one or two extra conversions can flip a 3–3 type of game into a Jets win. \n\nIn net, if the projected starters are Connor Hellebuyck vs Linus Ullmark, I think Winnipeg has the edge. Hellebuyck’s numbers are much stronger (.916 SV%, 2.41 GAA) than Ullmark’s this season (.877 SV%, 3.05 GAA)—and Winnipeg just got a great boost with Hellebuyck returning and looking sharp in a 5–1 win over Washington on Saturday. Conversely, Ottawa has dropped four of its last five (including a tough late loss to Minnesota), and the Jets’ path is pretty straightforward: play a disciplined game to reduce Ottawa’s PP impact, lean on the better goaltending, and let the Senators’ weak PK give Winnipeg the best chance to grab the “extra” goal that decides it.",

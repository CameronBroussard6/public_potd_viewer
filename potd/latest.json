In the last 10 meetings between these two teams, the under in 7-3. We are seeing reverse line movement as well. The line opened at 234.5 ➡️ 225 currently despite heavy public bet percentage on the over 👀RJ Barrett is out and the Raptors best player, Scottie Barnes is listed as questionable with an illness. The line was already trending downwards on the under before Barnes was listed as questionable early this morning. Toronto is ranking 18th in offensive efficiency and if Barnes doesn’t go, it should impact an already below average offense. The Wizards are bottom of the league, ranking 27th in offensive efficiency🤮As for defense, Toronto are 4th in defensive efficiency which should cause problems for a weak Wizards team. The Wizards are last in defensive efficiency but again, with a below average Raptors offense that’s dealing with injuries should help  the Wizards defensively in this game. Some other trends, Toronto are on a 6 game under streak and Washington have gone under in 4 of their past 5 games. With that being said, let’s expect this game to stay below 233 total points. BOL to those tailing 👊\n\n👇\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lgvdpbbqdl9g1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ba35dd030e3179a389b76cde4fbcab446ed816bf",

Trae Young has been getting many assists since his return from injury, with 10 9 and 15. Both teams play fast and we have a high total with low blowout risk. Trae should continue his recent form in this game. Deni has become the PG for POR after Jrue went down. Over this in 5 of L6. In what should be a tight game against LAC, Deni should continue form. LAC is missing Zubac, which can provide more opportunities for assists to players in the paint. \n\nIf you’ve been appreciating and tailing my picks, tips are greatly appreciated! [https://buymeacoffee.com/emupicks](https://buymeacoffee.com/emupicks)",

Cheers Ant!\n\nTrae Young gets a top tier matchup against the Heat and has looked really good since returning dropping 15, 9 & 10 assists. Well known about the pace Heat plays with by now and his minutes are ramping up having 31 minutes most recently. With those minutes last game he had 15 assists and a whopping 25 potentials meaning we’d need less than half of those potentials to get converted to cash.\n\nFast pace & more possessions should lead to more potentials for Trae here and with the upside of seeing more minutes this game. Davion will guard Trae tight so definitely seeing Trae keep dishing in this one.\n\nTrae has had a DD in 5/L6 against the Heat so definitely a matchup he’s done great against previously aswell. Heat is top 5 in assists allowed to PG’s this season.\n\nLove this game for Trae, would just run 10+ assists if the odds aren’t better on him to get a DD in your book.",

Props to the mammoth for keeping up. i had another pick that day with Rangers ML and going under 6.5 goals (vs wsh), but that game went into complete blowout. Boths teams didn't have finishers and that matchup provided 2 of the leaugues best golies. Anyhow:  \n\n**Today's Events:** WJC - DEN vs FIN 3:30PM ET & USA VS GER 6:00PM ET 🏒\n\n**Pick:** FIN -4.5 & USA -4.5\n\n**Odds:** 2.3 | +130 | 2units to win 2.6\n\n**Write up**: Bet1 - we just watched denmark get absolutely dismantled by canada. 13:2. Their goalies looked like they were trying to catch smoke with their bare hands. They gave up 50 shots. Now they have to turn around a couple of days later and face fins. This is a finland team that just lost to USA. their power play was embarrassed (0-for-5), and they have a point to prove. They aren't going to take it easy. They need to get their mojo back before the real games start. And then we look atthe net. Finland has Rimpinen, literally the best goalie in the tourney. I think Fin is getting a shutout. Fins are going up against a defense that just gave up 13. Emil Hemming and the boys are going to treat this like a shooting gallery. The Danes are tired, their confidence is shattered, and their goalie can't stop a beach ball right now.\n\n  \nBet2 - The USA just absolutely dismantled this same german team 8:0 in the pre tournament literally five days ago. We aren't just looking at one lucky game either. the trend here is massive blowouts. In last years opener, the USA hung a 10 goaler on them (10:4), and the year before that it was 11:1. The americans essentially treat this matchup like a track meet to pad their stats before the medal round, and with the game being played on NHL sized ice in minny, the usa speed advantage is going to be even more lethal against germans slower defense. sure the germans is starting their better goalie (Vieillard) this time, but he's going to face 40+ shots. Getting the line at -4.5 gives you a nice cushion just in case germany sneaks in a garbage goal or two, but all the data points to the usa winning this by at least 6 or 7.\n\nGood luck to all bettors today!",

He had an opportunity for a TD, but it was under thrown and broken up by the corner.\n\nLeague: EPL\n\nTime: 3:00 PM EST\n\nGame: Newcastle United @ Manchester United \n\nPOTD: Newcastle United Tie No Bet (-108)\n\nUnits: 3.0\n\nExplanation: Disclaimer, I’m a Manchester United, and I don’t feel confident heading into this game. United is missing key players to AFCON (Amad, Mazraoui, Mbeumo) and injury (Fernandes, De Ligt, Macguire), making the line up especially vulnerable to goals. The back line didn’t have a great game vs. Villa last weekend, and Dalot and Ugarte (both of which will likely start this afternoon) struggled as well. Their attacking options will be further constrained by the loss of Fernandes and the use of Sesko, who has arguably been out of form so far this season. \n\nNewcastle is also missing some pieces — especially in defense — to injury (Burn, Lascelles, Trippier, Botman, Livramento), but put a decent performance together last weekend home vs. Chelsea. I expect Manchester United to struggle with Newcastle’s currently stronger midfield and attack. \n\nI don’t have enough confidence in either side to pick a winner, but I think selecting Newcastle Tie No Bet at -108 is a safe option all things considered.\n\nBest of luck!",

      "text": "Record: 0-0\n\nNet Units: 0\n\nROI: 0\n\n**Event:** English Championship (Soccer) - Coventry vs Swansea (15:00 GMT) / (2 hours from posting)\n\n**Pick:** Coventry win + over 1.5 goals @ 1.75 (1 unit)\n\n**Write Up:** Hey all, and happy Boxing Day. Hope everyone had a great Christmas yesterday. This is my first time posting, although I’ve been lurking here for a while, so let’s see how it goes. Quick note before we start: every pick I post will be for 1 unit, with the occasional 2‑unit play only when I’m extremely confident. Personally, I don’t see the value in going higher if your unit sizing is right, but of course that’s up to you.\n\nToday’s match takes us to the CBS Arena, where league leaders Coventry host 19th‑placed Swansea City. Coventry have been outstanding this season under Frank Lampard, already **scoring 53 goals** — and it’s only Christmas. For context, the next closest side is **3rd‑placed Ipswich with 38.**\n\nCoventry have hit a slight dip recently, collecting just **5 points from their last four league matches**. Even so, they’ve **only lost once in that stretch**, bringing their total to just **two defeats in 22 games**. That loss came away to 3rd‑placed Ipswich, hardly a disastrous result. They drew 2 against **Preston (5th), and Southampton (11th)** — the latter played mostly with 10 men after a red card and won 1 against **9th place Bristol City**\n\nThe biggest factor behind today’s pick, though, is Coventry’s home form. They’re unbeaten at the CBS Arena this season, turning it into a complete fortress. They’ve **won 8 and drawn 2 at home, scoring 26 and conceding only 7.** They’re also the league’s best away side, but if we’re nitpicking, their 3-0 loss to Ipswich last month did come on the road.\n\nStatistically, Coventry average **2.41 goals per game this season, rising to 2.6 at home**. Defensively, they’re the second‑best unit in the league, **conceding 1.05 per game overall and just 0.70 at home.** They’ll be without Jay DaSilva after his red card, but three first‑team players return after missing the Southampton match through illness.\n\nNow to Swansea. After finishing 11th last season, they find themselves down in 19th — not quite in the relegation scrap, but far from the playoff picture. Since appointing Vítor Matos at the end of November, they’ve improved noticeably, **winning 3 of their last 4 after losing the previous 5**. However, their away form remains a major concern. Their only defeat under Matos came away at Stoke (8th), and overall this season they’ve played **10 away matches, losing 6, winning 2, and drawing 2**, with a goal difference of **9 scored and 14 conceded.**\n\nSwansea score an average of **1.09 goals per game** this season, dropping to **0.90 away from home**. Defensively, they concede **1.36 per match overall**, rising slightly to **1.40 on the road**.\n\nAll things considered, Swansea do look improved under Matos, and this won’t be the walkover it might have been a month ago but Coventry’s dominant home form combined with Swansea’s struggles away should give the league leaders the edge on Boxing Day. As for the over 1.5 goals, the numbers speak for themselves backed further by the fact that **82% of Coventry’s matches** and **73% of Swansea’s** have gone over that line, and that trend hasn’t changed under the new manager.\n\nI expect Swansea to make this competitive, but Coventry’s attacking quality should still see them through with something like a 2-1 or 3-1 win at the CBS Arena to extend their lead at the top of the table to 9 points.\n\nFeel free to drop any thoughts or suggestions — like I said, first time doing this. Enjoy the rest of your Boxing Day, and best of luck if you’re tailing.\n\n*Edit: Updated recent form as Coventry beat Bristol City which I originally wrote they drew.*",

With **Cory Joseph out**, their guard rotation becomes shorter and more ball-dominant through **Mike James and Okobo**, which usually slows the game down and leads to longer possessions rather than early offense.\n\nReal Madrid, on the other hand, are a team that clearly reduce tempo on the road. They prioritize defensive balance, limit transition opportunities and are comfortable playing through structured half-court sets. Against Monaco’s physical perimeter defense and switching schemes, easy points should be limited.\n\nFrom a matchup standpoint, there is a lot of defensive versatility on the floor: Diallo, Blossomgame and Theis for Monaco, and strong positional defenders on Madrid’s side. This usually translates into contested shots, fewer fast breaks and a game decided more by execution than rhythm.\n\nThe total at **174.5** feels a bit inflated for a game where both teams are likely to control pace, especially in the second half. Barring an unusually hot shooting night from both sides, this sets up well for an **under**.",

If you've been diligently fading me, congrats, you're probably a millionaire now. Guess I should've paid more attention to the H2H in that last game, but I think the Christmas miracle just wasn't meant to be. Inversely, I'm pretty sure that had I bet on under 8.5 goals, they would've found a way to score 9, bonus points if half of them would've come past the 80th minute. Anyway, moving on to the competition that I still haven't managed to tame (the AFCON), but I'm determined to change that with my next, well-researched pick. Let's get it done*\n\n**Last Five:** ❌❌❌❌❌\n\n**Event:** AFCON, Angola v Zimbabwe, 7:30 am EST\n\n**POTD:** Zimbabwe Win or Draw + Under 3.5 goals +130, 4 units\n\n**Write Up:** Despite both Angola and Zimbabwe losing their opening AFCON group stage fixtures - Angola narrowly went down 2-1 to South Africa while Zimbabwe were dramatically beaten 2-1 by paper favorites Egypt - there are solid enough reasons to back **Zimbabwe to avoid defeat today**. Angola’s AFCON history shows they’ve **only won one of their 10 opening games** at the tournament and have often dropped points in their second fixture after an initial loss, with draws in 1996 and 2006 following opening defeats. Meanwhile, **Zimbabwe have historically absolutely held their own against Angola**, and the overall **H2H is well balanced,** with both teams winning **eight times apiece and registering three draws** across their numerous encounters.\n\nZimbabwe’s squad is certainly not noticeably weaker than that of Angola, and it carries momentum from the recent goalscoring form, including **Prince Dube**, who scored a silky goal against Egypt, and they’ve shown they can score in successive matches. Angola are missing striker **Zini** through injury, which could blunt their attack and give Zimbabwe a tactical edge. Add to that Angola’s inconsistent form and Zimbabwe’s resilience in tight games, and a **Zimbabwe win or draw** looks like a sensible, value-backed prediction for this crucial AFCON group game. There's also the possibility of neither team wanting to risk it ahead of the important Egypt - South Africa clash, thus making the draw even more likely (works for us). I'm certainly loving this pick and **pairing it with an Under 3.5 match goals** leg (I'm very positive this will be a **low scoring affair,** *personally feeling a 1-1 or a 2-1 Zimbabwe masterclass).* They've **nearly stunned Egypt,** so why can't they take it a step further? Exactly, there's no reason they can't. I've spent hours researching the underlying data behind this pick, so I'm feeling very confident that it's gonna hit and finally release me out of the shackles of the horror run that I'm having atm - staking 4 units on this. Covering two outcomes and sprinkling an Under feels like great value for these odds, and the more I look at it, the better I feel about this. I don't mind the BTTS Yes pick either, but I've gone with the outlined POTD in the end. BOL whether you tail or fade, let's have some fun and hopefully make some money together ☘️",

Oddly enough there's only one match today, but it's bound to be an entertaining one as 7th place Man United hosting 11th place Newcastle. This is an important match as both teams are vying for spots in European football next season. \n\nManchester United has been a mixed bag this year. They score a lot of goals and concede a lot of goals, in fact they have the highest # of total goals per match in the EPL. They are currently missing a ton of players, including their leading Goalscorer and leader of assist with Mbuemo,  Bruno Fernandes, and Amad all out due to AFCON/injury. They're going to be looking for creativity and Cunha looks tocbe the guy to try to fill those shoes. \n\nCunha has been on a year lately, after some injuryy struggles early in the season. In his last 3 games, he has really turned it on. In these last 3 matches, he has averaged 7.3 shots/game, 2.7 SOTs per game, and scored 2 goals. With Bruno now out, I see him getting even more of the ball and taking more shots. The books currently have his as Man U's most probable Goalscorer, most probable shot taker, but behind Sesko and Zirkee in probable SOTs. I think this line is mispriced based on these trends, but we will certainly take it. \n\nNewcastle is a decent team defensively, but play much better at home than on the road. They have not had a lot of tough road tests this season, but notably they conceded 7 SOTs on 15 shots away at Brentford, 9 SOTs on 15 shots away at West Ham (who only had 38% possession). Predicting a lot of shots and goals here - love this line in this spot. \n\nBOL and hope you all had a great Christmas!",

Angola are clearly the better side and should control this game from start to finish. They’re more organized, better in midfield, and don’t need chaos to win.\n\n\nZimbabwe will sit back and defend deep, but they don’t have enough quality going forward to really threaten for 90 minutes. Angola aren’t a high-tempo, high-scoring team anyway they’re happy to score, manage the game, and close it out.",

They run a balanced offense and their run defense is much improved over the season, only allowing 113.4 rushing yards per game, and that’s good in this matchup since Minnesota’s run game is struggling barely topping 100 rushing yards per game. \n\nNew Mexico is hot on 6 game winning streak and set a school record of 484.5 total yards per game. I foresee and conclude too many things that can go right for New Mexico , and too many things that can go wrong for Minnesota.",

      "text": "Record: 34-14\n\nInternational Hockey U20 - World Junior Championship\n\nPick: USA vs. Germany | USA -5.5 (-110)\n\nTime: 6:00pm EST\n\nWhat’s going on everyone, I'm back again for my favorite week and a half of the year. If anybody's been around, we’ve been on a roll the past few years and looking to continue with more of the same. It’s a pretty even split this year as far as the playing field goes. A clear top 5, a Slovakia team that can be a little scrappy and the last 4 fighting to stay out of relegation.\n\nWith that being said, we’re going to start the slate off with the US covering against the Germans. The Americans have the Germans number in this tournament, routinely dominating them year in and year out. The US didn’t bring a gold favorite to the tournament like last year, but they should still comfortably fight for a medal. The Germans on the other hand will be fighting to stay in the top division for another year.\n\nWe only have a few pretournament games to go off of for both teams, but luckily for us they already played eachother 4 days ago, with the Americans winning by 8. Germany did start their backup in this game, but it wouldn't have mattered much. USA also sat a few of their returnees to get some looks at depth players before the final round of cuts. Expect a pretty big mismatch between a gold medal hopeful and a team trying to just stay afloat to start us off",

Under Kim Hellberg, Boro have climbed to second in the Championship thanks to consistent performances and an aggressive, possession-oriented tactical setup that sees them dominate games and control midfield play — a philosophy Hellberg has publicly praised for its intensity and control in recent press comments after big wins like the 4-1 rout of Hull. At home they are particularly dangerous, with seven wins in ten league matches this season and a habit of starting games strongly, making them favorites in front of their supporters. Injuries to Lenihan and Fry are a concern, but Boro’s defensive reinforcements and creative balance — including form attackers Strelec and Conway — mean they have more depth than struggling Blackburn. Conversely, Blackburn’s squad is stretched with key absences including potential issue with Gudjohnsen and other regulars, and coach Valérien Ismaël has recently admitted attitude issues in training, undermining consistency and preparation. With Boro’s clear motivation to consolidate an automatic promotion spot and Blackburn still fighting just to climb away from the bottom, the hosts have both the tactical edge and psychological incentive to take all three points.",

Ending 0-0.\n\n\nToday's pick:\n \nPremier League \n\nManchester United Vs Newcastle \n\nMatheus Chuna 2 or more shots on target.\n\n(2.10) 2.5 units \n\nBoth teams come into this game with a good portion of missing players, United missing some key attackers, Newcastle missing a lot of key players in defense.\n\nWith so many players on international duty or out with injuries, Chuna should get the full 90 minutes here to find these shots on target. He's been in good form as of late coming back from an injury, 2 goals and an assist in his last 3 games.\n\nShot wise his breakdown is as followed for the past few games.\n\nAston villa away: **6 shots 3 on target**\n\nBournemouth at home: **8 shots 3 on target**\n\nWolves away **8 shots 2 on target**\n\nNewcastle are also a team that really struggles to perform well away from home , they average about 7 shots on target conceded away from home if you take out the derby game against Sunderland last away game, which was a hard watch, constant fouls as it was a fierce rivalry match,  which meant there was very few chances for either side.\n\nChuna is a very direct player, great at picking up the ball from deep and going on a run and getting shots away, he should again get plenty of shooting opportunities to cover this line again like he has been for the past few weeks and for the price were getting it's too good for me to pass up a bet on this.\n\n\n\n\n\n**BOL and only bet what you can afford to lose!**",

Threes are high-efficiency possessions. If even 3–4 of those don’t drop, this total probably lands in the low 140s.\n\n⸻\n\nToday’s Pick\n\nCollege Basketball | NCAA Men’s Basketball\nYale @ Harvard | Time: 6:30 PM ET\n\nPick: Full Game Under 142.5 \n\nOdds: -110 (FanDuel)\n\nWrite-Up: \n\nIt’s been a couple days, but I’m back. I took a couple of days off to reevaluate my model. \n\nI started off hot at 4-0, but then had to reevaluate after I went 2-5 over the last 7 games I selected. \n\nOne time I made a spread play, which was ill advised and out of fear because the under the previous game missed by so much (the irony is the under on the spread game would have hit). Another time a game went to OT which messed up the under. Another game went over because the team that plays suppressive defense also got hot shooting 3’s.\n\nSometimes games are going to miss, but I felt like a 2-5 stretch showed that there were something’s on my end I needed to work on. It made me take time to go over the model and modify it - which it essentially is another model entirely now. \n\nA lot of hours put in but I am happy with where it is and ready to start making picks again. \n\nThat was my Ted Talk. Now - to the game.\n\nIvy League teams often play back to backs on Friday-Saturday. That can help the under. \n\nYale and Harvard played earlier this year and totaled 132 points at Yale.\n\nBoth teams are comfortable in the half court. They’re not built on transition chaos or early-clock threes — they execute, work through sets, and make you defend for 20+ seconds. When you have two teams like that facing off, possessions naturally compress. Fewer trips = fewer scoring opportunities. That alone makes 142.5 feel a bit inflated unless efficiency spikes.\n\nThe other piece here is game flow. The spread is competitive, which lowers the risk of extended foul sequences late. Neither side profiles as a volatility-heavy offense that can randomly drop 15 points in three minutes off turnovers and runouts. If this stays within structure — which is the most likely outcome — this game projects more mid-130s than mid-140s.\n\nNothing flashy. Just two disciplined teams, controlled tempo, and a number that looks a little high relative to how this should actually play out.\n\nBest of luck!!\n\n⸻\n\nIf you find value in my analysis, contributions are appreciated: [https://cash.app/$KindlyQuantifying](https://cash.app/$KindlyQuantifying)",

Swindon Town is currently sitting 2nd in the table, hunting for automatic promotion and coming off a string of dominant performances. On the flip side, Shrewsbury is languishing in 21st, fighting for their lives just above the drop zone. While Shrewsbury just secured a vital win against Barrow, they are now stepping up several weight classes to face a Swindon side that has won 4 of their last 5 league matches.\n\nWe should see Shrewbury parking the bus to try to scrape a draw, but Swindon should prove to be too efficient for Shrewbury's liking. The race for promotion will likely give them that extra push, especially against a bottom-four side. ",

When they’re fully locked in, it’s game over.\n\n  \n\\- Even though Al Fateh SC have pulled off some surprises this season — including a draw against Al Ittihad Club - this feels like the moment for things to return to normal. Al-Nassr FC have more quality, more experience, and far greater attacking firepower. If they impose their tempo from the start, this one should be over before full time.    - Al-Nassr will likely try to control possession and press high as usual, using their offensive firepower to unlock Al Fateh’s defense. If Ronaldo and his teammates are sharp, Al-Nassr should close this fast, but the most important to close it until the final whistle.  \n\\- Al Nassr's winning streak says a lot, LET'S LOCK THIS IN .\n\nGOOD LUCK & LET'S GET IT.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nstm8cgtqgjg1.png?width=853&format=png&auto=webp&s=365aa2bebba6d91990bce3c19ddc6ad854b76f89\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n",

A team that is 2/2 with 1 push ATS vs ranked opponents. Clemson in the last two seasons has stayed within 13.5 points in 59/59 of their games….in ACC road games, they are 17/17. Hell, they even beat Duke last time they played. Dating back to last season, Clemson has won 14 straight road games. That is the longest active streak in the country,….but I don’t think they win here. It is never easy playing in Cameron Stadium, where the Devils remain undefeated.\n\nThis game is going to be a war. Two of the best teams in the ACC, and both rank top 10 in defense. Clemson ranks 21st in points per possession allowed, whereas Duke ranks 238th in possessions per game. Duke has been mediocre on the three this year, ranking 173rd in 3-point shooting % - Clemson ranks 36th in opponent 3-point shooting %. The strength of Duke's offense is inside the perimeter, ranking 4th in 2-point shooting %. However, Clemson ranks 14th in defending 2-point shots away from home. The Devils also have a slight turnover problem, while the Tigers take care of the ball.\n\nThis Clemson team is built to make elite teams uncomfortable. Everybody from Clemson can get buckets. I’m talking a consistent 10 points. It is hard for coaches to have a defensive game plan, since nobody is “that guy”. This team excels in set plays. They are not flashy - they are methodical. Clemson likes to get back and set up their half-court sets on defense. They make you work for every possession, every point. They value execution, pressure, controlling tempo, and defensive rebounding. In this type of matchup, there is no need to overthink it. Duke should win this game, but Clemson's style of play is going to force drawn-out possessions, where buckets will come at a premium. This game is going to be ugly, but I don’t think Clemson is going to be intimidated in this spot. Get ready for a classic ACC-style game that will be gritty and physical.

They average strong goal output, apply constant pressure through wide play and quick transitions, and generally overpower mid-table opposition. Bayern’s depth allows them to maintain intensity for 90 minutes, and historically they handle these types of fixtures with authority. When they click offensively, they’re very difficult to stop — making them one of the stronger favorites on the board. They are only 3 points ahead of Dortmund now, so there is no time to mess around. \n\nAl Nassr come into this matchup with clear attacking superiority and far more individual quality across the pitch. They typically dominate possession in domestic games and create a high volume of chances, especially against sides outside the top tier. With their firepower up front and overall squad depth, they rarely drop points in fixtures where they’re the stronger side on paper. If they control tempo early, this is the type of game they usually grind out professionally.\n\nBOL",

Leicester took the lead in the 9th minute, just four minutes later (13') they doubled their lead, while in the 29th minute it became 3-0. Southampton threatened during this period but failed to score. The second half started with a triple change for the \"Saints\" who took the ball and showed a desire to dominate. Stewart, who came on as a substitute, reduced the deficit in the 62nd minute, Stephens scored in the 83rd minute, Manning, who came on as a substitute, equalized in the 87th minute and Charles, who also came on as a substitute, completed the turnaround in the 90+6th minute.\n\n\"We have to enjoy what we have achieved. The season is so long and you don't have many nights like this. We will be well prepared to play a different first half and continue the second half like we did on Tuesday,\" said Eckert in his statements, who with his changes played a huge role in the turnaround. In the Championship they are in 9th place, just -1 from 6th place Wrexham and look ready to take the fight to the end. They have won four of their last five (4-1-0), while in the previous round of the cup they beat Doncaster 2-3 away from home.\n\nLast Tuesday, the two teams gave us the best game of the Championship season so far. The closing stages of the match found Southampton attacking and finding a victory capable of boosting their morale even more. Leicester's image is problematic, with many gaps and the cup, compared to the battle for relegation, garnering less interest.\n\nBol",

I don't regret the pick, remember, we are gambling, just invest into bonds if you want something safe. After two different 5+ win streaks, we're having a bit of a rough patch with 1W3L in my last 4 picks. That doesn't mean we stop, we keep going with picks we like.\n\n\n\nNow for today..\n\n\n\nPick: Zurich-Luzern BTTS&O2.5 @ 1.75\n\n\n\nWrite Up: Even though our last Switzerland BTTS&O2.5 didn't hit, I'm going to keep going because I usually make a good profit with Switzerland overs.\n\nToday, Zurich is hosting Luzern. Some stats:\n\nZurich at home has scored 22 and conceded 23 goals in 12 games. O2.5 has hit in last 6/7 Zurich matches and BTTS has hit in last 5/7. \n\nLuzern away has scored 18 and conceded 19 in 12 games. O2.5 has hit in last 8/10 and BTTS has hit in last 7/8. \n\nBTTS has hit in their last 5/5 H2H and their four H2H matches in 2025 went 3-2, 1-1, 3-2, 3-1. Both matches where Zurich was at home went 3-2. \n\nLet's get back on track - and for extras:\n\n**Safety angle:** you can get just O2.5 at 1.53. I'm adding a unit on that (plus a unit of course on my POTD).\n\n**Degen angle:** I'm going to do a few degen small-stake side bets. 0.25 units on O3.5 at 2.3 and 0.25 O4.5 at 3.96. 0.25 units for BTTS + O2.5 + U11.5 corners at 2.4, and 0.25 units for Luzern/draw + BTTS + O.25 + U11.5 corners + O 0.5 1h goals corners at 3.9.

I played D1 lacrosse so I'm going to stick strictly to that since it's a niche market where you can sometimes find a slight edge on the books.\n\nI sat out the first two weeks because I wanted to see how the new rosters actually look on the field before putting money down. I'm going to keep my write ups short. My picks usually come down to personnel turnover, conference match ups, and venue.\n\nFor the first pick I'm going Towson -160 for 3 units (I usually roll 1-5 scale).\n\nReasoning is pretty simple. Navy lost a ton of their core starters from last year. Towson is coming off a really close loss to Hopkins where they actually looked like the better team for most of the game. Their offense is built to hammer the cage and they're playing at home where they've historically been way better. I expect them to bounce back big today and outclass Navy's defense.\n\nGood luck if you're tailing and let’s see if we can get something going here.\n\nBIG WIN TO START‼️",

They consistently average around 1.7–2.0 goals per game in league play, and a large majority of their matches clear the 1.5 goal mark. In fact, over 80% of their recent league games have gone over 1.5 total goals. That alone covers half the bet in most scenarios, because even a 2–0 or 2–1 type of win gets it done.\n\nGrasshoppers, on the other hand, have struggled defensively away from home. They tend to concede more than a goal per match on the road, and their away games regularly see multiple goals. Even when they lose, it’s often by scorelines like 2–1 or 3–1, which still cash the over 1.5 portion comfortably. Defensively, they’ve had trouble containing higher-tempo sides, and St. Gallen play with that kind of attacking intensity.\n\nHead-to-head trends also support this angle. Recent meetings between these two have frequently produced at least two goals, and St. Gallen have had strong results in this matchup, including multi-goal wins. The 1.5 total is a relatively low bar, and given both teams’ scoring and conceding patterns, it’s statistically likely to be cleared.\n\nWhen you combine St. Gallen’s stronger form, better home performances, and higher goal output with Grasshoppers’ defensive inconsistency away, the probability leans toward a home win in a game that sees at least two total goals. Something like 2–0 or 2–1 feels like the most realistic outcome based on the data.\n\nBOL if tailing ",

Over the last 10 games, only 4 bigs have eclipsed this mark against the Phoenix and they all play in the post - Cooks, Froling, JLA, Mennenga. One look at that list and you can tell they have very different games to Deng who is more of a spot up shooter than an off the dribble player. Soares is the best comparison and he's gone 6 and 9 the last 2 games against the Phoenix.\n* Deng scores 30% of his points from behind the arc. The Phoenix dont allow a lot of 3PA to opposing big men and cover well when they do. Soares got up 1 attempt last game. Mennenga got up 1 attempt. Rob Loe got 4 attempts but only hit 1. Deng is going to have to be very effective from the field to cover this.\n* Deng has cleared this line against the Phoenix 2/3 games this year but they were very different Jackjumpers lineups. With Hamilton and Magnay out, the spacing won't be there and help coverage isnt required for Bannan if John Brown or Malique Lewis are guarding him.\n* He also had a lot of FT attempts in those games - 8 per game. The Phoenix gave up 30 FTA per game those 2 games. Their opponents average 27 on the season and over the last 5 games this has regressed to 24. They've cleaned up the defense and this should be emphasised today with their coach coming out and saying:\n\n*\"If you want to win a championship, it has to be at the defensive end and when we get stops and get out and run, we can beat anyone, but our defence has to be a focal point.\"*   \n  \nBOL",

They’re coming off a good win but even that ended up being very ugly. These last few weeks have been mean to them and Iowa is in an amazing spot here. Moving forward this game could put them in an incredible spot for March. And remember we don’t need a win, we just need a cover. Purdue is 2-8 in their last ten against the spread and yet 80+% of the money is on them.. Purdue’s struggled to find offense in a number of these past games and that’s a nightmare on the road. Especially when the opposing team has a battle tested veteran guard on the level of Bennett Stirtz. I just flat out don’t see Purdue blowing the top off this game unless they go ballistic from the 3 point line (knock on wood) so we’re gonna bet our money Iowa can lose by less than 3 points tomorrow.

It is what it is. \n\nPlay of the Day:  Kentucky vs Florida over 153.5 (-110 FD) 1U\n\nI like the over 153.5 in this matchup because the tempo and scoring profiles both point toward a high total. It’s not necessarily that either Kentucky or Florida plays bad defense, but both teams give up a lot of points largely because of how fast they play and how many possessions they create. The pace leads to more shots, more transition opportunities, and naturally higher scores on both ends. With each team averaging over 80 points per game, the baseline projection already flirts with this number. If this turns into the up-and-down game it projects to be, 153 is very attainable.\n\nGood luck to anyone tailing!",

Appreciate anyone who tailed - once again apologies about the late post.\n\nFirst up we have a fixture in the Six Nations rugby, we travel to Scotland where they host England at Murrayfield. My pick of -5.5 handicap for England comes from, despite their poor recent form in Edinburgh, England are coming off the back of a 48-7 win against Wales whilst Scotland enter off a 15-18 loss to Italy. Whilst these score lines are not indicative of the result watching both I do believe England posses better form (currently winning 13 fixtures in a row), better depth and kicking control which is pivotal in these kind of matchups. Scotland were weak in their lineouts and even with practice I do think England's quality in this area will give them problems a plenty just as Italy did; to slow down England's attack they need to neuter their offensive power, especially forwards, which will be difficult for the Scots. It must be said that Scotland have won 5/8 encounters with one draw, 3 of which are coming from Murrayfield - international fixtures in autumn tend to prove better results for this England team oddly enough. Simply put it will come down to depth and form, both of which England have an advantage. Original line is -8.5 but I have bought it down a little bit for a buffer, safe pick for me would be the ML.\n\nSecondly, we go to League One where Luton are winless in their last 6 away games going 0/1/5 (total record of 4-2-8), with the hosts Cardiff going 12-1-2(W/D/L) from 15 home games. Cardiff are unbeaten in 10, sitting nicely in 1st in the league and Luton sit 7th - but home/away forms are currently very important. The bluebirds only posses 2 points more than 2nd place Lincoln so they will be wanting to take all 3 away from this fixture. The reverse fixture ended in a win for Cardiff on the road, no overthinking here I reckon they take all 3 much important points from a poor travelling Luton side.\n\nBOL and always bet what you can afford to lose!",

In their last four competitive maps, these two teams have averaged **52.5 kills per map**. Their Bo1 during the group stage of this tournament on February 3rd was a bloodbath, ending with **56 total kills** in just 38 minutes.\n\nTo hit **Over 186.5**, at their current average of **\\~52 kills/map**, they only need the series to go **4 maps** (4 x 52 = 208) to clear this comfortably. If OG continues their giant-slaying form—they already beat Liquid 1-0 this tournament—it is highly unlikely Liquid finishes this in a 3-0 sweep. So we're basically betting OVER 3.5 maps again but with better value\n\n**Reasoning:** High historical kill average (52.5/map) + high probability of at least 4 maps + OG’s aggressive tournament form.\n\nUpdate: Unlucky, if OG made the comeback on Map 3… :( \n\nParlay option:  Team Liquid vs. OG  OVER 186.5 total kills + Navi vs Yandex (Player Watson over 4.5 kills map 1)  (@2.50)",

Today we've got another FA Cup match, this time as League One side Burton host Premier League side West Ham. As confusing as it is, League One is actually the 3rd tier division in English Soccer. Burton, is ranked 21st in that division, meaning there are 47 teams in the hierarchy between West Ham (18th in EPL) and Burton. That's a huge talent gap in soccer. Burton are both bottom 5 defensively and offensively in League One, and are winless in their last 5 matches. \n\nI get it, for those who follow the EPL, you'll note that West Ham is bad and be cautious to back them. They're neck deep in a relegation battle. However, they have won 3 of their last 5 and seem to have turned a corner the last few weeks. The team is clicking, and they'll see this match as a chance to continue to build momentum and maybe have a chance to make a deep cup run. They've brought in some attacking players during the January window and have genuinely looked good the last few matches (going up 2-0 away at Chelsea). So I really like the odds here given the talent gap on paper and form of both teams. Lets hope West Ham show up. \n\nBOL and hope everyone has a great weekend!",

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 15-40-5 *Finally, it feels like all the pain and bs I had to witness in my Barcelona fades lead to that moment! Barcelona were completely outclassed from the very first whistle and shipped 4 goals in the first half alone. The second half was a bit of a snoozefest, but Atletico had everything under control. I knew they'd do well, but I couldn't have imagined what would follow, not even in my wildest dreams. This was the third successful Barca fade and I feel like I'm finally starting to get the hang of this thing. Let's move on from this now though, as my record is still somehow even more horrific than that Barca first half performance. Still a lot of work left to be done if I'm to get anywhere near a positive record*\n\n**Last Five:** ❌❌❌✅✅\n\n**Event:** LaLiga, Real Madrid v Real Sociedad, 3:00 pm EST\n\n**POTD:** Real Sociedad Win or Draw, +200, 3 units\n\n**Write Up:** It seems like I've finally managed to tame Barcelona a bit (kinda), but my ambitions are loftier. I'm coming for the other Clasico side, Real Madrid. They're matched up against Real Sociedad, who, in case you forgot, **actually beat Barcelona earlier in the season.** How poetic would it be if they could get one over Real Madrid too? They certainly **have the squad to do it.** Not only that, but they're coming into this matchup in great form, remaining **unbeaten in the last 11 games, a run that includes 8 wins** in that span.\n\nReal Madrid are still very much finding their feet after a turbulent beginning to 2026, and I think they're definitely there for the taking. I absolutely love these odds as they're in the absolute upper limit of what's allowed in these threads, but after that Barca shocker, my confidence is sky high so yes, I'm putting down three whole units on a +200 odd play. I just see terrific value in these odds. Not expecting a high scoring game, so something like Under 2.5 goals sounds reasonable too, if you want to go down that route. Expecting a big game from Oyarzabal, who loves turning up against Barcelona and Real Madrid specifically. For those of you who are wondering about the fade, you can go with something like a Real Madrid -1.0 Asian Handicap or even a Real Madrid -1.0, -1.5 Asian Handicap for some decent odds (I think the Madrid divas are getting clapped though). BOL and let's enjoy some Valverde longshots ☘️🫡",

That means that FUT map pick is up first in this series as the odds also indicate\n* Both teams have a clear perma ban, Aurora ban Ancient, FUT ban Inferno, both teams also have EXTREMELY OBVIOUS map picks. FUT pick Mirage, Aurora pick Anubis, there is almost 0 chance we see either team swap their map pick off of these unless one team just randomly drops their perma ban\n\n**Mirage Stats:**\n\n* FUT are 89% winrate on 18 maps of Mirage in the L3 months, they are on a rampage run, I would argue maybe the best Mirage team in the world strategically, they have been running Mirage as their home map forever. They first pick this map in 70% of their games and for good reason. FUT dominance on Mirage as mentioned is not new, they went 51-20 on this map in 2025, an insane run of form\n* Aurora are 29% winrate on 7 maps of Mirage in the L3 months, they have heavily struggled on this map, this is their only map in the pool currently they are <50% winrate on.\n* FUT are on a 10 map winstreak on Mirage, and while for a while they were mostly farming tier two teams, recently they have been dominating tier one teams on the map as well. They have beaten Astralis, G2, FURIA, as well as some strong tier two teams on the map like OG, EYEBALLERS and BetBoom.\n* FUT are extremely well rounded on this map, they win 64% of pistol rounds, they average a 73.3% winrate on CT side/defense, and a 53.4% winrate on offense as well. In the last month despite a drop in pistol round win % down to 40%, they are 5-0 in this time including the win against FURIA where they won 13-11 despite losing both pistol rounds\n* Aurora struggles really started for them in October and to close out the year but a lot of their Mirage maps back then were still close, but in 2026 these struggles have been much worse then previous, they are not just losing Mirage but getting dominated by teams, they lost to FURIA 13-4, Falcons 13-10, PARIVISION 13-5, GamerLegion 13-5 in 2026 so far which is when they picked up Soulfly.\n* Aurora are 20% winrate in their last 5 mirage games, they have lost them by a total score of 59-37 winning just 39% of rounds overall. They have really struggled on CT side recently generating only 40.3% of rounds on this side in the new year, despite a 50% winrate on pistol rounds, their offense has always been shaky on Mirage going back 6 months, they average 42.1% winrate on T side over a 24 round sample, but in the past were able to win close maps due to their strong CT sides and often sneak win close maps, without good CT sides, they will never stand a chance against strong Mirage teams in my opinion\n\nCash it :) sweat free \n\n**oDdS sHiFt DoEsN't BoDe WeLl**",

Multiple reasons for the conviction as below.\n\n1. Match is played in Ahmedabad , the pitch is extremely flat meaning bowlers need to alter the lengths significantly and be more aggressive and hence prone to mistakes.\n\n2. SA bowling attack is notoriously wayward in bowling , past 2 matches they have given away 11 & 12 wides respectively. Not to mention 2 no balls in each innings as well. New Zealand are also susceptible bowling 7 & 9 wides in their last 2 games.\n\n3. This is a highly competitive game and a high scoring one resulting in the full over quotas being close to completion.\n\n4. The conditions - The match is played at night in India where dew will come into play, the balls will slip out of the hands easier for the team bowling second increasing the number of errors. Also, weather is clear so the innings won’t be truncated.\n\nHope to be off to a good start and best of luck!",

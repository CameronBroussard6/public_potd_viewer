The Premier League selection controversy around Bunting adds variance: it could sharpen him into his A-game or weigh on him with extra pressure.

      "text": "Darts 🎯 - 2026 Premier League - Night 1\n\nOverall: 0-0\n\nToday's Pick: Michael van Gerwen ML vs Stephen Bunting @ 1,62\n\nDarts are coming back with another Premier League season, and we will be having matches every week for the next 16 weeks. \n\nToday I am going to back \"Mighty Mike\" against \"The Bullet\". Reason is simple, van Gerwen is a superior player, he leads their H2H 24-6, and there are many voices saying that Bunting shouldn't have been nominated for Premier League in the first place, because there are better players around (Danny Noppert for example), adding additional pressure for Bunting that he needs to perform - but when you look at his resume, he is more likely than not to crumble under all this pressure. I do believe he is the worst player in the Premier League this season, much like last year, when he finished dead last.\n\nBOL",

Should've been a lot higher, but UNCA scored just four points over the last 3:49 of regulation despite leading. Combined, these two managed nine points over the final four minutes. Gross. Onward!*\n\n**Today's reasoning:** I *really* wanted to find something in the NBA tonight, but with all the trade dust still settling, it's hard to dial in on a player prop or team trend. I *do* like the Raptors at -9, but not enough to put a unit on it. I will probably look at the Association again next week. Instead, let's stay in the college ranks for a Big 12 slowdown between molasses and a glacier.  West Virginia (14-8) travels to Cincinnati (11-11) for a game of defense with occasional points scored. Look, I'm gonna forget that West Virginia already has a straight up win earlier this season - 62-60 on Jan. 6. Cincinnati is 9-13 against the spread this season. And when you play as slow as these teams do, every possession, every point comes at a premium. I don't see Cincy pulling away. KenPom puts West Virginia's adjusted pace at 361. Both teams have a defensive efficiency in the Top 35. Oh, and Bart Torvik has this game going 63-59 to Cincinnati.\n\nI don't trust Cincinnati to lay two full possessions to a team with a better conference record, even if they *are* at home. Speaking of, Cincy is 7-7 ATS at home and haven't covered as favorites in three of their last five games. In fact, Cincinnati has failed to score 70 points in four straight games. When you're talking about two possessions, it gets amplified with an offense that's stuck in the mud. Meanwhile, WVU is 4-3 ATS when catching points, but they're 4-1 ATS against Big 12 mid-tier teams (Kansas State, Arizona State, Colorado, and Cincinnati). I don't like relying on WVU's defensive intensity against the elites, but I like it here. West Virginia's leading scorer, senior Honor Huff, had 24 points and eight rebounds (both season highs) against the Bearcats on Jan. 6. The last four times he's cleared 20 points, WVU is a perfect 4-0 ATS. Let's hope for a good scoring game from him. For what it's worth, Cincinnati's Moustapha Thiam is listed as questionable with a foot injury. If he doesn't go, I love this line even more. The Bearcats want to operate inside, but they won't have Thiam's 10.8 points (third on the team), 6 rebounds, and 1.6 blocks.\n\nLook. Both teams are 2-3 ATS over their last five, so something's gotta give. I believe it'll break for the Mountaineers, who at least have a winning record over their last 10 games, unlike Cincinnati. This is definitely more of a gut play than deep statistical analysis. I see that Cincy's offense has been cold recently, and have no faith they can pull away. At home, it's a coin toss if they cover which is... not ideal for the Bearcats. And West Virginia seems to cover just fine against teams of Cincy's ilk. I'll take the glacier to cover. And if this line goes to 6.5, I'll double down.\n\nGood luck and Godspeed!\n\nPOTD tracker: [https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/Seventh\\_\\_Place-z37cn7](https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/Seventh__Place-z37cn7)\n\nIf I've made you a few bucks through fades, it's just gonna ask you a few questions: [https://buymeacoffee.com/seventh\\_\\_place](https://buymeacoffee.com/seventh__place)",

So it's not a secret that Marchy is starting to fall off from his Vegas days, but he's still a solid contributor as a linemate with the Preds star Filip Forsberg on both EV and PP. His offensive metrics still rank in the top third in both xGF/60 and actual GF/60, so the opportunities are there.\n\nThe Capitals have solid goaltending, ranked 10th in SV%, but their defense is leaky, allowing 10th most shots and 6th most High Danger Chances. Their penalty kill also ranks in the bottom third, so there are several factors working in Marchessault's favor. I'm willing to take the solid plus-odds for the risk.",

Telstar’s last match was a 4-1 defeat, with both teams finding the net in six of their last eight games, with four or more goals being scored in six of them. So, while this looks like a BTTS, im going for a safer over 2 Asian line, since Ive been having bad luck with btts for some time now\n\nLeg 2 - Salford have won their last four away games, but they have only kept one clean sheet on the road in their last 12 League Two away days. Accrington Stanley have come up short against members of the top four recently, losing to Bromley and MK Dons at home, but they are in good scoring form and should contribute to a high-scoring affair at Crown Ground.\n\nHope we get the W & BoL",

Nurkic is not listed as out so that may limit some assists and open him up for more points. I feel more comfortable taking the combined prop with Nurk in the game incase he has a 15p-15a or 20p-10a night. Either way his minutes and usage should be insanely high even if he doesn't play the full 48 like last game.",

I love the plus money edge here. Clicking on all cylinders, with the whole team being healthy for the first time in ages. They have really shocked a lot of people. I've always been high on the Hornets and pretty big on Miller, and now he is finding his groove. He just won player of the week or month in the east... can't remember. He plays extremely similarly to KD, and will be matched up against him tonight. Hornets have become dangerous, with one of the best defenses in the league and an offense that always seems to find a way to get hot during a game. They carry a lot of momentum into this game on a 7-game win streak. With all the starters playing, they are 11 and 3 since Jan 5, and 7 and 1 on the road. Hornets are also coming in on two days of rest. Rockets are ranked 28th in points allowed in the paint over their last 10 games. A lot of these Hornets are taking around 40% of their shots down there, while both teams rank highly in rebounds. Should be a battle and a back-and-forth game.

Today with another spot that stands out from a value perspective. Beşiktaş travel to face Kocaelispor in the Turkish Cup, and while cup matches always bring some unpredictability, the price on the away side feels inflated. We’re getting plus money on a Süper Lig giant against a second-tier opponent, which is rare and worth attention.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n**POTD:** Beşiktaş ML (+105 / 2.05) vs Kocaelispor\n**Sport:** Football - Turkish Cup\n\n**Pick:** Beşiktaş ML\n\n**Odds:** 2.05 (Bet365)\n\n**Confidence:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (4/5)\n\n**Stake:** 100€ (1unit) (depending on bankroll)\n\nBeşiktaş ML here is a classic case of the market overcorrecting due to “cup upset” narratives and expected rotation. Even with squad rotation, Beşiktaş’s depth, quality, and experience remain significantly higher than Kocaelispor’s. A rotated Süper Lig side still carries more individual talent and tactical flexibility than a full-strength second-division team.\n\nKocaelispor are well-organized and strong at home, but they rely heavily on defensive structure and limited attacking patterns. That’s a tough profile to maintain over 90 minutes against a team that can control possession and create chances through multiple channels. If Beşiktaş score first, the game script heavily favors them, as Kocaelispor are not built to chase matches.\n\nFrom a numbers perspective, odds of 2.05 imply under a 49% win probability. I rate Beşiktaş closer to 60–65% to win this matchup outright, even factoring in rotation and away conditions. That discrepancy makes this a value play rather than just a “big-name club” bet.\n\nI’m deliberately avoiding handicaps or goal markets here and sticking with the straight moneyline to keep variance lower while still taking advantage of the mispriced odds.\n\nFinal thought:\nNot risk-free — it’s still a cup match — but at these odds, backing the superior team straight up is the disciplined play. The value lies in the price, not the badge.\n\nGood luck if tailing 🤝",

In all three games, Royce has gone under. To me this really isn't that surprising. I always thought of him as more of a play finisher. However, looking into the stats, he disproves this somewhat. He averages over 40 passes a game and around 4.5 potential assists a game. Those are pretty high numbers especially for a three-and-D specialist like him.  \nEven then, I believe in the Warriors defense. Most of their team roster is smaller (and versatile). Thanks to this, they run people off the three point line pretty well; their length, hustle, and IQ also help a lot. A lot of Royce's assists come from the three, so if the Warriors do what they usually do, I expect the people receiving his passes to put the ball on the ground and do something of the dribble.",

      "text": "Record: 4–0\n\nLast 10: 4–0\n\nLast Pick: South Alabama @ Appalachian State — Full Game Under 129.5\n\nResult: ✅ WIN (Final total: 122)\n\nReview: The game stayed under 129.5 because it played exactly to a mutual pace-suppression script rather than relying on missed shots alone. Both teams operated almost entirely in the half court, with limited fast-break opportunities and no sustained transition pressure. Shooting efficiency was modest on both sides, but more importantly, neither team generated easy points in the paint or at the line to inflate scoring late. The absence of foul escalation and the lack of urgency-driven tempo kept possessions long and scoring capped throughout. This was a clean structural under that won because the game never sped up.\n\n⸻\n\nToday’s Pick\n\nCollege Basketball | NCAA Men’s Chicago State Cougars @ Central Connecticut State Blue Devils Wednesday, February 5, 2026 | 7:00 pm\n\nPick: Full Game Under 138.5\n\nOdds: -108 (DraftKings)\n\nWrite-Up:\n\nThis matchup sets up well for an under because the scoring ceiling is naturally capped by Chicago State’s offensive profile. Chicago State has struggled all season to generate efficient offense, especially on the road, and those issues are not pace-related — they stem from shot quality, finishing, and an inability to create easy points. When that type of offense travels, it tends to stay limited regardless of how the game unfolds.\n\nCCSU doesn’t need to dominate or play slow for this under to stay intact. They typically operate in a controlled offensive structure and don’t push tempo aggressively when holding a lead. That matters here, because even if CCSU scores at a reasonable clip, Chicago State’s lack of scoring reliability keeps the overall total from inflating quickly. This is the type of game where one team doing “just enough” is still sufficient for the under.\n\nThe risk is clear and worth acknowledging: this under depends on Chicago State remaining inefficient. If CCSU has an unusually strong shooting night or Chicago State overperforms offensively, the margin narrows. Still, with the total sitting at 138.5, the market is pricing in more consistent offense than this matchup typically produces. Structurally, this game favors an outcome where the weaker offense sets the tone, not the other way around.\n\n⸻\n\nFor those who find the analysis valuable, contributions are appreciated — no pressure.

Tarisov has a .904 save percentage and a 2.61 goals against average. For the Lightning, we have Alexander “The Great” Vasilevsky, he is a monster every season and this one is no different. This season, Vasilevsky has a save percentage of .918 and just a 2.14 goals against average which is insane. On the offensive side of things, the Lightning are strong ranking 2nd in the league in goals, but they are only 16th in shots on goal. On top of that, they are facing a Panthers goalie who’s been on fire and has a good save percentage. On the other side of offense, panthers aren’t really anything to be in awe of, ranking just 19th in goals. Both teams are great at limiting the shots which is going to be a key component. The Panthers defense is very good, with them ranking 5th in least shots allowed on their goalie, despite them not actually being in the opponents offensive zone as much as last year, so being that good at limiting shots is impressive. The Lightning are also great at limiting shots on goal, ranking 7th in least shots allowed on their goalie. With both goalies having high save percentage’s and both teams being elite at limiting shots on goal, there won’t be many opportunities to score, and these great goalies will be able to stop a big chunk of those shots that do get on net.\n\nTake The Under 6.5 Goals!",

On to the next one.\n\nBorna Gojo is a talented player who stands at nearly 2m tall and possesses a powerful game reminiscent of Marin Cilic. Injuries and inconsistency have been major themes in his career, but when he's timing the ball well, it can be extremely hard to stop him. In the first round here in Cleveland, he scored a dominant 6-0, 6-0 win over the 17-year-old Jack Kennedy (7.64 performance rating). It was clear that Kennedy was overmatched, but I didn't feel that he gave the match away with unforced errors; rather, Gojo was able to take control from the start, earning free points on serve and taking a strong court position in rallies. \n\nOn the other hand, Tristan Boyer only earned a 6.64 rating for his 4 & 4 win over Garrett Johns. I will say that I think the rating slightly underrates his performance, as his forehand was doing a lot of damage, and he showed some good resilience to not get broken back at 4-3 in the second set. Boyer has the serve and physical attributes to succeed on fast courts, but actually developed his game on South American clay. The result is that he has developed a one-two punch game with a heavy forehand, but doesn't approach the net as much as he maybe should. However, once you're able to target Boyer's backhand, things start to fall apart. Johns isn't a bad player, but he doesn't have the weapons for these conditions, and found himself constantly on defense in their match. In comparison, Gojo has the weaponry to dictate, and his serve into the Boyer backhand should score pretty often. Boyer's topspin also tends to fall in the strike zone of taller players, and he actually holds an 0-7 record against players 6'2\" or taller in the last 52 weeks. Overall, I see Gojo having the advantage in the serve and backhand departments, and I think Boyer will need to make a lot of first serves and clip a lot of lines if he wants to win this. Gojo won't win with a double bagel this time, but he should be able to move on here.",

The Czech team looked completely outclassed against Canada and Chabicovsky was particularly weak. Sweden is another very strong experienced team that will put a lot of pressure on the young Czech team. The bigger advantage for Sweden is actually with the women; Isabella was the best player on the ice in the opening draw and she should easily outshoot Zelingrova with draws and hits. Sweden are coming off a 10-3 win over a Korean team that I have ranked higher than the Czechs. Sweden won 10-4 in the only career head-to-head match between these teams. Should be another easy win for Sweden.\n\nEDIT: FD put up -1.5, which is crazy so please hammer that if you see it but I'll keep my -3.5 as my POTD",

BANJORA - WIN - $1.80 (Betting 4 units)    \n**Write up:** Today’s pick is BANJORA who is resuming for its second preparation and second race start. On debut was slowly away but mustered to sit 4th/5th, and showed great grit to wear down the leader BENEVAC, who has since won and run in much tougher races.      \n     \nSince that run BANJORA has trialled on two occasions. Firstly finishing 2nd after showing great gate speed and leading the field, and was applied absolutely no pressure. The second he again began brilliantly and sat 4 wide round the turn, finishing full of running without being tested at all. This improved ability to ping the gates implies maturity and development, and bodes well for us in the race since drawing barrier 4. The likely leader is one gate inside us, so I imagine us sitting just outside and in plenty of clear air.     \n     \nBANJORA is also yet to see a firm deck, but with the trials coming on ground that was borderline soft/good, I have no doubt we’ll handle it fine, and there’s even the potential of an improved showing on such a track.     \n      \nI think we’re a clear standout here, and the only horse we’re gonna have to get past is JUST AWESOME, which I’m fairly confident we’ll be able to do.

They have a 31-15 record in maps this year so far. They won a forfeit in RO16, and beat Betclic 2-0 in quarter finals (13-8/13-3)\n\n**Projected Veto:**\n\n* Nuclear TigeRES are the higher seed, they have side choice, 90-95% will pick to choose second, they had side choice in the R016 against UNiTY and chose to veto 2nd as well\n* illwill ban Ancient, Nuclear TigeRES ban Overpass\n* illwill pick Mirage, **Nuclear TigeRES pick Inferno**\n\n**Inferno Stats:**\n\n* Nuclear TigeRES are 84% winrate on 19 maps of Inferno in the L3 months overall. It is their third highest played map in the pool, and their highest win rate currently. They are on a 4 map winstreak on Inferno.\n* This TigeRES core was 15-3 on Inferno in 2025, averaged 54% winrate on CT side, and 66% on T side\n* illwill are 33% winrate on 9 maps of Inferno in the L3 months overall. This is their only map with a <50% winrate in the map pool at the moment, and by far their most uncomfortable.\n* TigeRES have some extremely impressive Inferno wins against quality teams to start 2026, they are 5-2 this year so far, beating Nemesis 13-5, EYEBALLERS 13-6, and VP 13-10, they also had a very close lose to Gentle Mates 19-15, who might be the best Inferno team in all of tier two, very strong stuff\n* illwill have very mixed results on Inferno, blown out by Tricked/FNC, close losses to BASEMENT BOYS/UNiTY, wins over Bet-M and Ursa, and in the last week have two relatively bad losses to 1WIN/FAVBET 13-7 each (both are very strong Inferno teams). They also had a win vs. ECSTATIC on Inferno 13-8 a week ago who are decently strong, but they also won both pistols",

Atalanta beat Parma 4-0 last home game, but also in the last five, they drew against Pisa who are in the relegation zone, lost both Champions League games that they were also favourites in and were massively lucky to get away with a 0-0 draw against Como on Sunday. \n\nJuventus has much the same story as Atalanta, as they also have gotten a whole lot better after sacking their manager. I will say that they are somewhat reliant on Kenan Yildiz to score and create chances, he is pretty clearly their best player at the moment and there is maybe some concern that he will not play this game. \n\nI don’t expect fireworks from this game, but for my money I believe Juventus has enough about them to see this game through in normal time with a 1-0 win.  ",

Bet 2u\n\nWriteup: First thing to note here is the price of the bet has been moving like crazy since Monday. I got this originally at +125, and has since moved anywhere from +105 to -130. Do a little shopping around to try to get the best value.\n\nI’ll also note that Kim has anywhere from the 3rd-5th best odds to win this entire event, and yet he is still listed as a plus money play in some books just to make top 20. Let’s capitalize on this.\n\nThe Waste Management Open is known for its fairly easier greens, making tee-to-green and strokes gained metrics very important if you want to come out on top in this tournament. Kim is currently 5th overall in tee-to-green metrics over the last 5 events this season, and is 4th in strokes gained. He is also leading in strokes gained specifically in his approach shots. Recently, Kim came tied for 2nd at the Farmers Insurance Open and tied for 6th at the American Express. In this tournament specially, he placed tied for 21st in 2025 and tied for 12th in 2024. I expect the winning score to be around -18, and with Kim having a Greens In Regulation of 75%, along with his fantastic ball striking with his iron play, I expect him to have a lot of birdie opportunities to keep climbing up the leaderboards. Kim has been a bit varied in his putting, but has recently earned 1.2 strokes gained from his putting over the last 5 events. \n\nI will be willing to say Kim will have some of the most birdie opportunities this entire tournament, the question will be if he can convert. Even if he is average in his conversion rate, his iron game and metrics in this area have been so good that he should be able to finish in the top 20 by the end of Sunday. A plus money play makes it even better.\n\nRemember to only bet what you can afford to lose, and BOL!",

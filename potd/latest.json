Clemson is coming in ranking 29th in defensive efficiency in the nation. Alabama dropped 85 in one of their 2 losses to Gonzaga who ranks 11th in defensive efficiency. All of the other ranked teams they've played this year are in the top 100 defensive efficiency rankings. \n\nAlabama is also coming off of a one week break where they dropped 115 and 105 back to back nights against UNLV and Maryland respectively. Though those two schools are not great defensively, that many points is absurd regardless in a CBB game. \n\nClemson is coming off of a 5 day rest, and averaging 85.3ppg. Expect this game to be very high scoring (somewhere in the 170s - considered taking over on the game, but worried Bama's home court advantage may slow Clemson down). \n\nIf the game were to be played at Clemson's pace, I would take the under, but Alabama has controlled a majority of their games with their high tempo offense. I am very high on the Alabama backcourt and I think they will combine for 40-45 points a game at least 8-10 times. \n\nI expect to see another high scoring performance from Alabama and think by the end of the season they will be in the top 3 teams in PPG. \n\nBest of luck.",

SWEAT FREE\n\nEdwards scored 40+ while Queen didnt even attempt a 3 even when there was overtime, will definitely look to run the Queen play back if similar odds are given\n\nPOTD: Cooper Flag under 1.5 3s made + Dyson Daniels over 4.5 asts (1.97) (Stake)\n\nBet 3U\n\nBeen loving these 2x parlays just feel more confident in them tbh but running it back with a similar pick to the Derik Queen one so lets  try to get the back to back W here\n\nCooper Flagg has gone under in 9/10 games with 5 of em not even making 1. He averages around 3 3s attempted per games and shooting at 25%. Seeing this at 1.45x odds is one hell of a steal. Coop has adapted to a more of a finishing sort of playstyle as of recently so we should see him continue to have less oppurtunities to shoot and the only real times I would see coop hit a 3 is from the near the corner in an infrequent catch and shoot. The only worry I have is that they face the #1 pace in the heat but hoping the heat blow them out to prevent more PT for coop.\n\nDyson Daniels in the last 5 games due to the absence of Kristaps and Trae has averaged around 37 minutes per game and has gone over this line in each of those 5 games. He is also over this line in 8 of the last 9 including the \\~20 min games which just gives me more confidence. Clippers also are a bottom 10 in asssists allowed per game so just further strengthens my claim. This pick is mostly an odds booster to Coops but still really love it.\n\nNever financial advice, always bet within bankroll limits and BOL!!",

      "text": "**Yesterday's POTD**: Vasco ML (+110 Draftkings) [3u] 🤮\n\nTough one last night, lads. Vasco really should’ve had that in the bag. They absolutely dominated, 14 shots, 10 corners compared to Mirassol’s 8 shots and just 1 corner. But somehow, the ball just refused to hit the back of the net.\n\nVasco pressed and pressed all game long, had Mirassol pinned for stretches, but that high line left gaps and Mirassol took full advantage late in the second half with a brutal counterattack. And when Vasco went all-in chasing the equalizer, they got stung again in stoppage time on another counter, sealing the 2–0 loss.\n\nA frustrating defeat, boys. The right side, wrong result. We bounce back. ⚽💪\n\n**Record**: 1W-0P-1L\n**Net Units**: -1.4u \n**Form**: ✅️❌️\n\n⚽️Soccer | 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿EPL | Arsenal vs Brentford | 2:30pm EST \n\n**Today's POTD**: Arsenal first half ML (-115 Draftkings) [3u]\n\nAlright lads, we move again today. Arsenal welcome Brentford to the Emirates, and this is a spot the league leaders should be licking their lips at. They’re coming off a tough away draw at Chelsea, and you already know a team like Arsenal doesn’t stay quiet for long, especially not at home.\n\nThe Gunners have been nothing short of dominant at the Emirates, winning 10 of their last 11 matches with one draw sprinkled in. The chemistry is flowing, the football is sharp, and every man on that pitch knows what’s at stake. Meanwhile, Brentford have been all over the place away from home, losing 5 of their last 8, with their only wins coming against lower-division Grimsby, struggling West Ham, and Bournemouth. That’s not exactly the résumé you want walking into the Emirates.\n\nWith Arsenal’s form, depth, rhythm, and the massive talent gap between these two sides, I fully expect the Gunners to draw first blood early. They’ve got the momentum, the crowd, and the firepower, this is the perfect spot for a strong first-half performance from the league leaders.\n\n*Tail responsibly.

      "text": "Record: 20-13\n\nNet Units: +4.58\n\nROI: 13.9%\n\nPick: Cricket \n\n1U Australia to beat England in 2nd test match @ $1.53 (B365) \n\nWrite-Up: So this match starts Thursday 3pm AEDT which is 8pm Wednesday LA time (and Americans can work it out from there). The key thing for test cricket is that it takes up to 5 days to complete a match, so the result won’t pay out for at least 3 days  but maybe 4-5. The first test did end in 2 days but that is super rare. \n\nSo, why Australia over England? It’s a day-night test, which means half the match will be played during the day & half the match will be played during the night. Test cricket is traditionally a day sport, and this day-night format is new. Australia is really good at cricket, and even better at day-night tests, while England struggle. They use a pink ball and it “swings” more than normal matches, so someone who can bowl fast consistently & swing it is really important. \n\nAustralia is 13 wins 1 loss in day-night test matches, with the worlds best bowler in the format Mitch Starc at the top of his game. Starc is important in that he has extremely good endurance - he’s like a baseball pitcher than can pitch at full accuracy & speed til the 9th inning.\n\nEngland is 2 wins 5 losses in day-night test matches. They have some potent fast bowlers but they tire easily - they are like a pitcher that is good for 4 innings. Sure, they probably strike you out more often than not, but you wear them down & get going at them late. Archer was 10-15km/hr slower in the 2nd innings of the 1st test match than he was in the 1st innings. Archer took 2 wickets for 11 runs in 9 overs in the first innings (which are great stats), and then took 0 wickets for 45 runs in 8 overs in the 2nd innings (which are terrible stats) - like a pitcher throwing 9 strike-outs in first 3 innings & then conceding 3 homers, 7 hits & 9 runs in the next 3. \n\nAustralia still don’t have their best player (Cummins) and another strike bowler (Hazelwood) but they managed to easily bowl England out all 20 required times in the first match. They struggled with batting but Usman Khawaja goes out, whose back woes disrupted & unsettled the order significantly. Weatherald was shaken on debut but grew in confidence and based on his 2nd innings should only get better, Marnus Labaschagne found some form with a solid 2nd innings, and Travis Head was the match-winner. Meanwhile, England lose one of their main strike bowlers in Mark Wood, putting more pressure on the other 3 fast bowlers, all of whom were beaten up on in the 2nd innings. Basically, England gave it their all early, Australia underperformed, and Australia still won as England tired badly. Now, we enter Australia’s most dominant format.  \n\nBe aware that this bet also includes a draw - which will only happen if the weather is bad. However the forecast is pretty good for the next 4 days and England will not extend the match to a 5th day. \n\nFinally, Australia have won 13 of the last 15 test matches against England, in Australia. They have won 5 of the last 6 at Brisbane (where the match starting tomorrow will be held). \n\nThere’s no way in my eyes that this bet should have been eligible for POTD as the odds should be way under $1.50.",

The Knicks defense? That thing is like TSA at the airport when they’re bored they checking EVERYTHING. The Hornets walking in with half a roster missing more pieces than a Dollar Store puzzle, and the Knicks already warming up like, “Hey man, who we blowing out today?”\n\nAnd look if the Hornets offense had any rhythm, any swagger, ANY hope, maybe we’d talk. But no. These boys out here shooting like they’re trying to win a contest for “Most Creative Ways to Miss.” Meanwhile the Knicks got dudes who wake up in the morning choosing violence. They run their sets like they’re mad somebody ate their leftovers. You ever see a team rebound like they’re fighting for child custody? That’s the Knicks. And you want ME to believe the Hornets keeping this close? Maaaan Stahp.\n\nLet me tell you something… if the Knicks don’t cover -8.5, I’ll personally call the team and ask who sabotaged the script. Because this matchup feels like one of those games where the Knicks go up 18 in the second quarter and Mike Brown still got the starters in the fourth yelling at everybody like it’s Game 7. Knicks -8.5? That ain’t a line, that’s a gift. Enjoy it before Vegas realizes they messed up.\n\nDIsclaimer : Writeup is just purely entertainment and i can be wrong , its gambling after all ( Tail Or Fade Cautiously )",

      "text": "Record: 61-50\n\n🤾Handball Türkiye Superlig | Nilüfer Belediyespor - Giresunspor  ⏱️UTC 12:00\n\nPick: Giresunspor +11.5 Handicap @ 1.75\n\n\n\nGiresun's losses and points difference in the Süper Lig this season:\n\nvs. Nilüfer (home): 22–29 → -7\n\nvs. Beşiktaş (home): 37–45 → -8\n\nvs. İstanbul GSK (away): 31–35 → -4\n\nvs. Spor Toto (away): 29–33 → -4\n\nvs. AS Hentbol (home): 20–21 → -1\n\nvs. Güneysu (home, Week 15): 21–24 → -3\n\nCritical point: All of Giresun's losses this season have been by a maximum of 8 points (Beşiktaş match). No team has yet managed to outscore Giresun by 12 points or more. Moreover, a significant portion of these losses came against the top 4-5 teams in the league: Beşiktaş, Spor Toto, İstanbul GSK, Nilüfer, AS Hentbol, ​​Güneysu.\n\nOn the other hand, consider Giresun's dominant wins:\n\nvs. Rize Bld (home, Week 10): 41–24 → +17\n\nvs. Ankara Hentbol (home, Week 12): 50–25 → +25\n\n@ Trabzon BŞB (Week 7): 36–29 → +7\n\nvs. Mihalıççık (Week 8): 33–30 → +3\n\n@ Beykoz (Week 11): 34–28 → +6\n\nThese scores indicate two things: Giresun is productive offensively; they possess the quality to quickly overwhelm lower-tier opponents. They manage to stay in the game even against strong opponents; the score never \"collapses.\"\n\nStatistical summary: Total goal difference: +43 (421–378), +3.3 goals per game.\n\nHeaviest league defeat: -8 (Beşiktaş).\n\nAverage loss difference against the top 4 teams:\n\nTotal difference between matches against Nilüfer, Spor Toto, Beşiktaş, and İstanbul GSK: 7 + 4 + 8 + 4 = 23 goals\n\nNumber of matches: 4 → average -5.75\n\nLet's summarize and list them all.\n\n– Nilüfer has a +128 goal difference in 12 league matches, a +10.7 goal difference per game, although most of this difference is against the bottom-placed teams.\n\n– Giresun, on the other hand, is a positive mid-to-upper-level team with a +43 goal difference in 13 matches; their heaviest league defeat this season was only an 8-goal difference (Beşiktaş).\n\n– Nilüfer only won the first match away by 7 goals (29–22). A +11.5 win rate seems excessive from a market perspective for a team with an average margin of -5-6 against league giants like Spor Toto, İstanbul GSK, Nilüfer, and Beşiktaş. In a typical scenario, I'm betting on Nilüfer to win, but I expect a match where Giresun will maintain their lead for the full 60 minutes and a margin of around 8-9. Therefore, Giresun +11.5 (1.75) is a valuable handicap pick in my opinion.",

My very first POTD post on here was a college basketball play so I have been eagerly awaiting to find my spot for my first college basketball pick of the year! Going with a two legger with two very hot teams in the Indiana Hoosiers and the LSU Tigers. Indiana comes into this one with a perfect 7-0 record and they are averaging 90 points per game and shooting with over a 50% field goal percentage while being paired with a very solid defense that is averaging just 62 points allowed per game. They face off against Minnesota who has lost three straight games against Santa Clara, Stanford and San Francisco and they are an abysmal 1-7 against the spread this year with the main contributor being their lack of offensive production even against very poor squads. The Golden Gophers have also left many points off the board this year at the charity stripe as they are one of the worst free throw shooting teams in the nation with just a 66% free throw percentage and this team revolves around Cade Tyson so if the Hoosiers can make it difficult for Tyson I think they easily cruise to victory in this one. The LSU Tigers also come into this one with a perfect 7-0 record and they have one of the nations highest scoring offenses as they are racking up 95 points per game which is 9th out of 365 schools and they are 1st in division one in field goal percentage shooting 55% from the field. They are facing  a Boston College squad who have a very stale offense averaging 70 points per game, a 40% field goal percentage and similarly to Minnesota they have been struggling from the line as well just shooting just under 68% from the charity stripe. This Boston College squad has been handed some brutal losses against non impressive teams like Tulane, Central Connecticut State, Florida Atlantic and Davidson in a game where they only scored 49 points in. I expect both of these teams to win this one by at least more than one possession.\n\nPrediction: 78-69 Indiana, 76-70 LSU\n\nLast pick:🏈Oklahoma ML/Alabama ML💰Two really fun games to watch. Doesnt get much better than that on rivalry week.\n\nHappy college basketball season everyone, best of luck to everyone tailing and remember to bet responsibly and lets get this college basketball betting season started off the right way!!🏀🍀💜🐉\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8v4pg13rcy4g1.jpeg?width=1044&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aa511d2a4c660b787a764e708ecc45b65e4293c7",

Bench play made all the difference with the gritty hard play by Walsh, Queta, and the rest of the Celtics bench. Mazulla has his guys playing well! Glad to have gotten the win on this underdog!\n\nEvent: Milwaukee Bucks vs Detroit Pistons NBA\n\nPOTD: Milwaukee Bucks Moneyline (+135) 5 units\n\nOnce again, Vegas is reading too much into recent plays. Yes, I know the Bucks are 9-13 and the Pistons are an eastern-conference leading 17-4. Yes, I know the Bucks have lost 8 of their last 9 with their most recent being a loss to the Wizards. For me, the Bucks still pass the eye test and have had steady leads in a lot of their recent games. It feels more like the Pistons are actually the team that has lost some of their early season momentum in the last week, and I think it can finally catch up to them here. Pistons have lost b2b games against Celtics and Magic before scraping by one possession victories against the heat and the hawks. Now, they have to travel to Milwaukee. Giannis recently removed everything Bucks related off of his social media. This, dare I say, is a season-defining game for the Bucks and I expect them to come out strong and hold a lead throughout this game. Will be going my full 5 units on the Bucks Moneyline and I did float taking them on the spread instead (+3.5), but felt like the value is here on the ML. If you want to play it safer, def take the spread!\n\nJust to reiterate, in conjunction with my model, I use the eye test as well as my gut feeling to play what I believe is the most-valuable pick on the slate. Cheers to a great game, and please remember to gamble responsibly and to only wager what you can afford to lose.\n\nBOL!",

The Cardinals enter this matchup averaging 96.7 points per game with a +33.7 scoring margin, ranking among the nation’s top offenses while maintaining efficiency. Their assist-to-turnover ratio of 1.96 and 20.7 assists per game highlight a structured offense that minimizes mistakes, a critical edge against an Arkansas team that thrives on transition opportunities. Louisville also dominates the glass, pulling down 46.0 rebounds per game compared to Arkansas’ 37.9, which directly limits second-chance points and fast-break chances for the Razorbacks. Defensively, Louisville allows just 63.0 points per game, showing they can control pace even against high-scoring opponents. Arkansas, while explosive at 88.1 points per game, is less efficient in the half court with a 1.25 assist-to-turnover ratio and a lower assist rate (57.7% vs. Louisville’s 65.9%). Experience also tilts toward Louisville, whose veteran rotation has already proven it can travel, evidenced by their road win over Cincinnati, one of the nation’s top defensive teams. In a game projected to be fast-paced, the team that secures possessions, avoids turnovers, and controls the boards has the edge — and Louisville checks every box. \n\nLouisville doesn’t turn the ball over and has more than enough bodies to throw at Arkansas. I just think that while this game could be close, Louisville matches Arkansas strengths and has the better experience here.\n\n\nLaying -2.5 positions us with the deeper, more disciplined side that can neutralize Arkansas’ preferred style and grind out a cover.\n\nAs always.

To put this in perspective for non-hockey fans, this season they've set an NHL record by becoming the first team to get shut out in their first three homes games and have been blanked five times at home already this season which is absolutely brutal to avid viewers and frequent MSG attendees such as myself.  Even in the games they haven't been shut out, they've generally performed like complete ass offensively. All this to say that while taking three -400 lines wasn't sexy, wasn't turning anyone on or getting on the phone with their girlfriends/sidepieces to get them all hot and bothered, it did yield some results and for that, I am thankful.\n\nUnlike last night when I didn't love anything on the NHL calendar, this one popped immediately.  Naturally, this probably means that it's going to be a brutal beat but I'm riding anyways.  These have been two of my favorite teams to target all season: young, fast, fun teams that play up-tempo hockey.  Ducks are 2nd in the NHL in goals while both teams are league average defensively but also full of enough youthful exuberance  that they commit massive coverage gaffes every now and then that lead to odd man rushes against. I'm listing over 6.0 as the safer official play but 6.5 is playable for better odds or even 7.0 if you really want to get spicy with it.  Should be a fun game.\n\nBOL if you tail.",

That was terrifying yet so much fun to watch. Never a doubt right? I was looking at the board for tomorrow and these two games really jumped out at me. I’m a big Bradley Basketball fan and know the MVC inside and out. This Belmont Bruins team is the cream of the crop this year in The Valley. The way they run their offense, move the ball, get open looks; it’s truly a thing of beauty. Casey Alexander has a good thing going down in Nashville and I don’t see the team from Richmond slowing them down whatsoever. Tyler Lundblade in my opinion is the best shooter in the country and it’s not even close. Remember the name. \n\nBelmont comes into this game 8-0 on the year and has honestly decimated every team they have faced. Don’t get me wrong this Richmond team is good and they are very well coached. But they lack so much on the defensive end that they simply won’t be able to keep pace with the efficiency of Belmont. \n\nBelmont effective offensive FG % sits at 4th in the country and their defensive effective FG% is 15th in the country. Meanwhile Richmond is 49th in offensive effective FG% and this is the big difference they are 143rd in defensive effective FG%. \n\nRichmond won’t be able to stop the Belmont train. I’m a fan of this team and that’s coming from a Bradley fan. I don’t look forward to playing them this year. \n\nTake Belmont ML.\n\nNow for the Texas Longhorns. I actually really like the build out of this team. They are the 5th oldest team in the country and have two blemishes on their record. A 15 point loss to Duke which nobody has been able to keep close with them and a 1 point heartbreaking loss to Arizona State. That ASU team I’m higher on than a lot of people. Both those losses are going to be great losses come selection time. Coming off a great win against the Will Wade NC State squad this Texas team is going to be coming home looking for another statement win. \n\nThis Virginia team on the other hand hasn’t really beat anyone. Northwestern is an okay win but I don’t see Northwestern getting out of the bottom half of the Big Ten. They also lost to Butler who’s mid at best. The one thing I do like is how they crash the offensive boards. Virginia is big. But they aren’t athletic. At least not as athletic as their opponent. \n\nI truly think we see the experience and veteran led Texas squad show up and take this game by 5 or more points. Tramon Mark and Jordan Pope have this uncanny ability to make timely shots over and over again and I think we see them show up and show out big time. \n\nTake Texas ML\n\nI personally handicapped Belmont as -7.5 favorites and Texas as -5.5 favorites. Belmont/Texas +140 is a beaut. \n\nLet’s make it 3 days in a row why don’t we. \n\nGood luck and let’s keep it going. \n\nBC",

I find it difficult to bet / predict on both Tottenham and Newcastle games. However, they both can score and that thought pulled through.  \n\nSport: English Premier League - Chelsea vs. Leeds @ 3:15pm EST  \n\nPick: Chelsea win + Over 1 total goals = +110 (5 units)\n\nWrite Up: I usually like taking the other side when one team (Chelsea) has a much busier and more competitive schedule than the other (Leeds). However, Chelsea seems to be “sharpening their tools,” lately and really finding their confidence and form. It appears to me that Neto and Estevao are really coming into their own in Chelsea uniforms, Enzo is incredible, Palmer is back (apparently). My only hope is that they don’t take their foot off the gas now that they’re against an easier opponent. A draw a man down to Arsenal is a huge result, now they have the opportunity to make a big early step in the title fight. I am concerned about the number of games they’ve played recently and Caicedo being suspended for this game. No team in the prem is a cakewalk (other than Wolves), but Chelsea, for being such a young team, already has quite a bit of experience under their belts competing for the top and they also have little “pressure” from the media to be winning the league, I think that benefits them. Maresca is also a fantastic manager at balancing workload and getting results.   \n\nSide Note: Surprise surprise, I’ve created a BuyMeACoffee. If you find my analysis useful, please feel free to donate:\n\nhttps://buymeacoffee.com/5c2y4cxvy5e (link is working now)\n\nDon’t bet more than you’re willing to lose. 5-1 is a great start, I suspect there will be an averaging out at some point.\n\nBOL!",

Vejmelka played poorly against the Sharks on Monday, so you may see their backup Vanecek.\n\nOn the other hand, the Ducks are onto their 3rd string goalie Ville Husso (maybe could argue 2nd string) as they’re out Dostal and Mrazek. Husso had a pretty good game on Monday against STL but STL missed a bunch of golden opportunities to score (like wide open nets bad).\n\nGood luck!",

Hansi Flick’s trademark offside trap gave Atletico a chance to score the first goal of the game.

Another great read. \n\nEvent: Chelsea at Leeds (EPL) u/3:15pm EST\n\nPOTD: Chelsea to Win (-120)\n\nRead: Chelsea have really been getting themselves together as of late. They are coming off a hard fought draw as they hosted the league leaders Arsenal last time out. In a game including a first half red card which they played through, scored, and salvaged a point. Chelsea have only dropped points in two away games all season. One of which they drew 2-2 with Brentford back in September and then the next prem match that followed they lost 2-1 to Man United with a red card five minutes into the match. (I don't see them conceding two goals in this spot) Since then, they have won three away games in a row and have not conceded a single goal in any of them. Their defense has stepped up lately. Caicedo will not be available because of suspension. Cole Palmer is in the mix to play and potentially even start which is very positive.\n\nLeeds have conceded 25 goals and have only scored 13 of their own during this season through thirteen total games. At home they have been noticeably better defensively. Only conceding 7 goals in six games. Compared to conceding 18 goals in seven games away from home. This is my only worry in this game besides the Caicedo absence. Leeds are significantly better at home. They are also due unfortunately. Truth be told though Leeds are 2-1-7 in their last ten matches. They sit 18th in the table fighting to get out of the relegation zone. \n\nYes. Leeds have shown signs of life at home but, Chelsea is flying and with their form recently they will not be stopped here. Trust the boys in blue. \n\nBOL.",

Union Berlin did hold Bayern to a 2-2 draw just three weeks ago and have been the only team to take points off Bayern in the Bundesliga, but Bayern have both scored and conceded in their last five consecutive matches, meaning goals are guaranteed in both directions. Bayern lost 3-1 to Arsenal in the Champions League last week but bounced back with a 3-1 win over St. Pauli, proving they respond well to defeats. For Bayern, the pokal match is very important game as they would be aiming to win the whole thing. It's no surprise Bayern want to lift the cup since it's been lot of years since they last lifted it. Bayern's main 11 will play today against Union, and therefore Bayern should win this with score line of 2-1, 3-1, or 3-0.\n\n\nIf you found these picks helpful, tips or donations are greatly appreciated as they support the time and effort I put into creating them: [buy me a beer🍻](https://buymeacoffee.com/hercules.son.of.zeus)",

Their recent 3–1 win and consistent goal-scoring at home suggest an attacking approach from the EfB coaching staff, who know that their best chance lies in using the energy of Blue Water Arena to put pressure on FCK. Copenhagen arrive in a more fragile state, with head coach Jacob Neestrup openly admitting that the team has lacked “power and energy” after several poor away performances, yet he recently chose to highlight the side’s offensive strengths and stated that he wants to build on that rather than tighten defensively. The combination of Esbjerg’s motivation and confidence, FCK’s defensive vulnerability, and a coach who publicly prioritises attacking play despite setbacks creates the conditions for an open match with tempo, space, and chances at both ends — strongly supporting a bet on Over 2.5 goals.",

What a match that was, we were treated to a real spectacle. Bummer that Wilson didn't look to shoot much of the game and his teammates didnt pick out his runs in the box. 9 goals were scored and our guy wound up with one assist and no shots. We move on, sorry we lost, but thankful for a great game. I've mentioned this before, but my plays are intended to boost the enjoyment of watching some great matches. Giving us something to root for. We won't hit them all, but we try to hit as many as possible. \n\nWe stay in London today where 1st Place Arsenal hosts 11th place Brentford. These mid-week matches are always tricky, as coaches will want to rotate without losing synergy and giving up points. I think Arsenal will be looking towards the weekend where they play at Villa and try to rotate as much as possible. Brentford on the other hand will want to play spoiler as they are not playing in Europe this season and I expect most of their 1st team. \n\nI was shocked to see this line at even money and wouldn't be surprised if this moves quickly. Thiago has had a fantastic start to the season, filling the void for Brentford left by the parting of Mbuemo and Wissa. He's got 11 goals and is a striker in form. He's averaging over 2 SOTs per match, and has only failed a SOT in 3 matches making him 10/13. \n\nArsenal has a great defense, but we also bet against it over the weekend with success. I expect Arsenal to rotate their already injured backline even more here. I love this play because Thiago has hit SOTs against the big teams all season, landing 3 SOTs on Liverpool and 1 on Man City. He's also hit 3-2-2 SOTs in his last 3 matches. Arsenal should win this match, but I'll gladly take Thiago to get 1 SOT at even money!\n\nBOL!",

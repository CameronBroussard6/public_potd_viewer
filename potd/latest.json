      "text": "Record: 158-135, -0.71 units\n\nLast Pick: Otto Virtanen ML vs Emil Ruusuvuori (-137, 1 unit): Win\n\nTennis | Knoxville Challenger | 1:30 PM EST (estimated)\n\nToday's Pick: Daniil Glinka vs Darwin Blanch | **Glinka ML at -143 (BetRivers). 1 unit.**\n\nWrite-up: Nice win for Virtanen, who never looked to be in too much trouble. I didn't see much value in his odds against Cilic in the SF, but he actually ended up winning that one in straight sets as well.\n\nThis should be a fun match between Darwin Blanch and Daniil Glinka in the semifinals of the Knoxville Challenger. Glinka is a high-ceiling player who had been playing some of the best tennis of his career in recent months with the help of his strong serve and aggressive instincts. Here in Knoxville, he has marched through his opening three matches without conceding a break, including a win over an in-form Shinsuke Mitsui (7.11 performance rating). He possesses the unique combination of left-handedness and a one-handed backhand that is rarely seen on tour these days, and can often trouble inexperienced opponents. \n\nSpeaking of inexperienced opponents, it's hard not to describe Darwin Blanch as one, even if some of the tennis he's played this year has been beyond his years. The 18-year-old Blanch has long been one of the USTA's big hopes for the future, and even got to play in the US Open main draw this year after winning the 18 and under National Championship. At the same time, it still feels like he's more of a prospect than an established professional player right now. One can point to wins over guys like Valentin Royer, Johannus Monday, and Andres Martin as signs that he's one step away from breaking through, but you can also look at the match he dropped from a set up to Keegan Smith last week in Sioux Falls (6.51 performance rating) and see that there's a lot of work left to be done. As I mentioned, Glinka has found some really nice consistency over the past few months, and it feels as if he's had the same highs as Blanch without any of the lows.\n\nIn terms of odds analysis, Glinka closed at around -182 against Shinsuke Mitsui last round, which is a useful comparison point to this match. I honestly feel like Mitsui is playing at a similar level to Darwin right now: he closed at a similar price against Smith, but actually won his encounter in straight sets; he was also able to avenge a loss to Dhakshinewar Suresh, with his move to +104 from +179 in their last encounter showing just how much oddsmakers are liking him right now. Blanch also closed as a bigger underdog than he is here against Andres Martin in the second round, and Martin has generally been getting less market respect than Glinka as of late. \n\nOverall, I think Glinka's experience should carry him through in what should be a high-octane match. Blanch has a really nice lefty serve and forehand, but Glinka recently played two good matches against strong lefties (Martin Damm and Alejandro Tabilo). Looking at the backhand side, I feel like Glinka has a few more options, as I've been really impressed with the angles that his one-hander can generate. I don't see a crazy amount of value here (would take to around -150), but I see enough to take this for 1 unit. \n\nNote: The [POTD Capper Tracker](https://potd.lol), which you may remember from its Google Sheet days, is finally back in a cleaner, more robust website format!

I’m not making a really long write up and just my simple opinion. This is my first post, and I expect Leipzig to win over Hoffenheim. They have been more consistent, and their recent form has been pretty solid, while Hoffenheim has been struggling at home. Hoffenheim is also missing several important players through injury, which weakens them even more. I hope to start with a W.",

All bets are 1 unit.\n\nLast POTD 11/6/25: Tre Tucker 30+ receiving yards (-230) & Brock Bowers 5+ receptions (-350) 2 leg parlay (-114) ❌\n\nToday's POTD: Iowa +6.5 (-110 FanDuel)\n\nEvent: Oregon @ Iowa 1:30MST\n\nWrite up: Today’s matchup is a defensive clash between the #4th (Iowa) and the #6th (Oregon) ranked defenses currently in the nation, and I predict this matchup to be a close one. I believe Iowa’s ability to keep games close at home this year gives this team the legitimacy to keep this matchup within a single possession with a sneaky chance at taking this game outright. Oregon has allowed an average of 114 rushing yards per game, and although they have been effective at keeping teams out of the redzone, they have allowed touchdowns in 10/13 trips into the redzone to teams this year, and all 13 trips have resulted in a field goal or a touchdown. On the other side, the Hawks have been extremely productive at running the ball, rushing for an average of 185 yards per game and making the most out of their redzone trips this season in scoring on 32/34 attempts while scoring a touchdown at a 67% clip. The Hawkeyes' suffocating defense and ability to give their offense incredible field position will allow them to run the ball effectively, control the overall tempo of the game, and expose Oregon’s biggest weakness in stopping the run and their ability to stop teams once they enter the red zone.\n\nTail or fade BOL to everyone and cheers! 🍻",

I have lurked for a while and thought I'd share some insights here and in the Soccer thread. I watch a ton of EPL so I figured this would be a great fixture to start on. \nI see great value in this line. Chelsea, sitting 7th in the PL table, has been inconsistent this year and ravaged with injuries. Enzo has had at least one SOT in 6 of 7 matches in all comps (4 of 4 PL) since Cole Palmer has been out injured. He is also their main penalty taker and team captain. In his last 4 PL matches, Enzo has averaged 3 shots, 1.75 of those being on target. Chelsea is facing off against a last place Wolves team who just sacked their manager. I fully expect Chelsea will control the ball and fire off 15+ shots, we just need one from Enzo to be on target for this to hit. \n\nBOL to everyone, have a great Saturday!",

It most likely will rain later today, and the conditions are a bit questionable, but as long as Lando can keep it on the road, I am confident with this one. The spray from the cars will also make it harder to overtake from behind, as Lando will have a clear view of the track in front of him. Also with the weather, for the sprint, at least half of the 24 lap race must be completed, with at least two laps not being behind the Safety Car to award points. If this criteria isn't met, this bet will be a push.\n\nbol",

Bayern have scored 56 goals in just 16 games this season, which averages out to 3.5 goals per game, and they have hit over 2.5 goals in last 10 matches. Harry Kane is on fire with 22 goals so far this season, and he is supported by Luis Díaz with 10 goals and Michael Olise with 7 goals, meaning Bayern have multiple players who score regularly. Even though Union Berlin has been playing good at home this season, it would be difficult for them to stop Bayern especially since how they have been playing this season. Bayern won 16 games in a row and this is first time a team had a start like this in Top 5 leagues. This is the last game before the coming international break and Bayern would be looking to enter the break with 17/17 record. \n\nIf you found these picks helpful, tips or donations are greatly appreciated as they support the time and effort I put into creating them: [buy me a beer🍻](https://buymeacoffee.com/hercules.son.of.zeus)",

And 2 of those were last week away to the second place side. \n\nIn their 14 league games this season, South have won the first half 9 times, been drawing three times, and down twice. That record at home is even better.... Being in front 6 out of their 7 home games. They've only conceded two first half goals at home this season, scoring seven of their own. \n\nTo their credit, Kings Lynn have also been good in first halves this season - however South Shields are proving to be a class above this season and this bet is to echo that instead.",

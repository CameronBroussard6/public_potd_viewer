It seemed like most people got their bets voided, which is why I am tracking it as a push for my record. However, feel free to let me know if your bet was resolved as a loss, or you think I should track it differently. I would rather have a record that underestimates my success than one that overstimates it. \n\n Thiago Seyboth Wild is no stranger to the big stage, having broken out with a shocking five-set win over Daniil Medvedev at Roland Garros 2023 and beaten top 30 players like Taylor Fritz, Lorenzo Musetti, and Karen Khachanov. A string of poor results in 2025 saw him pushed out of ATP events and into obscurity on the Challenger Tour, so he will now look to rebound in 2026 and get closer to his peak ranking of No. 58 in the world. A title here in Itajai, where he has the home crowd behind his back, seems like the perfect way to kick off that rebound. Seyboth Wild is yet to drop a set in this tournament, spending just 5 hours, 48 minutes on court (compared to Vallejo's 6 hours, 35 minutes). He also has earned a strong average performance rating in his matches (7.47 vs 7.05). This trend continues even when adjusting for # of points played in each match (7.46 vs 7.00). Seyboth Wild also has a higher average rating in 3 of 4 categories (serve, forehand, backhand), while Vallejo narrowly edges him on return. This is despite Seyboth Wild only making 54.1% first serves (62.3% avg), while Vallejo has made 58.0% (64.2% avg). Seyboth Wild has played 6 (5 singles + 1 doubles) on Center Court, while this match will take place, while Vallejo has played 3. I expect Thiago's aggressive game to be firing from the start, and while Vallejo has enjoyed quite strong form on the Challenger Tour as of late, these feel like the conditions for Seyboth Wild to capitalize. The weather conditions are expected to be hot and humid, but pretty standard for this location, and I wouldn't expect that to have a huge effect on the match. The main reason I'm going for Seyboth Wild 2-0 instead of his ML is that both of these players are big hitters, and this feels like a match where one of them builds confidence early and takes over. Of course, I think that player is more likely to be TSW, and I also felt like he looked a bit better in the defense and touch departments in the semifinals. I also would trust Seyboth Wild's fitness and focus a bit less in a tight third set, and so I'd rather buy into the outcomes where he dominates at a much better price.",

Mechelen’s home matches are often goal festivals, with constant pressure, wide play, and multiple scoring options. Westerlo struggle defensively against high-tempo sides and usually concede early, which opens the game even more. Once Mechelen get ahead, they rarely slow down, and Westerlo’s willingness to attack can easily push the total into a high-scoring outcome.",

Purdue allowed 46 points to one guy and still had a chance. 7 win streak comes to an end, onto the next\n\nToday’s Pick: LA Rams vs Seattle Seahawks/ Seahawks ML (-138) 3u/ Odds Via FanDuel\n\n\nWrite up: Let’s get back in the win column. The Rams have been on the ropes twice and narrowly escaped defeat against 2 teams that aren’t in the same world as Seattle right now. This is a huge moment for Macdonald and the Seahawks team to return to greatness. Last time they played, Seattle’s offense exploded late despite the defensive shortcomings early on. This defense has looked about as great as you can ask for these last few weeks. Allowing just 9 points to the Niners in 2 games. This will also be a complete home field takeover, given that the rams don’t really have that many fans, and it’s of course in Seattle. Puka was extremely limited last week against a mediocre Bears defense. I expect Seattle to at least slow him down just enough to win this football game. Stafford has also looked a little shady this last month or so. With all things considered, I see Seattle winning this game and advancing to the Super Bowl. Let’s go!! Lmk if you’re tailing, thanks everyone \n\n\n\n\nIf you’d like to buy me a beer: [Venmo](https://venmo.com/u/Jay-Lawton-1) [CashApp](https://cash.app/$jaylaw930)",

Palmeiras looked sharp and converted their chances nicely to see the game out at 3-1, with the high pace of the game it was a breeze for corners, totalling 11 by the close of play - if you took the regular line like I mentioned well done or if you bought down appreciate the tail - either way we cashed!\n\nOn to todays pick, their H2H have given us goals for both sides 7/9 matchups; whilst the cards has gone under 5/last 6 for Brentford and 6/last 7 for Forest. Brentford currently sit 8th and Forest in 17th, Nottingham have the quality to score just not seeing results currently, as for Brentford they are in good form consistently finding goals with Thiago upfront being a huge contributor to this. I expect Forest to be wanting to stay clear of the relegation zone and want to put up a fight against a mid-table team. The referee for this match, Samuel Barrott is averaging 4.1 yellow cards this season, and due to the style of football both teams play I expect 2-3 cards but no more. I'm liking my odds for these, you can also take these as singles if you would like.\n\nI was also leaning towards an NFL pick but being a Seahawks fan I steered clear, lets hope both the championship games are a good watch! Have a wonderful day folks, lets make some money.\n\nBOL and always bet what you can afford to lose!",

As opposed, Allen is one of the stars of the formidable Bronco defense & he'll be facing Wilson (one of the least effective offensive lineman for the Patriots).

Silkeborg so far averaging around 9.80 total in the Danish league, at home jumps to above 10. Middelfart are one of the best corner generating teams in the 2nd league, getting around 10.60 total, and 9.90 away. ",

Yeah, I feel much more confident in Oviedo's ability to keep the scoreline respectable. This team, while being rock bottom doesn't really ship a lot of goals, and here's a fun stat for you: **50% of their games from Nov 3rd til Jan 4th ended 0-0 (4 out of 8 games played).** Crazy run. The earlier match between Barca and Oviedo this season also ended 3-1, and I think they're going to hold on strong again. Expecting a Barcelona win, but not by more than a goal, and I can even see Oviedo snatching a point off the overconfident Catalans.

In last week’s win against Buffalo, Denver became 12-2 in 1 score games this season. However, QB Bo Nix fractured his ankle ending his season. He will be replaced by backup Jarrett Stidham, who will be playing in his first game this season. He will be come just the 7th QB to start in the playoffs after not starting in the regular season, with the previous 6 having just a 1-5 record. Stidham has just 4 starts in his NFL career with just a 1-3 record. In his career, Stidham has a 4.1% interception rate on 197 passes. That ranks 90th/102 QB’s whove thrown 150+ passes Stidham entered the NFL. But he’s even worse when pressured, completing just 40% of his passes for 5.8 yards per pass & a 20.5% sack rate opposed to 70.7% of his passes for 8.1 yards per pass when not pressured. Now he faces a scary Patriots DLine that has a 52.1% pressure rate so far this playoffs, after a 40.3% pressure rate this year (7th but injured & now healthy). The Pats D has allowed just 6.4 yards per pass (6th) this year, but in the playoffs vs Justin Herbert & CJ Stroud they have only allowed 4.8 yards per pass & a 50% completion rate. A huge part of that is they just got back a healthy Christian Gonzale who is one of the best DB’s in the league. With Gonzalez on the field, the Pats D has allowed just an 83.4 QB rating, a 62.8% completion %, 6.0 yards per pass, & a 4.1% TD rate. With him off the field, those #s move to a 100.2 QB rating, a 69.9% completion %, 7.8 yards per pass, & a 4.9% TD rate. Stidham will have his hands full vs this defense. But even with Nix Denver’s offense ranked just 16th in points per drive (2.09) & 19th in success rate (41.5%) & punted as much as any team in the league. They punted on 39.3% of possessions (28th), failing to get a 1st down on 38.3% of them (29th). The Pats D has allowed just 1.67 points per drive (3rd) & has given up points on 30.8% of opponent possessions (3rd). This playoffs they have allowed just 1 TD on 24 possessions. The Pats are going to want to play a slow tempo game, not make any mistakes, & run the ball. Especially with the defensive minded Head Coach in Mike Vrabel.\n\nPats QB Drake Maye has been sacked 10 times for a brutal 13.9% sack rate, fumbling 6 times this playoffs. Maye’s 57 sacks this season is the 2nd most in the NFL. The Broncos are 3rd in the NFL in pressure rate (41.8%) & lead the NFL in sack rate (10.1%). With the Pats having a defense that is scorching hot facing a backup QB & Maye struggling with pressure & fumbles, the conservative defensive coach in Vrabel is going to want to put the ball on the ground. Especially with a in RB Rhamondre Stevenson who is playing the best football of his career right now. __Stevenson just became the FIRST player in the Super Bowl Era, over ANY 6 game span, to have 400+ rushing yards, +7.0 yards per carry, 4 rushing TD’s, 200+ receiving yards, +11.0 yards per catch, & 2 receiving TD’s. Since Week 16 he’s gone for 402 rush yards, 4 TDs, & a league-best +194 rush yards over expected. He’s has 11 explosive runs in that span, more than he had through the first 15 weeks. This led him to rank 5th in the NFL in Explosive Run % (6.9%).__ But things have flipped in the postseason. Stevenson has 26 carries for 123 yards (4.7 yards/carry), & 7 catches for 86 yards. While Henderson has just 21 carries for 52 yards (2.5 ypc), 2 catches for 7 yards. Last week vs the Texans who have one of the best run defenses in the NFL, Stevenson had 16 carries & played 40 snaps compared to Henderson’s 25, & that includes an entire quarter where Stevenson was out with an eye injury. Stevenson has been much harder to bring down as well. He has the most missed tackles forced in the playoffs (10). In the regular season Stevenson averaged 2.75 yards after contact per run (5th among RB’s) compared to Henderson’s 1.91 (42nd among RB’s ). Stevenson also averaged 0.23 missed tackles forced per run (5th) compared to Henderson’s 0.13 (33rd). In the receiving game, Stevenson is clearly the preferred option. Henderson only has 3 TOTAL catches in his past 5 games & is a poor pass blocker. Stevenson has gone 7 straight games with at least 2 catches & is one of the best pass blocking backs in the NFL. Stevenson has out touched Henderson 33-23 this postseason & that number will shift even more vs a tough Broncos defense that has allowed 4.5 yards/play (2nd), & 1.68 points per drive (4th), & has a 62.9% success rate (2nd). However, on the ground the numbers for Denver have actually been pretty poor towards the end of the season. Denver ranked 6th in the NFL EPA/rush allowed through Week 10. But they fell to 15th in that same metric in the background half of the year. Since Week 12 they are allowing the 12th most yards/carry (4.51), & are rank in the bottom 10 of explosive rush rates & success rates allowed. They just gave up 117 yards on 24 carries to James Cook on the Bills last week. __The Broncos have been particularly poor against man & gap rushing concepts, ranking bottom 10 in both ypc (4.51) & success rate. Since Week 12 they’ve given up 5.3 ypc to runs specifically between the tackles, 3rd worst in the NFL. New England runs these concepts at the 3rd highest rate in the NFL. Stevenson ranks #1 in the NFL in rushing yards over expected on runs between the tackles. Stevenson on man/gap runs (Last 7 Games): 62.8% Success Rate, 6.95 YPC, 4 TDs. All rank #1 in the NFL.__ The Broncos allowed 50+ yards to James Cook (117 yards), Travis Etienne (50 yards), & Josh Jacobs (73 yards), all of which are elite gap runners. Vrabel is going to attack this weakness.\n\nStevenson has hit 50+ rushing yards in 5 of his last 6 games, & with a rushing attempt line at 12.5 (also love the over on that), you can count on him to average at least 50+ yards per carry. The only way the Patriots lose this game is by turning the ball over. With Maye having 6 fumbles in 2 playoff games & now facing the pass rush in the league, Vrabel is going to have to run the ball to slow this defense down. Especially as the Broncos defense’s weak spot is on the ground in the gaps. I think Rhamondre eats here.\n\n__Rhamondre Stevenson o49.5 rushing yards__\n\nAppreciate the love!

Feels like the safer play and less risk if it’s a tight game.\n\nAtalanta have been in decent form lately… won 3 of their last 4 and only conceded 1 goal in that run. At home they usually control the game and create enough to score more than once.\n\nParma on the other hand struggle a lot going forward. Only 2 goals in their last 4 games, and one of those came when the other team had two red cards. Most games they just sit back and don’t offer much.\n\nThis line covers most scores I’m expecting 2-0, 2-1, 3-0, 3-1 etc.\nOnly real danger is a boring 1-0, but Atalanta usually don’t stop at one goal vs weaker teams, especially at home.\n\nNot trying to overthink it… better team, better form, home game, low scoring opponent. Simple play with decent value.\n\nGood luck to anyone riding with me on this one, hope it lands 🤞",

However, for this price? Yes please. Obviously for some safety you can take the games and set handicaps but I just think the straight ML is simply better value. \n\nBublik has been on a tear this year, making his top 10 debut and going 7-0 for the season, clinching the title in Hong Kong with a straight set victory over Musetti. He’s hardly recognisable from the inconsistent player he was just a year ago and his ranking will only increase with little points to defend until the clay season. Major lifestyle as well as playstyle changes have shown a really serious face to Bublik who hasn’t dropped a set so far at the Open, confirming his excellent form. He’s one of the best servers on tour and hits incredibly hard off both wings whilst also having the ability to possess incredible variety in his game to disrupt rhythm. Sascha genuinely has extraordinary talent with all the tools to succeed at the highest level and with both confidence and consistency it can be really hard to find the means of beating him. With how good his serving is I believe that he will have more chances on De Minaur’s return games as opposed to the opposite despite his “just” good return game, as a result of ADM’s “just” good serving. \n\nLet me reiterate that this will be far from a walk in the park but should really be priced closer to a pick’em in my opinion. De Minaur is the No. 6 and whilst he has some incredible qualities about him also comes with limitations. Higher floor than Bublik, lower ceiling. ADM performed well in his opening three rounds but I feel like the first set against Medjedovic (which the Serb won in a tiebreak) will be closest to the level Bublik will bring, Hamad having as usual tired out after a huge hitting set. The demon is arguably the best counterpuncher and mover on tour who loves to grind down opponents with his defensive skills which on paper would frustrate Bublik’s hyper-aggressive game. It produces some insane levels of consistency against worse opponents but the lack of raw power and of an offensive game leads to the Aussie losing almost every time he faces a better opponent, which I believe to be the case on form personally. He’s 0-13 against Sinner whose power overwhelms De Minaur every time they face and this version of Bublik will have a similar effect. Now I’m not comparing Sascha and Sinner per-say as Bublik does fold earlier in rallies but it’s the stylistic comparison that can be made. Whilst ADM may put loads of balls back to force the Kazakh to play an extra shot, often deep, and increase the chance of missing which could very well lead to an error-prone performance from his opponent on a bad day, the sheer speed that Bublik can consistently put on a ball may very well lead to him taking the upper-hand in exchanges on a good one. Based on form, there is no reason to believe he will be in a bad day. Sascha won both their encounters last year, including a battle back from 2-0 down at the French Open on his least favourite surface. This promises to be a big battle on Rod Laver Arena so make sure to get the popcorn out. BOL !",

Genuinely can’t see it not hitting. It’s landed in all of his Big bash games this league apart from one when he finished with 19 not out due to rain ending the game short. Smith’s form at the moment is undeniable. His last 5 matches he’s gotten: 65,37,54,100,19 not out. His only threat in my opinion is Jhye Richardson who should only bowl maximum of two out of the first 4 overs. After having a not so good outting while fielding in the second innings last game, the competitive nature of Smith will be on show in the grand final. \nBest of luck if tailing!",

They are still undefeated in matches but they have had to work for their victories. Domestically they have not been the strongest in the last few years and it's showing. T1 are very beatable.\n\nFearX on the other hand have been one of the biggest surprises of the first two weeks. They are punching way above their weight class, and are finding ways to win despite being behind. Their most recent test did end in an 0-2 defeat, but that match line does not paint the whole picture. They were competitive against Gen.G, the best team in the league, and they should've won at least one game.\n\nBoth teams have some of the slowest average map durations in the league. T1 average 33:02 per game, on Map 1 they average 32:20. FearX average 31:54 per game, on Map 1 they average \\~33:40. T1 are the favourites here but they have naturally slow tendencies; leaning on strong fundamentals and game management. FearX on the other hand try to push the agenda early, targetting botside to get Diable ahead. FearX have a relatively hard time converting early leads so they tend to slow it down until the midgame as well.\n\nThe key here will be the botside. FearX send a lot of attention that way, securing the early game and dragon count. T1 can be a bit psychotic at times, but when they are behind they let the opponents dictate the pace and force them to play perfectly to win the game. If they don't, they will snatch the victory away through sheer will. If FearX can get Diable ahead, and secure a few dragons, the over will be a breeze. Even if T1 get ahead early, FearX have shown they can stay and prolong games. I don't expect either team to get an insane lead early that snowballs out of control. Should be an exciting series.\n\n**Map 1 - Over or Exactly 31:30 Map Duration 2-Way (1.83) 2u to win 1.66u**",

With all the talk about the Seahawks 2 headed running game being slashed down to one, **LA have shown their own two headed attack is leaning one way themselves**.\n\nWe are going to challenge the best run D in the NFL - again. We are going to keep our faith in Kyren - again. I have to say, I’m no expert on line balance, but this number is genuinely 5/6 yards lower than I anticipated it would open at, and it has creeped there. **Personally I will be playing this as high as 75**.\n\nThe seasons work speaks for itself: **65 all purpose yards in ALL BUT ONE game this season. He had 95 on 23 touches last season, 96 on only 13 touches in week 11, and 85 on 26 touches 5 weeks ago**.\n\n*His rushing floor has been 46 yards which is low for this range*, but as I’ve emphasized a few times over the last few weeks he’s naturally become a part of the receiving game. **He’s had over 15+ receiving yards per game & 21 total targets in the last 5 weeks**. If Seattle DO show their run D card, Kyren is still showing himself as an option in Staffords progressions\n\nIf the Rams are winning, they are going to have to run the ball… if the Rams are losing the game, they will need to keep Kyren an option to keep Seattle guessing… basically either way **I can see Kyren easily getting 20+ touches tonight**.\n\nWhich means - once again - We’re going to fade the Corum effect. **He only had 6 touches last week**, and has been shaky in his on ball output when he’s gotten them in recent weeks. Playoff time means teams will rely on what they have faith in - **Blake hasn’t hit the ground running now in a few weeks**, as it feels like his inclusion into the overall game plan depends on how he starts. **As a result has clearly shifted into RB2 territory**. He’s still a threat to us, but it doesn’t feel as direct anymore.\n\nI feel like I’m repeating myself as alot of these details and stats have remained the same as the weeks have gone by. **Kyren has been a huge winner for me this year away from Reddit, to the tune of 91%**, let’s hope we can get one more.\n\nLast play review:\n\n***Fulham/Brighton BTTS (-155) 1.5u*** ✅\n\n(Game went to script essentially, a touch late to get there but it really never was in doubt.

West Ham finally started defending and kept him at bay the rest of the game. Great day in the Soccer thread, but we keep falling short on the POTD.\n\nI've taken Morgan Gibbs-White a few times with good success. He is the #10 for Forest and likes to take shots on. With Wood still out, he's the team's penalty taker and usually the captain. He had a tough game in Europa mid week, while I played his SOT there as well, which cashed in the first 10 minutes, he missed a penalty and wound up with 3 SOTs in a big 0-1 loss. I see him coming back for blood today and taking his shots to make up for the mid week match. \n\nI also like this because Igor Jesus is still questionable, and with limited other options there's a non-zero chance they throw MGW back up front as the striker. If they put on Big T or their new signing Lorenzo Lucca, I still expect MGW to take on plenty of shots as neither have had many EPL minutes. \n\nLets get back in the green, BOL and have a great Sunday!",

The Patriots are almost back to the Super Bowl. Stevenson has hit this in five straight, and I expect they'll rely on him heavily with Henderson struggling to be productive. The Broncos play a lot of man defense and blitz as much as anyone in the NFL (were leading the league late in the season with this). I expect quick throws and check downs from Maye. I look for the Patriots to capitalize on a mistake or two by the Broncos and jump to an early lead. They won't milk the clock early on, but slow meticulous drives to wear out the defense which favors more running back touches. Denver defense again the run (3.9 yards per carry for runbingbacks) is good, so I don't want to pick just the rushing prop as Stevenson has only gotten than three of the last five.",

Same reasoning applies here, only moreso than last week because the Broncos are starting a backup QB. New England will most likely be playing with a lead, so they'll be running the ball at least as often as they usually do. \n\n\nHenderson averages 9.5 carries per game, but in the last 12 that average has jumped to 10.5. He's cleared the 8.5 total in 11 of his last 12!\n\n\nThere was clearly a preference for his counterpart Stevenson last week against Houston, but the Patriots like to run the ball, especially with a lead, so there are plenty of carries for both of them, as we saw last week. Henderson has been the preferred back this year (180 vs 130 carries), but even if those percentages reverse again like last week, NE should be running enough to get Henderson double digit carries again. \n\n\nDenver does have a great run defense, and they allow only the 9th most rushing attempts per game with 24.2. A big part of that is playing with the lead though. In their 3 losses, they allowed 29 carries per game, and I do expect this to be a loss for them. The Denver defense is good, but the Houston defense was better than Denver, and they didn't have any issues falling behind so much that they had to abandon the run. I'm picking carries instead of yards to account for the possibility that NE hands it off many times in a row just to bleed the clock. Those runs are usually for 1 or 2 yards. \n\n\nEven if Stevenson gets most of the carries again (though he's averaging 2.5 fewer carries this year than Henderson), I don't think Henderson has any problems hitting his total again.\n\n\nThe other thing to note is that despite 50 more carries than Stevenson, he has only 1 fumble all year compared to Stevenson's 3. So if it comes time to milk the clock, ball security isn't an issue for Henderson.\n\n\nPatriots most likely win, so they won't be below their run attempts average from playing from behind, and if Henderson gets even a third of those 29 carries, he hits his over. Most importantly of all, again, 11/12 over this line, so I'm comfortable going back to the well. If Houston at full strength couldn't hold back Henderson from getting his carries, neither can Denver with a backup QB. \n\n\n\n\nTreveyon Henderson over 8.5 rushing attempts",

The Dallas Stars continue to be one of the most complete teams in the NHL, coming into this matchup fresh off a dominant 5-1 win over Toronto. Their depth is their greatest weapon, as they can roll four lines that all pose a scoring threat, combined with a defense that ranks in the top tier for goals allowed.\n\nWhile the Red Wings have shown flashes of brilliance at home, they face a massive challenge against a Dallas squad that excels in puck possession and neutral zone transition. With Jake Oettinger expected in net, providing a significant goaltending advantage, and the Stars' superior special teams play, I expect Dallas to control the tempo of this game. Dallas has a history of performing well in this building, and their disciplined structure should be enough to secure the road victory.\n\nPICK: Stars ML (1.78) 3U",

With **Jokubaitis and Elias Harris out**, and **Baldwin questionable**, their ball-handling depth and perimeter defense take a clear hit. That forces heavier minutes on a short rotation and creates problems against teams that play aggressively through guards.\n\nHapoel are exactly that type of team. **Micic and Blakeney** consistently pressure the ball, attack mismatches and generate advantages in pick-and-roll. Bayern have struggled in these situations all season, especially away from home, and without their usual defensive personnel it becomes even harder to contain penetration and late-clock creation.\n\nFrom a physical standpoint, Hapoel usually raise their intensity at home and push the pace in the second half. Bayern tend to compete early but often lose defensive structure as the game progresses, particularly when forced to defend in transition and rotate heavily.\n\nThe line at **-5.5** feels short considering the difference in guard depth, defensive matchups and home-court impact. Bayern can stay within range for stretches, but over 40 minutes Hapoel should be able to create separation and cover this number.",

This also is a pivotal match for the group as Senegal are clear favourites so whoever wins this game will likely come second.",

      "text": "**Record**: 8-7 (+3.28u) \n\n**Last Pick**: (NBA) Jokic O 22.5 R+A vs. Utah (W)\n\n**Event**: (NBA) Houston Rockets vs. Los Angeles Clippers 11:10pm ET\n\n**Pick**: SGP: **Alphren Sengun 8+ Rebounds & Rockets Alt -2.5** | 3u to win 3.27u | +109 on FD\n\n**Reason**: Houston (17-9) meets the Clippers (7-21) for the 2nd time in less than 2 weeks. Houston is on the second to last game of their 6 game road trip where they have had some rough performances. The league completely screwed them sending them to Denver (OT loss), then to New Orleans (OT loss), right back to Denver which they came out with a 14 point win, then to Sacramento on Sunday, third times a charm right, nope, a complete collapse and lost in OT by 1, the good ole Dennis Schroder dagger.\n\n**The Clippers are unfortunately without their most efficient player, Ivica Zubac, for at least the next 2-3 weeks.** He exited the game early against the Lakers with a sprained ankle. He was averaging around 15-11-2 on 32 minutes per game. This gives Sengun more favorable matchups with the Clippers turning to Brook Lopez and John Collins. **In their meeting a little less than 2 weeks ago, Sengun finished with 22-15-5** against Zubac who put up 33 points and 7 rebounds. Sengun came back from a 2 game hiatus earlier this month and has had 3/5 games over 10 rebounds, one of those games being the OT loss to Denver where he finished with a triple double. **On the season, Sengun is averaging 9.2 rebounds a game; the Clippers are 29th in the NBA in rebounds per game averaging 49.5. Houston ranks 1st in RPG averaging 60.2 on the year. Houston also ranks 1st in total rebounding percentage (54.9%), and the Clippers are 16th in that category (49.6%). The Clippers rank 25th in defensive rebounds per game, Sengun is averaging 3 offensive rebounds per game**, and without Zubac, Sengun will have many more chances to give the Rockets second chance points. The Clippers rank 28th in offensive rebounds (9.9 per game) and shoot around 48% from the field. This will give the Rockets the advantage they have maintained on the season and again, no Zubac really hurts the Clippers who rank bottom 5 in rebounding. \n\nTo cover -2.5, the Rockets will need to use the glass to their advantage. The difference in team rebounding puts the Clippers at a major disadvantage. The only thing affecting the Rockets is them being tired on their 6 game road trip. Houston averages 121 points per game (3rd) to the Clippers 110 (28th). **The Clippers have been underdogs 14 games this year and have only won 2/14.** Yes, Rockets will be playing tired, but they absolutely need a win in one of these last 2 games of the road trip to go back home with some satisfaction and motivation, the Clippers give them the best opportunity. **The Rockets average margin of victory is 8.8ppg opposed to the Clippers -5.4ppg.** The Clippers have a hard time relying on their bench who average 31.4ppg and their depth has become much more limited without Zubac. With KD playing 40+ minutes in each of the last 3 games, we may see his minutes limited if the game starts slowly pulling away. Though again, I see this game as a crucial win for the Rockets to bring them some life. **The Rockets also are happy to have forward Tari Eason back in the lineup** who had 16 points on 6-8 shooting against the Kings. \n\n**Brief summary:** Sengun, who is averaging 9.2rpg should easily record 8 rebounds against a struggling offensive and defensive rebounding Clippers team without their leading rebounder, Ivica Zubac. The Rockets should see more second chance opportunities and look to take one on the road to regain some confidence after some deflating losses recently. \n\nBOL.",

I really like riding with the Louisville Cardinals as they have looked really solid this year with some impressive wins as they have beaten two college football playoff teams as they have beaten James Madison 28-14 and pulled off a very impressive road win against Miami 24-21. They have one common opponent with the Toledo Rockets as both of these teams have faced off against the Kentucky Wildcats and the outcome of those two games were vastly different. When the Rockets played Kentucky they lost to the Wildcats 16-24 but when the Cardinals played them they defeated Kentucky 41-0. This Cardinals team is much different than this Rockets team as this squad out of the ACC is faster, stronger and more talented than this squad out of the MAC. A huge key factor as well in this one is that Toledo will be playing without head coach Jason Candle who took the UConn job and without starting quarterback Tucker Gleason who is out with a back injury. I also really like going with the UCF Knights as I think they should easily handle the FAU Owls in this one. UCF has put together some very impressive wins as they have a quad 1 win against Texas A&M in a 86-74 win, a solid win against Pittsburgh and they are undefeated against quad 3 and 4 teams this year. Their only loss comes to nationally ranked Vanderbilt and I actually thought they played very well in that games putting up 93 points and outscoring the Commanders in the second half. The Knights have one common opponent as the Owls as both of these teams played FGCU as the Knights defeated the Eagles 102-80 and the Owls defeated the Eagles 81-76. The Knights lead the Eagles in points per game, field goal percentage, free throw percentage, offensive rebounds and defensive rebounds so I like rolling with the Knights in this one.\n\nPrediction: 27-17 Louisville, 82-72 UCF\n\nLast pick: 🏈Texas A&M -2.5💩Defense played great but Marcel Reed played his worst and most inaccurate game of his career.\n\nBest of luck to everyone tailing and remember to bet responsibly!

As a result, we delve into the quarter final of the competition as Premier League leaders Arsenal host fellow Londoners Crystal Palace.\n\nToday’s selection leans heavy on the goal scoring trends between & aside these teams share. As usual I like to get the *roadblock* out of the way: last time Arsenal played Palace, it was a grinding, evenly matched 1-0 Arsenal result. Neither team found much attacking flow.\n\nMakes no sense to bet on this, right? Well, there’s good trends: Goals galore. Palace have **cleared 2.5 goals 5/5**, meanwhile Arsenal **clear the requisite 1.5 in 11/12** - they alone have **scored 2 goals in 8/9** home matches. \n\nRecent history is kind to this line as well, with Arsenal winning **7/10** matches between these two, and the **1.5 total clearing in 8 of their last 9**. Basically, I’m not saying we are gonna see a wild 4-3 match by any means, but a 2-0 or 2-1 Arsenal match is in my vision.\n\nFun fact: I forgot yesterdays fun fact, so here is 3: My brother is a huge Arsenal supporter, and only 13 km separates these two clubs, closer than the Yankees & Mets, \n\nLast play review:\n\nNBA - Utah @ Denver, Svi Mykhailiuk o1.5 3PM (-108) 1u ✅\n\n(All I can say is sweat free, FULL of perspiration. Worst basketball I’ve ever seen, and I once coached U14 girls basketball guys - this was that, maybe worse. For Svi, maybe the worst 5 minutes of basketball he played all season to start the game. Then he sat on the bench for almost the entire half. 43-15 Denver at the end of the first quarter, Svi 5 min, 0-3, pine. Flashbacks of Hendo last night. I can hear my grandfather laughing at my pain.\n\nThen he re enters, and snipes the 2 before halftime… gambling)\n\nBOL if you’re tailing, and if not BOL in general!",

Some of the best times to find great lines is during international soccer tournaments. AFCON, being the soccer tournament for African nations provides great spots to make money. Although today was not the first day of the tournament, it is the first day where I have found a line I like. Nigeria come into the match not playing up to their full potential. World Cup qualifying presented its struggles, but I feel that a full strength Nigerian team will still be able to handle Tanzania. I cap this line around -250 range so when I saw the line had not yet reached -200 I knew I had to play. Normally, I would look to play a spread here , but do to Nigeria struggling I could see a 1-0 win as the score line, which would still cash with the ML. The line is a bit chalky, but there is still value as Nigeria should cruise to an easy victory early in AFCON.\n\n  \nOverall: Again like I said almost everything will be played to win 1u. I will never be laying 5 units hammers and anyone who is consistently laying 5 units should really increase their unit size. Bankroll management is a key part of being profitable in sports betting, and if you are laying 5 units every play, you are not betting responsibly (or you just need to increase your unit size). Also the laying 5 units a play thing is misleading to people who tail and to people who are new to the space. \n\nIf you would like to chat more about my play or my analysis comment below or just send me a dm. I enjoy talking with people about other potential plays as well, even if they may go against one of my plays. More opinions and breakdowns lead to sharper bets. \n\nBet responsibly.",

I believe this is one of them. \n\nToronto has scored just 177 points in their last two games (88.5 PPG), including a humiliating 81-point output against the 7-19 Nets, and ranks 29th in three-point shooting at 31.1% while missing RJ Barrett. Miami is 10-4 at home and leads the NBA in pace (104.25), which they'll use to expose Toronto's sluggish offense that plays at 99.58 pace. Even without Herro and Jovic, Miami still has Norman Powell, Bam Adebayo (18.3 PPG, 9.4 REB), and Jaime Jaquez Jr. providing efficient scoring. Miami commits the 3rd-fewest turnovers in the league and sends opponents to the free throw line less than anyone, while Toronto's only real advantage is offensive rebounding against Miami's 25th-ranked defensive rebounding. The Heat will push tempo at home, force Toronto into a track meet they can't win, and cover the 4.5 points comfortably.",

Penguins at Maple Leafs, 4 pm ET 12/23/25\n\nRecord: 7-9\nNet Units: -5.4 Units\n\nExplanation: Toronto can beat Pittsburgh tomorrow because their most repeatable edge in this matchup is usually offensive ceiling + special-teams leverage, and those are exactly the things that tend to decide NHL games that aren’t perfect 60-minute efforts. \n\nThe Leafs’ roster construction is typically built around high end finishing and power-play conversion, which matters a ton against a Penguins team that has been more vulnerable when games turn into track meets or when they’re forced to defend multiple areas for long stretches. \n\nIf Toronto can get more shot attempts, more inner-slot chances, fewer odd-man rushes against—they put Pittsburgh in a spot where the Pens have to keep up offensively, and that’s where Toronto’s depth scoring and top-line star power can separate. \nToronto needs to start fast, get Pittsburgh chasing the game (which increases defensive risk), stay disciplined enough to avoid giving the Pens repeated power plays, and then let Toronto’s own power play be the difference if whistles happen. Add in that goaltending volatility often swings this specific matchup—Toronto doesn’t need 40 saves if they control the slot and limit second chances—so if the Leafs get even league-average goaltending while generating the higher-quality looks, they’re in a strong position to win.",

Perhaps it's stubbornness, inertia, or arrogance, but they seem to be daring me to go double or nothing. I will oblige.\n\nI made this same pick two days ago for this same matchup, so I am repeating much of my reasoning below for comprehensiveness, but now with updated stats.\n\nHere we have an almost perfect storm of ATS records.\n\nThe Hawks are now 4-9 ATS at home, 5-10 ATS as the favorite, and **0-6 ATS as the home favorite**.\n\nThe Bulls are now 11-3 ATS as underdogs, and 6-2 ATS as road underdogs.\n\nThe Bulls have now won both of their prior matchups outright against the Hawks, despite being 2.5-point (in Chicago) and 4.5-point (in Atlanta) underdogs. Both matchups included Trae Young and he is expected to play in today's game as well.\n\nTrae is a great player and had a strong game against the Bulls last time but it wasn't enough. He is a liability on defense and can't do anything against 6'8\" Giddey who can get to the rim ~~out~~ at will, drawing doubles and initiating endless drive-and-kick plays. Trae is also useless in transition defense and the Bulls are doing really well on fastbreaks, especially with the return of Ayo Dosunmu.\n\nIf you are concerned about the Bulls' ability to beat the same team twice in a row in a \"baseball series,\" rest assured that (1) they don't have to win, only cover a +4.5-point spread, and (2) they accomplished that very feat against the Cavs just last week.\n\nThere is no better ATS fade than the Hawks as home favorites, and the Bulls make it even more appealing. Obviously anything can happen but the evidence points overwhelmingly at this pick.\n\n**Edited** to update previous POTD and record, and fix a typo",

The Heat will be at home here, and Kel’el and Norm continue to look really good, so with the supporting cast of Wiggins, Bam and Davion, I am confident they can stifle the Raptors’ middling offense. In terms of recent form, the Raptors just got destroyed by the Brooklyn Nets, and had lost to the Cs by double digits prior to that. They've won only 3 of their last 10 (and only 2/L10 ATS). The Heat haven't been much better but put up much better fights in their last couple games against the Knicks and Cs. \n\n \n\n*If you’ve enjoyed these picks, tips are always appreciated:* [Coffee Link](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/TheBrat)",

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 5-11-3 *We come out empty-handed once again. In an unlucky turn of events, Levadiakos did what was expected of them and comfortably saw off a convincing 2-0 win against the lowly Panserraikos; sadly, though, Bologna let us down and played like they'd never seen a ball before. Despite all that, I'm determined to make it out of this slump, and I've (perhaps rather ambitiously) eyed up just the perfect event to help me achieve this goal - the AFCON*\n\n**Last Five:** ❌❌🅿️❌❌\n\n**Event:** AFCON, DR Congo v Benin, 7:30 am EST\n\n**POTD:** Benin Win or Draw +110, 2 units\n\n**Write Up:** The beloved AFCON is an unpredictable tournament with historically tight matches, and that is exactly why I'm backing Benin to cause a minor upset in today's outing. DR Congo enter this matchup as slight favorites, boasting stronger recent results, a deeper squad, and a greater tournament pedigree. However, football matches are never played on paper, and that is especially true when it comes to the AFCON, where things constantly refuse to follow the script. Let me emphasize that Benin are far from a pushover. They finished **level on points with Nigeria** in their World Cup qualifying group and **just a point off the eventual group winners, South Africa**, proving **they can sustain a competitive streak against highly ranked African nations** (not to mention their group was slightly tougher than that of the DR Congo). What's worth noting is that Zimbabwe finished bottom of Benin's group on measly 5 points and a goal difference of -7 (compared to Benin's 3rd place finish on 17 pts and a GD of +1), yet held their own against Egypt, so why couldn't Benin go a step further and snatch a point off their opponents? *I certainly don't see a reason not to take this value bet at the juicy + odds that cover not one, but two outcomes.* As for their key players, amid some absences, **Jodel Dossu is likely to lead the attack with creativity,** while **Rodrigue Kossi and Sessi D'Almeida fulfill the central midfielder roles,** serving as an **outlet for build-up and transition** (key **Benin strength**). The DR Congo players are expected to control the match flow and tempo, but I can absolutely see Benin sustain any and all pressure being thrown their way, while **killing them off with quick transitions.** Their **form looks good** too (they even **pushed Morocco** all the way in a recent friendly), so I can't see why they wouldn't give the DR Congo a serious run for their money. Trying to save one's record in AFCON of all places is always a challenging task, but one I'm certainly up for, and I expect a cheeky point (or more) to finally break out of this massive, unexpected downtrend. Going with just the measly 2 units today. BOL if you do tail and let's cash out together ☘️",

Regardless when I see the stats I simply cannot ignore it whatsoever, no matter the outcome that I don’t control. I would stake a lot more units on this but keeping it disciplined until the new year where in 2026 we’ll be hoping for big things. 15 games into the season and Scandicci are in second spot whilst Cuneo are 10th (out of 14). So this isn’t even a case of a fully dominant team top of the league playing against some dead-beat rock bottom side like this line would suggest. This corresponds roughly to their standings last year where the home team finished third and the away side 11th. Scandicci have gone over the line in 13 of their last 14 home league matches (93%). Meanwhile, Cuneo have cleared in their last 22/23 away league matches (96%). Statistically + logically, this is arguably the best play I’ve put out and I struggle to find why the line is set so low. To be fair the reverse fixture in October lost by 0.5 but not for the reason you might think of - Cuneo actually won 3-0 which is simply anomalous (odds are @41.00 for it). Looking past this, the line has been covered in 12/14 (86%) H2H league matches, including the last 9/10 (90%).

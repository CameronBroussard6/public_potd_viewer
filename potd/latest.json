      "text": "Record: 32-25 (+22.32u)\n\nLast 10:💰✖️💰💰✖️💰✖️✖️💰💰\n\nLast POTD:  🏈 Saints ML (-130) 💰\n\nWriteup: Thought this was chalked by halftime, but Saints came back in the second half to win it. Tyler Shough will be ROTY.\n\nToday’s POTD: 🏈 Blake Corum TD (+155).\n\nGame starts at 8:15pm EST. Bet 1.5u\n\nWriteup: Taking a calculated shot at a solid plus money play with Rams running back Blake Corum scoring a tuddy. \n\nCorum has scored in 4 straight games with 5 touchdowns in those games. This is largely due to increased usage over the 2nd half of the season. He is currently getting 30% of the carries for the season, and this number is much higher over the last few weeks as the Rams look to take some work off of their starting running back, Kyren Williams, before the playoffs. Corum has also had over 25 touches inside the 20 yard line this season, and again, all of these numbers have been inflated due to increased usage over the last 5 weeks or so.\n\nThe Rams are going up against the Atlanta Falcons, whose run defense is much weaker than their pass defense. They have given up rushing touchdowns at one of the higher rates in the league this season, with 8 different teams scoring a rushing touchdown against them.\n\nThe Rams are also favored by over a touchdown in this one, giving Corum even more rushing opportunities and opportunities to score. Even if Kyren Williams gets more of the work and the yards, the Rams have really liked using Corum near the goal line to smash it up the middle for a touchdown right after.\n\n50 total points are expected in this one, and it wouldn’t surprise me if both running backs find the endzone. Give me the one who’s been taking a lot of the redzone work recently as the Rams look to keep everyone healthy before the playoffs.\n\nRemember to only bet what you can afford to lose, and BOL!",

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 17-15-3 (Avg Odds +129)\n\n**Previous Pick:** Dominic Calvert-Lewin ATGS (+185) ✅️\n\n**Today's Event:** England Championship (Soccer) | Coventry vs Ipswich (10:00 AM PST)\n\n**Pick:** **WAIT FOR LINEUP CONFIRMATION 1 HOUR BEFORE KICKOFF**Jaden Philogene 1+ SOT (-140) 1.4 units to win 1 unit\n\n**Write Up:** Back in the green yesterday as Calvert-Lewin scores a goal just after halftime to make it 6 games in a row with a goal. Truly incredibly stuff by the guy and a great +185 cash for us to end the weekend. \n\nNo EPL today, but I do like this huge England Championship (2nd tier) match between 1st place Coventry and 3rd place Ipswich. As you guys know, I try to find the best value in our plays and try not to take picks under even money (this is only our 2nd play less than +100). That said, I really like this play and, while I'd normally add the Coventry striker and make this a Parlay, it's a toss up between who will start so I'm just going to take this straight. Definitely staying away from ML here as this could go either way. \n\nJaden was sold to Ipswich from Aston Villa last year as Villa wasn't using them and Ipswich had to clean house after being demoted to the Championship. He has really come into his own for Ipswich as he is currently their top scorer with 8 goals, having started 17 of 22 matches. I like the value on this play because Jaden has cleared this in 3 of his last 4 games, hitting 2 SOTs in two of these games including one a few days ago. This is likely one of the biggest games of the season for Ipswich, as they are in the thick of the promotion end of the table. Jaden has been a real bright spot for Ipswich and I expect him to have a big game today. \n\nJaden did just start a game on Boxing day, making this a 2nd game in 4 days for Ipswich. But he came off at 60 minutes and I really can't see them resting him in this massive game. That said, I will repeat, if your book does not void SOT plays for a player not starting, **please wait for lineups 1 hour before kickoff**. We have been hooked by some very strange lineup exclusions and there's a nonzero chance this could happen here again. All that said, this has hit in one of the matches he did not start, so I dont hate it if he comes on as a sub. \n\nBOL and hope everyone has a great Monday!!",

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 6-16-3 *Well, what do you even say after that? Absolutely gutted. Against the grain, I picked Mozambique to win or draw against Gabon - had to listen to a lot of snarky remarks as per usual, but I was calm and collected as I trusted my research and truly believed Mozambique could pull off an upset. And they did make us proud. We just needed a draw, but they went a step further, completely outplayed Gabon, and won... except, they cooked a bit too much in the process, killing my Under 3.5 leg. What even is my luck atp, but I won't let this deter me from trying even harder - the analysis is getting better, the results have, in fairness, been super close as of late, and it's only a matter of time I get back on the winning side. New week, new opportunities to do just that. Sticking to the AFCON because despite all the mishaps, I'm honestly hooked on the drama and I've identified the perfect pick to land us on a winning path*\n\n**Last Five:** ❌❌✅❌❌\n\n**Event:** AFCON, Zimbabwe v South Africa, 11:00 am EST\n\n**POTD:** Zimbabwe Win or Draw +110, 1.5 units\n\n**Write Up:** Does Zimbabwe ring a bell? Well, they helped break my losing streak by snatching a point against Angola, so just from that angle alone, I really enjoy having them in my POTD. While South Africa do enter this match as favourites on paper, Zimbabwe might very well be there to spoil the party in this crucial Group B tie. These two sides are meeting in the AFCON finals for the first time, but their H2H history outside of this tournament shows how tight their rivalry truly is. Here's a fun stat for y'all: Out of 19 previous encounters, Zimbabwe have won six, drawn five, and lost eight, proving time and time again that they’re far from pushovers when they meet South Africa.\n\nZimbabwe arrive with **momentum and real scoring confidence,** despite a tough opening loss; they earned their first point of the tournament with a **1-1 draw against heavy favorites Angola**, with striker **Knowledge Musona continuing his important role in attack**. Musona is now among Zimbabwe’s all-time AFCON scorers, and his presence upfront gives the team a genuine goal threat - he's super difficult to mark and should have a couple of pops at goal today. Meanwhile South Africa, for all their technical quality, sure have shown vulnerability at the back, **conceding in three straight matches** and failing to assert control in some key phases of the build-up play, as well as **struggling to break down defensively lined up teams,** as we saw against a 10-men Egypt, where they'd **continuously cross the ball to nobody in particular,** shoot from ridiculous angles, and even attempt an overhead kick from outside the box. Against a disciplined **Zimbabwe side that can sit compact and break quickly** on the counter, that defense could crumble.\n\nImportantly, this match matters equally for both teams’ progression hopes. Zimbabwe can edge into the knockout stages with a positive result, giving them extra motivation and belief. South Africa’s inconsistency with just the one solitary win in their last five AFCON matches in open play suggests they’re not immune to an odd slip up despite being favourites.\n\nIn a match likely to be tight, tactical, and low-scoring *(but nope, not touching the goal line after yesterday's debacle),* Zimbabwe might just have enough in their tank to avoid defeat. I do like the BTTS angle too, so if you take that, I don't mind it, but I'm not sticking any extras to this pick - learnt my lesson the hard way. Despite everything that's been going on as of late, I'm pretty confident in this pick. It'd be perfect if Zimbabwe could bail us out yet again. BOL and let's get a grip on this AFCON madness once and for all ☘️",

      "text": "POTD Record 15-10 (+5.02u)\n\nSunday’s Pick - ❌ Saquon Barkley TD +100 (1u to win 1u)\n\nMonday’s Pick - Matthew Stafford o2.5 passing TDs +147 (1u to win 1.47u)\n\nWith Drake Maye’s big game on Sunday, the Rams will want to get Stafford TDs through the air to help with his chances to win MVP. He is currently the betting favorite, but there is still a chance it goes to Maye if they get the number 1 seed and Stafford has a couple down games to end the year. I expect to see more passing along the goal line to bump up those numbers.\n\nAs far as their opponent, they’ve been giving it up through the air at a pretty high rate and they don’t have a ton to play for. That said, they’ve also played up to their opponents at times throughout the year, so they could also keep this close and give Stafford more opportunities to score TDs\n\nGood Luck",

Pick cashes and onto the next **FT: Sporting 4-0 Rio Ave**\n\n**Event:** England League 1 (Soccer) - Bradford vs Port Vale (19:45 GMT)\n\n**Today's Pick:** Bradford to win @ 1.66 (1 unit)\n\n**Write Up:** Today I'm going down to League 1 which is usually the lowest I'll go in the English pyramid before it starts to turn into a bit of a free for all. **3rd place Bradford City** host **bottom of the table Port Vale** as they continue their positive start to life in League 1 following their promotion from League 2 last season. They sit just **4 points behind league leaders Cardiff City** and only **1 point behind second place Lincoln** who they'll be hoping to leapfrog due to their game in hand. Port Vale too came up from League 2 last season but now sit bottom of League 1, **10 points from safety** and **without a league win since late September**.\n\nBradford City sit **2nd in the current form table** winning **4 of their last 6** games whilst **drawing 1** and **losing 1**. Their loss came to **12th place Leyton Orient** whilst they drew to **6th place Bolton Wanderers** at the end of November. The Bantams left it late to beat 18th place Wigan on boxing day and a win here today will make it 4 home wins on the trot. Bradford are the **4th best home team** in league 1 winning **8 of their 11 games** played on home turf this season and only **losing 1** which was against 21st place Burton Albion (not their best day at the office clearly). They have **scored 19 and conceded 10** at their home ground bringing their goal scoring numbers to **1.73 a game** at home whilst only **conceding 0.91**. Despite being in much better form than the visitors, they have only beaten them in **2 of their previous 10** encounters which they'll be hoping to make 3 after today's game.\n\nVisiting Port Vale are the **least in form team in the league** winning none of their last 6 whilst drawing 2 and losing 4 in the process. Most recently being thumped **5-0 by 7th place Huddersfield**, they've lost back to back games and as mentioned previously are **without a win since September**. They have actually **only won 3 games** **all season** having played 21, **losing 12 of those**. The only positive for Port Vale going into this game is that 2 of their 3 wins have come on the road but they are still the **5th worst travelling team** in the league. Their defense actually hasn't been completely awful considering their position in the table as they **concede 1.38 goals** per game with that **rising to 1.55** when playing on the road. Where Port Vale have failed this season is scoring goals. They've scored **the least amount in the entire division** averaging an extremely underwhelming **0.62 goals** per game rising slightly to **0.73 when playing away**. Overall this has amounted to an abysmal **13 goals scored all season** across their 21 games. For comparison the next worst scoring team is Exeter City with 21. Combine this with the **3rd best defense in the league** in Bradford City and hopes are not high for the visitors.\n\nWhilst this shouldn't be a trouncing by Bradford they should have enough to get over the line for a comfortable 1 or 2-0 victory especially with the added motivation of chasing Cardiff in first and Lincoln in second who have a difficult fixture away at 9th place Barnsley which the Bantams will want to capitalise on.\n\nI enjoy making these so please leave feedback and thoughts in the comments as I love learning and having a good football discussion. Also do let me know if you're tailing and BOL for those who are.\n\n*Edit: Having to paste in 2 different blocks as reddit doesn't like my long essays lol*",

In their last match, they got 3 shots on target, but they received a red card at halftime, causing the pace to shift. Match before against Zimbabwe, they managed 11 shots on target total and I'm seeing them back at their best today.\n\nAngola have played 2 games so far in AFCON, and their opponents have both had 4 shots on target. Now facing the best side in their group, I see the over being our friend here and great value. Even with Egypt qualifying for the next phase I see them having too much talent for an Angola side that cannot qualify.\n\n**BOL**",

This is solely based on stats. \n\nAl-Rayyan, 1st place in the league - 8-1 score, and 5-0 at home, Al-Gharafa 2-7 and 1-4 as guests. The home team is a power house in the league, 18 titles, and they have a 7 win streak against Al-Gharafa. The latest win was on 04.12, where they won by 16 points as guests. Both teams have 2-3 US players and 1 or 2 other international players.\n\nThe interesting part in the league, if I checked it correctly, is the fact that Al-Gharafa plays all their games with 7 players in the roster (at least in their last 5-6 games I checked). I have no idea why, or if only these players and not all that played are listed on the scoreboard (flashscore).\n\nThey for sure do use players in Thibodeau style, 38-40 minutes of playing time seems to be a common thing in this league.\nAl-Rayyan seems to do better there.\nThey use at least 9 players, and their top 2-3 players are simply put, much better, and this gives them a big advantage.\n\nBack to 1 unit, played at pinnacle.",

Things since then haven't gone better for the Jets with now 5 losses in a row with Hellebuyck starting in net for all of them. Meanwhile the Oilers are looking back to form with McDavid dominating the league again and Connor Ingram being pretty good ever since he replaced Jarry. They lost vs the Flames yesterday but they played a sloppy game after coming back from their Christmas break and I don't expect them to do the same this time especially since the Oilers tend to put a way better effort after a loss (they won 5 games in a row after a loss).

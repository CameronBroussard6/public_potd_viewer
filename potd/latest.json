I thought about initially doing his over on PRA's, but taking only his points is a more pure bet. He gets the ball, he shoots a lot and is a high usage player for the Sixers.*\n\n* *Earlier this year when they played the Pistons, Maxey was 33, 4, and 7. Edgecombe had 11 points, and tonight, he is a GTD. If Edgecombe is out, this is huge for Maxey's over on points*\n* *Ausar Thompson remains out for the Pistons + a favorable matchup for Maxey and the Sixers. Pistons are in the middle of the league in terms of team defense - Ranks 26th in PPG allowed*\n* *I do like that the Sixers are on the road tonight - Maxey will have to have a big game for them to stay close and to potentially walk away with the victory. I do think it will be a close game a majority of the night, which puts Maxey in a great position to play around 36-38 minutes.*\n* *Cade Cunningham is questionable for tonight's game with his hip injury - I believe if he is confirmed out, the line jumps to 31-33 points for Maxey* \n* *Maxey scored his season low, 22 points, against the Celtics on Tuesday night, and I expect a nice little bounce back for him tonight on the road.* \n\n*With a lot of injuries and question marks surrounding who will be suiting up tonight for both teams, I think Maxey is the play here. I do believe this bet will come down to the wire (if Cade plays) and should be a fun, exciting game to watch.*\n\n***Tyreese Maxey O29.5 Points***\n\n*Tips are appreciated; proceeds will be going towards my student loans.*\n\nVenmo: u/claysmiith\n\nPayPal: u/claysmiith",

      "text": "**POTD Record 45-39-2**\n\nWell that sucked. Total humiliation. Ugly, and pathetic if i am being honest. I haven't went back through, but i am pretty sure half of my losses this season were when i bet the Cavs. I think I am 0-3 or 0-4 when picking them, and as a life long cavs fun that is so fucking frustrating. I know i said it last time I took an L tailing them, but I need to take a break. Losing money, and wasting real emotional energy on a November nba game, is not something i enjoy. I love the cavs, and think highly of them this season, but theyre a mess and I shouldnt have expected their recent combacks to equal that they have figured something out.\n\nAnyways, back at it, and even though there are a slew of games on, only one jumps out to me.\n\n**Spurs -2.5**\n\nGoing back and firing on matchup that took place just a few days ago. Same team, same location, and looks like basically the same lineups. GSW took the W in that matchup, with curry dropping 44(only 5-16 from 3), Jimmy with 28, and Moody coming in around 20pts. On the spurs side, Wemby had one of his best games in his young career with a 31/15/10 triple double. Fox on the other hand sturggled, with his worst game since his return scoring 13 on 5/14 shooting. Castle played well (seems like he always does lately), and the rest of their starters played decent too with 6 guys scoring over 10pts. \n\nI expect spurs to have the same production as they did last game, but think they'll be able to keep butler and curry around their averages, rather than the explosion they had in their matchup a few days back. GSW is 2-6 ATS away from home, while also ranking in the bottom of the league in a lot of key offensive stats. On the other side, they are pretty similar, giving up points, free throws, 2pters and 3s at a high rate. Spurs on the other hand on paper are top of the league in majoirty of categories. \n\nI will say the part that worries me is the rate the spurs give up 3s. I mean in their matchup the other day, GSW had 3 guys hit 5+ 3s (curry, butler, and moody), and gave up 21 3s in the game. GSW did shoot 57 of them, so % wise nothing crazy, however thats the angle i see GSW being able to exploit. This is an Amazon primetime game, so I am hopefully Wemby has another legendary performance to add to his already incredible season so far. \n\nThis line has been odd so far. Opened at spurs -1.5, dropping all the way to spurs -3.5 for a short period of time, before landing at the 2.5 its at now. Approx 60% of the tickets are on GSW, which makes sense as they just won outright in an identical situation a few days back. \n\nOverall, nothing too sharp on this play, but just a bet on Wemby to dominate, and spurs to click with Fox back in the lineup. Also betting on GSW stars having a down game compared to their matchup a few days ago. Always scary betting against curry, but again really like this play.",

Also want to note that a 16th (out of 18) Maple Leafs over has hit the bank account.\n\nToday's play is based on the Hurricanes bouncing back at home after a thumping against the Capitals (1-4 loss) a few days ago and Thatcher Demko being out for a few weeks. Rod Brind'Amour is a great coach and I expect the Canes to take care of business against a Canucks team with a laundry list of injuries including Quinn Hughes, Victor Mancini, Derek Forbort, Teddy Blueger, Filip Chytil, Nils Hoglander and Guillaume Brisebois. \n\nThe Canucks will likely be starting Kevin Lankinen, who has had a less than ideal start to the season (3.57 GAA/.885 Save %) against a top 3 team in goals per game in the Hurricanes.",

      "text": "Record: 9-2-1  \nLast POTD: Anaheim Ducks over 2.5 Goals (-155) ✅  \nToday's Pick: Alexander Zverev over 12.5 Games (-160)\n\nDucks come out flat and lose to Detroit, who I had pegged as overrated.  Surprising result, but that's why we took the safer TT over 2.5 goals instead of the suspiciously priced ML.\n\nI swear I don't always take lines juiced to the 150-160 range but I'm doing it again today because this one looks too good to pass up.  Looks so good in fact that DK and FD have this at 13.5 but you can still get 12.5 at Caesars, ESPN and possibly whatever other books you guys have outside of NYC.  In short, Felix has looked great in this tournament and put aside lingering concerns about his injuries in an impressive win over Shelton, but I still favor Zverev.  Should be an absolute battle between two elite servers and while the over 22.5 games was a serious consideration for this POTD and I'll be sprinkling on that,  I see the Zverev over 12.5 games being a safer pick.  Two top players, in great form, playing a high stakes match (winner goes to the semis, loser is out) and with their serving on point this week...would be shocked if this one ended 6-4 6-3.\n\nBOL if you tail.",

Flagg is averaging the most minutes per game on the Mavericks with 32.8. He's also averaging 15.1ppg vs Collins's 11.9ppg.

Croatia are clearly the superior team, and they should handle business at home without too much stress. But they’re also not the type to blow teams out just for the sake of it. They usually control possession, take their chances when they come, and manage games professionally rather than chasing huge scorelines.\n\nThe Faroe Islands tend to sit deep and make life annoying, and while they’ll concede chances, they’re usually organised enough to avoid the absolute hammerings people expect. Their last 7 losses have only been by 1 goal - which fits this combo perfectly.\n\nCroatia’s attack can absolutely break them down, but the tempo they play at doesn’t often lead to four or five-goal explosions unless the opponent completely collapses. With Croatia’s patient style and Faroe Islands' low block, this has all the makings of a routine, low-event Croatia win.",

Milwaukee consistently clears the scoring marks that give Charlotte trouble, and with the Hornets getting out-scored on the season and struggling as underdogs, it’s hard not to lean Bucks in a tight but controlled win. On the other side, the Lakers are in a good bounce-back spot against a Pelicans squad that’s been allowing teams to shoot the lights out and giving up one of the highest point totals in the league. Even with their own flaws, the Lakers shoot more efficiently, force more turnovers, and should control the interior against a weaker defensive front.\n\nAs a side note, I'm still puzzled over how Cleveland put up such bad performance against the raptors yesterday in what should have been, a very easy win.",

I still like Efes there, but not as much as a few days ago to cover the spread.\n\nHouston is the worst team in the league per 3p attempts per game, they do only 29.9, that is the reason for this limit from bookies, I think. Still, they make a solid 13.0 3p on average, and in their 10 games, they had 7 above this limit.\n\nA 70% chance at 1.80 odds is a nice overvalue.\n\nThe only worry I had was that Sengun is going to dominate the small Portland lineup under the basket, but they manage to cover big guys relatively well (only Ayton destroyed them in the 2nd game, but he was extra motivated there, of course). Jokic, for example, in a loss, didn't really do anything special (for his standards, though he had a good %, as always).\n\nI think Sengun also doesn't like double-teaming that much and quick agile defenses, so there should be a good number of open 3p opportunities on the return passes from the paint.",

Gakpo has managed to get a shot on target for the past 4 international matches, one of which against Poland. He likes to cut inside and with an attacking Matty Cash on the right I think he'll get space. The Dutch Team average 6.7 shots on target per match in the last 10 matches.\n\n**Flint v The New Saints (19.45 GMT)**  \nThe New Saints a.k.a. TNS have been dominating the Welsh top flight for a decade now, with 12 championships in the past 15 years. They are on track to win another one this season as they are comfortably sitting 1st once again with 9 points clear. Their goal difference is 48:15 at the moment. They are away against Flint this Friday. It's safe to say Flint are struggling this season as they sit in 10th (out of 12). They have a negative goal difference and gained 9 out of 15 points against bottom league teams. If you take out results against teams lower then them they haven't won in a long time. Last 5 H2H between the teams? 4-2,5-0,1-4,5-1,1-8, all in favor of TNS. I think TNS will dominate once again, hence the 3-way handicap here.\n\n**Best of luck if tailing!** 🍀\n\n**PS:** If you want you can check my record and units won on [https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/OliveCritical5134-qXXxJZ](https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/OliveCritical5134-qXXxJZ)\n\nIf you're enjoying the picks and write ups and are looking to support me you could do so here: [buymeacoffee.com/olivecritical5134](http://buymeacoffee.com/olivecritical5134)",

We have a spurs team that just played this same warriors team on Wednesday the 12th. The spurs held a 15 point lead at one point in the second quarter and a 9 point lead in the 3rd and ended up giving away the game to the warriors, who rode the backs of a 46 point performance by curry. Not only that but kuminga went down with a knee injury and his status is going to be up in the air for this game. \n\nI’m going to go ahead and leave you with this here. Curry single handedly put the team on his back to will his team to a 5 point victory. He simply will not play any better than that again against the spurs. not only that but in that game the spurs closed as -3.5 and opened at -4.5. So now at -2.5 (yes I bought to 2 sue me once again) we are getting EVEN BETTER VALUE, then what Vegas originally thought of them yesterday. Have the spurs really done anything wrong that bad to warrant an even smaller line?\n\nThis will be the warriors 3rd game in the past 4 nights, kuminga is questionable, and not only that but since the spurs have gotten fox back in their last 3 games they have the 3rd best eFG% in the league and have been playing at the 5th highest pace! Tired legs for the warriors and a banged up kuminga? Cmon man. I just don’t see another repeat curry 40 point performance and I love the spurs to come out motivated to not only get the revenge win against the warriors, but this is also the second game for the spurs in the NBA cup group play! They already beat the rockets in their first go around and these young guys will be hungry to compete for the nba cup ship (even though I think it’s the stupidest fucking thing of all fucking time). This is a fantastic spot for the spurs.  If you have been following me for the entirety of my POTD journey you would also know I am 3-0 on 2 unit plays! Let’s get another big one on the board and ride this momentum into a big college football and nfl weekend! As always, cheers 🍻",

This is a friendly match but one where the South Korean's hold a huge advantage.\n\n* Team Captain and former Tottenham Hotspur superstar Son Heung-Min will be front and center for the Koreans.\n* In their last three H2H matches, Bolivia have failed to score a single goal.\n* South Korea are ranked 54 places higher in FIFA’s official world rankings.\n* Recently, Brazil beat South Korea 5-0, and lost to Bolivia 1-0 at altitude.\n* Bolivia are a different team when not playing at altitude where they hold advantage over their rivals. They have only won 2 out of 24 away matches since 2021.\n\n**Update:**  South Korea beats Bolivia 2-0 with a goal from Son Heung-Min.  Gets us halfway there.\n\nFor the Germans, there are several absenteed due to injury and suspension, but their bench is so deep it is not much of a concern.\n\nKai Havertz, Jamal Musiala, Nadiem Amiri, Niclas Fullkrug and Antonio Rudiger will be out for Germany but the likes of Liverpool's Florian Wirtz,  Serge Gnabry and winger Leroy Sane should make a start.",

In September, he won the title at the ITA's Battle in the Bay Classic without dropping a set, and followed that up with a strong performance as the No. 2 seed at the ITA All-American Championships. He then scored a big win over ATP #251 Clement Chidekh at an ITF in Montreal, and has already gotten off to a great start here in Drummondville, as he just defeated a really solid indoor player in Antoine Ghibaudo in straight sets (7.18 performance rating)>\n\nMeanwhile, Gabi Boitan is a solid player, but he plays most of his tennis on clay courts. The market hasn't exactly been loving him here in Drummondville, as he was pushed from +125 to +290 in the opening round and from +135 to +200 in the second round. Sure, he got through both of those matches in straight sets, but he didn't necessarily put in an amazing performance in either of them (6.95 and 6.87). In particular, I felt that he was starting to struggle physically in his second match against Ilagan, but got bailed out by his serve and a few poor points by Ilagan in the second-set tiebreaker. Looking at how Boitan was priced in that match, Ilagan closed at almost the same odds against Nicholas Arsenault in R1; however, I believe that Chan is playing at a slightly higher level than Arsenault right now. In addition, Chan closed at around +160 vs Ghibaudo, but I would honestly put Ghibaudo pretty close to even money in a match against Ilagan. \n\nOverall, my analysis of each player's form and recent market pricing makes this a 50/50 match to me. Both players are baseline grinders, but I feel that Chan brings a bit more variety to the table with his slice. Duncan was also hitting his returns with interest against a pretty big server in Ghibaudo, and I feel like that should help him against Boitan, who utilizes a heavy serve as one of his main weapons in these conditions. For those reasons, this is a 1-unit play for me.\n\n\nNote: The [POTD Capper Tracker](https://potd.lol), which you may remember from its Google Sheet days, is finally back in a cleaner, more robust website format!

That makes it 4 wins in a row betting on an away team favorite to cover their spread. For a change, I will go with the home team spread here, still betting on a favorite though.\n\n \n\nNext Pick: **Miami Heat vs New York Knicks -4.5 @ 1.95**. 3U play.\n\nThe Knicks had high expectations coming into this season, and while they started off rough, they got into a nice groove recently winning 5 in a row (both SU and ATS). They did lose their last game (Magic) but I’m willing to cut them some slack since it was the second half of a B2B. The Heat have been fairly good, but without Bam, their offense does seem to rely on Norm Powell (who I like) more than it should. In their last game, they also lost to a Cavs team that rested multiple starters, so I think some of the weaknesses of this squad are being exposed. I expect OG or Mikal to focus on Norm to reduce his threat, and with Mitchell Robinson/KAT they should be able to limit easy looks for Ware. I’m happy to back the better team at home to cover this line.   ",

Smart is a primary ball‑handler / facilitator when healthy, so assisting will be his role , rebounds are less of a strength but add “bonus” that help him exceed the RA. The Pels have many injuries that will help Smart getting his props with Zion averages significant rebounding and assists himself and his absence means the Pelicans lose some of their offensive balance and rebound support and Poole being out removes another playmaker which may force the Pelicans to rely on less experienced playmakers, opening passing lanes for Smart.\n ",

They draw a great matchup imo with Illinois State. USC is a lot bigger across the board and their opponent Illinois State’s top 2 scorers are 5’11 and 6’2. I expect USC’s height across the board to bother them.\n\nUSC’s shortest starter is 6’5 and the others are taller. They currently rank 11th in the country at Offensive rebound percentage at 44%. Last game they grabbed 24 offensive boards.\n\nNot only the size advantage, the talent USC brought in is top-notch in my opinion. \n\nThe 3 best starting transfers are Chad Baker-Mazara was one of Final4 Auburns top players last year, R.

I traveled to Iowa City to go watch that game and completely forgot to post it, but I looked a lot at Oregon and how they operate.\n\nThe numbers will point towards Oregon pretty considerably in every aspect so I’m not even going to acknowledge them. Oregon is a 25.5 point favorite for a reason.\n\nI watch a lot of Big 10 football and I’ve had this theory over the past 2 years since the addition of the west coast teams that they get pretty flustered when playing against the old Big 10 west. This is showcased when the king of the old Big 10 west (Iowa) covers the +6.5 against one of the best teams in the conference in Oregon and almost beats them, Wisconsin kinda hangs around Oregon until the 4th quarter, and teams like Washington get the doors blown off by teams like Michigan, Iowa last year, lose to a bad Wisconsin team this year. There’s something about playing against these gross midwestern farm teams that they have the ability to drag you down into the mud and make games competitive that really shouldn’t be.\n\nOregon notably did not cover against their past 2 matchups, Wisconsin and Iowa. Minnesota is cut from the same cloth as both of those teams, and they employ a similar style of gross football. \n\nOregon is missing it’s 4 best pass catchers this week to injury, and will rely on running the ball through the heart of Minnesota at home in another cold and rainy Oregon climate. Oregon is also coming off of a massive emotional spot in beating Iowa at Kinnick with 3 seconds left in the game, and is in a look-ahead sandwich spot after getting hyped up for their biggest test of the year at Iowa City, and going to play USC after Minnesota. They are also on a short week.\n\nOregon got into a war with Iowa. PJ Fleck wishes he could be Iowa’s Kirk Ferentz, and plays a lot of the same style of football as Iowa. I expect a low scoring matchup where Oregon wins by 2 touchdowns, but doesn’t quite get over that 25.5 marker. Oregon will run the ball at will, burn clock, and start preparing early for USC. Minnesota will slowly drive the field with their very good QB in Drake Lindsey, get a touchdown or 2 and cover the spread.",

After looking at Oregon's last two games most people probably think this line is too big. They only beat Iowa by 2 and lowly Wisconsin by 14, not covering their spread in either game. So why would we think they are able to cover this week??\n\nMinnesota is actually having a decent year; they secured bowl eligibility early, don't have any terrible losses, and picked up a quality win against a ranked Nebraska team. The two huge blemishes on Minnesota's resume are their outings against Ohio State and Iowa. In both of these games Minnesota only managed to score 3 points. They tallied 162 total yards against Ohio State and 133 total yards against Iowa. What do Ohio State and Iowa have in common? Well, not much...other then they both have elite defenses. Who else is in that club? Oregon.\n\nOhio State and Iowa rank top 4 in both Scoring Defense and Total Defense. Right there with them sits Oregon at #3 in total defense, allowing 239ypg and #7 in scoring defense, allowing 13.78ppg. Minnesota has faced elite defenses before and has nothing to show for it, now they have to travel 2 time zones west and try to muster up some points on the road. I just don't see it happening. \n\nOregon should put up some points here like they have all season long, and now we are at the point of the year where style points come in to play as well. The committee is watching games and puts their rankings out each week, Oregon is currently on the outside looking in when it comes to the Big Ten's auto bid, so they are going to have to earn an at large bid. This is a Friday night game on Fox, and they will have all eyes on them, the perfect opportunity to run it up against a conference opponent. \n\nOregon Total Offense: #13 (472 ypg)     Minnesota Total Offense: #118 (313 ypg)\n\nOregon Scoring Offense: #9 (38.7 ppg)     Minnesota Scoring Offense: #95 (23.8 ppg)\n\nOregon Total Defense: #3 (239 yards allowed per game)     Minnesota Total Defense: #21 (312 yards allowed per game)\n\nOregon Scoring Defense: #7 (13.78 points allowed per game)     Minnesota Scoring Defense: #39 (21.56 points allowed per game)\n\nOregon: 5-4 ATS (3-2 at home)     Minnesota: 2-6 ATS (0-3 on the road)\n\n  \nOregon does have some key offensive injuries with their coach being coy about their possible returns during his press conference this week, I suspect some are back, some still out. But they were without them at Iowa and still managed to move the ball in a monsoon against one of the country's best defenses. Weather looks great for game night, and I think they will still be running smooth on offense even without a couple of their dependable weapons. \n\n  \nI see Minnesota struggling to get anything going and Oregon utilizing their balanced attack to run up the score early and often. Go Ducks! 🦆",

Anderson had a few good opportunities, but unfortunately they were all blocked before reaching the keeper. We move on. \n\nWe're coming back swinging after our loss with what I see as a high value-high pick. I really like this match today where we see 1st place in the group Netherlands visiting 2nd place Poland. Netherlands comes into the match carrying a 3 point lead, so a win or a draw here secures their place in the world cup next summer. Poland equally are battling for 2nd place and a loss here makes their match in Malta on Monday a spicy one. I fully expect Netherlands to win this game and dominate possession, however I see some value on the other side.\n\nMatty Cash plays right back. With Poland typically lining up with a back 3 in a 5-4-1 or something comparable, Cash tends to play pretty far forward. He also (if you can sense a theme) loves to shoot from distance. But not only does he shoot from distance, he can score from distance with some absolute screamers (2 weeks ago against Man City, for example). \n\nNow onto data. Cash has had at least 1 SOT in his last 3 club matches as well as in his last 4 country matches. In his last 4 matches for Poland, he's averaging 3 shots per match and 1.5 SOTs. This includes a goal in the reverse fixture at Netherlands in September. I see Cash continuing his streak and landing a shot on target here. \n\nBOL!",

Felix showed improvements and came through as a +275 underdog from a set down. Felix brought an aggressive game to Sascha blasting 50 winners to 35 UE’s.

Both teams have been looking incredibly shaky. Vitality who were most dominant run in recent time have really fallen off in level as of late. They have looked way weaker/less dominant, map pool has gotten worse, and they have struggled against much worse teams they previously would've dominated.\n* Spirit on the other hand despite a fire power upgrade in adding tN1R have also struggled, their calling/overall strat book is just non existent. Watching them on some of their best maps is horrendous how all they can do is send donk to get a multi kill and if he can't, they can't do anything in rounds.\n* Vitality are 3-0 in matches against Spirit and 7-1 in maps in 2025, however all of these games came from the first half of 2025 when Vitality was much more dominant. While I still favor Vitality, they are definitely in worse form then they were back then but I think on paper this is still a really good matchup for them\n\n**Veto:**\n\n* Spirit ban Inferno, Vitality ban Ancient\n* Spirit pick Mirage (chance of Train/Dust 2)\n\n**Mirage Stats:**\n\n* Spirit are 64% winrate on 11 maps of Mirage L3 months\n* Vitality are 64% winrate on 11 maps of Mirage L3 months\n\n**Player Stats:**\n\n* Zywoo is averaging a .80 KPR L3 months\n* Sh1ro is averaging a .80 KPR L3 months\n* Both guys are AWPers, while they are both capable and strong on riflers especially Zywoo, their is a big advantage for AWPers on CT side (Defense) as it is the much better side in general for sniping/using the AWP.

There have been some comments under my last pick that I didn't post Sakkari pick which I answered to, but can only be seen from my profile. Then I figured it's the same with Sakkari pick itself. I'll post couple of links (images) from my profile to prove I did send it. Think it's the issue with this profile being new. I checked this sub for a while, but decided to post from New Year and made a new profile for that. Hope this and all the following picks get published on time.*\n\n[*https://ibb.co/nsjfHf3T*](https://ibb.co/nsjfHf3T)\n\n[*https://ibb.co/TqLs3ymz*](https://ibb.co/TqLs3ymz)\n\n\n\n\n\nOdds opened at evens for Iatcenko and are going up. The reason I guess is her left quadriceps/thigh was heavily taped in yesterday match against Aiava. She asked for a MTO at 6-7 2-1 for leg problems, but it didn't seem to bother her too much later as she went on to turn the match around and win 6-7 6-3 6-3. It was her R1 match after two impressive wins in Q against Wei and Shibahara. She is a young Russian with a complete game who had a breakthrough 2025. and will try to establish herself on Tour in 2026. I really like her in a matchup against Garland who is one of my favorite fades in WTA. Classic brainless ballbasher who reaches highest highs and lowest lows in same match. Iatcenko has a pretty consistent gamestyle, placing heavy balls deep into court, moving opponents and will make Garland hit on the run. It's a gamble since Iatcenko condition is not fully known, but given I consider her a favorite here I just can't miss her at these odds. H2H is 1-0 for Garland, 6-2 6-1 in 2024., but a lot changed since.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Any donations would be greatly appreciated:*\n\n[https://buymeacoffee.com/kumpir](https://buymeacoffee.com/kumpir)",

They conceded a last-minute equalizer on the weekend and have now lost 2 of their starting CBs which mean the best way they're going to keep the ball out of the net is by keeping it in Brighton's half. They did this in the Chelsea game and ended the first half with 5, and I'm expecting a similar start here.\n\n**---**\n\n**Last 10 Home games: Man City's Corners First Half**\n\n**5, 4, 3, 2, 7, 4, 6, 3, 6, 8  - Average 4.8 per game**\n\n**Line has covered in 9/10 of their last home games, with Man City averaging 4.8 corners in the first half per home game.**\n\n**BOL**",

Will add some personal information in this write-up as well.\n\n• ⁠Model has this game going 185+ total points\n\n• Model projects that both team totals go above the over, and a potential for overtime\n\n• EV better betting 100$ = 11-12$ for this play\n\n• This game is going to be GREAT - if you are a basketball fan, and don't keep up with mid-majors often, this is a must see game - Both teams are very athletic and both teams love to move at fast pace, especially SLU - VCU is averaging around 80 some PPG, while SLU is averaging around 90 PPG - However SLU does indeed have a good defense, but VCU at home, is VCU at home, they should come out firing - SLU overs have been a hit all season, with VCU overs are hitting at 80%+ - I expect Djokovic to slow down just a bit tomorrow due to Avila on the other side, which I actually think that helps the over because it should lead to more shots from outside the arc - Hill for VCU has been on a tear and I expect him to keep that up tomorrow - Do not feel like I need to talk much about SLU's offense, boy have they been on FIRE all year - ranking top 5 in the NCAA in PPG - Two of the A10's best battling it out for bragging rights - One of these two teams will get an automatic bid to the tournament, the other will have to perform really well in the A10 tournament - They know this, they know how important this matchup is - I expect a shootout here, so give me the Over 169.5 for a unit.\n\nPOTD History: https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/SoggyDatabase2348-bvjHUn\n\nBOL!\n\n**POTD: NCAAB: VCU vs. St. Louis Over 169.5 (1U TO WIN 0.90U)**\n\nTips are greatly appreciated - Proceeds will be going towards my student loans and my morning cold brews.

      "text": "MANCHESTER UNITED ML @1.67 VS WOLVERHAMPTON,\n\n\nAh, lad, let me tell you something with the confidence of a man who’s watched Manchester United since televisions had rabbit-ear antennas — Wolves don’t stand a chance this time. United are finally playing with that spark again, you can see it in the passing, the movement, the grit. Wolves will come in snarling like they always do, but United will pat ’em on the head and send ’em home quiet. The midfield’s tighter, the attack’s sharper, and the defense finally looks like it drank its morning coffee instead of hot water. Back in my day, we called this “handling business,” and that’s exactly what United will do. Goals will come, mark my words — one early to hush the noise, another late just to show who’s boss. Trust these old bones, lad… United are taking this one ⚽️⚽️",

I feel like he’s gonna be a difference maker in this game and fill up the stat sheet. Anybody who’s watched the Pacers over the last few years knows how important of a role he plays on this team and even down the stretch coach Carlisle relies on him to run the offense and be the steady hand. He’s gone over this line in 7/10 games, and playing against the Kings I love our chances. Kings are 26/30 in defensive rating and playing the Pacers at home McConnell feeds off that Indiana crowd. I like the Pacers to cover also, but going with arguably the best backup PG(based off how he impacts winning) in the league tonight! BOL!\n\nIf anyone wants to support, I’m a student just looking to get by. Appreciate the upvotes and comments for sure! Best of luck to everyone!\n\nhttps://buymeacoffee.com/elevate203\n\nVenmo @Elevate203",

The line tells me they expect them to break the goalless streak today.  Man U gives up almost 2 goals a game on the road.  Wolves are giving up more than 2 goals a game at home. Wolves can essentially already be penciled in for relegation so I expect to see an open game with a lot of chances from both teams.  Good luck",

South Korea has a big advantage at the fourth position in this matchup which should make the difference. Kim has been the better shot-maker than Yanagisawa and the Korean team is too strong for the rest of the Japanese team to continue to bail him out. On the season, these teams are very comparable. Japan are 43-14 against teams outside the top 25 and South Korea are 31-10 against the same competition. Tons of value at 2.9.",

Perfect setup for him against this weak Pacers defense despite being a bipolar scorer.\n\nLaVine is coming off a 42pt game. Overall he's cashed in L2/4 and L3/4 vs the Pacers. Hard to trust him fully  but overall he's performed against bad defenses.\n\nShooters do well against the Pacers. Jamal Murray put up 52, Donovan Mitchell put up 43. LaVine needs half that. Pacers rank 25th in Points allowed to SGs across the board.\n\nBoth teams rank top 15 in pace, a big plus to his potential possessions and opportunities\n\nFull stats if you'd like to do additional research: [https://www.statpick.ai/51692131/zach-lavine-points](https://www.statpick.ai/51692131/zach-lavine-points)\n\nBOL!",

Manchester away was my first thought. But they're just too inconsistent to represent value, since Wolves seem to be their Kryptonite in recent history. However, my model is a big fan of Milan in today's match and sees their probability of winning at over 70%. That represents great value at odds of 1.72. \n\nMilan has the second-best defence in the league, while Torino has the second-worst and is currently not in good form (0W - 3D - 2L). \n\nMilan are undefeated in away games in the league and have a strong record in their last 5 league games (3W - 2D - 0L). They lost narrowly at Lazio in the cup during the week, but they defeated them in the league last week.\n\nA 0-0 or 1-1 draw in December is always possible in Serie A if both teams focus on solid defence, so I'm only betting 1 unit.\n\n  \n**Please only bet money that you can afford to lose.

He was a full participant in Sunday's practice and assuming he comes back and gets atleast 20 minutes, this is a very attainable line against the Pelicans.\n\nCastle is having an amazing year two as a primary ball handler for the Spurs and is averaging 7.5 assists per game. He’s had 5+ assists in 89% of games this season and 6+ assists in 69%. When playing 20+ minutes this season, Castle is averaging 13.6 potential assists, with a 75% hit rate on this prop.\n\nHe gets a very soft matchup against the  Pelicans who allow the second most assists this season. Castile has already played against them twice this season, averaging 9.5 assists on 15.5 potentials and going over this line both times.\n\nOther combo guards have found success playmaking against the Pelicans include:\nEgor Demin (7 AST)\nAustin Reaves (8 AST)\nCam Spencer (7 AST)\nTre Jones (11 AST)\nBrandon Williams (12 AST)\n\nCastle will likely allow DeAaron Fox to be the primary scorer for this game and focus on running the offense and facilitating. Even if he’s limited, he can get this done in 20-25 minutes.",

Los Angeles will be looking to rely heavily on their running game with Justin Herbert's hand injury and Hampton's return couldn't have come at a better time. \n\nAlthough the Chargers offensive line in pass protection is the teams most blaring weakness, their ability to run the ball has been respectable, even with their injuries at RB all season. Philadelphia has struggled defending the run and has allowed 160 yards and 4.8 per carry over their last 3. Also on top of not being able to effectively stop running backs on the ground, the Eagles rank 28th in receiving yards allowed to RBs (39ypg). Without Jalen Carter in the lineup, Philadelphia will have their work cutout for them in stopping the Chargers heavy offensive sets and outside runs.\n\nBefore his injury Hampton hit this mark in 4/5 games and will have fresh legs coming into this game.

Let’s go baby!\n\nEvent: Sabres @ Flames (NHL) (8pm central)\n\nPOTD: Over 6.5 (+115) (1U) \n\nWrite up:\n\nThe Sabres enter this matchup trying to snap a two game losing streak in which they have allowed a combined 9 goals in those two games. Meanwhile the flames enter having won two straight at home and will remain at home for this one. They have heated up recently. In their last 10 games both teams are bottom 12 in goals allowed. The Sabres though are 8th in goals scored over this period. Both are top 9 in goals expected over this period with the Sabres ranking first. Both are bottom 12 in save percentage over this period as well. The Sabres are also 2nd in shots on goal with the flames sitting around 15. The flames have been playing a lot better as of late and look the odds are -110 both ways. If this game is expected to be competitive than the over is worth a look at + money because the Sabres will be highly motivated to get back on track offensively after two blowout losses but their defense hasn’t been great and the flames have some momentum on home ice. However we know damn well the Sabres can light up the score board and the flames have got some momentum of their own. Not to mention both teams rank inside the top 5 in high danger shots for over the last 10 games. Not to mention these same two teams played each other last month and the Sabres lost 6-2 at home! There will be revenge on their minds going into this game as they look to get back on track offensively here. Not to mention the Sabres have allowed 4+ goals in 5 of their last 10 games and the flames have won 6 of their last 10. Gimme the over for the plus money. As always, cheers 🍻",

Their first-quarter scoring has been above league average, largely due to their disciplined ball movement, ability to hit open shots, and tendency to exploit mismatches early. Tonight’s matchup further favors the Spurs, as their opponent has struggled historically in the opening quarter, often allowing fast-paced teams to dictate tempo and rack up early points.\n\nAdditionally, the Spurs’ depth on both ends of the floor gives them an advantage over a team that relies heavily on one or two primary scorers. This not only increases the likelihood of a first-quarter lead but also positions them to sustain that momentum into the full game. The -135 odds on FanDuel for a first-quarter winner and match winner represent value given their statistical trends, matchup dynamics, and recent form. A 5-unit allocation is justified for this play, considering both the probability of hitting and potential payout.",

The Red Wings look back on track to how they started the season hot after Saturday’s win. There’s no reason why they can’t jump right back onto their winning train. They’re on the road again vs Vancouver, but that shouldn’t phase them since they’re coming off an intense road win.",

Wolves are at home, and most of their goals this season come from home ground. With the season on the line, they have to score in this matchup even to have a glimpse of hope going forward.

I will take this one on the chin...it was just a tough loss honestly but really pleased with my read of the game. While the Bears had a lackluster first half, it felt like the only thing the packers found success on offensively was when the Bears sent blitz packages which Love absolutely diced up. It was unfortunate in the end that they had Jacobs bottled up on 3rd and 1 and couldn't make a tackle that would've given the Packers 3 instead of 7. Then caleb unable to find moore underneath on the final play that would've scored the TD. Had he even thrown it to the end zone with a little more velocity and not underthrown it, feel like this would be a different story. just the way it goes sometimes :(\n\n**Event:** Los Angeles Chargers vs Philadelphia Eagles NFL\n\n**POTD:** Los Angeles Chargers Moneyline (+115) 5 units\n\n**Rationale:** Will keep it short and to the point. The Eagles offense has looked lackluster lately (15.5 point average over the past 4 games) and I expect it to continue against the Chargers. The issue is that they're not utilizing Saquon well and Hurts has clearly taken a step back. They found some signs of life feeding Brown, but I anticipate LAC will key in on this to neutralize Brown and Smith as much as possible. More importantly, the Chargers defense has been rock solid against the run all year, barely giving up anything on the ground and consistently getting off the field on third down. Offensively, they finally found rhythm in the run game last week with nearly 200 rushing yards and a pair of scores, and now they get a Philly front that’s been leaking yards and losing leverage in the run game all season. With the return of Hampton, I anticipate this Chargers offense to find its groove backed by the likes of QJ, Gadsden, and Allen. Put those pieces together, and this is a spot where L.A.’s strengths line up perfectly with the Eagles’ weaknesses\n\nJust to reiterate, in conjunction with my model, I use the eye test as well as my gut feeling to play what I believe is the most-valuable pick on the slate. Cheers to a great game, and please remember to gamble responsibly and to only wager what you can afford to lose.\n\nBOL!",

However, I’m going to trust the process here. The Eagles usually do a good job at responding after a not so good game. That didn’t happen last week, but I think it happens here. They have had an extended break to prepare and get ready. They will be out Jalen Carter, but they be going up against an O-Line that is so banged up that they’re going to be able to do just fine. There is also a chance that Justin Herbert doesn’t play, or he is very limited.\n\nAs far as the offense goes, I don’t think they need to score 30 to win. I think 20 could do the job. The Chargers defense is tough, but I don’t see them being able to overcome their offensive struggles.\n\nGood luck!",

They’re currently on a five game losing streak and took a big home loss to Como on Nov 24th, proving their grounds aren’t a “12th man.” AC Milan, on the other hand, has the best defence in Serie A so far this season, they’ve only let in 9 goals. AC Milan isn’t a team that wins by large margins either, they’ve scored 5 goals in their last 5 games (2 of which were against Parma). Allegri has kept AC Milan very focused on defense and therefore I believe they’ll score first with the fire power they have (Pulisic, Modric and Leao) and then do what they do best, defend. \n\nIf you find my insight useful, please feel free to donate to BuyMeACoffee:\n\nhttps://buymeacoffee.com/5c2y4cxvy5e\n\nAs you all know, bet only what you're willing to lose!\n\nBOL!",

If we look at her current season, she played 52 matches on clay and only 13 matches on hard courts. When it comes to recent form, she isn't performing particularly well, having lost 5 out of her last 6 matches in straight sets (all on clay). The Italian player is only 1.60m and should struggle to close service games against a player of Kartal's quality from the baseline.\n\nThese types of handicaps can certainly be dangerous when the underdog has the possibility of doing a phenomenal game, but I'm quite certain that this will be a walk in the park for Kartal.

Just 2 games ago the Chargers were blown out 6-35 by the Jags, then luckily had a bye week the following week. They used the rest & put a beat down on the (2-10) Raiders 31-14. They are currently 2 games back behind the Broncos in the AFC West & are looking to gain stay in contention for the top spot of the Division. The Eagles suffered their 2nd straight loss last week to the Bears on Black Friday in their last game 24-15, but they still are on top of the NFC East. Starting OL Lane Johnson was injured with a foot injury & has this has significantly affected the Eagles run game, leading to more passing.\n\nNo team in the NFL has won more games than the defending Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles (47-16), since the start of the 2022 season. The Eagles offense has been stagnant lately, but they have played some good competition. Whereas the Chargers have had a weak schedule. The Chargers have done really well at shutting down the pass. LA ranks 7th in the NFL in EPA/Dropback allowed. Phili hasn’t been great through the air lately, but they are still above average passing, ranking 13th in the NFL in EPA/Dropback. QB Jalen Hurts has been slinging deep this season. __Hurts is 2nd in the league in rate of throws 20+ yards downfield (15.2%). He ranks 4th in the NFL in completions of 40+ yards with 8. Hurts has a 118.6 passer rating on those deep throws, the fourth highest in the NFL. Spreading the field has also helped Hurts, who has a league leading 113.3 passer rating in sets with four or five wide receivers.__ Who has Hurts primary downfield target been lately? Star WR AJ Brown. The Eagles may have had a rough game vs the Bears last week, but Brown had a huge game, catching 10 balls for 132 yards & 2 TD’s. Brown has become the focal point of this Eagles offense the past few weeks. __AJ Brown has double digit targets in 3 straight games. Brown leads the NFL in designed/first read targets over the last 3 weeks with 32.__ Over that same time period, other Eagles star WR DeVonta Smith has only 23 designed/first read targets. The pecking order has been reestablished in Philadelphia & AJ Brown is the clear WR1. Brown has been the best receiver in football since then. __In his last 2 games he ranks #1 in Receiving Yards (242), #1 in Receptions (18), & #2 in Targets (22). He has 47% of the Eagles receiving yards in those games.__ He has been the guy the guy all season that they get the ball to when they need to move the ball. __Brown has the 3rd most receiving yards amongst WR’s in the 4th quarter with 268. He has had 50% of the red zone targets over the last 5 weeks.__ The Chargers have great stats this season at shutting down opposing WR’s, but most of the WR’s they’ve played this season have to wear helmets off of the field as well. __All of the pass catchers they’ve played this year that don’t have the tism’ all hit this number this season- Bowers: 4/63, Jakobi Meyers: 5/64, Jettas: 7/74, Alec Pierce: 5/98, Waddle: 6/95, Deebo: 8/96, & Sutton: 6/118.__ Not only is this a good play due to AJ Brown’s recent success, but also due to the Chargers defensive scheme. __The Chargers run Zone coverage at the highest rate in the league, as they only run man on 14.1% of their snaps, the league’s lowest rate.__ Brown has been a monster vs zone defense lately, & Hurts has been targeting him way more than other star Eagles WR Devonta Smith. Here are the 2 WR’s stats vs Zone coverage over the last 3 games:\n\nBrown: 1st Read: 48.8%, Yards/Route: 3.59, Targets/Route: 0.37, Air Yard Share: 44.3%, 1st Down/Route: 0.18, ASS: 0.106 (Average Separation Score)\n\nSmith: 1st Read: 24.4%, Yards/Route: 1.54, Targets/Route: 0.20, Air Yard Share: 36.4%, 1st Down/Route: 0.06, ASS: 0.05\n\nSmith also has been playing in the slot in a majority of his snaps this season. __Devonta has ran 59% of his routes from the slot. Whereas AJ has ran 89% of his routes out wide.__ That’s not good news for Smith as he’ll be lined up against Chargers star defensive back Derwin James Jr. The Chargers have been using safety Derwin James Jr. as their primary slot coverage player. __Among qualified cornerbacks & safeties, James allows the lowest yards per slot coverage snap (0.28), ahead of notable safeties like Kyle Hamilton (0.42) & Minkah Fitzpatrick (0.49).__ Smith is going to struggle this Monday night opening up even more opportunities for AJ. Brown is also much bigger than the Chargers DB’s & I think Hurts continues to target him all game, especially with the run game situation. \n\nEagles RB Saquon Barkley has been a shell of what he was last year. Barkley had 14 games with 100+ rushing yards last season. This season he has just 1 game with 100+. He has only rushed for more than 60 yards twice in his last 10 games, getting held to less than 50 yards in half of those. This week he’ll be behind an offensive line that will be without star LT Lane Johnson. Barkley is not the same back with Johnson off the field as he is with him on. __On 124 rushes with Johnson on the field, Barkley has ran for 4.2 yards per carry with a run of 10 + yards on 11.3% of his carries. With Johnson off the field, Barkley has ran 74 times for 218 yards (2.9 YPC) & a run of 10+ yards on just 4.1% of his carries (38th in the NFL).__ The Eagles are going to have trouble getting things going on the ground & will have to turn to Brown through the air.\n\nIn a defensive game where points are going to be hard to come by, AJ Brown is going to get fed as the most efficient weapon on the field.\n\n__AJ Brown o60.5 receiving yards__\n\nAppreciate the love!

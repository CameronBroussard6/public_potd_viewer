Additionally, the Canucks are eighth worst in allowing points to defenseman at 2.3 per game. As for Sanderson, he has collected a point in seven straight games, which includes five home games. And, amongst defenseman, he’s tied for fourth in minutes played at 25:16 per game.",

Combined with Gobert being out due to suspension and him averaging 11.4 rebounds a game and had 18 rebounds last time these teams played. Ant had 4 that game and Randle had 7. So i'd expect Randle to be able to grab 2 more boards than last time with two starters out. BOL",

The Denver Nuggets are walking into a disaster zone in the frontcourt; they’ve officially ruled out three-time MVP Nikola Jokić (knee) and their primary backup Jonas Valančiūnas (calf). Without their two anchors, the Nuggets have no one left with the size or physicality to stop Zion once he gets downhill.\n\nWhy the \"Over\" is the play:\n\n• Sharp Line Movement: This line actually opened at 22.5, jumped to 23.5 today, and has now settled back at 22.5 but with heavy juice (-125 to -131). That’s a loud signal from the books, they are terrified of Zion landing on 23, so we're paying a bit of a \"tax\" to grab that extra point of safety.\n\n• Historical Dominance: Zion has been a nightmare for Denver throughout his career, averaging 25 points flat against them. He even hung a career-high 39 on them back when they actually had rim protection.\n\n• Locked-In Form: He’s playing his best ball of the season right now, averaging 25.0 points over his last eight games. He just put up 31 on Washington last week and a hyper-efficient 22 against Orlando two nights ago.\n\nThe Bottom Line: \nWith the Pelicans missing key playmakers like Dejounte Murray and Herb Jones, the offense is going to be \"Zion or bust\" tonight. Denver is stuck starting Zeke Nnaji and Peyton Watson in a makeshift front court, neither of whom can keep Zion out of the restricted area. Expect him to live at the rim and clear this number easily.\n\n\nIt’s my first pick here, so GL everyone 🔥\n\nEdit: just fixing some spacing and grammar lol",

Not getting too deep into the metics here: had it circled on Friday, line went live, loved the priced. \n\n2 teams slumping: Dallas have Stanley Cup aspirations but have lost 7/9, meanwhile Anaheim have become the new Jets, winning only 2/15 - but the kicker here is neither teams  poor winless runs are what we are betting on, rather the volume of goals & goals conceded by both during these barren runs/this season\n\nDallas has *only covered this 6/10*, the Ducks meanwhile have **covered this 11/12** - mixed results - head to head however is where I see inspiration: 2 games this season, **TWENTY FIVE (25) GOALS COMBINED. 6/7 between these two has hit at least 6 goals, with 5/7 giving us at least 2 first period goals.**\n\nWhilst Dallas’ D is respectable, **Anaheim are 30th in the NHL on expected goals against**, but they put they do try to put puck in the net: **6th best expected goals in the NHL**. Dallas themselves are absolutely no slouch, with the **3rd most goals per game** in the NHL this season.\n\nLukas Dostal is expected to start, he’s given up **9 goals on 33 shots against the Stars this season**, getting pulled in the second game after only **giving up 4 on 9 shots**. He’s been all around cold, with a **3.25 GAA on the season**, with a season low run of **.854 Save% and a 4.32 GAA in his last 6 games.** Ugly is the word.\n\nI really can’t look past this game providing goals - even if Dallas can play to a formidable defensive level, the Ducks attack volume and lack of defensive responsibility should get us to 7 goals tonight.\n\nLast play review:\n\nNFL - Nico Collins o68.5 Rec Yds ❌\n\n(Injuries - they can win you bets, but they sure can lose you bets, too. That’s the third POTD football bet that has died for me because of an injury. Nico got hurt before he had a chance to get us close, despite 7 targets and 3 grabs, his routes were all stunted up til he was hurt - the Football run ends 2-3.)\n\nBOL if you’re tailing, and if not BOL in general.",

They will be extra motivated to easily go through as PSG, their biggest opponent for the cup title, is out thanks to a loss yesterday\n\nI expect complete domination from Marseille here. They will most likely rotate their team but even their bench players are miles better than anyone Bayeux will field.

On top of that, Loyola Chicago struggle offensively and rank 256th in turnovers per possession. George Mason is solid defensively so Loyola Chicago should have a tough time generating points in this game. Line movement has favored the under as well. So with limited possessions, slow tempo and a Loyola Chicago team that really struggles offensively, let’s expect this game to stay below 140.5 points.\n\n👇\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ufgomy8di5dg1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d1e112dedc112de024458327769cf979cefd51a9",

They're currently 5th, just ahead of Frankfurt in 7th, and their home record speaks for itself: 5W–1D–1L in the league, with the only defeat coming against Bayern. Overall, they've won 10 of their last 12 home games in all competitions, showing just how reliable they are on their own ground. In the last 5 matches, Stuttgart won 4 and lost 1.\n\nFrankfurt are still a quality side, but they've been very inconsistent, especially away from home. In their last 10 away matches, they’ve managed just 2 wins, alongside 4 draws and 4 losses, and they've conceded in every single league away match this season.\n\nGoals look very likely in this fixture. BTTS has landed in 8 of the last 10 H2Hs, and in 4 of the last 5 at Stuttgart’s home. Frankfurt are one of the best BTTS teams in the league, hitting in 69% of their Bundesliga games and 7 of 8 away league matches. Stuttgart are around the league average, with BTTS landing in 56% of their league games.\n\nWith Stuttgart being so reliable at home and Frankfurt usually finding a goal but rarely keeping clean sheets on the road, Stuttgart double chance + BTTS looks like a solid play.",

You know you're in trouble when THE Jay Huff is putting up 20 points. This game played out exactly like I hoped, and flew under in Jaylen Brown's absence. Personally, I had a monster night. I took the early line at 223.5 for POTD but put another unit down each time it went up a point. Pregame topped out at 226.5, but I live-bet the under all the way to 229.5. Call it blind luck or delusion, but I had a very nice night. Per the write-up, I even hit my side bets on Andrew Nembhard's under 25.5 PA (he got there in assists but not points) AND the Utah-Cleveland under 250.5. Smoke em' if you got em', right? Let's see how all of this bragging jinxes me today.*\n\nLet's talk about Justin Moore. The junior guard leads Loyola in scoring (12.5), assists (4.1), and minutes (31.0), although he doesn't shoot particularly well - 29.5 percent from three, and 41.1 percent from the field. He's also hurt. He missed a Jan. 7 game against Davidson, then played only eight minutes Saturday at George Washington before reaggravating an undisclosed injury. If he can't go tonight, the Ramblers lose a guy with a 24.9 percent usage rate, and perhaps the only real offensive threat against a defense that KenPom ranks 78th overall and third in the Atlantic 10 in opponent scoring. Speaking of injuries, Loyola forward Xavier Amos - like Moore - is listed as questionable. Moore has only played five games this season, and nothing since he logged 30 minutes on Jan. 3, but he's been Loyola's second-leading scorer when he goes. In fact, four of Loyola's top six scorers are game-time-decisions. *So, where is the offense coming from?*\n\nGeorge Mason (16-1) is a pace-control team. Full stop. KenPom has them with a 315-ranked adjusted tempo. Loyola (5-12) plays slightly faster (271), but my thesis for the first-half spread is:\n\n**A)** George Mason will limit possessions as they look to stay unbeaten in the A10 against the worst team in the league. I would love to get a 3.5 line to guard against a slow, tight game, but I don't think Loyola can stay within three possessions in the first half.  \n**B)** Loyola's possessions will not go through their quality scorers. Without Moore (and/or Amos), the Ramblers will turn to a junior center with a sub-20 percent usage rate and a sophomore guard who shoots 38.1 percent. If Moore plays, is he 90%? 80? 60? How do you trust a guy who missed all three of his shots in eight minutes and then sat?  \n**C)** George Mason holds a *distinct* advantage in team shooting percentage (48.8 percent to 42.0). Even if Loyola's top scorers play, I don't see that advantage changing. All we need to cover is two possessions, two shots, two more stops than Loyola can produce.  \n**D)** Loyola ranks near the bottom of the NCAA in committing turnovers while George Mason plays disciplined with the 38th fewest turnovers.  \n**E)** Loyola simply cannot make their 3s (31.3 percent). If George Mason pulls away early, don't expect the Ramblers to make up ground from beyond the arc. In fact, Loyola's percentage lines up perfectly with George Mason's 3-point defense (31.9 percent).\n\nGeorge Mason is off to the school's best start, including an unprecedented 4-0 mark in conference play. Even the 2005-06 Final Four team was 12-4 at this point in the season. George Mason is riding a seven-game winning streak, and they've covered the first-half spread in two of their last three games. I think George Mason makes its shots, dictates pace, causes turnovers, and guards a Loyola squad that is battling injuries.\n\nLoyola has lost three in a row, and shows no sign of life. They got drubbed by 35 at George Washington on Saturday, including 60-39 in the first half. Over the last 10 games, Loyola is 3-7 against the first-half spread. In their last four games, they've failed to cover three times and pushed once. They are simply getting outmatched early. And I haven't even gotten to George Mason's offense, which KenPom rates 78th. Unlike the Ramblers, the Patriots *can* make 3s (35.6 percent). George Mason's true shooting percentage is over 60 percent. They spread the wealth with five players averaging double digits. I've been harping on how injuries and just-being-bad will sink Loyola, but George Mason is not an offensive welterweight. In their previous game, the Patriots dropped 86 on a win over VCU. The offense is there.\n\nThe reason I'm not taking the full-game spread (-7.5 as of this writing)  is because I'm scared to death of a backdoor cover against a desperately bad conference team playing at home. If the rout is on in the first half, George Mason may use the second to rest key players, get experience for the B Team, and create a glorified practice setting. That feels like a seven-point win on a -7.5 line all day. Devil's advocate: Loyola is 4-13 against the spread, but George Mason is hovering around .500 (9-7). I don't trust it for a full game, but I like it for the half.\n\nGood luck and Godspeed!\n\nIf I've made you a few bucks through fades, it's just gonna ask you a few questions: [https://buymeacoffee.com/seventh\\_\\_place](https://buymeacoffee.com/seventh__place)",

San Jose was clearly not up to the task as they got absolutely lit-up on home ice. Should've known better than to assume they'd be able to pull off 2 streak-breakers in the same weekend. But we move.\n\n**Write Up:** So I get to fade my team on this one. Had this game circled as a loss for a minute, here's why:\n\n1. Washington 8-1-1 in their last 10 vs with only 1 game going to OT. The only match-up so far this season was an 8-4 Washington win on November 20, 2025.\n\n2. Montreal's starter tomorrow is Sam Montembault, who is 2-5-0 in 10 games vs. the Caps, getting the hook his last 2 times out, including the Nov 20 game where he gave up 3 goals on 10 shots. Against Washington, he has a career GAA of 3.47 and an .890 SV%.\n\n3. On the flip side, Washington will likely start Logan Thompson, who is 5-1-1 lifetime vs. Montreal. In his 5 wins, he's given up 2 goals 3 times, and 1 goal twice. He has a 2.43 GAA and .915 SV% vs. Montreal. In the off-chance they start former-Canadien Charlie Lindgren, he's lifetime 4-1-0 H2H in 7 games (came on twice in relief), and holding a 2.98 GAA and .885 SV% vs. the Habs. But the Caps  don't have a B2B until Jan 23-24 in Alberta, so no reason not to start Thompson.\n\n4. Montreal won at home tonight 6-3 at home with an impressive 41-23 shot edge but have to travel right away (assuming the current snow allows travel tonight). They'll also be playing their 5th game in 7 days, and their 3rd set of B2Bs since Jan 3-4. Washington on the other hand haven't played B2B since Dec 31-Jan 1. Montreal is the youngest team in the league, so perhaps less susceptible to fatigue, but Washington should still have fresher legs. \n\n5. On the injury front, Montreal might be getting Josh Anderson back in the line-up Monday as he's DTD, but that doesn't move the needle much since he's -7 with 2 points in his last 10 vs. Washington. The Habs are still without mercurial sniper Patrik Laine and centres Jake Evans, Kirby Dach and Alex Newhook. Washington on the other hand should have D-man Jakob Chychrun back who missed last game with an illness, and is +10 with 6 points in his last 10 H2H vs. Montreal. Both right-wings Tom Wilson and Justin Sourdif are DTD, Wilson obviously being the more significant loss as he has 9 points in his last 10 H2H.\n\n6. Alex Ovechkin love to play vs. Montreal. He had a hat trick last time out, is 9G-5A-14P and +6 for his last 10 games with a 27.3% shot%, and is 42G-32A-74P and +13 in 61 career games vs. Montreal, averaging 4.27 shots/game. Dylan Strome (3G-13A-16P) and Aliaksei Protas (2G-7A-9P) over their last 10 H2H are also playing the Habs well. \n\nAll this to say, while I never root against Montreal, this is one of those where I'm thinking that my consolation prize will be to get back in the win column. \n\n**BoL and play responsibly. Comment if you tail or fade if that's your thing, or don't, I'm not your mom.**",

In additiona, Peterborough & Sheffield are No2 & No1 in the league respectively, roughly separated by 10 places from their opponents.

I also see City changing back to thr \"feed Haaland\" tactic they started the season with, with all of their creative players and the new arrival of Semenyo.

That was a fuckin’ sweat and really had no need to be. I am not sure I have ever seen a more idiotic defensive play in my life than the one we saw by Szoboszlai. Barnsley had a couple early chances, but that was a very undeserved goal. Liverpool had their fair share of chances but really didn’t take advantage of all the opportunities. We caught a lifeline in the 90’+4’ with Liverpool 4th goal that helped us cover and end on the right side of this one. I’ll be staying away from this Liverpool side for a bit. That being said, hit my prediction with 4+ for Liverpool and 1 or less for Barnsley.\n\n**Today's Write Up:** Today we are rocking a classic European 2-legger so that we can get 2x as sweaty while two matches rage on simultaneously. First leg at 1:30 PM CT is Dortmund ML over Werder Bremen. Dortmund at home and Dortmund away are quite different squads. This season, Dortmund has 5 wins and 2 draws in 7 matches at home, with 4  wins, 4 draws, and 1 loss away. They are a top tier Bundesliga team, but their home win rate has far surpassed their away win rate. On the other side of the pitch, Bremen has been awful away, coming up with only 1 win, 3 draws, and 4 losses on the road. This season on the road, they lost 4-0 to Bayern, 2-0 to RB Leipzig, and 4-1 to Eintracht Frankfurt; which are their most similar road matches against the top ⅓ of the table. I’ll be riding Dortmund ML on a matchup like this 10 times out of 10. Give me Dortmund to score 2-4 goals and Bremen to score 1 or fewer.\n\nOur second leg is Atletico Madrid ML vs Deportivo La Coruna in the Spanish Copa Del Rey. There isn’t a ton to say here other than we have a top 4 La Liga squad in Atletico against a La Liga 2 team. Atletico just lost 2-1 to a really good Real Madrid squad(who just kept it very close with Barcelona in the Spanish Super Cup Final 3-2), and are looking to [rebound.](http://rebound.as) As an interesting point of reference, Atletico Madrid just drew away at Real Sociedad 1-1. Deportivo la Coruna recently played at home against Real Sociedad 2 (the B squad) and lost 3-0. I could probably go on for awhile about reasons why Atletico should win this easily, but I’ll leave it at that. I love Atletico to have a clean sheet here, but if they have a mental lapse, I’ll take them to win by at least 1. Expecting 1-3 goals for Atletico and zero (maybeee 1 for DLC).",

I think betting sites have it wrong by putting them at -110. While I do see that the Stars are struggling just like the Ducks, the stats say a completely different story. Stars are 3-7 in their last 10 games with 37 goals scored and 35 goals allowed while the Ducks are 1-8-1 with 26 goals scored and **48 goals allowed**!! For me this is just a Dallas Stars team in a slump (who are still 2nd in the whole league btw) while the Ducks are showing their true colors by being a top 5 team for the draft.\n\nYou could tell me the argument that the Stars will be tired from their back-to-back games wellllll the exact same scenario happened the last time they played this season (December 19) with Dallas playing the day before while the Ducks came in fresh. The result? The Ducks got destroyed 8-3. \n\n\nDallas will also have Jamie Benn back in the lineup while I saw at Ducks practice that one of their top forward, Leo Carlsson, left early and did not return so there's a chance he doesn't play or plays injured (which might be the case already). Troy Terry will also not play for the Ducks so they might play without their 1st and 2nd best forwards.\n\nI see this as a back and forth game that the Stars will ultimately win because of their experience and better goaltending(I know DeSmith has been leaky lately but both Ducks goalies have been way worse).\n\nBOL!",

I think this trend is going to continue in the Spanish cup and I feel like Atletico are going to be the (un)fortunate victims of an upset. Their **form has been patchy** and their playstyle often hot and cold, with their **clunky slow build ups** that have become predictable. Their key players are either **out of form, like Griezmann and Alvarez,** or **injured, like Barrios and Lenglet.**\n\nMeanwhile, their opponents, Deportivo are close to the top of the second Spanish division, fighting for an automatic promotion spot, *although their form has also been anything but stellar* as of late. Still, they're not a pushover in the slightest and I back them to at least reach extra time against a what should be a tired and **heavily rotated Atletico Madrid** side that had travelled all the way to Saudi Arabia to face Real Madrid in an intense match just a few days ago (which they lost, so **their morale is at a season low).** They're definitely not going to be at their best and I seriously believe they're in for a rude awakening when they clash with Deportivo. Taking the morale, energy, injuries, poor individual and collective form, and rotation into consideration, I think these odds that cover two outcomes are absolutely golden.

It’s a ground where even in-form players can disappear in key moments. Newcastle come into this game on a three-game home winning streak, and I can tell you right now that place will be bumping tomorrow.\n\nBefore Manchester City’s emphatic win against League One side Exeter, they drew three straight matches against Premier League opposition - Sunderland (0-0, A), Chelsea (1-1, H), and Brighton (2-2 ,H). City have started to adapt to being more open and allowing teams more time on the ball, but the issue is that opponents still find themselves in behind and in one-on-one situations with City defenders far too often. You can tell the back line is nervous about conceding late — and ironically, they still ended up conceding late goals against both Chelsea (90' + 4) and Brighton (60').\n\nA significant development here is that City lost both of their starting centre-backs to injury just over a week ago (Dias and Gvardiol). Alleyne has looked solid, but St. James’ Park is no joke — especially when you’ve only played one Premier League match so far with your new back line.\n\nI see the Exeter game painting over some defensive cracks that will resurface against athe riled up  Magpies, not saying City will lose but considering this is leg 1 of a 2-game tie, I see Newcastle throwing the kitchen sink at it\n\n**BOL**\n\n![gif](giphy|KF2UlEZDfMBVDrrtfx)",

Taxes. Sparty respecting our coin.\n\nFor those of you who’ve been along for the POTD ride since last February, it’s a phrase you’ve heard me repeat quite a bit. For good reason too, as Michigan State has had a knack for delivering the goods whenever we’ve backed them. And although some of the familiar faces from last year’s squad no longer remain, this year’s Spartans (14-2) are more than capable of taking up the baton.\n\nIt all starts with a defensive unit that, believe it or not, is even better than the year before.\n\nThrough 16 games, Michigan State ranks 5th in opponent field-goal percentage (38.4%), 11th in scoring defense (64.5 PPGA), 14th in defensive efficiency (0.923) and 45th in opponent three-point shooting (30.3%). Those numbers have looked even better as of late, as the unit has conceded just 58.3 points per game on 34.1% shooting—27.5% from beyond the arc—over its last three contests. Sure, Indiana presents a tough out offensively, ranking 26th in offensive efficiency (1.185), 41st in field-goal percentage (48.3%), 42nd in scoring (84.5 PPG) and 57th in three-point shooting (36.3%). However, the Spartans defense has proven it can match wits with the best of them.\n\nDon’t take my word for it, just take a look at how the unit has fared in its seven matchups (5-2) against offenses ranked in the Top 70 in offensive efficiency:\n\n* **Arkansas (15th):** 66 points, 39% shooting (25% from three)\n* **Duke (18th):** 66 points, 38% shooting (31% from three)\n* **Iowa (20th):** 52 points, 38% shooting (30% from three)\n* **Kentucky (38th):** 66 points, 35% shooting (23% from three)\n* **Nebraska (53rd):** 58 points, 34% shooting (36% from three)\n* **North Carolina (54th):** 58 points, 38% shooting (17% from three)\n* **Northwestern (66th):** 66 points, 38% shooting (23% from three)\n\nConversely, here’s how the Hoosiers (12-4) have fared against opponents who rank in the Top 60 in defensive efficiency:\n\n* **Nebraska (20th):** 77 points, 46% shooting (37% from three)\n* **Louisville (22nd):** 78 points, 41% shooting (32% from three)\n* **Kentucky (43rd):** 60 points, 34% shooting (17% from three)\n* **Minnesota (54th):** 64 points, 40% shooting (30% from three)\n\nNot only did Indiana lose all four of those games by six points or more, those numbers in Saturday’s matchup with Nebraska are a little misleading. While the team did shoot lights out during the first half, the Hoosiers only managed to shoot a meager 36.7% from the field during the second half while coughing up a 16-point lead in the process. Not surprisingly, the team is still seeking its first Quadrant 1 victory after falling short in each of its first three opportunities.\n\nLook for Michigan State’s interior presence to loom large on Tuesday night.\n\nPer KenPom, the team ranks 22nd in average height and 20th in effective height. Not surprisingly, the Spartans have made their impact felt down low, ranking 24th in second-chance points (14.6 per game) and 32nd in blocks (4.8). That advantage shows up on the glass as well, as the team ranks 5th in total rebounding (42.7), 8th in defensive rebounding (27.6) and 12th in offensive rebounding (12.3) while also ranking 4th in opponent total rebounding (29.1), 6th in opponent offensive rebounding (6.6) and 17th in opponent defensive rebounding (19.3). That should present more than a handful of problems for an Indiana team that ranks just 105th in total rebounding (36.8), 122nd in opponent offensive rebounding (8.6) and 167th in opponent second-chance points (11.1).\n\nHowever, if there was one Achilles heel for Michigan State, it’s turnovers.\n\nOn the season, the team has struggled mightily to keep control of the ball, ranking 214th in turnovers (12.4 per game), 235th in turnovers per possession (17.8%) and 279th in opponent steals (7.6). That imperfection was really put on display during the Spartans’ disaster of a first half last time out against Northwestern, where the team turned it over eight times. Fortunately, the Hoosiers defense doesn’t appear to be equipped with much bite in that area, ranking just 229th in turnovers forced (11.4), 236th in opponent turnovers per possession (16.0%) and 298th in steals (5.6). Those numbers have been even worse over the team’s last three outings, dropping to 7.7, 11.3% and 2.7 respectively.\n\nLook for Michigan State to put together two full halves of clean, dominant basketball in front of the home fans on its way to a comfortable victory.\n\nBOL if tailing, and as always, please do so respectfully. One bet should not be enough for you to crash out.",

      "text": "**POTD** Record 130-03-101\n\n\n\nHAMBURGER VS BAYER LEVERKUSEN\n\nDate: 13 JANUARY 2026 at 20:30\n\nBET ON: Over / Under- Over +2.50\n\nOdd: 1.65\n\n\n\n\\- HSV have conceded heavily all season and continue to show defensive vulnerability — their last five matches all saw more than 1.5 goals and goals at both ends, reflecting a systemic issue in transition and structure that coach Merlin Polzin hasn’t fully fixed yet. Even with absences (Glatzel, Poulsen, Elfadli suspended), Polzin’s 3-4-3/3-4-2-1 setup invites open play with wing-backs pushing high and frequent transitions, often leaving space at the back that opponents can exploit.\n\n\\- Leverkusen, under Kasper Hjulmand, openly acknowledge a need for improvement after their recent 1-4 home defeat against Stuttgart and are motivated to score more — Hjulmand stressed before the game that the team must perform “much better than Saturday” and that he expects a tough, open match against a speedy Hamburg side. With Patrik Schick hopeful of returning from injury to boost the attack, Leverkusen’s offensive firepower increases, but they historically concede in phases when trying to maintain high possession and press aggressively.\n\n\\- Combining these factors — HSV’s ongoing defensive lapses and direct style, Leverkusen’s need to respond offensively after recent setbacks, and both coaches’ public confirmation that the match will be competitive and demanding — strongly indicates a game with multiple scoring chances and goals on both sides. Recent statistical trends in German Bundesliga data also show both teams contributing to higher-scoring matches, making Over 2.50 goals a convincing market choice.",

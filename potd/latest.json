      "text": "\nOverall record 74W-44L\n\nUnits +65.5\n\nLast pick:\n\nPSG Vs Tottenham \n\nPSG win and over 2.5 goals \n\n(1.80) 2 units ✅\n\nGreat to be back with a win, would have been so underwhelming to come back to anything less\n\n\nThis actually drifted out to just over double money odds by kick off I couldn't understand why.\n\nA bizarre game with Tottenham going ahead twice, and actually scoring 3 goals from only 7 shots, both sides very clinical but PSG were the dominant team and good value for the win 5-3 in the end a bit sweaty at times but all my picks usually are 😅 \n\n\n\nToday's pick:\n \nUefa Europa League \n\nFeyenoord Vs Celtic \n\nFeyenoord win and over 1.5 goals \n\n(1.90) 2.5 units\n\nCeltic are a club in a very bad state at the moment, they've had a poor season for their standards performing very poorly, there are a number of factors for this but for me it's mostly been the board and owners.\n\nThey have let some key players leave and have brought in some underwhelming players mostly on free transfers. Not helped also by arguably their best attacker Jota being injured also\n\nYes you may look and see they've won their last 2 games and Feyenoord have lost their last 3, for me you can't just go off recent wins and loses, and performances and stats are much more important in the long term.\n\n\nAt home Celtic have an incredible atmosphere and the fans have carried them but away from home they have played some terrible performances, very lucky to recently beat minnows St Mirren 1-0 . St Mirren managed to accumulate 1.6 XG to Celtics 0.8xg\n\nThey got destroyed 3-1 away to Danish side Midtjylland lost also 3-1 to Hearts and lost embarrassingly 2-0 away to Dundee **just 1 win in their last 4 away games**\n\nFeyenoord played in the champions League last season, they are having a blip in short term form themselves, losing their last 3 but still performing well in attack, no shame in losing to top German side Stuttgart, but should be doing better defensively.\n\n**They still boost a strong home record of 7 wins from 10 home matches this season**\n\nFeyenoord have much stronger pedigree in Europe in recent history, they have a much stronger squad on paper particularly in attack, with no significant injuries unlike Celtic I just can't pass up on this play. Feyenoord should have far too much fire power for Celtic to handle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoffee's always appreciated if you have found my write ups and tips useful ☕\n\nhttps://buymeacoffee.com/willo777\n\n\n\n** BOL and only bet what you can afford to lose!  **",

Both of these teams are coming off of game winning field goals and the two of these teams are fighting to keep their playoff hopes alive in this one. The main reason I like the Cheifs in this one is because of how bad the Cowboys defense is this year, especially in pass coverage and they are facing a Chiefs offense that is very pass heavy. The Cowboys defense is one of the worst in the NFL this year with over 270 passing yards allowed per game which is second to last in the league and also second to last in scoring defense allowing over 28 points per game to opponents. I think Rashee Rice, Xavier Worthy and Travis Kelce cook this Cowboys secondary and I wouldnt even be suprised to see Marquise Brown to make an impact in this one. The Chiefs run game has been stale recently but I am expecting that to change in this one as they are getting Isiah Pacheco back so I think this will greatly help the Chiefs offense out. The Chiefs have also been playing solid defense this year, they having been allowing less than 100 rushing yards per game as well as having a top 7 pass defense in the league. They are also doing a good job of keeping teams out of the endzone as they rank 4th in the NFL in points allowed per game with only an average of 18 points let up per game. With a pass offense that I think will exploit this Cowboys secondary and a solid defense, I think the Chiefs take this one by more than a field goal.\n\nPrediction: 27-21 Chiefs\n\nLast pick:🏈Bowling Green -3.5/Western Michigan ML💰Great games played both by Bowling Green and Western Michigan! No sweats are my favorite!!\n\nHappy Thanksgiving everyone! I hope everyone has a great day with family, theres nothing better than family, food and football!! Best of luck to everyone tailing and remember to bet responsibly!🦃🍽️🍀💜🐉\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w730diunpo3g1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2c4a722dc2a18b475459cbb6cd2ce529543d0501",

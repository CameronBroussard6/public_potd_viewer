      "text": "Record 5-2 (Pending)\n\n**POTD: SGA over 29.5 and New York Knicks ML**\n\nI like this spot for SGA when Jalen Williams is out as he becomes the number 1 option and there is not going to be any hockey passes. For example I mean if someone is hounded maybe SGA will have to pass it off to Jalen and they make a play through that, for example SGA doubled passes to Jalen/Isiah Hartenstein who will hockey it off to Holmgreen or a shooter. With him out and potentially Caruso, the only real play maker is Ajay Mitchel who could definitely be doing this exact scenario. But it's more so when Ajay Mitchel is benched, I'm not sure who else would be able to make a play. \n\nThe Bucks currently are also one of the worst defensive teams and are bottom 3 in points allowed to PGs. I'm not too concerned about a blow out as OKC struggles on the boards and suck at guarding threes which is what all these Bucks players do besides Giannis. Obviously I could be wrong and it's a case of them hitting or missing all their shots etc but I give a blow out chance maybe a 30 percent chance. As when your NBA champions it usually makes all teams lock in when they have to play vs them. More so I think the effort will be a lot higher then OKC tbh however their defense scheme of swarming could lead to them turning it over a lot.\n\nAnalysis would be SGA has hit 30 Points in 17/20 games without Jalen Williams and his last 2 games in 2025 was 22 minutes 34 points and 34 minutes and 31 points. I think the main concerns are double teams but even then the Bucks have been fouling a lot it seems to me. And this man loves to get to the stripe.\n\nKnicks im taking as ML because currently they are so bad that they are literally talking about trading KAT and I really do not see them trading him when Brunson took a pay cut for him lmfao. Brunson was also pretty rusty and I'm fairly sure he rushed back when he was still injured.\n\nHonestly you could take SGA as a straight at 31.5 if you're not a big parlay kinda guy which I get as well. Or you could also change the Knicks ML as they have been pretty stinky.",

TNT is always dangerous with their guard play and pace, but they simply don't have an answer for June Mar Fajardo down low. When the game slows down in the 4th quarter, SMB’s ability to dump it into the post generates high-percentage shots, while TNT often lives and dies by the three. San Miguel has the deeper bench and the championship pedigree to handle big games. I expect them to control the rebounding battle and wear TNT down physically.\n\nBOL! \n\nhttps://buymeacoffee.com/222benz",

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 24-28-5 (Avg Odds +128)\n\n**Previous Pick:** Haaland ATGS and Over 3.5 Goals (+116) ❌️\n\n**Today's Event:** Champion's League (Soccer) | Chelsea vs Pafos (12:00 PM PST)\n\n**Pick:** Moises Caicedo 1+ SOT (+105) 1 unit to win 1.05 units\n\n**Write Up:** Well we had half the pick right, over 3.5 goals hit. Haaland didn’t show up. He whiffed a few great chances where he normally finds the back of the net. The Rodri red card didn't help either. \n\nBack to my picking roots here as we take another Chelsea midfielder to land a shot on target. Chelsea host Pafos, the 2nd place team in the Cypriot First Division (Cyprus) in the UEFA Champion's League. This will be Chelsea's first UCL match under their new manager, and the club would love a win here to pull themselves into the top 8. Chelsea have all sorts of illnesses and injuries going on, so as always **please consider waiting for lineups if your book does not void for players not starting.** However, I do believe Caicedo will feature with Enzo questionable after reportedly playing their weekend match very ill and James reportedly nursing another injury. I also expect Palmer to be rested here for this heavily rotated team. \n\nMissing many key players, Caicedo will likely be asked to play further forward than normal. Coach Rosenior has also been pushing all of his midfielders to push forward. Caicedo is typically a more defensive midfielder, which gave Enzo room to roam. Again, I'm expecting this to change for this match much like the position we saw him play against Fulham after the early red card, where he had 2 SOTs playing 10v11. The other reason I like this play is that Caicedo has been known to pull the trigger on long shots from distance, usually pretty accurately. The fans also encourage this, and I expect him to take a bit more shooting risk against a team Chelsea should beat. \n\nPafos allow the 8th most SOTs in the UCL, averaging 6 per game. Interestingly enough they allow the most shots per game (21). An extreme example, Bayern Munich on the road at Pafos had 15 SOTs on 26 shots. Juventus at home took 25 shots. Pafos tend to run a low block and encourage shots from distance, this is where I expect Caicedo to find his shots. This should be teed up perfectly for Caicedo to land at least one SOT. \n\nBOL and happy Wednesday!",

Al Khor always try to play, even when they shouldn’t, and that leaves space everywhere. Al Rayyan are ruthless when given room and won’t slow the game down once they start scoring. When one goal goes in, more usually follow quickly. This feels like a classic open contest where defending is optional. Over 4.5 goals.",

Scoring twice in all 3 home matches but going 1-1-1 overall with 6 goals scored and 6 against. \n\nThey will fancy their chances vs a \"weak\" Eintracht Frankfurt. \n\nEintracht Frankfurt has gone 0-1-2 away in the Champions League this season with 2 scored and 7 against. \n\nWith 4 points out of 6 games they may seem eliminated but here is why I think they will act like they still have a chance. \n\nTheir schedule so far has been a single win vs Galatasaray, a draw vs Napoli and losses vs Atletico Madrid, Liverpool, Atalanta and Barcelona. \n\nA lot of big dogs in Europe whilst their remaining 2 matches are against Qarabag today and Tottenham at home. \n\nThey require a win here to keep their CL dream alive. \n\nThe 2-7 goalscoring record might not look promising either but in the Bundesliga their 10 away games saw 50 goals with a 23-27 split. \n\nThere is insane potential in this match and I expect another success. \n\nFade or tail, BOL!",

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 10-31-5 *The Barcelona curse is lifted at last and my 10th win is here! I even predicted the Oyarzabal masterclass. Truth be told, Barcelona should've walked all over Sociedad in that game but luck was finally on my side for once. I decided to take a breather after that madness and came back just in time because Barca and I still have some unfinished business left. Let's get to it*\n\n**Last Five:** 🅿️❌❌🅿️✅\n\n**Event:** Champions League, Slavia Prague v FC Barcelona, 3:00 pm EST\n\n**POTD:** Slavia Prague +1.5 Asian Handicap, +105, 4 units\n\n**Write Up:** We're coming right back to take another hit at Barcelona while they're vulnerable. They head into what promises to be a tough game against the Czech side, Slavia Prague, on the back of a **tough defeat** to a midtable Sociedad team, and without **Yamal, who's suspended** for the clash, as well as a questionable **Raphinha, just coming back from injury**. **Cancelo is also not registered** for the Champions League.\n\n*Slavia Prague might not be doing amazingly well in the Champions League this season,* but they're a team more than capable of causing an upset against a shaken up Barcelona that can't catch any rest. They're still **unbeaten in their domestic league,** which *admittedly isn't nearly as strong as the Spanish one,* but it still features very respectable teams that produce players that then go on to play in the big leagues for big money. They've **scored over 2 goals a game (41 in 19), while conceding at a rate of less than a goal per game (16 in 19),** proving just how stable they are on both ends of the pitch. The same absolutely cannot be said for **Barca, as their defence routinely lets them down** and this has been especially apparent in Champions League this season as they've already dropped **points in three games,** meaning they have a measly **win rate of just 50%.** On the Czech side, Provod has been Slavia's main man this season, notching up **15 G/A in 26 apps,** and he'll be looking to torment the shakey Barcelona defence. Remember the name.\n\nHaving said all that, I still think *Slavia need a bit of a helping hand* and that's where the AH comes into play. We're making sure the bet wins even in case of a narrow loss, and while I think Barcelona are definitely capable of beating Slavia today, I just can't see them winning by more than a goal away from home. Let me tell you, these Eastern European sides are on a different level when a big team shows up in the Champions League, being able to grind out results at home time and time again. A low scoring draw seems like the most likely outcome to me, so you can also experiment with that. It seems like last weekend was the weekend of underdogs and the start of the week seems to have followed this trend, with teams like Manchester City, PSG, Napoli, Bayer Leverkusen, Dortmund all being shocked by weaker teams on paper, and I think Barcelona are next to follow suit. The Dro drama really doesn't help them either. Confidence is high so I'm laying four whole units on this play. BOL and may the best team win ☘️🫡",

But as far as Nebraska’s unbeaten season is considered, that conclusion won’t be coming on Wednesday night. \n\nThe Huskers (18-0) have easily been the story of the season. Not only is the team’s 18-0 start the best in program history, its 21-game win streak is the longest active streak in the nation. Not to mention, this is already a battle-tested Nebraska squad that has captured five Quad 1 wins—tied for fourth nationally—and five Quad 2 victories. \n\nBut it’s not just that the team is winning games, it’s how it’s doing it. \n\nThe Cornhuskers are flat out dominating opponents. The team has seven victories by 19 points or more—including its last two against Oregon and Northwestern—and has now covered in each of its last four games by an average margin of +13.75 points. In fact, in games with a spread of -13.5 or less, Nebraska is 9-1-1 ATS. \n\nThe team can thank a suffocating defense for much of that success.\n\nThrough 18 games, the Cornhuskers rank 5th in opponent field-goal percentage (38.8%), 14th in scoring defense (65.3 PPGA), 15th in defensive efficiency (0.931) and 52nd in opponent three-point shooting (30.7%). Furthermore, the team has held 12 of its 18 opponents to under 1.0 points per possessions. But Nebraska really seems to get an additional spark when playing in front of the home fans, ranking 3rd in defensive efficiency (0.826), 3rd in opponent field-goal percentage (34.6%), 4th in scoring defense (57.8 PPGA) and 40th in opponent three-point shooting (28.2%) in 12 home games. That could prove devastating to a middle of the pack Washington offense that ranks 89th in scoring (80.1 PPG), 96th in offensive efficiency (1.102), 157th in field-goal percentage (45.1%) and 312th in three-point shooting (30.7%). Not to mention, the team averages just 75.5 points per game on 42.1% shooting (29.9% from beyond the arc) away from home. \n\nUnfortunately, the Huskies (10-8) might find themselves undermanned on the other end of the floor, as well. \n\nThus far, Washington ranks 87th in opponent three-point shooting (31.7%), 107th in defensive efficiency (1.018), 110th in opponent field-goal percentage (43.2%) and 149th in scoring defense (74.0 PPGA). That should provide a dangerous Cornhuskers offense—38th in offensive efficiency (1.160), 58th in field-goal percentage (47.4%), 65th in scoring (81.4 PPG) and 91st in three-point shooting (35.5%)—plenty of openings to pounce. Furthermore, this is an offense that seems to be gelling as of late, averaging 83.3 points on 50.9% shooting (43.8% from deep) over its last three games. Junior forward Pryce Sandfort (16.7 PPG) has been leading that charge, averaging 25 points on 57% shooting over the last two games. \n\nBut the X factor in this one will come down to turnovers. Or lack there of.\n\nOn the season, Nebraska has played some of the cleanest basketball in the country, ranking 4th in turnovers (9.1 per game), 8th in turnovers per possession (12.9%) and 8th in opponent steals (4.9). Believe it or not, over the team’s last three games, those numbers have free-fallen, dropping to 6.3, 9.8% and 2.7 respectively. Against a lesser-talented Huskies defense (272nd in turnovers forced) that will need to rely on creating turnovers to keep this close, that should prove to be the nail in the coffin. \n\nTrust the Huskers to keep on rolling.\n\nBOL if tailing, and as always, please do so responsibly. One bet should not have you crashing out all over Reddit.",

ROYAL RENDEZVOUS $1.75 (Bet 3.5 units to win just over 6.1)                          \n**Write Up:** Back at it today with probably one of my most confident plays since I started posting POTD, hence the increase in units.    \n    \nThis horse ROYAL RENDEZVOUS is a star in the making and its first 2 starts have been huge. First up with no market expectation, it sat worse than midfield and unleashed a massive turn of foot to win softly on the line, beating a horse who came out and won its next start by almost 3 lengths.    \n    \nLast start was a horror watch. Forced back to last from a bad barrier, and had traffic problems in the straight until it was way too late. Still had the turn of foot to pick up really late and rattle off some seriously impressive sectionals to finish 4th, beaten just over a length. This race in particular was a strong Saturday class race containing some very good horses.    \n    \nWe now go from an on pace bias track of Geelong, to a wide open Sandown that heavily favours our racing style, plus we get an increase of 200m. Drawn perfectly in barrier 4, I imagine D Lane just sits midfield or even a touch worse, and with the long straight we have ample time to unleash our run down the middle and get over the top.    \n    \nI’m very big on sectionals/race splits and I can’t begin to describe how big this horse’s 400-200 and last 200m splits have been. To be running home this fast is the trait of a well above average horse, and I think up in distance + a more suitable track, RR is set to explode here.

Cobolli was pretty average at the United Cup and was suffering from diarrhoea apparently in the match. Wont read much into it.\n\nFery is known for his agressive baseline play but he lacks a serve that delivers punch. His 1st serve win %'s are only slightly higher than his second. The problem with that is, he now faces a guy that was already a dominant baseline player with a huge first serve that he wins on average 75%+ of the time.\n\nEtcheverry has played 5 top 100 players to start the year and his service game has been solid winning 74% of 1st service games and 57% of second service games over that span against opponents much better than Fery.\n\nIt's difficult to see where Fery has an advantage here given Etcheverry is a natural clay court player who has developed significantly on hard courts i.e. he knows how to construct a point in rallies and break down baseline players (again, Fery's biggest strength).\n\nOnly reason this isn't a 4U or 5U play is that Etcheverry has gone the distance in his last 3 games, including the 5 setter against Kecmanovic.\n\nAs always, bet this on a book that pays out the winner on retirement and voids bets on the retiring player.\n\nBOL",

      "text": "2026 record: 6-7 (-2.1 units)\n\n2025 record: 55-41 (+26.5 units)\n\nLast 10 (most recent on right):  ❌✅✅❌✅❌❌✅✅❌\n\nLast Pick: Eva Lys 🇩🇪 ML vs Sorana Cirstea 🇷🇴 ❌\n\nEvent: Australian Open R1 🎾\n\nPick of the Day: Daniil Medvedev 🇷🇺 -6.5 games handicap vs Quentin Halys 🇫🇷 5 units to win 4.2U @1.83 (Bet365)\n\nYes I know I’m betting on Medvedev in a grand slam match. He went an atrocious 1-4 in slams last year and his only win was against some guy ranked outside the top 300. But as they say it’s new year new me for Daniil. The former word No. 1 and three time finalist at the Australian Open finally sacked his coach after eight years together after the US Open and both his results and performances have improved since then. He won Almaty at the end of last year and  comfortably won Brisbane to start off his 2026. I feel like he’s getting closer to his best in terms of his baseline skills and is FINALLY starting to come to the net and finish points early. Medvedev’s ability to turn defence into offence is a joke which makes it very difficult to break him down. To be honest his first round was fairly unconvincing despite the straight set victory but to me it seemed more like a mental barrier from last year’s nightmare and he really grew into the match as it went on, applying more pressure to De Jong and limiting unforced errors. I expect him to carry on playing looser and continue his good form now that he won that. So what’s the one problem with Medvedev? His second serve is really bad. I mean seriously bad (as good as his first serve is) which caused him to break down when serving for the match twice against De Jong.\n\nNot to worry though, I introduce Quentin Halys the third worst returner on the ATP tour (according to the return quality stats) just ahead of Mpetshi Perricard and Opelka so the main issue is out of the way. The No. 83 can produce some good tennis at time but his low margin big hitting game causes huge periods of inconsistency. One week he was taking Rune to a fifth set at the French Open and the other he was on a 9 match losing streak losing to Bellucci 4 and 2. To be fair he’s had a pretty good start to the season going 7-2 including qualifiers and crushed Tabilo in round 1. So you may wonder why the handicap, well the match-up is simply the worst possible for Halys. His game is primarily driven through his excellent first serve + one combo but Medvedev’s comically deep return position and quality nullify this. As soon as a rally starts to be imposed (far from his forte) the errors will start to leak against a human backboard and his lack of movement exposed by one of the best movers on tour. Halys struggles in the physical matches and when every point will start to feel more and more like a grind, Medvedev should start to easily pull away. The only way he can keep this match close is if his first serve percentage stays high (8th best 1st serve% won on tour, 70th 2nd serve% which shows the disparity) as he will be crucified on second serves by the Russian. It was only 56% in round one and against the 5th best 2nd serve% returner that is a death sentence. \n\nHalys easily lost in his two matches over top 40 opposition (4,2 in both) this year and lost by the same score last time he faced Daniil on hard courts. They also faced last year on grass where Medvedev won against 2,5. If you had asked me to pick the worst opponent for Halys in the ATP I toughest probably have said Medvedev which is why I like this play. BOL !",

Will add some personal information in this write-up as well.\n\n• ⁠Model has Syracuse -2.5 at 55%\n\n• Model projects Syracuse ML at 58% \n\n• EV better betting 100$ = 10-11$ for this play\n\n• Before anyone says something, yes I’m aware, Syracuse just lost to Boston College - I believe Syracuse has a home edge in this one - they seem to play their best ball at home, and to be honest, they look a lot better at home, some games being night and day different - Syracuse is 9-2 at home this year, while VT is only 1-2 on the road, with their only road W being @ South Carolina (10-8) - In VT’s two road loses, SMU (buzzer beater) & Wake Forest, they played well & lost close games in both - While Virginia Tech’s offense is a high scoring one, I think Syracuses top 40 defense, top 30 at home, can slow them down a touch - Syracuse averages right around 80 PPG at home while holding away teams to just under 70 PPG - Syracuse covers at home at a nice percentage of 63%, which is important to note, regardless of their record - A fun statistic that stands out in this one is VT turns the ball over around 11 T/Os per game while Syracuse defense forces roughly 14 turnovers a game - VT shoots a whopping 48% from the field in the ACC, but when they are playing on their home court - this number drops down to 42% during road ACC games - Surprisingly, Syracuse averages almost the same amount of points scored in both halves as VT (38-40PPG per half) - I like the chances here with Syracuse’s home court advantage, them coming off a brutal ACC lose, and them playing their best ball in the dome.. Syracuse -2.5 to hopefully continue our win streak\n\nPOTD History: https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/SoggyDatabase2348-bvjHUn\n\nBOL!\n\n**POTD: NCAAMB: Syracuse -2.5 vs Virginia Tech -110 (1U TO WIN 0.90U)**\n\nTips are greatly appreciated - Proceeds will be going towards my student loans and my morning cold brews.

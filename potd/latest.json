Just disappointed & I apologize for the loss\\]*\n\nCricket | Women's Big Bash League | Adelaide Strikers (W) vs Brisbane Heat (W) | in \\~6.5hrs\n\nAdelaide Strikers (W) Win @ 1.65 (1u)\n\nWrite Up: While both these teams are at the bottom of the table, Adelaide still has a good team & has won a match & been unlucky with rain spoiling their chances in 2 matches +their previous match was a close 1 run loss. Dont expect them to lose to a clearly poor Brisbane team\n\nBoL & lets hope to turn it around",

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 7-4 (Avg Odds +113)\n\n**Previous Pick:** Iliman Ndiaye 1+ SOT (+105) ❌️\n\n**Today's Event:** UEFA Champions League | Chelsea vs Barcelona (12:00 PM PST)\n\n**Pick:** Enzo Fernandez 1+ SOT (+100) 1 unit to win 1 units\n\n**Write Up:** So I've never seen that before. A 13 minute red card for an Everton player slapping his own teammate. Obviously this really gutted our chances as Ndiaye shifted to a quasi-right back and Everton saw very little of the ball. Bummer too because he had a great chance early and was looking sharp. Fun fact, that was the 3rd time in Premier league history a player has been sent off for hitting a teammate. 3 times in 33 years. Anyways enough harping on that, on to the next. \n\nIn other news...guys...they're giving us Enzo 1+ SOT at plus money again. We've cashed this twice already in the last month and all of the same stats/data/feelings apply. \n\nOff we go back to London where Chelsea hosts Barcelona in the Champions League match of the week. As you all know, Barcelona is a great team. However, they have been leaky defensively over the last few matches, particularly in UCL, notably conceding 3 goals (6 SOT) to Brugge in their last CL match and 7 SOT to an injury ridden PSG. Both teams will want a win here, but I like Chelsea to show up here in front of their home crowd. \n\nThe caveat here is that **there is a non-zero chance that coach rotates some players** around for this mid week match as he has been known to do, but I really can't see him leaving out Enzo for a match this big. Even if he does come in as a sub, he will want to make an impact quickly and go for goal. \n\nIn case you want more #s, this has hit in his last 2/2 UCL matches (including the last match where he came on as a sub) and in his last 6/6 EPL matches (averaging 3 shots per game, just under 2 on target). \n\n**UCL and Europa matches are tough to predict**, squads get rotated, flukes happen, so mind your units. But I like our guy here again in this huge match, and I'm riding the Enzo train until the wheels fall off. BOL if tailing!",

      "text": "**Analking's pick of the day!!**\n\n**POTD Record:** 0-1\n\n**ROI** -100%\n\n**Last Pick:** Manchester United vs Everton, Man Utd to win ❌\n\n**Today's Event:** UEFA Champions League | Galatasaray vs Union Saint-Gilloise (17.45 GMT)\n\n**Pick:** Galatasaray to WIN! 1€ to win 1.69€\n\n**Write Up:** Well my first pick went wrong. But let's not get depressed because of that and I got another one coming here. Here is the reasoning for my pick: \n\nIf we look at the stats, this matchup is in Galatasaray’s favour. Their great attacking, strong defensive team play in past couple of weeks and UNBEATEN home record give them a clear edge. Union SG’s defensive unreliability, combined with their inconsistent away form, increases the difficulty of their mission to win or take points in Istanbul.\n\nGalatasaray are currently one of the hottest home sides across Europe - unbeaten in nine straight matches - and they are well-positioned to extend their Champions League winning streak to FOUR consecutive games.\n\nFew reasons why I expect that Galatasaray Will win:\n\nGalatasaray has three consecutive wins in last 3 rounds of UCL and are still unbeaten on home soil this whole season, with a record of NINE MATCHES WITHOUT A DEFEAT ACROSS ALL COMPETITIONS! Thats a crazy stat IMO! Also to add, USG has three back to back losses on UCL this season.\n\n**Pick: Galatasaray to Win.**\n\n\nBOL, let,s turn the record to 1-1! \n\nps. sorry if the text is not perfect in english, english is not my native language.",

      "text": "**POTD Record:**  95 – 62 - 9\n\n**Previous:**  Hajduk Split Double Chance & Over 1.5 Total Goals - LOSS\n\n**Recap:**  Single worst beat ever.  Best team in the league vs one of the worst and they lost by 5-0.  Absolute thrashing even suspect at times.  Hadjuk’s defense was passing the ball directly to the attackers right in front of the box.  Just a brutal lack of concentration and effort.\n\n**New Event:**  UCL Man City vs Leverkusen & Marseille vs Newcastle\n\n**Pick:**  Man City -1 Asian Handicap  & Newcastle Double Chance @ 1.80 (Usual 3 units)\n\n**WARNING:**  DO NOT TAIL ME.  I am on 3 game losing streak on POTD. \n\n**Leg 1 :  Manchester City -1 Asian Handicap vs Leverkusen**\n\n* City lost to Newcastle this past weekend by 2-1 in a fantastic match and are looking to bounce back strong and with good reason.\n* City are 23-0 home games without defeat in the Champions League league phase/group stage - winning 20 of them.\n* City have found the back of the net at least twice in each of their seven straight wins at the Etihad.\n* Earlier this month City beat Dortmund by 4-1 in a match with similar circumstances.\n* Leverkusen’s team is riddled with injuries and suspensions making this a lopsided affair favoring City.\n* Erling Haaland faced Leverkusen 4 times during his Dortmund days and scored 4 goals against them.\n\n**Leg 2 – Newcastle Double Chance vs Marseille**\n\n* Newcastle are riding high off a tremendous win against City this past weekend.\n* Newcastle have lost only twice in their last 13 Champions League away matches.\n* Marseille have not won a single match of their last 12 matches against English teams. \n* Marseille have many injuries and one suspension whereas Newcastle’s starting 11 against Man City should take the field.\n\nOnce again, all I can do is take the teams in better form and with higher probabilities of giving us a win.  It seems is has not been happening for me lately but fortune has not been kind to many others on POTD either.\n\nGamble responsibly please and enjoy yourselves. ",

He’s very talented (mainly a clay courter) and now he’s having a breakthrough year putting his hard court game together too finally. He had a great showing two weeks ago on the Sentra hard courts where he claimed the title. His performance in the finals *really* impressed me against his biggest step up in completion vs Bailly. He’s had two weeks now to acclimatize to the conditions for Athens 2 so championship hangover won’t be a factor. He’ll be super motivated to continue his great form into this challenger tournament with more ranking points and prize money as incentive.\n\nJames Story. 24 year old British ITF hard court farmer. Better doubles player than he is a singles player. He’ll be playing doubles here too so he’s got a built in fall-back mentally (and financially) knowing he has a doubles game the following day. He does ok farming low level M25 hard court tourneys but He’s only played *TWO* challenger level singles this year on hard courts beating Silvestre as a -10000 favourite and then loses the next game to Sakellaridis as a -500 favourite… He’ll be exposed tomorrow and Caniato will show levels on the outdoor harcourts of Athens 2.\n\nRide with the hottest capper in this subreddit and come see why they NVS🌟\n\n*If I’ve made you money and want to tip*: [BMAC☕️](https://buymeacoffee.com/nvsbets) or [BTC](https://pastebin.com/0Lf0mHqu) [ETH](https://pastebin.com/D2QRi3Bx)",

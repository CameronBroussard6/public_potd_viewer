Cambuur play aggressive, attacking football at home and rarely slow the tempo, but that approach leaves them exposed defnsively. Eindhven are happy to trade chances and can punish mistakes. With both teams favoring offense over control and defenses thatconcede regularly, an open match is expected. Over 3.5 goals is a strong and logical prediction here.",

I’m not just picking Colorado to beat Philadelphia tomorrow, I expect them beat the spread! Here’s why:\n\n**1. COL Home record:** Colorado have been struggling lately, esp.  at home where they are 1-1-2 in their last 4. ***However, they’re a whopping 20-1-4 at home this season, and all 20 wins coming in regulation.*** They are a combined 110 GF and 52 GA, good for 4.4 GF/GP and 2.08 GA/GP. If you remove the 3-7 shellacking against the lowly Preds last week, their GA/GP at home drops to 1.8. At home, they outshoot their opponents 36-25.5. In their last 10 at home, they’ve outscored opponents 39-21, and outchanced them 34.8 S/GP to 35.4 SA/GP. After dropping 3 of their last 4 and losing to Anaheim in OT their last time out (Dostal stood on his head to get the win for the Ducks), Colorado will be hungry to get back in the win column and not keep it close. \n\n**2. Offense, Defence, & Special Teams:** COL rank 1st in the NHL in scoring at 3.96 GF/GP, goals allowed at 2.27 GA/GP, PK% at 85% and shots/game at 34.9. In those same categories, PHI is 22nd in scoring at 2.9 GF/GP, 20th in goals allowed at 3.1 GA/GP, 23rd in PK% at 77.7% and 26th in shots/game at 26.0.  Now, you may think the power-play is where it turns, since the Avs are only 26th in the NHL with a 16.5 PP%, but the Flyers are 30th at 15.5%. The Flyers (4th) rank only slightly ahead of the Avs (8th) in SA/GP, 25.4 to 26.8. This won’t be enough to overcome the rest of the Avs strengths.\n\n**3. Goalies:** Philadelphia had better hope that starter Dan Vladar is ready to come off IR, as amongst qualifying goalies his .905 SV% (22 of 61) and 2.46 GAA (11 of 61) are WAY ahead of backup Samuel Ersson’s .858 SV% (61 of 61) and 3.38 GAA (53 of 61). Colorado’s still missing one half of lights-out goalie tandem Scott Wedgwood. If they go with presumptive starter Mackenzie Blackwood, his .917 SV% (4 of 61) and 2.26 GAA (5 of 61) are both top 5 for qualifying goalies. If they go with 2nd-year Trent Miner, he’s got 4 of his 6 lifetime games this season, putting up a .933 SV% and 2.03 GAA which belies his 1-0-2 record, as he came off the bench once, saving all 20 shots he face while already down 4-1 (Avs in a shootout) and his only win was a 4-0 29-save shutout of the Blue Jackets on Jan 10. \n\n**4. Goalie H2H:** Dan Vladar is 2-4-0 lifetime vs. Colorado, with a 3.88 GAA and .887 SV%. Ersson is 0-2-0 H2H with a 2.74 GAA and .913 SV% (he came off the bench once, making 8 saves on 9 shots after starter Carter Hart was shelled for 5 goals on 15 shots). On the flip side, Blackwood is 11-2-2 vs. Philly with a 2.24 GAA and .927 SV%. Trent Miner has never played against Philadelphia. \n\nAs this is an inter-conference games, these teams only face each other twice/year. That said, Avs won 3-2 in Philly in December this year, are on a 4-game win streak in this matchup and 7-2-0 in the past 5 seasons.\n\nLook to the Avs to right the ship and put up lopsided numbers here. If you're shy about the spread, the 3-way moneyline is currently at -190, it's just not juicy enough money in my opinion for this juggernaut. \n\n**BoL and play responsibly. Comment if you tail or fade if that's your thing, or don't, I'm not your mom.**",

Will add some personal information in this write-up as well.\n\n• ⁠Model has St. Louis ML at 87% (Highest % the model has shown me) \n\n• Model says St. Louis should be -10.5 favorites\n\n• EV better betting 100$ = 12-14$ for this play\n\n• I’m sure some of you will be hesitant about this because of the last time I bet on SLU (SLU vs. VCU over, and both teams shot under 29% in the 1H) - SLU is 6-0 in conference play, while the Bonnie’s are 1-5 - SLU is a top 10 team in the country when it comes to PPG - they average 91.1 PPG while the Bonnies are a bottom 2 team in the A10 in terms of defensive efficiency, also noting they are bottom 60 in the country - The pace in which SLU plays at is to fast for the Bonnies - Looking at the Bonnies, they have 3 guys - Mitchell, Charles, and Simmons - Simmons is their 3 ball threat, who is coming off one of his best shooting games this year - Mitchell is their big, who has been an absolute tank this year, and Charles who is just a very good player in every part of his game - that being said, the Bonnies have been inconsistent, especially in A10 play while SLU has continued to roll - Mitchell will have his hands full with Avila because Avila plays half of his game beyond the arc, and the other half in the paint - The pace of this game will be to fast for Mitchell - I can see SLU having a game plan along the lines of getting Mitchell switched on a pick, and getting him in foul trouble early - The Bonnies 2nd option behind Mitchell, is a freshman, who has played good minutes, but nothing close to what SLU can do - after the freshman, is there 4/5, Big Red (nickname) - and Bonnies coach, just last week talked about how he still has a lot to learn, and it’s more of his basketball IQ, and not so much his performance - Buddy Simmons can flat out shoot the lights out of the gym - but he has been very inconsistent - that’s the game plan for SLU, and a lot of other teams that play the Bonnie’s, limit one, Simmons or Mitchell, and you have a very good chance of winning \n\n•SLU has the best defense thus far in the A10, only holding teams to an average of 65 PPG - Bonaventure allows over 50% of shots from inside the paint, which SLU will exploit - SLU is a top 20 team in the nation in the rebound category, while the Bonnie’s are bottom 3 in the A10 alone - Ever since Marshall and Irmakov went in the injury category for the Bonnie’s, they have been pretty bad, their backcourt and depth is basically gone (hence the 1-5 start in the A10) - I like SLU -8.5 in this spot here\n\n\nPOTD History: https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/SoggyDatabase2348-bvjHUn\n\nBOL!\n\n**POTD: NCAAMB: SLU -8.5 vs St. Bonaventure -108 (1U TO WIN 0.92U)** \n\nTips are greatly appreciated - Proceeds will be going towards my student loans and my morning cold brews.

Let’s go bet on them!\n\nAfter winning 12 of their first 15 games, the Hoosiers (12-7) welcomed then-No. 10 Nebraska into town on Jan. 10. Up 16 points with a little over 16 minutes to go, a statement-making victory appeared to be on the horizon. Instead, the team coughed up separate runs of 13-0 and 16-0 on its way to dropping a gut puncher, 83-77. The Hoosiers haven’t recovered since, losing each of their next three games by 14+ points. Not surprisingly, the team’s performance on both ends of the floor has suffered over those three games, scoring just 63.0 points on 40.5% shooting while conceding 80.3 points on 50.7% shooting. Yeeeeesh. \n\nAnd *this* is how we plan to get over a disgusting, disgusting beat from Wednesday night?\n\nBut before you scroll away, hear me out. Yes, the recent run of form has been putrid. Sure, the thought of dropping any amount of coin on this squad is downright terrifying. Yet upon closer examination, this is a game the Hoosiers should not only win, but win convincingly.\n\nSix of the team’s seven losses have come against teams ranked in the Top 100 in NET ranking—at No. 1 Michigan, No. 8 Nebraska, at No. 11 Michigan State, No. 15 Louisville, No. 21 Iowa and at No. 30 Kentucky—with the other coming on the road at No. 83 Minnesota. Regardless of some of the scores in those contests, nobody could fault Indiana for losing to any of those opponents. \n\nNow, take a look at how the team has performed in nine games against opponents ranked outside of the Top 100 in NET rankings:\n\n\n* Penn State (114): W 113-72 \n* Marquette (142): W 100-77 \n* Maryland (149): W 84-66 \n* Siena (189): W 81-60 \n* Milwaukee (230): W 101-70 \n* Lindenwood (231): W 73-53 \n* Bethune-Cookman (270): W 100-56 \n* Alabama A&M (307): W 98-51 \n* Chicago State (352): W 78-58 \n\n\nNot only are the Hoosiers 9-0 in those games, but they’ve won each game by 18+ points and by an average margin of 28.3 points. Furthermore, the team averaged 92 points on 51.6% shooting while conceding just 62.6 points and holding opponents to a meager 36.7% shooting from the floor. \n\nThat’s alarming news for Indiana’s opponent Friday night: NET No. 154 Rutgers. \n\nThe Scarlet Knights (9-10) enter on a bit of a slump themselves, after dropping two straight and three of their last four. But what stands out is how the team has struggled against teams ranked in the Top 50 in NET ranking:\n\n\n* Michigan (1): L 101-60\n* Purdue (5): L 81-65\n* Illinois (9): L 81-55 \n* Iowa (21): L 68-62 \n* Tennessee (25): L 85-60\n* Ohio State (35): L 80-73 \n* Wisconsin (39): L 96-87 \n* Seton Hall (45): L 81-59\n\n\nNot only is Rutgers winless in eight tries, all but two of those loses came by nine or more points.\n\nThrough 19 games, the Scarlet Knights offense has been anything but efficient. The unit ranks 249th in three-point shooting (32.1%), 251st in offensive efficiency (1.012), 272nd in scoring (70.3 PPG) and 325th in field-goal percentage (40.9%). That could present numerous challenges against the Hoosiers—No. 36 NET ranking—who rank 43rd in opponent field-goal percentage (41.2%), 58th in opponent three-point shooting (30.8%), 59th in defensive efficiency (0.993) and 69th in scoring defense (69.9 PPGA). In those nine aforementioned games against opponents outside of the Top 100 in NET rankings, those numbers fall to just 62.6 points conceded on a porous 36.7% shooting from the field. \n\nThings don’t get much better on the opposite end of the floor.\n\nOn the year, Indiana ranks 44th in offensive efficiency (1.151), 67th in field-goal percentage (47.2%), 69th in scoring (81.1 PPG) and 94th in three-point shooting (35.4%). Those numbers improve to 92.0 points on a blistering 51.6% shooting from the field in those nine contests against opponents outside of the Top 100 in NET ranking. Furthermore, against the nation’s No. 2-ranked defense (Michigan) last time out, the Hoosiers finished with 1.027 points per possession—the fourth-highest mark for a Wolverines opponent this season. Saying Friday could be a long night for an underwhelming Rutgers defense—153rd in scoring defense (74.1 PPGA), 174th in opponent field-goal percentage (44.5%), 216th in defensive efficiency (1.067) and 318th in opponent three-point shooting (36.7%)—would be an understatement. \n\nLook for Indiana to take out its frustration Friday night and win this one by double-digits.\n\nBOL if tailing, and as always, please do so responsibly. One bet should not have you crashing out all over Reddit.",

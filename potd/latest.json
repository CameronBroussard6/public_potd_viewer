Atalanta have kept cleansheet in 5 of their last 6 matches in Serie A. There have been u2,5 goals in 8 of Cremoneses last 10 games. Cremonese haven't scored in 8 of their last 9 matches in Serie A. I expect Atalanta to win 2-0.",

When games get messy and scoring comes harder, I want the team that can still win possessions, stay organized, and keep pressure on you for 48 minutes.\n\nWhy I’m on OKC:\n\t•\tMore ways to score without the star. OKC can still generate looks through pace, ball movement, and multiple handlers. They don’t have to rely on one guy bailing them out every trip.\n\t•\tLA’s offense can get sticky. Without Luka, the Lakers can drift into slower possessions and tougher shot quality. If that happens for even a few 3–4 minute stretches, that’s where OKC can create separation.\n\t•\tDepth matters in this spot. Bench minutes + second/third options decide games like this. I trust OKC’s rotation more to keep the same level of effort and execution.\n\nI’m not expecting a blowout, but -5.5 is basically asking for a solid two-possession win. If OKC wins the “extra possessions” battle (turnovers, rebounds, transition chances), they cover.\n\nProjected: Thunder by ~7–10.",

Without Giannis, he is 8/10 on his line. The minutes are steadily going up aswell since he started with a bit of a minute restriction. Magic got scorched in the last game against the Jazz until the Jazz benched all their starters in the fourth for obvious tanking, lmao. JJJ, Markkanen, and most importantly, Collier all reached 30 pra. Magic tend to play isolation defense and force guards to make plays. Guards are seeing higher usage rates against the Magic because of this. They also don't defend PNRs the best, which is KPJ's main play type. Should see a lot of opportunity come from the PNR with some assists dished out if they collapse onto him. He is mostly driving to the basket off the screens and forcing contact. Plus, he is taking half his shots in the paint or under the basket. Good for us as the Magic have been weak down low all season, and especially in the last week.  On top of that, they are allowing opposing teams to shoot a ton of free throws, where KPJ gets around 20% of his points. Magic in their last ten are ranked 24th in assists allowed and 19th in rebounds allowed. KPJ without Giannis is seeing 18 potential assists + 10 rebound chances a game.\n\n  \nP.S. going to ladder 35 & 40 aswell. GL",

I just love watching Trey Murphy play. Malik Monk and Lavine are out. \n\nThe next game here is the Heat against the Jazz. We’re comparing a playoff team against a team that is tanking their ass out. I also expect the Heat to win after losing to Boston after leading by 20.  \n\nAll Net Adjusted Efficiency comparison are won by both picks by a significant margin.\n\nLet’s all hope for no voodoo shit again like we did last night.\n\nApologies on that game and hoping we can bounce back on this one.\n\nBest of luck!",

Bet 2.25u\n\nWriteup: In both matchups, we are betting on the better of the two teams who both have similar play styles to their opponent. \n\nSt. John’s goes up against Xavier, and the only thing I like for Xavier in this one is 3 point shooting. Everything else goes in the favor of St. John’s. St. John’s has a top 15 defensive efficiency rating, whereas Xavier is around 100th on offense. Similarly, the St. John’s offense should find success with their 30th ranked offense against Xavier‘s 100 ranked defense. Both teams have a fast paced pace of play, so we’ll take the St. John’s team who is better in nearly every category.\n\nUTRGV should have a closer match on their hands against Nichols, but they are also the better team in this game. Their offense should have a slight advantage against the Nichols defense, but the big advantage here will be the UTRGV defense. They come into this with a top 100 defense, whereas Nichols has an offense ranked around 250. On top of this, UTRGV currently has the 3rd best momentum rating in the league, meaning the difference between their average play and their play now is better than almost everyone in the country. They also play some of their best ball away with a top 20 rating in that department, whereas Nichols ranks 275th when playing at home. The books are pretty much calling this game a toss up, so we’ll give UTRGV a slight cushion for a good price.\n\nRemember to only bet what you can afford to lose, and BOL!",

The USA looked like the best team throughout the round robin, while Italy are lucky to have made it through to the playoffs based on their performances. USA has the advantage at both positions but Dropkin in particular will be the difference-maker. He has been the best curler on the ice all week. My metrics had USA as the top team in the world coming into the event and they've looked the part so far; Italy is being hugely overrated by the books simply because they won this morning's meaningless round robin game. Italy focused on their 4-person teams this year and it has shown at the Olympics. USA were 4-1 against intermediate level teams like Italy this season coming into this event and 29-4 overall. USA also won the only time these two teams have played each other before today, which was at a world championship.",

One of them is bound to be the winner of the league and the question is which one. Sporting has to do everything here vs Porto, and Porto needs at least a draw to keep Sporting away. They sit currently on 55 points for Porto, and 51 points for Sporting. Benfica is sitting 3rd with 46 points, therefore watching the final here. I can’t say who will win or lose this one, but I do expect an entertaining game with lots of chances and goals from two of the best teams in this league. I also don’t expect these teams to sit back and play slowly, instead watching forward for an all out attacking game. I also learned to not pay too much attention to head to head statistics etc. Another thing to mention is that Sporting has scored the most goals and conceded the second fewest 54-11, and Porto had the best defense so far with 41-6. Meaning conceded the fewest and scored one of the most in this league. But this is a FINAL we are witnessing here. \n\n\n\nOn the side note: My tactics won’t change by lowering the odds. The goal is to find high odds to play here. I’m trying to keep track of the results in all of the top leagues. We will **always aim for** **long term** gains here and make sure to manage your bankroll. I will try to post another pick in the coming days.

First, the Pelicans are the worst rebounding team in the league. Second, Sabonis physically overpowers both Queen and Missi on the Pelicans. Missi has the vertical athleticism and speed over Sabonis, but Sabonis' strength on the floor is just too much too handle. In 4 games against the Pelicans last season, Sabonis grabbed 28, 15, 16, and 20 rebounds. In these games, Missi was the Pelicans' starting center.  \nSomething to note is that he is currently listed as questionable at the time of this writeup (which could maybe explain why this line is so low). The report says he has lower back inflammation. Not sure how big this is, but if Sabonis chooses to play, I believe this will have no effect. Sabonis has zero pressure to play in games if he isn't 100%. The Kings are bad with or without him, so they probably wouldn't pressure hurting starters to play. Zach Lavine is sitting out because he has a sore finger. Maybe this is worse than it sounds, but I feel like players have played with worse injuries and still played.",

Shai is still out and so is Ajay, but Jdub is not on the injury report and is potentially playing his first game after missing 10 games.\n\nThey’re missing their primary ball handlers and Jdub could be limited. First game without Shai this season for Ihart was against the Rockets last game where he had 19 RA, and the game prior he dropped a 20 RA tripple double performance against the Magic where Ajay and Jdub was sidelined. \n\nHes taken the roll beautifully of running the offense these past two games and has cleared this line significantly, had 11 assists on 13 potentials last game not counting the handoffs as potentials where he gets a lot of his dimes from.\n\nLakers have been a good rebounding team and maybe aren’t the best matchup for rebounds, but we’ve still seen bigs with good rebounding numbers lately against them\n\nKAT 13, Allen 9, Vucevic 11, Zubac 19 etc..\n\nSince joining the OKC, Ihart has had 8, 15, 6 & 18 rebounds against the Lakers.. facing Ayton who isn’t a stretch big should make him stay close to the rim for rebounds, not to mention his activity on the offensive glass.\n\nHas cleared this 11.5 RA line in 2/4 against them but again, that’s with Shai playing where the assist upside hasn’t been there. Without Shai and Ajay, Ihart will as I mentioned run the offense in large parts of the game and we’ve seen the assist numbers as of late that backs it up. Love the assist upside, and we’ve seen him clear this in rebounds alone in numerous games this season\n\nMinutes have been ramping up after his return so upside there aswell, overall a spot I like for Hartenstein here.",

Their road form is marked by defensive instability, especially against teams that press high and attack through wide areas—an approach Racing use effectively. Mirandés concede regularly on their travels and rarely keep games tight for a full 90 minutes, which increases the likelihood of Racing finding multiple scoring opportunities. Even when Mirandés remain competitive, they often allow high-quality chances that eventually translate into goals.\n\nFrom a goals perspective, this matchup strongly supports over 1.5 total goals. Racing matches routinely clear this line due to their scoring consistency and willingness to commit numbers forward, while Mirandés games also trend higher because of their defensive concessions. Historical meetings between the two sides further reinforce this pattern, with most encounters producing at least two goals.\n\nTaken together, Racing’s superior home form, stronger attacking output, and Mirandés’ away defensive weaknesses point toward a Racing Santander victory in a match that realistically surpasses 1.5 total goals.",

      "text": "Record: 5–3\n\nLast 10: 5–3\n\nLast Pick: Furman -12.5 vs UNCG\n\nResult: LOSS ❌ (Furman lost by 3)\n\nFurman didn’t cover the –12.5 largely because the game never developed the type of possession separation a double-digit favorite needs. While Furman actually shot slightly better overall (43% vs 42%) and dominated points in the paint (32–18), that advantage was neutralized by UNCG’s three-point efficiency gap — UNCG hit 10 threes at 53%, while Furman went just 5-for-19 (26%) from deep. That alone erased Furman’s interior edge and kept scoring compressed.\n\nAdd in nearly identical foul counts, similar free-throw volume, and limited fast-break scoring, and there was no late-game scoring accelerator to stretch the margin. Furman controlled the game for most of the night (led 79% of the time), but without perimeter shot-making or turnover-driven runs to create distance, control never translated into separation — resulting in a straight-up loss that never seriously threatened the spread.\n\n⸻\n\nToday’s Pick\n\nCollege Basketball | NCAA Men’s\nYale @ Howard\nTime: 7:00 PM\n\nPick: Under 147.5 \n\nOdds: -115 (DraftKings)\n\nWrite-Up:\n\nYale–Howard sets up as a matchup where game flow and structure matter more than raw scoring potential. Yale consistently plays with strong pace discipline, prioritizing half-court execution, shot quality, and clock management. That approach naturally limits possessions and reduces scoring swings, especially against teams that are more comfortable playing in rhythm than pushing tempo. When Yale controls the pace, games tend to settle into longer offensive possessions and fewer transition opportunities.\n\nFrom a broader profile standpoint, this matchup leans toward stable scoring outcomes rather than high volatility. Yale games often stay close to their expected scoring range, with fewer explosive runs that dramatically inflate totals. Howard’s offense is capable but tends to be more shot-dependent, which can lead to uneven scoring stretches when defenses force them into longer half-court sequences. Without consistent pace acceleration or extended transition play, scoring remains more measured across both sides.\n\nLate-game tendencies also support a controlled environment. Yale is comfortable closing games without speeding things up, and Howard is less likely to introduce chaos unless the game completely deviates from script. With disciplined tempo, limited transition volume, and a game state that favors execution over urgency, this matchup projects as one where the overall scoring environment stays contained relative to faster or more volatile pairings.\n\n⸻\n\nIf you find value in my analysis, contributions are appreciated:\n[https://cash.app/$KindlyQuantifying](https://cash.app/$KindlyQuantifying)",

Sporting’s Rui Borges, on the other hand, has publicly stated that his team only thinks about winning even if the game isn’t “decisivo” for the title, underlining his motivation to attack with purpose and not simply manage the match, which fits his tactical profile of possession control, dynamic wing play and pressure after loss seen in training reports this week. Porto’s defensive lines are weakened by suspensions and absentees, forcing Farioli into a less familiar back setup that could be exploited on transitions, while Sporting, although also missing squad members through injury, has repeatedly trained with a compact midfield and quick vertical passes to exploit half-spaces — a risky but attacking-leaning tactical setup. With both coaches stressing attacking intent and competitive spirit in their Portuguese press build-ups, and tactical plans that favor forward momentum rather than containment, BTTS Yes becomes a highly plausible outcome.\n\n",

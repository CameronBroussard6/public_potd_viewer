Playing two units\n\nThis line is 15.5 for Fanatics and FanDuel for +105 so -120 for 13.5 is a steal. He has hit this in 6 out of 7. Averaging 17.2 for the season. The four guards likely to guard him (Ball, Green, Sexton, and Knueppel) all grade out as average or below average defenders on StatMuse. I expect the Spurs to get out to an early lead (like the line for them too), and if they do, I expect more minutes for Harper. He could score over 14 points, but he is averaging 6.5 rebounds/assists for the season. Sometimes it’ll be 5-1 or 2-4 so I don’t like his individual props. I think this line is low based on his match up and season average, and I expect a few extra minutes against the Hornets.",

Starting off with Leeds, they may not have a great record but boy do they score some goals. Leeds have scored in 9 of their last 10 games and have only gone scoreless at home once this season (which was GW3 against a strong Newcastle team). At home this season in the Prem Leeds average 1.72 goals scored per match and 1.18 goals conceded. Across the entire competition this season Leeds average 1.35 goals per match and concede 1.65. Although in their previous matchup this season Arsenal won 5-0, this was before Leeds found consistent goal scoring form and it was at the Emirates. \n\nFeel like I don't really need to touch on Arsenal. They're the best team in the league (although it pains me to say) and they score practically every game. Although they are the best defensive side in the league, they conceded 2 at home to an awful UCL team last match, conceded 3 to United at home, and overall have conceded in 5 of their last 6 games.\n\nI dont see Leeds winning this game or scoring more than 1 goal, but I'll be shocked if they don't bag at home considering their recent form along with Arsenal's poor form as of late. \n\n**BOL!**",

I really think this team can make a run to end the season as a top 6 seed.

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 11-36-5 *I have, in fact, not lifted the Barcelona curse. Off to a dream start with an early goal for Copenhagen that held strong and even won the first half 1-0. The bet looked very safe, but then Flick did his team talk magic and Barca ended up scoring 4 in the second half. It seemed like there was some life in Copenhagen as they did score a late goal, but in prime sigmabale fashion, it was disallowed by VAR. We move though and I'm sure we're going to have a great weekend ahead*\n\n**Last Five:** ❌✅❌❌❌\n\n**Event:** LaLiga, Elche v FC Barcelona, 3:00 pm EST\n\n**POTD:** Elche +1.5 Asian Handicap, +103, 3 units\n\n**Write Up:** Elche have been the surprise package of this LaLiga season, sitting in 12th place after coming up from the second division just a season ago. They do play above all expectations, but their team genuinely looks very solid with the likes of Inaki Pena, Chust, Rafa Mir and many others. *Their form might've taken a bit of a nosedive at the beginning of the year,* but they're still capable of frustrating the visitors. Emphasis on visitors, because here's a fun stat for you: **Elche have a record of five wins, five draws and just one loss in 11 home matches.** Yes, they're extremely resilient at home and are no doubt going to make life tough for the Catalans. They're also going to treat this as a bounce back and a revenge game because as I said, their recent form has been patchy, and Barcelona did win the last time they met.\n\nBarcelona, with their usual defensive instabilities, which were on full display once again against Copenhagen, are going to struggle for sure. **They're also going to be tired after the midweek Champions League match,** in which they had to give it their all to secure the top 8 spot in what proved to be a surprisingly demanding game against Copenhagen.\n\nThe stats point in Elche's favor and even if they lose by a goal, the bet still wins because of the +1.5 handicap. All in all, Barcelona are definitely vulnerable, so I'm dropping 3 units on this. BOL and may this be the day Barcelona are finally stopped ☘️🫡\n\n☘️ If I've made you some money through fades, please consider dropping a tip: [https://buymeacoffee.com/sigmabale](https://buymeacoffee.com/sigmabale)",

I'm going for o6 Goals. Columbus has been on a scoring tear since they fired their coach, and the Blues have good energy.

I mean they have back to back wins now in the league, having beaten Tottenham and Sunderland in the last two rounds. At least the atmosphere around the club has livened up a bit and it’s no longer all doom and gloom. \n\nChelsea has started well under Liam Rosenior, but I do still have some caveats about the results/performances until now. Sure, winning 3-2 in Italy over Napoli is nice… But Conte has a horrible record with his teams in the Champions League, just god awful, which can easily be proven by the fact that Napoli couldn’t even make the top 24. A 3-1 away over any team in the Premier League is great, but Palace is in a terrible place at the moment. 1-0 over Pafos was a bit disappointing. They beat Brentford 2-0, but the guests were just as good if not better. Then they were a bit lucky not to concede more in their 3-2 defeat at home in the first leg of the League Cup against Arsenal.\n\nRegardless if you agree or disagree with my assessment of Chelsea’s performances in these games, we can all agree that the situation with their defense isn’t great and Robert Sanchez in goal isn’t exactly mister reliable. \n\nThe sale of Lucas Paqueta doesn’t change much for this game, as he hasn’t really been good for West Ham for a while now. Castellanos has only scored against QPR in the league so far, but he is at least getting shots off which is what we want for this bet. Also, Summerville has really popped off for the Hammers recently with a goal in his last three games and just generally great play.",

I don’t see Volk being able to finish Lopes here, I think if he wins it's gonna be via the scorecard. Give me Lopes win inside the distance decision no action (this means the bet is voided if it goes to a decision).\n\n\n\nSaint-Denis is known for his relentless forward pressure and strong grappling, averaging over four takedowns per 15 minutes. This relentless style is a bad matchup for Hooker, who has previously been finished by submission multiple times and struggles when forced to fight on his back foot. Going with BSD ML, I think he wins via finish.",

This time we're taking on some extra juice by adding 2+ total shots to the mix, because I like the value that bring going from 1 SOT at -135. Feel free to stick to just the SOT if you prefer. \n\nI like this play primarily because West Ham concede the 2nd most SOTs and shots in the EPL. Chelsea is at home and I expect they will have most of the ball. Palmer has been dealing with another injury, and while coach says he is fit to play, there's a decent chance he's rested with Arsenal next on the schedule, which puts Enzo back starting in the #10 role again and playing further forward.\n\nWhile Enzo has slowed down a bit with his SOTs, he is coming off a 2 shot, 1 SOT and a goal game at Palace, and a midweek champion's League goal on 3 shots at Napoli. He has played a lot of minutes lately, but so has the rest of the squad it is that time of year. \n\nBOL and happy weekend!",

Dybantsa versus Darryn Peterson game, expect home court to be the difference. \n\nUnder head coach Bill Self, Kansas is an impressive 336-21 at Allen Fieldhouse since 2003. While the Jayhawks (15-5) already rank among the nation’s best defensively all-around, their numbers get even better at home, where the team concedes just 61.1 points per game on a porous 35.4% shooting. In fact, Kansas has beaten five of its last six opponents at home by 18 or more points, including a 84-63 thrashing of then-No. 2 Iowa State on Jan. 13. \n\nOn the other end of the floor, this is a BYU defense that seems to be unravelling.\n\nWhile the unit enters ranked 23rd in defensive efficiency (0.955), things have slipped in recent weeks. Over their last five games, the Cougars (17-3) have conceded an average of 80.3 points on 46.2% shooting (37.8% from beyond the arc). That includes losses to the potent offenses of No. 1 Arizona and No. 15 Texas Tech over the last three games. \n\nBut what will be the X factor is guard play. \n\nIn those two losses, BYU was exposed by dynamic guards. Against the Wildcats, Brayden Burries constantly got whatever he wanted on his way to picking up 29 points and four assists. For the Red Raiders, sophomore Christian Anderson took advantage as well, pouring in 22 points and seven assists. Expect senior Melvin Council Jr. (13.7 PPG, 5.2 APG) to have a big game on Saturday for the Jayhawks. \n\nTrust Kansas to take care of business at home.\n\nBOL if tailing, and as always, please do so responsibly.

I think lot of people are still underestimating Auroras new lineup and the way they play and they think Spirit is able to “ Stomp” them in a short duration game. Nightfall their carry has been playing outstanding this tournament and they have been beaten the two favourites to reach upper bracket final. Spirit on the other hand are still the favourites to win this tournament with Yatoro finding his form again on Sven and Windranger. \n\n• Head-to-Head History: In their last three Bo3 encounters, over 70% of Map 1s have gone over the 38-minute threshold. Both teams currently favor high-durability cores (like Abaddon for Nightfall) that naturally extend team fights and objective sieges.\n\n• Tournament Stakes: As this is the Upper Bracket Final, both teams are expected to play conservatively in Map 1. Neither side wants to concede an early series lead to a \"cheese\" strategy, leading to a more methodical, late-game oriented draft. I choose spirit because I still do think they are the better team, more experienced and there is good value.\n\nPrediction:\n\nI think it will hit over 35.5 map duration regardless of which team wins, however I am edging more towards Spirit taking the map but Aurora won’t back down easily, longer slower game but Spirit will eventually come out at the end.\n\nFor safer bet—> Over 36.5min 1.75 odds",

Both teams like to play attacking football and recent meetings have produced open, fast-paced games. Defensive lapses, high pressing, and derby pressure can lead to chances at both ends. With attacking quality on display and emotions running high, Over 3.5 goals is a bold but appealing option.",

DARYTE - WIN - $1.70 (Betting 3.5 units)                           \n**Write Up:** Picking back up a little with 3 wins on the trot now, and for today’s pick we’re heading west to Ascot for DARYTE. Now this horse trialled well into its debut last  start however the performance it put up there far exceeded what I expected. Sat leaders back and had to wait for a gap, only to rocket through it and put 3 lengths on the second horse in about 50 meters. The acceleration off a sit sprint was insane and the mark of a good, young horse.      \n      \nWe draw barrier 1 today and I expect the exact same scenario to play out again here; we sit leaders back and wait for the gap before exploding past. The same leader/2nd place getter is the 2nd favourite in the race, alongside the 3rd place getter, and I can’t see at all how they get any closer to us, especially factoring in the extra 100m.     \n      \nGot the goat WA jockey in W Pike aboard again, and all he needs to do is get us some space in the straight and we’ll go whooshka.     \n      \nNow we could be in some trouble if we begin badly and get buried on the rail, but in all trials and the one race-day performance, we’ve jumped well enough to hold a spot, so I’m not that concerned.     \n      \nGL!    \n    \n[https://ko-fi.com/bstilled_](https://ko-fi.com/bstilled_)",

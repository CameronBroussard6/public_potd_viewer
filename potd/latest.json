Tonight is a fade against an already bad Kings defense that's on the 2nd night of a back to back and they're on the road. The game line is pretty steep, but I'm liking Dillon Brooks to go over his 19.5 points. He's gone over that in 9/11 home games this year, and the 2 he missed he was way under his average minutes, so it wasn't like he was being stymied. He's also gone over this total in 5 of his last 7, with the 2 misses on the road at New Orleans. I think the Kings will struggle on the road with no rest, and Dillon Brooks will continue his great season with 20+points. ",

Got to take that big whiff on the chin and move on to the next.\n\nToday going with Jacksonville State to beat a Delaware team that is coming off scoring only 43 points at home against Missouri State. Jacksonville State's offensive rebounding percentage is nearly 13% higher than Delaware and holds teams to roughly 37% field goal percentage.\n\nDelaware is a team that lives and dies behind the three point line, but I don't see many shots falling against this Jacksonville State defense, and I do believe that Jacksonville State's ability to get an offensive rebound on roughly every third shot (33.1% Offensive Rebound) will be key in second chance opportunities to put away this Delaware team and get us in the win column for 2026.\n\n  \nEDIT: Also to note, while not major, the line opened up yesterday at -1.5 for JKST and is now currently at sitting at -2.5. I wouldn't be surprised to see this line increase to -3.5 prior to tip off.",

The *Gray’s Sports Almanac* had Wake Forest taking down Mississippi State in the Duke’s Mayo Bowl, and the future delivered. I just got back from Charlotte, North Carolina, where I saw the Demon Deacons pull off the win even without star running back Demond Claiborne. Wake’s defense — top 15 in yards allowed — set the tone, led by safety Nick Anderson, a First-Team All-ACC standout. Head coach Jake Dickert earned his first bowl win, guiding the Deacs to their fourth 9-win season, right in their backyard. The future was written — Wake Forest takes home the Duke’s Mayo Bowl.",

      "text": "POTD record: 2-2 \n\nLast POTD: Ravenna ML (+110) ❌\n\nEvent: La liga Rayo Vallecano vs Getafe (4:00PM AST)\n\nPOTD: Rayo Vallecano o5.5 SOT (+163)\n\nWriteup: I started out so well then crashed with 2 L's. I took a break and now I'm back and I really like this one. Rayo vallecano has been a very hard team to beat, being undefeated this season at home to both Barca and Madrid. On top of that, they're VERY dominant in shooting against teams out of the top 3 at home. Six SOT vs Barca (including barca here although a top 3), 7 SOT vs real betis, 7 SOT against valencia, 5 SOT against deportivo alavez and celta vigo, 6 SOT vs sevilla. Then away from home,  8 SOT vs elche, 6 vs osasuna. It's clear to see that against teams with moderate to good defense, rayo gets sot around the 5-6 line and that's why there's such a huge bump from o4.5 which is -120 to o5.5 which is +163 (on bet365). Looking at getafe as a team, they've been in TERRIBLE form, losing their last 4 games which includes a CDR game. They took 5 sot against villareal, 4 from espanyol, 4 from burgos (second division and EIGHT from real betis. Looking at their last h2h match which was as you guessed, vallecano AT HOME, rayo came out with 8 SOT, although getafe had a red card in the 80th minute, 7 of the SOT came before then. \n\nLooking at their past 5-10 games, it shows that getafe has conceded around 4 SOT on average, but I think rayo's home dominance can get them over this. I project around 8 SOT for rayo, if you wanna push it you can.",

Giannis has cleared this line in 10 of 15 games in which he's played 25 minutes this season, including 43 PA against the Hornets on Nov. 14. Full disclosure: Giannis played exactly 25 minutes at Charlotte on Dec. 29 and netted 31 PA, including 7 assists on 14 opportunities. So what makes tonight different? Charlotte is already without centers Ryan Kalkbrenner and Mason Plumlee. Team-leading rebounder Moussa Diabete is questionable with a sprained wrist. That would leave 6-foot-8 PJ Hall as the primary interior player. And if you're wondering who that is, so are Charlotte fans, He joined the team on a two-way deal on Dec. 24 and has played three games. \n\nThis is the first of back-to-back games for the Hornets, who have played Milwaukee close this season. Although Milwaukee is 2-1 against Charlotte, including an overtime win, the Hornets have led at the half in two games. If Charlotte keeps it close again, expect Giannis to get his minutes. And again, who is going to stop him? Former Clemson standout PJ Hall? I do worry about blowout potential. But the most likely path to that is Giannis getting anything he wants inside. As an aside, Miles Bridges (Charlotte's best help defender against Giannis) is a probable GTD. If he sits, I expect Giannis to score at will - forget the assists.\n\nGiannis has played three games since his calf injury, logging 24, 25, and 28 minutes - showing that he's trending upward for usage. He cleared 34.5 PA in one of those games, a New Year's Eve loss against Washington. He also cleared 34.5 PA in 6 of the 10 games before his injury. However, he logged just 13, 19, and 2 minutes in three of the four misses. Clearly, this is not a value play. Giannis is averaging 34.7 PA this season, but I look for an above-average Giannis game tonight. He's at home. He's shaking off a loss to the hapless Wizards. He's playing a Charlotte team with ZERO interior presence.\n\nGood luck and godspeed!",

They also miss their main centre back and captain Ibanez due to a red card besides Mahrez, Kessie and Mendy who are participating at AFCON\n\nWith a home record of 3-3-0 they are defeatless at home which is risky but Al Nassr have a 4-1-0 record away from home\n\nAl Nassr will want to avenge their first loss of points by winning this game and boost their confidence for the upcoming matches against Al Qadsiah at home and Al Hilal away. With almost a week of rest after this game they will give it their all\n\nI have a feeling Al Nassr will exploit Al Ahli their weakened squad with the abundance of quality in CR7, Felix, Coman, Brozovic and Martinez\n\nBOL everyone!",

Six of Cincy’s 7 wins were against teams with losing records. Cincy have lost 4 straight and are playing this game without their starting QB Brendan Sorsby and a lot of their secondary due to transfer portal. Navy are a heavy run team offensively and Cincinnati run defense hasn’t performed well against heavy run teams. Utah rushed for 267 and BYU ran for 265 against them. Navy run game will cause all sorts of problems for Cincy. Navy hasn’t lost a bowl game since 2016 and I don’t expect them to here. Line movement has moved in favor of Navy as well. With that being said, let’s expect Navy to cover 7 points\n\n👇\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0maenb6sfyag1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6242999d74a939ead6017057b12661c09a5d1d6a",

The main thing stopping me from choosing Al-Nassr’s ML is the fact that *Al-Ahli are off to a fantastic start themselves. This is where the roadblock both ways comes into play.*\n\n*Al-Ahli have only conceded 8 goals in 11 matches so far this season* - so they are stout despite missing a handful of players to injuries and AFCON. In fact, the top 4 teams in Saudi Arabia have only 2 defeats between them, so there’s parity there.\n\nWhich is why we are gonna pounce on the other form: **Ronaldo has scored in all but one game in the Saudi Pro League this season, he has 13 goals in 13 matches this season, and has scored in 5 of his last 6 in all competitions.**\n\nYes, he *played 2 full matches in 3 days prior to the new year*, but with 6 days off til their next match & a top of the table clash against Al-Hilal on the horizon, this is an important spot for the club and Ronaldo has risen to the occasion this year, in what could be his final season in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThis week the media have been talking about his statement about **not retiring until he gets 1000 goals**, and this seems as good a platform as ever to continue to get rolling to that milestone. ***Stick to the guy putting the ball in the net.***\n\nLast play review:\n\nNHL - Winnipeg @ Toronto\n\nToronto ML (-150) 1.5u ✅\n\n(All I can say is the gambling gods were shining down on us again last night… down 4-1, the Leafs came back to tie it, only to give up a goal right after - only to score 2 to win it 6-5. If I’m the Jets at this point I’m trying to find every voodoo and rabbit foot in town because they snatched defeat from the jaws of victory - all that aside, we were quite possibly treated to the game of the season to start the new year)\n\nBOL if you’re tailing, and if not BOL in general.",

Offensively the cats are declawed without their big guns (Barkov and Tkchuck(probaly not how you spell his name)) making the under 7.5 feel even safer. Reinhart has been hot with 7 goals in his last 10, but hes gonna see the rags top checking unit all night.\n\nThe rangerss have the 31st ranked offense in the league, potting a measly 2.55 goals per game, which is the best friend for under 7.5 ticket. Panarin is doing heavy lifting with 41 points, but if the cats lock him down, the secondary scoring is virtually non existent. they simply dont have the firepower to blow this game open, especially on slow ice. Combining these metrics, the game script screams a low scoring, tight checking affair where the rags hang around until the final buzzer. seeing as outdoor games historically trend under due to sightline issues for shooters and bad ice, grabbing a line as high as 7.5 provides a massive cushion for a game that likely ends in the 4 to 6 total goal range. we are taking the insurance. we don't need the rangers to win.we just need them to not lose by two goals. with floridas offense banged up and the soft ice slowing the game down, this is going to be a grinder.\n\nBet responsibly and good luck to yall today! 🍀🍻",

With Wembanyama and Vassell both out, Castle’s role grows in a big way. When those two aren’t on the floor, the offense runs through him, and the numbers back it up. In those minutes, he’s putting up about 23 points per 36 with a huge 35% usage rate, which tells you he’s getting the ball and the green light.\n\nWhenever his usage jumps to 25% or more this season, he’s gone over 19.5 in 7 of 10 games, averaging around 22 points. Simply put, when Castle is asked to do more, he usually delivers.\n\nThe matchup helps too. Indiana isn’t great at protecting the paint, giving up the sixth-most points there, and that’s where Castle scores most of his points (68%). They also allow a lot of free throws and struggle defending pick-and-rolls, which play right into Castle’s main scoring actions.\n\nWith extra responsibility, a proven track record in high-usage games, and a defense that gives up exactly what he likes to take, this sets up well for Castle to clear 19.5.",

Think Gian is a favourite for reason but not as big as the odds are implying that's why I decided to stay away from ML cause this should be an instant Ally Pally Classic. 11 180's against MVG (5 sets played), 14 against Wattimena (7 sets played), 9 against Scutt (4 sets played) he can hit them for sure, not so lucky against Hood, but I think he felt as if he didn't need to hit a lot of 180's, Hood just didn't pose any trouble, Gary did hit a lot of 140's though. MVG, Wattimena were dangerous opponents and it looks like that's when Anderson goes into high gear, he knows his scoring power is needed to play against these world class players. If this was a second round match for example, I'd say Gian beats him to zero, cause Scotsman was having an average season, said plenty of times motivation is not as big as before, doesn't have any thoughts of playing Premier League, but looking at it now he did turn it around somehow and is having a wonderful championship. I think this goes to the distance, Anderson managed to push Littler all the way at Grand Slam, can do the same today. Van Veen trashed Humphries yesterday but early stages at the game it looked like Humphries had him, just missed couple of key doubles and randomly gave up, started throwing faster, looked beaten already at 3-1, if those early doubles went it for Luke, I believe we have a much closer game. Hopefully Gary capitalizes on his chances and we have a close game, BOL!",

FT: Watford 3-0 Birmingham City\n\nEvent: Ligue 1 (Soccer) - Toulouse vs Lens (19:45 GMT)\n\n**Today's Pick:** Draw or Lens @ 1.5 (1 unit)\n\n**Write Up:** Hoping to continue our great start to the New Year I'm going to the French top division for a major clash between **7th place Toulouse** and **1st place Lens**. Lens have surprised everyone this campaign as they sit top of Ligue 1 after 16 games played having picked up **13 more points than they had this time last season**. With PSG breathing down their neck week after week the title contenders have so far held strong and today is another opportunity to uphold their 1 point lead to the 4 time consecutive league champions.\n\nOur home team today is **7th place Toulouse** who have been pretty average throughout the current league 1 campaign but ended 2025 on a good run, going **4 unbeaten in all comps**. They have **won their last 2 games** in the league which were against **Paris FC (14th)** and **Strasbourg (8th)** and have recorded only **1 loss across their last 6 matches** which came against **10th place Angers**. This has resulted in **9 points from an available 18**. During this time they have also **scored 7 goals** whilst **conceding 4**. This season Toulouse are scoring **1.5 goals per game** which rises to **1.75 when they are playing at home** like they are today. Alongside this they have **conceded a pretty good 1.19 goals** per game but this also **rises to 1.38** when they play on home turf, something the visitors will look to exploit. The team from South Western France are just the **12th best home team** in the league in the current campaign, having **won only 3 of their 8** **games** played at home, **scoring 14 and conceding 11**. Toulouse will be a tough opponent today as the chance at a European spot for next season has suddenly opened up for them as they sit just **4 points behind the European spots** in the table.\n\nAs for the visitors they are enjoying an incredible season atop Ligue 1 as they hope to topple French giants PSG which no team has managed to do **for the last 4 years**. Lens are currently on a **7 match unbeaten run** across all competitions, **winning all 6 of their last 6 games** in the league. During these games they have **scored 14 goals whilst conceding just 3** and their defensive displays are exactly why they are in the position they are in this season. Lens hold **the best defensive record in the league** conceding an average of just **0.81 goals per game** this season however this does rise to **1.13** when they play away from home. As for their goal scoring they are finding the net **1.75 times per game** this campaign which drops slightly to **1.5** when they play away from home turf. The current league leaders are the **2nd best away team** in the league as they have **won 5 of their 8 games** played away from home whilst **losing 2, to 2nd place PSG** (not a disaster) and **17th place Metz** (more of a disaster). Overall Lens are performing so much better than expected this season and they **haven't lost a game since the end of October**.\n\nPersonally I am putting 1 unit on Lens or draw today as I don't see them losing this game with so much on the line but I wouldn't be shocked if Toulouse mounted a decent challenge based on their recent form which could potentially end in a draw. I am also having half a unit on Lens to win the match altogether @ 2.55 but this is slightly riskier so be careful with that one.\n\nAs I said it won't be an easy game for the league leaders but I'm backing their defense to hold up as it has so often this season to see out something like a 2-1 win for the visitors.\n\nBOL with all your bets today and let me know thoughts and suggestions in the comments + if you are tailing!",

Rangers offense has been a bit lack luster, averaging 2.55 goals per game and in their last 10 still around the 2.5 point mark. Their defense has been a bit better allowing 2.76 per game, however in their last 10 they have given up 3.2 goals per game, with their most recent match giving up 6 goals to the capitols.

They are top of the table in red hot form and generating elite attacking output with 17.6 shots per game and an xG above 2.0. That level of chance creation travels well and explains why their away scoring remains consistent even against compact home setups.\n\nToulouse on the other hand are a split personality team. They have shown flashes away from home but their home attacking numbers are a real concern with just 0.5 goals per game and limited shot volume. That is a serious issue when facing a Lens side that defends efficiently concedes under a goal per match and is comfortable controlling games without needing to overextend.\n\nThe model makes Lens clear favourites to win outright but the draw still carries some weight given Toulouse’s tendency to stay competitive. This is exactly where draw no bet makes sense as it backs the better team while removing the main downside risk. If Lens play to their metrics which they have done consistently over the last ten matches they win this game more often than not. If Toulouse manage to grind out a draw the stake is protected.\n\nIn short Lens have the sharper attack stronger underlying data and superior recent form. Lens draw no bet keeps the value while reducing variance and avoids overexposure to a low upside Toulouse home win.\n\nBest of luck.",

Perth Glory return to league action after mixed results and they’ve shown they can be dangerous going forward, but still struggle to stay solid when under pressure for long periods.\n\nVictory’s recent form shows a team that knows how to win without taking unnecessary risks. Wins at home against Adelaide United and away at Melbourne City came from staying compact and patient on the ball. Even their draws with Macarthur and Auckland FC showed how hard they are to break down. While losses to Sydney FC and Brisbane Roar came during a tougher spell, recent matches show better balance between defence and attack. At home, Victory usually keep games tight and controlled.\n\nPerth Glory have picked up some strong wins against Melbourne City, Macarthur, and Newcastle Jets, but those results have been mixed with losses that highlight ongoing issues. Defeats to Adelaide United and Sydney FC showed how little room for error they have, especially when they fall behind. Away from home, Glory often struggle to stay organised defensively. Heavy losses at Melbourne City earlier in the season and problems sustaining pressure suggest they may spend long stretches without the ball in this match.\n\nPerth Glory look like a classic glass-cannon side, dangerous going forward but vulnerable defensively. They also rely heavily on Taggart for goals, and with his fitness in doubt, that could be a concern. Even if he plays, Melbourne Victory should have the edge, especially at home.\n\nStats wise, it points towards a Melbourne win for me here. Melbourne are on a three-game winning streak, including a 5-1 win over Wellington Phoenix, and have won five straight against Perth. They also took a 2-0 win at HBF Park last time out. \n\n**NOTE: Please only stake what you can afford to lose; know that no picks are 100% guaranteed to hit. Stake Responsibly.

Despite a blowout defeat to Notre Dame (49-10), the Midshipmen closed strong with wins over USF, Memphis (on the road), and rival Army (17-16).\n\nSome bulletpoints as always:\n\n* Navy boasts the nation's #1 top rushing attack averaging 289.3 yards per game\n* Service academies have won seven straight bowl games since 2021.\n* Service academies do not have many opt-outs because they consider it the same as going AWOL. Big no-no.\n* Cincinnati ended the season on a four-game losing streak (7-5 overall) and has been hit hard by opt-outs and the transfer portal.\n* Cincinnati will be missing starting QB Brendan Sorsby, who accounted for over 2,800 passing yards, 580 rushing yards, and 36 total tds.\n* The QB position replacement is completely inexpererienced.  Options include either backup Brady Lichtenberg and redshirt freshman Samaj Jones.\n* Multiple defensive starters are also opting out for Cincy, leaving a depleted roster.\n* Navy's elite ground game faces a vulnerable Cincinnati run defense, while the Cincy Bearcats' quarterback uncertainty limits their ability to keep pace.\n* Navy's QB Horvath's dual-threat ability should control the clock and exploit gaps, with Navy likely attempting fewer than 15 passes unless trailing.\n\nNavy's full-strength roster, dominant rushing attack, and Cincinnati's significant absences (especially at QB) give Navy a clear edge. I expect Navy to grind out long drives and cover the spread in a relatively one-sided dominant rushing affair.  Laying the 7 points with Navy.\n\n**UPDATE:**  Still sick, but found some more data to add that makes me like this even more.\n\n\\- Even at full strength, Cincy was allowing 36pts per game and 470 opposing yards per game.  \n\\- In the last 4 games of the season Cincy allowed 235+ rushing yards per game  \n\\- In the last 4 games of the season Navy rushed for 270+ yards per game  \n\\- Navy is trying to get their 11th win in a season for just the 2nd time in their history.    \n\\- Navy's top 3 running backs are all seniors and this could well be their last game ever.  They are plenty motivated.  \n\\- Navy did have an easier schedule than Cincy this year but they also had a couple of monster milestone games.    \n\\- Earlier this year they faced a team expected to make the playoffs, South Florida.  Navy entered the match as double digit underdogs and won outright.   \n\\- In the final conference game of the season Navy were underdogs traveling to Memphis at this same venue, the Liberty Bowl, and beat Memphis outright 28-17.  Navy have won on this field recently and familiarity of venue also adds a huge advantage for them",

But dammit does he summon up his only testosterone when he plays the Atlanta Hawks. In his career he has played them 21 times averaging 24.9 points, 12.4 rebounds, and 3.9 assists. This year was no different on Trae Young’s lil ass as he played the Hawks 5 days ago and had 36 points and 15 rebounds. I can just hear KAT screaming “After all that 💅” in the locker room after that absolutely disrespectful performance while Brunson and Hart are in the back fingering each other. \n\nBut I digress, the man has hit this line 4 times in the last 5 games (L5: 7, 12, 15, 14, 13). He is averaging 11.7 rebounds this year. I know his average is lower than the line barely, but there are key factors that are going to contribute to his rebound production. Josh Hart is out (a very reliable rebounder for NY) and Mitchel Robinson is questionable (another glass eater), KAT is gonna have to carry a heavier rebounding load than usual. The Hawks are also constantly out-rebounded by teams as they rank 25th in rebounds as a team this year. Both of these teams shoot a lot of three pointers, NY is 7th and ATL is 11th in attempts per game. 3 pointers are the lower FG% shot so there will be more rebound opportunities. I expect KAT to be inside the lane more than usual to counteract the key rebounding pieces Hart and Robinson (potentially) being out for the Knicks. I am no fortune teller, just a man.

Draymond is their defensive heart and the one player with the veteran \"IQ\" to pull Chet away from the hoop. Without him, the Warriors' interior is a revolving door, and Chet is the only person holding the keys.\nChet is averaging 2.2 blocks over his last 10 games, hitting the Over in 70% of those contests.\nGSW ranks 3rd-worst in the NBA, allowing about 4.0 blocks per game\n\nScenario A: (Quinten Post Starts)\n   With Draymond out, 7-foot rookie Quinten Post is expected to start. This is a dream for Chet. Post lacks NBA-level speed, which allows Chet to stay deep in the paint. Rookies often try to test established rim protectors; Chet’s 7'6\" wingspan will be waiting to swap out shots \n\nScenario B: The Warriors Go Small (Speed vs. Length)\n   If Kerr plays Jonathan Kuminga or Al Horford at the \"5,\" the Warriors will try to drive and kick. Since Isaiah Hartenstein is OUT, Chet has zero \"vultures\" taking his blocks. He is the only rim protector on the floor for OKC. Every drive from Steph Curry or Podziemski must eventually face Chet at the apex.\n\nScenario C: The Blowout (OKC leads by 20+)\n   You might worry about Chet sitting early. However, the data shows Chet is a \"fast starter.\" In his 6-block masterpiece against Portland, he had 3 blocks before halftime. Trailing teams get desperate and attack the rim faster, which actually feeds Chet's stats in the first three quarters.\n\nScenario D: The Offensive Slump (Ugly Shooting)\n   If it’s a \"brick fest,\" the Warriors will stop settling for 3s and try to draw fouls. This funnels the game directly into Chet's office. An ugly game for shooters is a \"Block Party\" for Chet.\n\nDPOY Hunt: Chet is the betting favorite for Defensive Player of the Year (+150). \nAnd I hope he takes it from Wemby (as a thunder fan of course, I love wemby as rival competition)  He isn't just playing; he's \"stat-hunting\" to solidify his trophy case. \n\nScenario-Proofing \n- Blowout: OKC is heavily favored (Thunder around -8 to -10 spread). Chet often racks up 2+ blocks by halftime in lopsided wins because desperate teams attack the rim more.\n\n- Close Game: 32–35 minutes guaranteed, and GSW's guards/forwards will challenge him repeatedly.\n\n- Ugly/Slow Pace: More rebounding → more transition → more rim attacks for Chet to erase.",

Cotton will know this matchup is heading his way, and will be smart enough to use it to his teams advantage, so think he'll be dishing assists rather than forcing shots over a defensive system in place to limit him.\n\nBOL!",

Tsitsipas is the superior player but has not played an ATP match (with the exception of Davis cup) since the US Open due to back injury issues. Tsitsipas had been getting very poor results. Since grass court season he is 5-11. His opponent Mochizuki does best on hard courts but is ranked 99 so definitely not an elite player. Last year on hard courts won sets against both Ruud and Michelsen and took Khachanov to 5 sets in Wimbledon. Given Stefanos current form and Mochizuki being a competent top 100 player I’m expecting a close match and think this goes 3 sets.",

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 6-20-3 *Starting the new year with a milestone - the 20th loss. Not exactly the start I had in mind but once again, I picked a match between two pretty evenly matched teams and backed the team that proceeded to get pumped 5-0. For some added spice, I bet on Manchester City and Liverpool to win their respective games and they both ended 0-0. At this point I might genuinely be cursed. We move though and at least I can just copy and paste the Last Five bit (saves me a few seconds of having to move the tick emoji around)*\n\n**Last Five:** ❌❌❌❌❌\n\n**Event:** Lige One McDonald's, Toulouse v RC Lens, 14:45 pm EST\n\n**POTD:** Toulouse DNB -120, 1 unit\n\n**Write Up:** We're venturing into the French league and I'm eyeing up the match between Toulouse and a flying Lens side. But make no mistake, Toulouse are in a pretty decent spot too. They've quietly turned their season around and come into today’s clash with **real momentum of 3 wins on the bounce** and 4 matches without defeat, making them a strong candidate to stun the slight favorites on paper. After a frustrating first half of the campaign, they look much sharper, more confident, and far harder to break down. They’ve gone unbeaten in their last four matches across all competitions and have won their last three games, including a **convincing 3-0 victory over Paris FC** that boosted both morale and momentum heading into 2026.\n\nWhat I think is especially encouraging for Toulouse is their **home form.** They’ve picked up points in **five of their last six home matches**, keeping **two clean sheets in their last three outings** at the Stadium de Toulouse.\n\nMeanwhile, *Lens may be leading Ligue 1,* but they **don't look very threatening going forward** and don’t have an overwhelming H2H edge. **Toulouse actually defeated them twice in 2025**, only conceding one singular goal across the two fixtures, and Lens have generally **rarely cruised past this opponent** recently. The hosts also have **key attacking threats like Santiago Hidalgo and Yann Gboho** in good form, giving them real scoring potential even against strong defensive sides.\n\nConsidering Toulouse’s upward curve, solid home performances and the fact that they’re not outdone by Lens, I'm leaning towards a Toulouse win, but going to cover my stake in case of a draw. BTTS Yes is a fine bet too, but I'm sticking to match results for now. Preserving my bankroll for a special Saturday's clash I really like, so going real light on this one with just a standard unit. BOL and let's get the first win of the year ☘️🫡",

Anyways, we move on again today and try a different league. I don't frequently venture out of English football, but today I like the value on AC Milan.\n\nMilan head to Cagliari as a clear favorite. I like them to come away with all 3 points here and put themselves back in 1st place. I debated taking -1, but there's a very good chance they only win by 1 goal. So we are adding Pulisic SOT to up the odds. Pulisic had been in great form, scoring 4 goals in his last 4 matches. He was out injured for a chunk of the season, but is now hitting his stride and playing much further forward than last year, leading a dual pronged attack. \n\nBOL everyone, remember to tail with caution and do your own research.

Pisacane’s side are expected to adopt a compact, low-to-mid block against a stronger Milan team chasing the top of the table, prioritising intensity, duels and disruption rather than possession. With key attacking absences such as Belotti, Felici and Folorunsho, Cagliari’s main way to stay competitive is through aggression, tight marking and stopping Milan’s rhythm with tactical fouls, especially in midfield and wide defensive areas against Leão, Pulisic and Nkunku. At home, Cagliari have consistently shown they are hard to beat against top sides, but that resistance often comes at the cost of discipline. Referee Rosario Abisso is known in Serie A for a relatively high incidence of disciplinary actions — averaging around 4+ total cards per game across recent seasons and often breaking up play with frequent fouls and cautions compared to league norms, including in matches involving Cagliari and big teams like Milan. With Milan expected to dominate possession and Cagliari forced into prolonged defensive phases, the likelihood of the hosts picking up at least two cards is high.",

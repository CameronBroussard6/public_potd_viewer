Bet 3u\n\nWriteup: Annoyed with our last loss, let’s get back in the win column win a moneyline parlay.\n\nIowa State has an offensive in pretty much every metric against TCU, and they are putting up these metrics against some of the best teams in the nation with a top 3 quality of record. They’ll have a top 10 offense going up against a top 50 TCU defense. Even more impressive it’s Iowa State’s 5th ranked defense, while TCU has a top 100 offense. TCU is a bit more consistent game over game, but we’re simply taking the better team here, not much else needs to be said.\n\nArkansas vs LSU has a greater likelihood of being closer game. Normally I avoid taking the favorite in these types of matchups where teams have opposite play styles, but this Arkansas offense is rolling. They have the 5th most efficient offense along with the 4th best field goal conversion rate. Along with a huge offensive rebounding advantage, I expect this to be too much for LSU’s 130th ranked defense. \n\nRemember to only bet what you can afford to lose, and BOL!",

Booker is playing, and Jalen Green should be eased back in with his minute restriction. With Booker and without Allen this season, he is 12/18, 67% - pretty good. At home, he is 8/9, averaging 25 points. He had 18 in that one game and played only 25 minutes since they put a beatdown on the Kings. He’s already covered in tougher matchups like the Rockets, Spurs, Thunder, Wolves, and 76ers. The Mavericks have been bad at defending pull-up jumpers, and we’re talking about Brooks, where his bread and butter is some form of a pull-up shot. Similar to KPJ, he runs PNRs and tries to get into the midrange/paint for a layup or step back + fadeaway. The Mavericks, same as the Magic, aren’t protecting the paint all that great, ranking bottom 25% this season. Like I mentioned, Brooks is taking almost 50% of his shots there. The Mavericks also play at a fast pace, so Brooks is naturally going to have a few more chances to score tonight. Looks like another 25 point game to me.",

In recent matches, Chelsea only lost to Arsenal.\n\nLeeds are not looking to bad. They won against Fulham and Forest. But they lost 4-0 to Arsenal.  \nThey did drew against Man United and Liverpool, which is quite impressive. But if you check the xG, it should've been another scoreline at the end.\n\nChelsea should win this, hopefully with 2 or more. If they win with 1 goal difference, we get the money back.\n\nBOL!",

He has cleared this 11.5 line in 6 of his last 10 games, averaging a staggering 13.3 rebounds per game over that span. His recent outings include massive totals of 20, 22, and 15 rebounds. Mitchell Robinson has been ruled OUT for tonight’s game due to injury management. The Logic: Without Robinson to \"vulture\" boards, KAT’s rebounding floor sky-rockets. He averages 14.3 rebounds per game when Robinson sits. That's nearly two full boards above your target.\n\nEvidence 2:The Indiana Rebound Desert The Pacers are currently the worst rebounding team in the East, ranking 29th in total rebounding percentage (47.7%). After trading away size for perimeter play, they allow the 2nd most points in the paint and struggle to box out elite bigs. Indiana’s frontcourt simply lacks the physical gravity to keep KAT off the glass. Indiana’s new big man, Ivica Zubac, is Questionable with an ankle sprain. Even if he plays, he won't be 100%. If he sits, Indiana is forced to start Jay Huff, who doesn't have the mass to keep KAT out of the paint. Rebounding Defense: Indiana ranks 29th in the NBA in total rebounding, losing the battle by an average of 4.4 boards per game.\n\nEvidence 3: Historical Matchup Edge In his only other meeting with a similarly undersized Indiana rotation this season, KAT dominated the boards. The forensic data shows that without a traditional \"glass-eater\" at center for the Pacers, the Knicks' offensive rebounding efficiency (top-3 in the league) funnels extra opportunities directly to Towns. KAT's Current Heater\n\n* The Numbers: KAT is leading the NBA in rebounding at 11.9 RPG. He recently recorded games of 20 and 15 rebounds.\n* The Efficiency: He is hauling in double-digit rebounds in 38 of his 49 appearances this season. Scenario Playbook\n\nScenario A (The Ideal):The game remains competitive into the late 4th quarter. KAT plays 32–35 minutes and naturally clears 12+ rebounds by the middle of the 3rd quarter due to Indiana's high-pace/missed-shot volume.\n\nScenario B (The Grind): Indiana shoots unusually well from 3-point range, limiting defensive rebound opportunities. KAT has to work harder on the offensive glass, but his 3.8 offensive RPG average keeps us alive.\n\nScenario C (The Outside Influences):Early foul trouble for KAT. If he picks up two quick ones in the first quarter, his minutes get slashed, and we rely on a massive 3rd-quarter surge to hit the number.\n\nScenario D (The White Flag 🏳️) The Mike Brown Factor. The Knicks go up by 25+ points. Coach Brown pulls the starters with 8 minutes left in the game. We need KAT to have 10-11 boards by halftime to survive the early \"towel-throw.\" Scenario E (Cold Night):The Knicks' perimeter defense is too good, and Indiana turns the ball over instead of shooting. Fewer shots = fewer rebounding chances.\n\nScenario Proof:The NBA 2K26 simulation and real-world forensic trends both show KAT clearing 11.5 in 85% of projected 30-minute simulations against Indiana's current roster. The \"Line Creep\" from 10.5 to 11.5 is a reaction to his dominance, but the data says there is still value at this number.",

Mertens won't give her the same leeway.

Onto today's pick, where I took a negative correlation parlay. Looking at the Mavs, a 7 game losing streak puts them well outside the play-in, and team morale is dipping. During this stretch, they've gone 2-5 ATS, winning by a mere 1.5 points against the Hornets and by 6.5 to the Rockets, one of the worst favourites ATS in the league. However, the major bright spot of recent has been rookie sensation Cooper Flagg, who has been seeing increased volume and maintaining impressive efficiency. Setting aside his last game against the Spurs where he only played 26 minutes, Flagg has routinely notched 20+ FGA. I expect this volume to return especially after playing less minutes in a blowout loss. On the Suns side, I see this as a clear opportunity to get back on track before the all-star break. After a couple tough losses, the Suns are dangling at the 7th seed, in danger of the play-in. Despite this, I'm optimistic about the matchup, as Phoenix won the earlier matchup this year in Dallas by 9 and they are one of the best teams ATS as a favourite in the league.\n\nFor those who aren't able to parlay these 2, I'd take Suns -7.5.\n\nBOL if tailing, lets make it 7 straight NBA plays!  \n[https://buymeacoffee.com/ch1cken](https://buymeacoffee.com/ch1cken)",

      "text": "Record: 5–4\n\nLast 10: 5–4\n\nLast Pick: Yale @ Howard Full Game Under 147.5\n\nResult: LOSS ❌ (Combined score: 168)\n\nReview: OT. OT. OT.\n\nThe game was tracking cleanly under almost the entire way. Regulation was set to end at 139 total points, well below the 147.5 number, before a last-second Yale three tied it and sent the game to overtime.\n\nOnce OT hits, full-game unders are immediately at a disadvantage because the total was never priced for extra possessions. The added period pushed it over, but the original game flow and pacing played out exactly as expected. This one was decided by overtime, not by a breakdown in the read.\n\n⸻\n\nToday’s Pick\n\nCollege Basketball | NCAA Men’s Basketball Houston @ Utah | Time: 9:00 PM\n\nPick: Under 142.5\n\nOdds: -105 (DraftKings)\n\nWrite-Up:\n\nHouston–Utah profiles as a game where possession control and defensive structure outweigh raw scoring potential. Houston consistently imposes half-court discipline on opponents, limiting early-clock opportunities and forcing long, contested possessions. When Houston dictates the tempo, games tend to slow naturally rather than oscillate, which suppresses both pace and efficiency without requiring poor shooting luck. Utah’s offense is more rhythm-dependent and less effective when forced into late-clock execution, making sustained scoring runs difficult in this matchup.\n\nFrom a game-flow standpoint, margin separation here works in favor of the under rather than against it. Houston does not accelerate when leading and is comfortable draining clock while maintaining defensive pressure. Utah lacks the spacing and foul-drawing profile needed to reliably manufacture late-game scoring inflation, which reduces over risk even if the game stays competitive. This creates a scenario where possessions quietly disappear over the final ten minutes rather than multiply.\n\nThe under is further supported by late-game tendencies. Houston is among the most disciplined teams nationally when closing games, prioritizing shot selection and defensive containment over pace. Without consistent transition chances or an extended foul sequence, Utah is unlikely to push the total upward late. Structurally, this matchup favors containment, control, and clock erosion — all characteristics that support a total staying below market expectation.\n\nBest of luck!!\n\n⸻\n\nIf you find value in my analysis, contributions are appreciated: https://cash.app/$KindlyQuantifying",

I will preface this pick by saying Birk Ruud did look fantastic in qualifiers, but he shares similar strengths as Luca (big rotations and amplitude, while being a little less technical on the rails) and I just think Luca possesses another level. I also like Alex Hall as a sneaky dark horse contender due to his unmatched creativity and technical abilities but the judges are unlikely to reward him in the face of guys like Birk and Luca.\n\nSprinkling .25u on Luca to bring home the gold (+1100) Best of luck!",

Everton’s recent performances have shown a clear upward trend, particularly in defensive structure and midfield control. They have been far more compact without the ball, conceding fewer high-quality chances and forcing opponents into lower-percentage shots. This defensive improvement is crucial against a Bournemouth side that relies heavily on transition moments and wide overloads rather than sustained possession.\n\nAt Hill Dickinson Stadium, Everton’s underlying numbers traditionally improve, especially in terms of expected goals conceded. The home crowd tends to amplify Everton’s intensity, leading to stronger pressing phases and fewer defensive lapses. Bournemouth, meanwhile, have been far less consistent away from home, where their attacking output drops and they struggle to dictate tempo. When Bournemouth are forced into a slower, more physical match, their effectiveness noticeably declines.\n\nFrom a tactical perspective, Everton’s direct approach and set-piece threat pose a persistent problem for Bournemouth’s back line, which has shown vulnerability against physical forwards and second-ball situations. Everton do not need prolonged dominance to create danger; their ability to capitalize on moments, particularly from dead-ball situations, gives them a clear edge in tight matches.\n\nThe Draw No Bet angle strengthens the pick by mitigating Everton’s tendency to grind out narrow, low-margin games. If the match turns cagey or ends level, the stake is protected, while Everton’s superior defensive stability and home advantage still provide a realistic path to victory. Overall, Everton Draw No Bet represents a disciplined, analytically sound selection that aligns with form trends, matchup edges, and risk management principles rather than relying on outright result volatility.",

LNG are 12-2 in game record and 6-0 in matches, complete inverse of TT, while TT was still in the harder group, I still think this is a compelte mismatch, most of LNG group was bad but LNG roster is very good, they have a ton of talent and should roll over TT, expecting a 3-1 if im being generous, 3-0 if LNG play serious throughout.\n* LNG in map wins die the 2nd least/14 teams in the LPL, and rank 12th/12 in deaths per game amongst playoff teams at only 6.6 deaths per game, while also having 12 map wins overall meaning this is quite a strong sample to go off of. They don't die a lot and play very cleanly in their games, at a 6.6 average (round up to 7 to be generous) Ryan3 would need 4/7 kills to go over or a roughly 57% kill share. He is currently averaging a 33.6% kill share overall meaning this number will be very hard to achieve.\n* In map losses, Thundertalk don't really do much either, their pace of play is extremely slow, they average just 8.8 kills per map loss, even at this number still very hard for Ryan3 to hit this line, they often just rollover and let teams dictate pace of play against them and they aren't proactive at all. Ryan3 is often left farming in side lane for the grubs fight early\n* LNG in map wins don't give up many kills to enemy adc's at all, In map wins this split, LNG are only giving up 1.58 kills to enemy adc's in their 12 map wins overall, well below this line, they also have a massive advantage in bot lane with 1xN/missing up against Ryan3/Feather.\n* Ryan3 is averaging 2.42 kills per map in losses this split for Thundertalk, has gone O in 2/12 map losses. However this average is inflated from a very high kill loss which he dropped 8 kills, factoring that out, in the other 11 losses, he is averaging 1.91 kills per map loss overall",

Another couple of side tangents why we might be seeing value on OG: both teams are popular and their fans will bet on them regardless and I'd say OG's IGL (in-game leader) is a little unpopular with some bettors maybe fading him but it's just perception imo I think he's a very solid IGL fwiw.\n\nEdits: tidied up the formatting\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c3pz013ytkig1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=32132264bfbcc30ff4c56f811443f21a43830d23",

For example, at the Australian Open she caused Anisimova quite a few problems, in a match where she could have won the first set. Here, in her opening match, she cruised past Arango, only facing some difficulty in the second set when her serve dropped below her usual standard. However, she possesses one of the best serves in the world, and I don’t think she will concede breaks easily today.\n\n\nElena Rybakina comes into this match after winning the Australian Open title, where she defeated Sabalenka in the final. She is an exceptional athlete, but I expect a slight dip in her level. Often, after winning a Grand Slam trophy, players tend to be more relaxed at the next tournament and somewhat less motivated. I believe this could be the case here as well, leading to a more modest performance.\n\n\nTherefore, I believe Wang will not lose by more than a 5-game margin, and my prediction is based on this idea.",

In their 6 matches played in 2026, he has scored or assisted in all of those games.\n\nWest Ham have actually played pretty well as of late and are also equally motivated to get out of the relegation zone. These two teams played in December at Old Trafford and they drew 1-1. With that being said, ManU controlled a lot of that game and I think it’s safe to say this team is currently playing with a different confidence level than they were in December.\n\nGood Luck!",

Got a touch sweaty as Malen had a bunch of shots blocked, but he came through for us again. Appreciate the love friends, and good to see a lot of you cashed yesterday! Let's see if we can start a streak. \n\nWe're playing back one of our favorite plays today and backing Enzo Fernandez to land a shot on target. Enzo, as many of you know, is one of my favorite players to back and fits the style of player I love to back to a T. He's always working hard, chases every fast break, takes free kicks frequently, crashes the box well, and isn't afraid to shoot from distance. This is lower odds than I usually like to take him, but I absolutely love this spot for him so we're not going to overthink it. \n\nLeeds sit 16th in the table and sit right at 16th defensively as well. They just conceded 6 SOTs at home to Forest and 9 SOTs at home to Arsenal. The reverse fixture at Leeds ended 3-1 in favor of Leeds, and while Enzo didnt have an SOT he did have 3 shots which is rare for him to not find the target. \n\nEnzo has been on a tear lately and is in the running (maybe favorite?) for midfielder of the year in the EPL. He has scored 4 goals in his last 7 matches, and landed an SOT in each of his last 3 matches. I expect Chelsea to dominate the ball here at home and im turn get their shots in. I'm also thinking there's a chance Palmer is rested in this game and Enzo will play further forward where he has thrived this season. Even if he plays further back, I still see him getting his shots in. \n\nBOL!",

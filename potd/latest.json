      "text": "Record: 0-0\n\nLast: First POTD, fade me up\n\nPOTD: (CBB) Purdue -9.5 vs Iowa\n\nStart Time: 6:30 PM ET\n\nOdds: -125 (TheScore)\n\nUnits: 1.25\n\nReasoning: Purdue rolls into a Big 10 matchup against Iowa tonight. Purdue boasts one of the most elite, efficient, & well rounded offenses in the nation according to KenPom & while the numbers show Iowa is typically a defensively stout team, they have been effectively weaker in recent games giving up back to back losses.  Purdue has yet to cover a spread this large this season, but I like this spot for a few reasons.\n\nREBOUNDING:  Iowa only averages around 29 boards a game.  I believe this number will get worse against a Purdue team who outsizes Iowa.  This should lead to more offensive rebound opportunities creating second chance points for Purdue. OFFENSIVE DEPTH:  Purdue has multiple players that average double digit points & love to share the rock.  On the other side, Iowa's offensive identity is rather one dimensional.  If Purdue can lock down Bennet Stirtz, Iowa's path to points can become murky. STAGE:  We get an in conference matchup where Purdue has the home court advantage that should prevail here as Iowa has struggled mightily on the road this season not winning a single road game against what I would consider a competitive team.\n\nGood Luck 👊",

Took a few days to collect myself and I’m ready to drop the hammer tonight! \n\nUAB currently sits at 11-6 and have been solid all season, ranking in the Top 70 in PPG, while shooting at 45% from the field. They’ve also been nothing short of PHENOMENAL down low, scoring 89 PPG in the paint over the last 3 games, putting them Top 15 in the nation over that span! \n\nNow, their perimeter shooting is weak at best BUT they make up for it, ranking in the Top 20 in rebounding rate which gives them ample 2nd chance opportunities. \n\nOn the other side of the ball, Tulane is going to struggle to defend UABs offense that sees the 2ND LOWEST turnover rate in the nation. Tulane is 166th in defensive efficiency AND 222nd in opponent FG percentage. \n\nTulane has also STRUGGLED offensively, ranking outside the Top 200 in PPG and shooting percentage! They rely on the deep ball with over 24 attempts per game HOWEVER The Blazers are only allowing teams to shoot 32% from 3 this season. \n\nWhile both teams see similar defensive metrics, UAB CLEARLY has the better offense which leaves them in a great spot to take the win tonight! \n\nPS: Let’s not forget that I LOST my first official POTD and started in the Red -1.5 Units. We CAN and WILL get it back 🤝💪",

Based on the standings shown, FC Köln are bottom-three on home form and conceding regularly, while Bayern Munich sit top of the away table with the best away goal difference; the last-5 and last-10 form tables show a clear gap. With Bayern’s starting XI strength, that home–away split points to a multi-goal win, which is why Bayern -1 makes sense, workable in-play if you’re late.\n\nOdds: 4/7\n\nUnits: 1.5",

The Buccaneers of East Tennessee State have started off conference play out very nicely with a 4-0 start in SOCON play while the Catamounts have had a rough start to conference play with a 1-3 conference record including a loss to conference bottom feeder Citadel, a team the Buccaneers beat 74-49. On the offensive side of the things the Buccaneers lead the Catamounts in points scored per game, field goal percentage, free throw percentage and three point percentage. On the defensive side of things I see the biggest difference between these two teams as the Buccaneers have great team defense allowing only 66 points per game which ranks 28th out of 365 division one teams while Western Carolina allows 81 points per game ranking 329th in division one basketball. I also like going with the Iona Gaels over the Rider Broncs in this MAAC contest. I like fading this Rider U team as they are one of the worst if not the worst in all of division one basketball. Rider comes into this one with a 1-14 record with their only win being against division 3 Eastern University so they haven’t defeated a division one team all season. Out of 365 division one schools Rider ranks 359 in the NET and 344 in the RPI and metrics wise they rank 364th in points per game, 362nd in field goal percentage, 365th in assists, and 335th in steals so this team has not done much right all year. With how bad they are I like Iona to handle them on the road in this one.\n\nPrediction: 76-69 ETSU, 78-67 Iona\n\nLast pick: 🏈49ers +6.5💰Outright win, 6 and a half was way too many points against a fraudulent Eagles team.\n\nBest of luck to everyone tailing and remember to bet responsibly! Sorry for the late post today we still got 4 hours until the first tip but Ill try to post the morning of going forward!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h9ixr9gp3ddg1.jpeg?width=1040&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c4bf911e0ee36ba14cc79fb0e4cc765591e472dd",

Purdue is better coached and Iowa lost their last two, they don’t beat Purdue on Purdue’s court. UNC is just a better team and I expect them to put Stanford in their place, this is a revenge pick from losing the VT vs Stanford game.

Missouri has been dominant at home, sitting at a perfect 10–0 on their own floor. The Missouri Tigers opened the season on an eight game winning streak but have gone just 4–4 since and are coming off a loss to Ole Miss, making this a key bounce back spot for them. That said, there’s value backing Missouri who have shown they can compete with anyone and come into this game playing solid, balanced basketball. While Auburn is strong offensively, their defense has been a concern, ranking 93rd nationally in defensive efficiency. Line movement has favored Mizzou as well.\n\n👇\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c0nrsvarjcdg1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9e31baca0a8e84276c61a6ba9b25efecee56b939",

      "text": "🏀 POTD: The Bounce-Back Play\n\nRecord: 0-1\nNet Units: -1.25\nROI: -100%\n\nSport | League | Event Time\nNBA | Cleveland Cavaliers @ Philadelphia 76ers | 7:00 PM ET\n\nThe Pick: \nTyrese Maxey OVER 27.5 Points (-105) bet365 , 11am ET\n\nStake: 1.05 Units\n\nThe Write-Up:\n\nMan that was an annoying game to watch yesterday. Zion result was a total \"bad beat\", he was perfect from the field but just wouldn't shoot. Tonight, we’re going with a guy who has never met a shot he didn't like: Tyrese Maxey.\n\nMaxey is currently the #3 scorer in the league, putting up nearly 31 points a night. Getting a line at 27.5 is a gift from the books because it's over 3 points lower than what he usually does. He’s not just a scorer; he’s a workhorse who leads the NBA in minutes, so even if he starts cold, he’s going to be on the floor long enough to get his numbers.\n\nThe Cavs aren't exactly a defensive brick wall lately (ranked 21st in points allowed), and with a high game total of 237.5, this is going to be a track meet. Maxey has cleared this number in 4 of his last 5 games, including a 38-point explosion, and there's no reason to think he slows down tonight.\n\nSeveral massive factors make this a \"smash spot\" for Maxey:\n\n• The Return of Support: Kelly Oubre Jr. (16.8 PPG) is officially Available tonight. Having another threat on the wing prevents Cleveland from double-teaming Maxey, which should spike his efficiency.\n\n• The \"Whistle\" Trend: League-wide free throw attempts are up 13.1% to 16% this season. As a speedster who lives in the paint, Maxey (an 86.8% FT shooter) is perfectly positioned to pick up \"free money\" from the refs.\n\n• Cleveland Fatigue: The Cavs are coming off a tough road loss to Utah on Monday and have had to travel cross-country to Philly. Their defense is currently ranked 21st in points allowed (117.7 PPG), and they are missing key wing defenders Max Strus and Dean Wade to disrupt Maxey.\n\n• Home Comfort: Maxey just dropped 33 points in his last outing and has a usage rate of 30.2%, ensuring he’ll have the 20+ shots needed to hit this over in a projected high-total shootout (237.5 O/U).\n\nMy sources:\n\n1. Injury Status & Depth Chart (76ers/Cavs): ESPN Official Depth Chart\n\n• Confirms Maxey's starting status and teammate health impacts.\n\nhttps://www.espn.com/nba/team/depth/_/name/phi/philadelphia-76ers\n\n2. Player Performance Logs & Rankings: \n\n• Verifies Maxey's 30.9 PPG average and #3 ranking in the league.\n\nhttps://www.nba.com/stats/players/traditional\n\n3.

      "text": "**POTD Record:**  105 – 70 - 11\n\n**Previous:**  Newcastle vs Man City - Over 2.5 Total Cards + Each Team At Least 1 Shot on Target Per Half – LOSS\n\n**Recap:**  First half easily hit the cards total for the first leg.  However, just my luck that perhaps for the first time ever, these two squads failed to record a single shot on target in the first half.  Then went on to a shot fest in the second half.  Absolutely incredible.\n\n**New Event:**  AFCON – Nigeria vs Morocco + Scottish Premier – Hearts vs St. Mirren\n\n**Pick:**  Nigeria Win/Draw + Hearts ML @ 2.30 (5 units)\n\nToo many losses recently based on just unlucky results.  Premise, logic and reason have just not come through recently.  (Like arguing with my wife.)  But reason and logic prevail in the long run, always.  I have been digging deep and have found two matches on short notice but one in particular just seems off due to skewness to home favotitism.\n\n**Leg 1:  AFCON – Nigeria Win/Draw vs Morocco (1.65)**\n\nSemifinals of the African Cup of Nations is a big deal.  Tournament hosts Morocco, have high expectations and with the help of their Real Madrid star Brahim Diaz, have been able to be efficient on counterattacks while remaining relatively goal free in defense.  I think this line is heavily skewed due to the presence of Diaz as well as PSG star Hakimi both of whom can be deadly when attacking.  However, Morocco are deficient in midfield and concede the ball way too much to competent opposition.  In their previous match, Cameroon had 75% possession in the second half.  Nigeria is far stronger than Cameroon.\n\nNigeria have been dominant in all of their matches overpowering their opposition with physical presence and free flowing football.  They are a balanced team on both sides of the ball and will present a difficult challenge to Morocco with their relentless attacking style.  I expect Nigeria to maintain possession throughout the match and have plenty of scoring opportunities as well.  Morocco will rely on their counterattack which has worked out well for them thus far, but counters alone will only get a team so far.  Morocco will also have the home crowd behind them on home soil and maybe even the refs, if it comes down to that. \n\nNigeria should not lose this match in regular time if at all.  This semifinal is not foreign to them as they reached the final match at the last AFCON tournament.  Also, Nigeria has never lost a competitive match to Morocco in the Moroccan capital.\n\n**Leg 2:  Scottish Premiership - Hearts ML vs St. Mirren (1.42)**\n\nHearts are having a fantastic season leading the Scottish Premier table 3 points ahead of Rangers and 6 ahead of Celtic.  They also bost the most wins of any team and the largest goal differential at +23.  Hearts are playing an outstanding brand of football at the moment and the cup is theirs for the taking as long as no stupid mistakes are made.  One such mistake would be to not capitalize on today’s opportunity at home.\n\nHearts host 10^(th) place St. Mirren (only 12 teams in the league).  Their last win came in December at home against last placed Livingston by 1-0.  St. Mirren’s defense is like a colander and have a -12 goal differential.  This is not even a fair fight and Hearts should easily win this match by multiple goals at home.\n\n**UPDATE:**  15 minutes in, Hearts gets a red card and we are a man down.  I can't catch a break.\n\n**Update 2:** Caught a break.  Hearts goal at 60 minute mark!",

They play faster, score easier, and don’t rely on grinding half-court offense like Rhode Island does. Even if URI hangs around early at home, VCU’s pressure usually forces runs in the second half.\n\nVCU’s offense is way more reliable they can score in transition, off turnovers, and from deep. Rhode Island has long scoring droughts, and that’s deadly against a team that pushes pace like VCU.\n\nAlso, this matchup favors VCU historically. They’ve handled URI plenty of times before, and when VCU gets a 6–8 point lead, they’re good at extending it, not just protecting it.\n\nProjected score: VCU 78 – URI 71",

These teams have a shootout when they vs each other with their last game early in the season ending 6-5 in OT win -for the Kings. The L5 H2H it went over 5.5 and ended with 7+ goals in each game, although I expect similar I dont expect 7+ again. What I want to target is just that underperformance of Kuemper in a spot where VGK is scoring 4.40 GFA in their L5 and Kings are allowing 3.40 goals per game L5. I think Vegas has a great spot to score 3 or 4 goals tonight where they are 11-5-6 as the away team. With the assumed 3 or 4 goals im banking on Eichel to have another stellar game where he had 1 goal, 3 assists and 5 shots last time these teams faced off. Vegas has a great PP at 26.1% and the Kings on PK are 76.8%, 2 of Eichel's points were from the PP last game and I expect him to contribute the same this game. Eichel has 4 goals in his last 3 games and a point in 10 of last 11 games. Eichel has hit 3+ shots in 5/6 games recently and I expect him to continue that trend with a hot offense from Vegas. \n\nBOL! All my picks are 1U bets!",

In their last two games (wins over Lafayette and Army), the Terriers shot nearly **60% from the field** and from three-point range. They even cracked the 100-point mark against Army. The Terriers are **4-3 at home** this season and have historically been tough to beat at \"The Roof\" (Case Gym).

They often struggle to maintain defensive pressure in hostile environments, which plays right into Boston’s current hot shooting streak.

Expected from a 6th tier team vs a top team in Marseille. I started to doubt myself but praise to the betting gods that these “easy” days do happen. I think we should go for another sweat-free one, I can get used to them.\n\n \n\n**Write Up:**\n\nWe’re going with a 4U bet on this Dutch cup game.\n\nLet’s start with Den Bosch. They are aiming for promotion this year sitting in a playoff spot as 7th place in the second league. They’ve played 13 games at home this season, scoring in 12 of them. They have 25 goals at home in 11 matches in the league. 2 home cup games so far this season saw them score 5.\n\nNow let’s look at PSV Eindhoven. Very far ahead in the first division with 49 points compared to second place with 36 points. But they do give up goals. 22 goals against in 18 matches. 12 of 18 matches saw both teams score. Away 5/9 matches saw BTTS.\n\nPSV Eindhoven give up chances when they shouldn’t and I believe FC Den Bosch will capitalize on those chances.\n\nI like the BTTS & o2.5 goals because PSV Eindhoven will most likely score multiple times. They play very attacking football and will put pressure even when behind. This does leave gaps and I expect FC Den Bosch to score at least one goal. In front of their home crowd they will have the confidence to score at least once.\n\nHopefully this is the turnaround I’ve dreamed of. Fade or tail, BOL!",

Since Jokic’s injury, Watson’s role has expanded significantly — he’s seeing increased minutes, higher usage, and more offensive responsibility, which has translated directly into production. With more shot attempts, more rebounding opportunities, and a bigger playmaking role, Watson has been consistently clearing this PRA line in recent games. Against a Dallas team that isn’t elite defensively on the wings, another 20+ point night with solid boards and a few assists puts him comfortably over 29.5 PRA. As long as his minutes stay elevated, the volume alone makes the over very achievable.\n\nP.S - I still love the Sam Merrill line but I’ll go with PW today and hopefully he does well again! \n\nAppreciate any donations 🙏🏻 [Donate via PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/flamesongames)",

Against Brooklyn he dropped 30 and against Chicago 47 points and against Cleveland he dropped 28 Points. Using a sample size from December to January he has hit this line 11/14 games. \n\nBulls are also the worst team in guarding the restricted area, which is where Lauri has taken advantage of, in the Cavs game, all his points came from either threes or inside the restricted area with one made mid range shot. \n\nI also like this spot as the bulls are on a back to back and Vucevic and Jalen Smith who are the main rim protectors both played 37 minutes.

Inter are leading Serie A and are in great form, having scored two or more goals in each of their last seven matches. At home, they’ve been especially strong, with 26 goals scored and only eight conceded, showing how solid they are at both ends of the pitch. Lecce, meanwhile, are struggling near the bottom of the table and have the lowest expected goals (xG) in the league, which highlights their problems in attack. History also strongly favors Inter — they’ve won the last five meetings between these sides, scoring 14 goals and conceding none — and with all these factors in mind, I’m thinking the scoreline could very well end up being **3,4 - 0** to Inter.\n\n  \n**Gamble responsibly:** While match predictions can be fun to analyze, it’s important to remember that games are unpredictable and anything can happen on the pitch.

This one is all about early pressure and tempo. PSV usually come out fast, even when they rotate in cup games, and they don’t really waste time feeling the game out they try to kill it early. Den Bosch at home will try to play, but against a side like PSV that usually just means space at the back. Remember, Den Bosch have not played a game since Dec 21st. Two goals in 45 minutes isn’t crazy at all with the quality PSV have, and in cup matches teams often start aggressive instead of slow and cautious. If PSV do what they normally do and push from minute one, this can hit before halftime. At 2.29, it’s a clean value play for early goals.  If it stays at 2 goals in first half we push.  I think this is a decent bet.",

KenPom has WCU (5-10) ranked 282nd with a 272 rating for both offense and defense. ETSU (12-5) is ranked 116th overall and enjoy offensive and defensive ratings in the 120s. WCU is 4-9 against the spread, and didn't cover their last two games. They're also 3-8 ATS as an underdog, and 1-2 ATS at home. ETSU isn't great ATS this year - only 8-7 - but they've covered two of their last three games against WCU. Also, ETSU has won four in a row as they've maneuvered atop the Southern Conference standings. Three of those wins have been by 14 points or better. WCU has lost four of its last five games, including an overtime loss to a Citadel squad ranked 360th in all the land by KenPom. These are two schools going in opposite directions. I'm going with better team numbers, and WCU's inability to cover this year. It's a simple play, but then... so was George Mason against the Loyola JV team, and we see how *that* worked out.\n\nGood luck and Godspeed!\n\nIf I've made you a few bucks through fades, it's just gonna ask you a few questions: [https://buymeacoffee.com/seventh\\_\\_place](https://buymeacoffee.com/seventh__place)",

Atletico controlled the match for the most part with a somewhat reduced side, and held on to a fairly comfortable 1-0 victory. Cash money lads.\n\n**Today's Write Up:** Today we are riding with two separate juggernauts in European Women’s soccer. FC Barcelona (W) and OL Lyonnes (W) are the two best women’s club teams in the world. They both absolutely dominate their individual leagues (Spanish La Liga F and French ​​Première Ligue). FC Barcelona is 14-0-1 with a +70 goal differential this season. They have scored 74 times in 15 matches and only conceded 4 times. OL Lyonnes is 11-0-0 on the season, scoring 49 times in 11 matches and only conceding 5 total goals through those matches.\n\nThe last time FC Barcelona faced Atleti, they dominated 6-0 away from home. Now they will face Atletico Madrid at home, coming off a 12-1 win of their own. In Atleti’s last match they gave up 5 goals to Real Sociedad who sits 3rd in the table with 32 goals on the season. FC Barcelona has scored more than 2x as many goals as Sociedad, who just netted 5 times against Atleti. Give me FC Barca to score 3+ goals in this match. Predicting a final score of 4-0 or 5-1.\n\nOur second leg is OL Lyonnes at home taking on Lens. OL Lyonnes is the second ranked women’s club team in the world and also absolutely dominant (undefeated on the season). OL Lyonnes has scored 49 times this season (most of any team), and Lens has conceded 30 goals through 11 matches (most of any team). Last time these squads met, OL Lyonnes won 8-1. They will be looking to get into their groove before their match against Paris FC this weekend. Give me OL Lyonnes to score 4+ goals in this match. Predicting a final score of 5-0 or 7-0.",

Now if we do get a fair way back there is always the possibility of bad luck, so I’m hoping the goat jmac shows some positivity out of the gates.    \n    \nAll that being said, UNLEESHING is different gravy to the other horses here, and provided the breaks come (faith in the best jockey), I think we should be way too good.

He's done very well though and it's all behind a very strong first service game. Being able to generate 5 BP opportunities off the Blockx service game shows the kinda form he's in.\n* Kjaer is a young up and comer making his first attempt at the AO. He's covers the court very well and is a strong ball rallier, evident with him regularly taking more than 50% of his opponents 2nd service games. He's had much less prep than McCabe for this one and given more games leading in, I think he'd easily win it. His recent victory over Watanuki tells me he's almost there and is still a very good chance of winning this and deserves to be the favourite.\n* At their best, McCabe is nowhere close to Kjaer in terms of talent but I think his service game is so strong right now and the fact that he's had more time on court to start the year and is playing in his home country gives him enough to come close in this match.\n\nI can't decide who's going to win this match, which is a good indicator for me it could go the distance.\n\nBOL",

Coach Ole Werner has publicly framed the match as a chance to “restart the season with rhythm” and stressed that Leipzig are “well-prepared” despite the unusual break caused by the snow cancellation — his words underline a desire for a dynamic, high-tempo game rather than cautious play. Werner also hinted that attackers like Timo Werner might feature, as he remains “in discussions” with the club and could return to the squad, giving Leipzig additional firepower up front.\n\n\\- Defensively, Leipzig’s setup remains stretched: injuries to Kampl, Klostermann, Nusa, and Bakayoko force structural adjustments and weaken their ability to cope with transitions once their press is bypassed — an issue critics in Germany have repeatedly flagged as leading to goals conceded. Freiburg coach Julian Schuster, meanwhile, has emphasised his side’s confidence and offensive rhythm, praising his squad’s ability to respond and contribute goals, especially through substitutes — which underscores his intent to keep attacking rather than sitting back.\n\n\\- Schuster’s remarks and recent team news also highlight that Freiburg will not shy away from an open contest; while they struggle historically away at Leipzig, Schuster has publicly spoken about focusing on Leipzig’s strengths and exploiting spaces between the lines — language typical of coaches who plan to counter-attack and invite pressure as a pathway to goals.\n\n\\- Finally, German previews note that Leipzig’s home offensive numbers are among the league’s strongest, while Freiburg’s defensive record away is far from secure, adding a statistical backbone to the tactical picture that supports multiple goals.\n\n\\- All told, with both teams motivated to push forward, Leipzig’s injury-forced defensive shifts, Freiburg’s attacking confidence, and coaches indicating a proactive rather than cautious mindset, the conditions are aligned for a match exceeding 2.5 goals.",

      "text": "Record: 4-3-1\n\nLast pick: Julian Brandt 1+ Shot on Target stake returned (did not start)\n\nSoccer | Bundesliga 🇩🇪 | FC Köln vs Bayern Munich\nDate: 14 January 2026\nTime: 20:30 (Amsterdam time)\nPick: Bayern Munich -2 Asian Handicap @ +100 (Bet365)\nStake: 2 units\n\nWrite Up:\n\nLast pick didn’t get settled since Brandt didn’t start, stake back, and we move on.\n\nI’m backing Bayern Munich -2 Asian Handicap away at Köln.\n\nBayern are on a completely different level compared to Köln and the recent form is scary. In their last five games they’re averaging 4.4 goals scored while conceding just 0.8. On top of that, they just sent a message this weekend by thrashing Wolfsburg 8-1 at home. When Bayern get rolling, games can get ugly fast.\n\nKöln really struggle against top teams, especially defensively. They give up a lot of chances and don’t cope well with sustained pressure, which is exactly what Bayern bring for 90 minutes.\n\nWe’ve also seen this matchup recently. On 29 October 2025, Bayern went to Köln in the DFB Pokal and won 1-4, again showing how big the quality gap is.\n\nQuick explanation of the line: Asian Handicap -2 means Bayern need to win by three goals or more for the bet to win. If Bayern win by exactly two goals, it’s a push and the stake comes back. Anything less and the bet loses.\n\nYou could wait for the line-ups in case Bayern rotate a bit, which is always possible with their schedule. That said, even if they do rotate, they still have ridiculous depth with players like Lennart Karl and Nicolas Jackson potentially coming off the bench. Just keep in mind that if you wait for line-ups, the odds will likely drop.\n\nAt +100, I’m happy to take this now. A 3-0, 4-1 or even bigger scoreline wouldn’t surprise me at all.\n\nBayern Munich -2 Asian Handicap\n2 units\n\nLet’s keep it rolling.",

Achilles has his heel. Illinois has… playing on the road at Northwestern?\n\nYes, the Illini (13-3) have posted an impressive 145-45 all-time record against their Big Ten foe. Sure, under head coach Brad Underwood, the team is 11-5 in the series. However, Illinois is just 3-4 over its last seven trips to Evanston, including dropping each of the last three. That includes a frustrating overtime defeat last season in which the team coughed up a double-digit lead late in the second half.\n\nFortunately, this year’s Wildcats (8-8) have made a living snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. \n\nIn six of its eight losses this season, Northwestern has held leads of seven or more points with under 13 minutes to go. The proof isn’t that hard to find, as the team saw second-half leads disappear in each of its past three games against Minnesota (67-60 w/ 4:39 remaining), Michigan State (45-38 w/ 12:36 remaining) and Rutgers (65-59 w/ 2:33 remaining)—the Wildcats lost all three contests. With a March Madness bid all but gone, and staring down an 0-6 start to conference play, the team appears ready to be put out of its misery.\n\nLook for a revenge-minded, lethal Illini offense to deliver the kill shot. \n\nThrough 16 games, the unit ranks 2nd in offensive efficiency (1.234), 30th in scoring (86.0 PPG), 55th in field-goal percentage (47.7%) and 122nd in three-point shooting (34.8%). It’s become a game of “Pick Your Poison” for opposing defenses, as Illinois boasts four players averaging 12.4 points per game or better. That has disaster written all over it for a suddenly-reeling Northwestern defense that ranks 63rd in opponent field-goal percentage (41.6%), 94th in scoring defense (71.2 PPGA) and 113th in defensive efficiency (1.014). Not surprisingly, those numbers have ballooned to 79.0 points per game conceded on 47.6% shooting over the team’s three-game slide. \n\nConversely, the Wildcats have the nation’s leading scorer in Nick Martinelli (24.1 PPG) and not much else. \n\nOn the season, the team ranks 54th in field-goal percentage (47.7%), 67th in offensive efficiency (1.127), 100th in scoring (79.1 PPG) and 294th in three-point shooting (30.8%). Over the last three games, those numbers have dropped to 73.0 points per game on just 42.7% shooting (26.9% from beyond the arc). Things won’t get any easier against an Illini defense that ranks 20th in opponent field-goal percentage (39.5%), 34th in scoring defense (67.4 PPGA), 44th in defensive efficiency (0.968) and 66th in opponent three-point shooting (30.9%). The unit has been more suffocating as of late, only conceding just 58.4 points per game on a meager 35.2% shooting (24.3% from deep) over its last five games. \n\nLook for Illinois to impose its size advantage on Wednesday night.\n\nPer KenPom, the team ranks 1st in average height and 4th in effective height. That advantage has been evident on the glass, where the Illini rank 9th in total rebounding (42.3 per game), 13th in defensive rebounding (27.2) and 20th in offensive rebounding (11.9) while ranking 8th in opponent defensive rebounding (18.5), 28th in opponent total rebounding (31.3) and 208th in opponent offensive rebounding (9.3). Furthermore, the team also ranks 16th in blocks (5.4) and 18th in second-chance points (15.3). That all adds up to what could be a long night for a Northwestern team that ranks 233rd in opponent second-chance points (11.8), 247th in total rebounding (33.6) and 288th in opponent offensive rebounding (10.2). \n\nBut the X factor in this one might just be Illinois’ ability to get to the charity stripe. \n\nThus far, the team ranks 28th in drawing fouls (20.6 per game). But not only that, the Illini makes good on those opportunities, ranking 4th in free-throw percentage (79.8%). That includes shooting 27-32 (84.3%) from the line over its last two games. Conversely, the Wildcats rank 229th in fouls committed (18.5). \n\nBank on Illinois to finally conquer its own personal House of Horrors and cruise by double-digits. \n\nBOL if tailing, and as always, please do so responsibly. One bet should not lead you to crash out all over Reddit.",

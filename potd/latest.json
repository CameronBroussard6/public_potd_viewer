They are 18-8-1, so there’s a real home advantage. They are 8-1-1 in their last 10 as well. LA Kings have been eeking out wins against not so great teams lately. Red wings score more goals a game and have better power play (6th in the league). I like the home team red wings. AYO!",

Putting that record into context and looking at who they have played, it’s clear they haven’t had a tough schedule. On the other hand, UMass have won 4 out of their last 5 including a couple of road wins and an upset win vs Buffalo. Miami (OH) defense isn’t great ranking 213th in the country in ppg allowed. UMass aren’t necessarily weak on the offensive end as they average 80 ppg (116th) on 46% shooting (133rd). With that said, Miami (OH) are 20-0 however their defense is their kryptonite here. I don’t see them covering a large spread against a UMass team that is capable of scoring.. Weak defenses vs good offenses are a red flag to backdoor covers and what not. Give me the Minutemen +9.5 tonight\n\n👇\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bihuu5bkwxfg1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=91cb487ab768bb465c640268a600f99ddb166303",

On top of that, Bremen are missing core defensive pieces (Weiser, Stark, Friedl, Agu, Schmidt), which guts their structure and ball progression, while Hoffenheim still field Kramarić, Grüll and Asllani.

      "text": "RECORD 6-6 (+8.28u)\nSTREAK: 2 WINS\n \nLast P.O.T.D. - NFL: NE@DEN - ZACK ALLEN OVER 0.5 RECORDED SACKS (+160, HRB)\n\nRECAP: For the 3rd straight wk, we hit JUICY ODDS (+160) betting the NFL's top \"sack machine\" (Drake Maye, not Zack Allen) will hold onto the ball too long & take a sack by one of the top left-side defensive lineman on the opposing team (DEN, HOU & LAC) & this one hit just 18min. into the game. It would seem that almost nothing is so sure as death, taxes & Drake Maye SAXES!!! (Yea..I'll be here all week with horrible comedy for you at 8PM,10PM & midnight)! Anyway, let's go forward..shall we?\n\nTODAY'S POTD - 8PM (EST) NBA: PHI 76er's @ MIL Bucks - (LINKED PARLAY) \nT. MAXEY UNDER 27.5pts + \nJ. EMBIID OVER 7.5 1Q pts (+230, HRB)\n\nRISK/WAGER AMOUNT: 2u \n\nREASONING/PROJ. ANALYSIS: Please pardon my verbosity, however there's actually quite & combination of things going on here & so to do y'all due diligence  I actually want to break this down properly. \n     So, first off, let's remember that the 76er's are on the second night of a scheduled back to back after having just gotten UTTERLY blown out by Charlotte so badly that at one point in the game they were actually down by 50pts. Surely, Philly isn't that bad, but let's look at the conditions that led to that & leads into this tonight. First of all, about a week ago the team & every starter plays 43+ mins in a overtime monster battle vs Houston, then goes toe to toe against New York coming back from 18 down to barely lose the game but what was clearly evident even at that point is that the team (& especially Maxey) was seriously drained. Then, last night happened in Charlotte. To make matters worse, and as bad as the shitstorm in Charlotte was, the snowstorm blanketing half the nation then forced them to fly (delayed) from Charlotte to Milwaukee & basically got then to the hotel just in time for a night of (likely at best) light sleep after traveling through near zero weather conditions.\n     Additionally, while I can't put my finger on exactly what's going on (& I don't have any factual evidence for y'all on this), but what I can tell FOR ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN via the eye test over the last wk+ is that there is sure as shit something doing with Maxey. Yea, he's on the court for his minutes but he's not scoring & other than providing a decent number of assists (6 or 7 per game), he jusr looks like he's being dragged up & down the court in both directions nearly every time. I don't know if he's injured or trying to hide an injury or just seriously drained carrying most of the team most of the time for nearly half the season now, however he very apparentl does not possess that same energy that was pulling down 30+ pts & 7+ asts a game or really even anywhere close to that lately with just 6pts last night in a reduced 25 minute role vs Charlotte & that's just after he (BARELY) finished with 22pts vs the Knicks in NBC's nationally televised \"Game of the Day\" just one game before it (& I know that because one leg of the parlay I played for that game had him needing just over 20pts for the game & I only LUCKILY hit it in the last 30 secs of the game)! All this said & with the 2nd night of a back to back, a plane delay, a likely light sleep plus dealing with the snow storm & weather & I just don't see how he recovers in (maybe) 10-12hrs from whatever his funk is to now go out & knock down o27.5 tonight as he's not only also seemed highly content to just pass the ball &  provide assists lately, BUT ALSO BECAUSE...\n\nTo the contrary of Maxey's play, has been the play as of late of one Mr. Joel Embiid who has (for whatever reason) been playing with the energy & spring in his step of a first year rookie. I mean, there can be no argument that he didn't completely take over the 1st half of the Knicks game dropping what I think was 28pts in just the first half (his highest scoring 1st half in over two years), but even driving, dunking & playing some rare defense nearly in the form of rookie Olympian Dream Team Joel Embiid who we haven't seen for obvious reasons in many years. To top it off, while he is \"technically\" listed (as always) as day to day with the \"knee\" injury, he actually did fully sit out last night in what I believe was a smart move by the 76ers to reserve his energy for this very winnable game vs a Giannis-free Milwaukee which gives him even less to contend with. For any of you who know me, I'm not very exciting and I make a lot of the same repeat bets. Some like Drake May getting sacked & others like Joel Embiid scoring over whatever his 1Q pts total is because he almost always comes out & takes the first couple/few shots & hitting or missing them doesn't ever really have any effect on him. \n     On a personal note, although not always played on this board, this season I have hit seven of nine times taking Embiid for over his 1stQ pts total (which is usually between 5.5 and 7.5) & he generally ends up with at least 8pts & usually at most 12ots. I was a little concerned after he took that fall during the Knicks game, but he even bounced back from that to stay in &  finish the game with several strong baskets well into the 4th quarter to help bring the 76er's back to as close as just one point down in the final minute despite them having been down 18pts after the start of the 4th. I guess what I'm saying here is that I FULLY EXPECT a (now) most-rested on the team Joel Embiid (who had the luxury of being able to sit out yesterday's game) to go back out & do what he normally does which is a lot of the heavy lifting with regard to the early scoring & I do think will there anyone set it in the locker room, he already knows that it's pretty squarely on his shoulders for tonight especially with Giannis out. \n       Now, let me also provide y'all with  some of the actual stats (courtesy of Statmuse) where he has actually hit his 1Q over in 4 straight & 8 of the last 10 games total, all but vs Cleveland (3) & Orlando(4) & additionally in that same 10 game period he has ONLY finished the 1stQ with under 8 total pts on 3 occaisions. Now, in case you're wondering about what seems to sound like a slight stat discrepancy, it isn't as he actually DID hit his OVER 5.5 1Q pts vs HOU, but only finished that opening qtr with 6 points total). In either case, with Philly fighting to stay in the race, Embiid being the quick starter he is & most-rested of the team & not even having to battle Gianni's in this one then you best believe that whether or not it's been openly discussed in the Philly locker room, his 76ers are going to need (&likely expect) him to put them on his  back at least for some significant duration of tonight & I believe he will answer the call considering that his overall conditioning has also just continued to be better & better to the point where after playing 43+mins vs Houston the game before, he then skipped taking the next game off to play the Knicks & drop 28in the 1st half.\n\nNOW LET'S GO CASH THIS SHYTE OUT!!!",

Today, we are going back to Jalen Brunson, who faces the Kings at home after a break. Brunson has been the second best first quarter scorer in the league this season avaeraging 10 ppg in the 1Q. This includes a high usage rate early in games with about 3.6 made shots on roughly 7.2 attempts in the opening Q. \n\nBrunson also comes into this game heating up, he dropped 31 last game where he just absolutely controlled the offence, players meeting must have helped lol. \n\nUltimately, a season 1Q avg of above 10, consistent shot volume early, and a knicks team that is sparked, I like brunson to clear 8.5 in the 1Q today.",

Over his last 10 games, Wallace has stayed under 2.5 assists in 9 of 10 contests (90%), posting both an average and median of 1.5 assists during that span. Notably, the lone over came in an outlier spot, while the majority of his recent games have consistently landed well below this number.\n\nFrom a usage standpoint, Wallace’s offensive responsibilities remain limited. He is not a primary initiator in Oklahoma City’s offense, with ball-handling duties concentrated among Shai Gilgeous-Alexander with secondary facilitation from Jalen Williams. Despite averaging roughly 24–25 minutes per game, Wallace’s potential assists sit around 3.3, which leaves very little margin to clear a line of 2.5 without an efficiency spike from teammates.\n\nThe matchup further supports the under. New Orleans has been effective at limiting assist production from opposing guards, and recent results against similar guard profiles show a trend toward suppressed assist totals. Guards facing the Pelicans in comparable roles have frequently fallen short of their assist lines, reinforcing the difficulty of generating consistent playmaking volume in this matchup.\n\nGiven Wallace’s clearly defined role, modest potential assist numbers, and a defensive opponent that limits guard facilitation, this line appears slightly inflated at -115. Without a meaningful change in usage or offensive responsibility, the under presents value in this spot.",

Avdija is expected to play today, which helps, going from 64% to 67%. What really helps is Camara's recent surge in court time. Over his last 10 games, he has averaged 36 minutes, the most on the team. This is because Kris Murray is carrying an injury. Jerami Grant has found his way back into the lineup from his injury, and when Camara, Grant, and Avdija all play, he is 15 out of 21 this season. Without Murray, he is 3 out of 3. I'm hoping Camara stays on this trend of 30 minutes played because he has covered in 29 out of 39 games (74.5%). He just played the Kings, Heat, Raptors, and Celtics and achieved 22 or more PRA in every game.\n\nCamara is a spot-up shooter who plays GREAT defense. Most of his points come from behind the arc + the restricted area. Wizards rank 26th in defending spot-up shooters this year. Camara is torching teams that cannot defend that type of player, going 14 out of 17 against 20th or worse. In the Wizards' last 15 games, they are getting blasted from the arc, especially from small forwards, ranking 29th. Camara is averaging 7 three-pointers attempted this season. Camara is making at least 3 threes tonight. Inside the restricted area, Wizards are pretty bad, ranking 26th. \n\nWizards are ranked 27th in defending transition points. Really good for us considering the Wizards give up the most steals this season. As I said earlier, Camara plays great defense, averaging a steal a game. Wizards are allowing opposing small forwards to average 2 steals a game, so I see Camara eating. Steals lead to some easy buckets or assists. \n\nTalking rebounds and assists, the Wizards have consistently ranked 15th or worse in allowing those stats. In the season, they rank 28th in opponent assists and 29th in rebounds. Last ten, they are 25th and 15th. Camara is about to feast! Versus the bottom 16th in allowing rebounds, he has covered at 76% or better throughout the season + last 5/10/15 games. On assists, he sits around the 70% mark. This season, against teams that rank 16th or worse in assists + rebounds at the same time, he is 14 out of 15. If we add horrific spot-up shooting defense, he is a perfect 9 of 9.\n\nWizards are also giving up a ton of free throws, ranking 29th in FT's allowed, plus playing at a fast pace, where Camara thrives. The only way I don't see Camara getting 20 pra is if he gets sat early from an uncompetitive game. \n\nGL today, everyone! Let's stay green, fellas.",

Anyway, my motto is that scared money don't make no money. If it looks good, don't overthink it.\n\nThe reason for me debating it, is because Bremen are not bad at home. Being 11th in the league as a home team and 2-2-1 in their last 5 home games. Hoffenheim though, are the 3rd best away team with a 5-3-1 record and a 17:10 goal diff while Bremen are still in a negative goal diff (11:15). The form of Hoffenheim in their away games have slightly been going down though, but they are in the same spot like Bremen, 2-2-1 in their last 5.\n\nIf we look at overall form, Bremen is heading into the wrong direction, being winless in 8 Bundesliga games, having a 0-3-5 record. Hoffenheim are going into this game 5 games unbeaten (4-1-0). H2H is a huge upperhand for Hoffenheim, with them being 7-1-2 against Bremen. At their home, Bremen have not won since 2014 against Hoffenheim in the Bundesliga. Even more, Hoffenheim have won 3 straight games at Bremen currently. Also lots of injuries for Bremen...",

      "text": "Record: 40-27-1 (+36.97u)\n\nLast 10: 💰✖️💰💰💰✖️💰💰💰💰\n\nLast POTD: 🏀 Duke ML + Arizona ML (+125) 💰\n\nToday’s POTD: 🏀 Nebraska +15.5 alt spread + Providence +12.5 first half alt spread (+103).\n\nGame 1 starts at 7pm EST. Bet 2u\n\nWriteup: Taking a shot at this whacky 2 leg parlay where we take some alternate points against two of the best teams in the nation. \n\nLet’s start with Nebraska at Michigan. There are only 3 teams left in men’s college hoops that are still undefeated who have a chance to make March Madness - one of them is Nebraska at 20-0. While showing some inconsistencies at times, they have a solid all around team on both the offense and defense. They go up against Michigan, who I have as the best team in the country. They have blown out multiple top ranked teams in a fashion we have not seen in a long time. Michigan will have the advantage on the defensive side against Nebraska’s offense, but I also like Nebraska’s defense to hang in there against Michigan. The biggest difference for me is the momentum of this game. Relatively speaking, Michigan has been playing a bit under their standards and have not been challenged recently, whereas Nebraska is absolutely riding this 20 game win streak. If Nebraska starts to feel something, they can absolutely keep it competitive. I would be shocked if they win, but giving them a 15.5 point cushion sounds great to me.\n\nNow let’s move to Providence at UConn. UConn was my pick to win the National Championships this year before the season started, and they’ve certainly shown they’re capable. They are the #2 ranked team in the nation (though I like them closer to #8) and have one of the best defenses in the program, all while going against many quality opponents. Their one drawback is they can be a bit shaky on offense at times, which can hurt their slow and methodical play style. It’s one thing if they were Alabama or Louisville and launched 3 pointers all day, but this UConn play style demands efficiency. This play style is in complete contrast to Providence, who has a top 10 fastest paced offense in the league. This is the type of matchup you circle when making March Madness brackets - fast pace vs slow pace. Upsets come more often when teams have opposite play styles, and this could not be more true here. UConn will have a solid defensive advantage here, but I like Providence’s fast pace and consistency compared to UConn’s methodical pace and slight inconsistencies at times. It wouldn’t surprise me if Providence comes out the gate and takes it to UConn early. UConn should be able to take care of business, but they may need the second half to do so. I like Providence getting a 12.5 point cushion in the first half to take it to the Huskies early.\n\nRemember to only bet what you can afford to lose, and BOL!",

And I’m very happy that my account here is finally unbanned, let’s keep it going. The Stars are coming to St Louis where they will play the Blues. In net for the Stars we have Jake Oettinger, he has been good this season and especially as of late with his consistency these past games. This season, Oettinger has a .902 save percentage and a 2.61 goals against average. For the Blues, Joel Hofer is in net and he has a .902 save percentage alongside an impressive 2.54 goals against average on the season. This is where I really start to like it, on the offensive side of things, the Blues are terrible, ranking dead last 32nd in goals this season. They also can’t get shots on net, ranking 32nd in shots on goal for the year. The Stars are mediocre on offensive this year, being 12th in goals but they don’t get a lot of shots, ranking 29th in shots on goal. The Stars and Blues played recently, and in that matchup, the Stars could only put up 3 on the Blues with Binnington in net, and Binnington has been HORRIBLE this season. Both goalies are pretty solid, with Oettinger being very locked in these past few games. Both offenses are very weak this season and that will cause this to be a good matchup with a low amount of shots from both teams.\n\nTake The Under 5.5 Goals!",

I know the \"curse\" of the Millerntor is a thing people talk about since Leipzig hasn't won there in ages, but the talent gap right now is just too big to ignore. St. Pauli is really struggling to find the back of the net they've only got 13 goals all season and their top scorer, Hountondji, is out with a busted ankle. They just played a massive derby against Hamburg a few days ago too, so they’re bound to be a bit gassed emotionally and physically.\n\nLeipzig, on the other hand, looked super sharp in their 3-0 win over Heidenheim over the weekend. Both their full-backs, Raum and Baku, are playing out of their minds and actually scoring goals themselves. Even with a couple of injuries in the midfield, they have way too much depth for Pauli to keep up with for 90 minutes. St. Pauli hasn't kept a clean sheet at home in forever, and with Leipzig’s attack starting to click again, I just don't see the home side holding them off. It might be a bit scrappy early on, but Leipzig’s quality should take over in the second half. BOL!",

They allow the most shots against (33.4), have the fifth fewest wins (10), and are eleventh in goals allowed (3.35). Importantly, they are the second worst team in the league in allowing assists to right-wingers (Zuccarello's position) with 1.5 per game. So, the combination of Zuccarello being good at home and the Blackhawks sucking on the road is the reasoning for this pick.",

I think due to Missi and DQ being fairly bad on the glass should allow Holmgreen to see boards, this team also loves to throw double teams and it allows easy put backs but I think he may end up scoring more. I think Daigneault will not play around with Chet Holmgren's minutes either due to the fact that this is a very ideal match up for Holmgreen so I think he plays 32 minutes easily or at least 31 minutes. \n\nI love Pelicans for this matchup as they chuck up a lot of threes as well, and they turn over the ball a lot and this team will force turnovers and bad offense. So im hoping to see Poole, Murphy threes from half court or even Hawkings if he sees the floor and I expect Holmgreen to be anchored in the paint due to Zion's presence and Missi as well as either can not shoot threes. So expect him to block and hopefully collect boards. Ah also if you want you can take this as a straight at 9.5 if you dont like parlays.",

While the public sees a mismatch between #7 Michigan State and unranked Rutgers, the math shows this line is far too high due to a fundamental misunderstanding of pace.\n\n**Model Data** \n\nThe total for this game is set at 136.5, implying a game played in the low 60s for possessions.\n \nThe Math: To cover a 14.5-point spread in a 62-possession game, the favorite must be +0.23 PPP (Points Per Possession) more efficient than the underdog. That is a statistical chasm rarely seen in conference play.\n \nThe Trends: My backtesting shows that road favorites laying >10 points in games with Totals <140 cover at a rate of just 38%. The lack of possessions simply denies them the opportunities needed to extend (and hold) a lead beyond what the books are saying.\n\nTrue Line: The model projects a final margin of Michigan State by ~5 points, nowhere near the 14.5 points the books are offering.\n\n**Nightmares at the RAC**\n\nRutgers has one of the most distinct home court advantages according to the data. Historically, Michigan State's offensive efficiency drops by ~12% when playing at the RAC due to the unique sightlines and physical defensive style Rutgers employs at home.\n\n**The Bottom Line**\n\nWe’re back to fading a public-heavy road favorite in a game that will be a dog fight in the mud.

They’re creating more chances, converting at a higher rate, and generally managing matches better than Bradford. Bradford, on the other hand, have struggled recently, particularly away from home, where their defensive record and game control drop off noticeably.\n\nWhen you combine Lincoln’s home strength, superior recent form, and Bradford’s issues on the road, this looks like a spot where Lincoln should be winning the game outright rather than settling for a draw. Laying the -0.5 simply backs Lincoln to do what the numbers suggest they’re more likely to do — take all three points.",

I already placed the bet with DraftKings, since FanDuel had -2.5, so I'll use that for the official POTD recordkeeping.**\n\n*Recap: What a great game for me, personally. Not only do I hit on the POTD, but I hit on Le Moyne at +1.5 moments before tip-off. Why the sudden line flip? Because leading scorer and senior center Shilo Jackson didn't play for Le Moyne. It didn't matter. The Dolphins led by 15 at the half and shot 61 percent from beyond the arc in an easy, easy cash. FDU is straight up terrible. We move...*\n\nWhat are we doing here? Marquette already lost 84-63 to Creighton on Dec. 20. If you think homecourt gives you 3-4 points, then this line suggests a 19-point swing. What am I missing? What's changed in the last month? Oh, yes. Injuries. Forward Jasen Green - third on the team in scoring (10.8) and the Bluejays' top rebounder (5.1) - reaggravated a shoulder injury in a squeaky win over Xavier on Jan. 21. ....but he's expected back in the starting lineup tonight after practicing yesterday. Forward Owen Freeman (6.2 points and 4.6 rebounds off the bench) is dealing with a leg injury, and didn't practice Monday. He's listed as questionable. Here's the thing. Creighton is the epitome of a system team. Plug-and-play, baby. Next man up. Creighton's hallmark is to let it fly. It's all about spacing, and finding layups and 3s. Consider that in their 21-point win over Marquette last month, Green only had eight points and Freeman only played 11 minutes. The rest of the roster played to their season averages that game - making 46 percent from the field and 37 percent from 3. If Creighton has even a slightly-above average shooting night, there's no way Marquette can hang - *even* *if* the injury report is worst-case scenario at tip-off. Here's why.\n\nThe system works. Creighton remains the No. 53 team, according to KenPom and Marquette is 124. The Golden Lions' system under Shaka Smart has been chaos and disruption. But if they're not causing turnovers, they're not winning. Full stop. Marquette wants quick strikes from their defensive pressure. Yeah, well... Creighton has no problem playing up-tempo, only they do it with efficiency. The Bluejays have a higher-rated offense (49 vs. 136), defense (88 vs. 128) and they've played much better teams than Marquette with a nonconference strength of schedule advantage (84 vs. 149). The only thing Marquette is better at is pace of play, steals, and offensive rebounding.\n\nCreighton is 28th nationally in 3s made (10.4), which ought to afford them plenty of come-from-behind energy (if they need it) and certainly win-by-two opportunity. If you don't like how sharp the line is, you can always pay the juice and take moneyline at -134. To wit, Creighton narrowly beat Xavier by 1 in its last game out. Meanwhile, this is a lost season for Marquette. They're 5-16 against the spread all year. They've lost four in a row ATS, and they're 3-7 ATS at home. ...And *this* is supposed to be the game where they put it all together, cover, and rally into the second half of Big East play? Miss me with that.\n\nCreighton has a huge shooting advantage. The Blue Jays make 46.6 percent from the field, 35.5 percent from beyond the arc, and 75.5 from the charity stripe. All three are miles better than Marquette (42.2 // 30.2 // 67.8). In a close game, that matters. Creighton also turns the ball over 9.7 times per game compared to Marquette's 11.1. In a close game, that matters. Creighton is 2-1 in games decided by three points or fewer. In a close game, that matters. As the moneyline favorite, Creighton is 9-2. In a close game, well you get the idea. Devil's Advocate: Creighton is only 1-1 ATS in games where they're favored by 2.5 or less. If this game is a toss-up based on the line, I'll take my chances with a Creighton team that ranks first in the Big East in effective field goal percentage, 3-point percentage, and free throw percentage.\n\nBut wait, there's more. Creighton is the best in the Big East at keeping the ball. If Creighton isn't turning it over, how is Marquette scoring? In their December matchup, the Bluejays turned it over 12 times, leading to 14 Marquette points and still won by 21. For today's line to make sense, Marquette needs to force something north of 15 turnovers and hit some 3s. ....but they can't. In their previous game, Marquette made 5-of-27 from deep. The Golden Lions hit just 18 percent of contested 3-pointers all season, which ranks them among the worst teams in the NCAA. My thesis is Creighton dares them to shoot, protects the paint (and the ball), and matches whatever tempo Marquette wants to play. The last time Creighton won at Marquette was Feb. 2, 2021. The next time is tonight.  \n\nGood luck and Godspeed!\n\nIf I've made you a few bucks through fades, it's just gonna ask you a few questions: [https://buymeacoffee.com/seventh\\_\\_place](https://buymeacoffee.com/seventh__place)",

Do not be fooled by the 82-59 drubbing of a very bad Rutgers squad-239th in defensive efficiency and 258th in offensive efficiency-because when push comes to shove against the upper echelon of the college basketball world, Indiana is the one on the receiving end. The team is just 0-6 vs Quad 1 opponents and 1-1 vs Quad 2 foes. Meanwhile, the Boilermakers (17-3) enter Bloomington looking to let off some steam. The team enters Tuesday night's tilt on a two-game slide, despite holding leads of five or more points during the final media timeout of each of its last two contests. The loss to Illinois on Saturday is especially tough to stomach, as Purdue shot a blistering 56.9% from the field (36.9% from beyond the arc) with senior guard Braden Smith chipping in 27 points and 12 assists. This Boilermakers squad has an edge over the Hoosiers in points scored per game, points allowed per game, field goal percentage as this Purdue squad is shooting over 51 percent from the field, rebounds per game, three point percentage, steals per game, blocks per game and less offensive turnovers per game. This Purdue squad has a couple impressive wins this year as they knocked off Alabama on the road as well as handing Texas Tech a beat down by 30 points while Indiana has lost by 6 or more to every ranked team they have played this year with losses to Nebraska by 6, Louisville by 9, Michigan by 14 and Michigan State by 21. These two teams have a few common opponents as these teams have played Minnesota (Purdue W by 28, Indiana L by 9), Iowa (Purdue W by 7, Indiana L by 17), Rutgers (Purdue W by 16, Indiana W by 23), Washington (Purdue W by 8, Indiana W by 10) and Marquette (Purdue W by 20, Indiana W by 23. Purdue is the better team here, and this is a perfect spot for them to bounce back after their last 2 performances - When looking at the data on KenPom, KenPom suggest that Purdue would be -10ish point favorites if they were at home - Purdue is top 10 nationally in FG % while Indiana is outside of the top 75 in FG % - They average 84.2 PPG and hold their opponents to around 68ish PPG - Indiana is 1/4 their L5 - and looking at their recent opponents like Michigan, Iowa, Michigan State, and Nebraska - Indiana does not perform as good as they would against a team that is not Top 25, whether that be home or away - One thing that stands out to me here is the rebounding edge that Purdue brings to the table in this one - Indiana can be beaten on the glass, Indiana ranks outside the top 250 in rebounds & ranks outside the 300 in offensive rebounds - Indiana does average 80+ PPG, but that number is inflated due to their weaker non-conference games this season - Looking at their recent results vs. the teams I listed above, they have not gone above 80 PPG in any of those - Lastly, Indiana is more vulnerable to having scoring droughts - I think, Purdue catches Indiana off guard tomorrow, Purdue is in a great bounce back position here - Purdue is a top 5 team and I think they have something to say tonight at the good ole Assembly Hall.\n\nPrediction: 84-74 Purdue\n\nLast pick:🏈Patriots -3🅿️Buying the half point came in clutch there, push is always better than a loss.\n\nBest of luck to everyone tailing and remember to bet responsibly!

That's a top six offense overall and NUMBER ONE IN THE LEAGUE, and it's far above the total of 111.5. They're the best offense in the NBA at home.

While Oklahoma has not looked great at home lately they are still a much better team when playing in the Loyd Noble Center with an 8-2 record. \n\nWhy is this especially more important for this game? While Arkansas has not played many road games this year they have ONE road win and it’s against a subpar Ole Miss team. Arkansas is 1-3 on the road and lack of road tests + lack of road wins = road losses. \n\nLed by Nijel Pack, Oklahoma has plenty of scoring power to keep up with Arkansas in what is sure to be a very high scoring game. OU is playing well lately almost beating Missouri on the road if not for wild buzzer beaters. \n\nLastly, Arkansas is an 8 man deep team. They do not go any further than that on their bench and any bit of foul trouble can really hurt them. They average 1.9 more fouls in away games this year which is a significant amount and can be a game changer in this one. \n\nGive me Oklahoma to win this SEC battle outright but as always in cbb betting, if they are giving you points, take them. \n\nI know I am new here and have no credibility so tail at your own risk. I have been on fire betting cbb this year so I figured I’d try to help others out. Hoping to build some credibility over time and make both of us some money during the rest of this cbb season.",

All from hitting woodwork and poor finishing to getting 11 corners in the last minutes of the game. It is what it is, onto the next.\n\nIm staying confident in my methodology which has proven to work for me. Todays we are visiting the German Bundesliga 1 for TWO fixtures but a mixture of the both. First up is RB Leipzig moneyline, where St.Pauli are winless in 5 fixtures and head to head RB Leipzig haven't lost in the last 3. RB sit 5th in the league with St.Pauli fighting relegation in 17th, most of RB's losses have come from teams which are similar or are powerhouses in the league (Dortmund, Bayern, even Hoffenheim and Stuttgart in current form). They seem to be winning 62% of their fixtures at these odds with St.Pauli only coming through on 8% - this alone, PLUS their current form gives me confidence that RB will deal with SP and come through. SP are the home team, currently in terrible form going 2-2-4 (W-D-L), RB are 4-2-3 respectively and despite these numbers I am confident enough they have the quality to win.\n\nSecond leg of the bet is u11 corners for the other Bundesliga fixture, which has hit u10.5 in their last 8 encounters - current form for corners is last 4/5 for Hoffenheim and 7/8 for Werder Bremen. Hoffenheim sit 3rd and WB sit 15th, WB are winless in 9 games I see them playing for a point at least especially being at home and trying to create a cushion from the relegation zone which they sit 5 points ahead of. Because of this I do think both teams find the net and it could result in an attacking centred but defensively controlled game. Corners tend to be better for unders in games that teams are looking for control in the midfield and defence, while taking advantages of breaks and big chances. Lets hope this plays out how we expect and teams can convert on their chances unlike the last few! If I stuck to my gut yesterday we would be 2W-3L and \\~+4.0 units but such is life.\n\nBOL and always bet what you can afford to lose!",

Arkansas has one of the most efficient offenses in the country and do a great job of spreading assists and playing with tempo. Oklahoma’s hope to win relies on home court advantage, lots of turnovers from Arkansas, or a career night from Xzavier Brown. I think Arkansas is way more talented, more disciplined, and better coached. Arkansas has a size advantage at guard, which I think will be hard to defend. Oklahoma has some size with their bigs, but they struggle in transition and are not as athletic as Arkansas. I look for Arkansas to get to an early lead and push the pace, neutralizing Oklahoma’s bigs and causing foul trouble for Oklahoma’s guards.\n\nEdited to add unit size",

When he is in form, he is just so fun to watch. Unfortunately he just gets injured way too often to go on any longstreaks, but he is injury free again now. In his first game back from start he failed to get any on target, but managed five against Bayern Munich and should probably have had a goal with the chances he had, then last round away against Heidenheim he scored and had two on target.\n\nSt. Pauli is currently in the relegation zone which is not so surprising when you have only won once since the third round, that win came against the only team that is below them in the league table… So things aren’t going so hot for the host. \n\nDespite playing out wide on RB Leipzig’s left wing, he gets centrally very often.

It seems as though he had no holes in his game most of the time except when his focus drops and becomes unrecognisable spraying errors for portions of matches. With how electric his game is it’s almost part of the fun he brings to the court as it can bring some momentary drama to his matches. He’s won 59 of his last 63 matches with only losses to Sinner and Norrie (lmao) but since the US Open it’s just felt like he’s gained a serious boost in consistency in his matches. Alcaraz has dropped just one set in grand slams since Flushing Meadows (against Sinner in the final) and has been dominant yet again here in Melbourne. Following two opening rounds where he was solid if unspectacular he did well to deal steamroll past Moutet’s tricky game and managed to beat Paul in straights in spite of the American playing the match of his life. Carlos is looking to be the youngest person ever to win the golden slam and has been getting better and better, when in confidence he can genuinely be unplayable in the literal sense of the term.\n\nAs I’ve said before De Minaur is a very consistently great player with a glass ceiling when playing against stronger opposition. He will give everything he’s got in front to the home crowd, play a lot of balls back but simply doesn’t have the weapons to harm the top of the top. To have a chance at being competitive with a Sinner or Alcaraz you have to either hope they’re having a truly terrible day or redline as they’re simply better in all aspects. It’s almost impossible to sustain such a level of intensity in BO5 like this but De Minaur physically doesn’t have the raw power to do such so I believe he doesn’t even win a set here. ADM loves rhythm which Alcaraz just doesn’t provide but won’t be able to get out of his metronomic style due to the Spaniard’s intensity putting him on the back foot which his opponent should feast on. I expect the demon’s serve to be largely neutralised in this match-up considering it’s already a weakness of his compared to the elite and with how well Carlos has been returning so far. As a result, ADM’s service games should be more contested than his opponent’s throughout the match. \n\nAs I said Carlitos does sometimes dip in quality in matches which is why asking him to not drop a set is risky but I believe fairer odds should be around the 1.9 mark and therefore see value. I have found that Alcaraz has been dropping the tempo in the less important moments (e.g. Moutet recovering from a double break in the second set) by playing with his food before turning the machine back on when it matters (still won 6-4). This seems similar to last year’s AO where De Minaur brushed aside the competition until reaching the quarters where he lost 3,2,1 to Sinner. BOL !",

Taxes. Vegas disrespecting Sparty.\n\nIf that Washington line was disrespectful, and if that Oregon line was downright blasphemous, then this line is straight up unforgivable. Especially given that we just got a good look at the disaster of a runaway train that is the Rutgers men’s basketball team when fading them for Friday’s POTD.\n\nBut mostly, it’s because Michigan State has been playing some of the best basketball in the country right now.\n\nSince a 58-56 loss at Nebraska back on Jan. 2, the Spartans (18-2) have reeled off six consecutive victories. All have come by 10 or more points with all but one by 16+. Even more impressive, is the fact that the team has done so by an average margin of victory of 22.7 points, including a 91-48 thumping of Maryland on Saturday. Not surprisingly, Michigan State’s recent form has helped it soar up to 4th in the KenPom rankings.\n\nAs is the case with most Tom Izzo-led squads, the defense has been the backbone.\n\nThrough 20 games, the unit finds itself among the nation’s elite, ranking 4th in scoring defense (62.8 PPGA), 6th in defensive efficiency (0.910), 7th in opponent field-goal percentage (38.8%) and 23rd in opponent three-point shooting (29.7%). But it’s the Spartans’ tendency to take it up a notch away from home that makes them a tough out, ranking 1st in defensive efficiency (0.901), 2nd in scoring defense (61.9 PPGA), 6th in opponent field-goal percentage (38.8%) and 31st in opponent three-point shooting (29.7%) on the road. Furthermore, ever since an uncharacteristic showing against lowly Cornell on Dec. 30—97 points allowed on 46% shooting—the unit has been in something of a flow state, conceding just 56.9 points on 37.8% shooting from the field (25.9% from beyond the arc) in seven outings.\n\nThat all adds up to what should be yet another lackluster offensive effort from the suddenly reeling Scarlet Knights (9-11).\n\nFollowing a 82-59 beatdown at the hands of Indiana last Friday, the team enters as losers of three straight and four of its last five. And while Rutgers already ranks among the worst in the country offensively—258th in offensive efficiency (1.010), 270th in three-point shooting (31.9%), 277th in scoring (69.7 PPG) and 330th in field-goal percentage (40.7%)—things only take a turn for the worse against stiffer competition. In six contests against opponents that rank Top 75 in defensive efficiency, the team averages just 59.2 points on a porous 37.5% shooting (29.8% from the perimeter). That includes being held to 37% shooting or worse in all but one of those games.\n\nUnfortunately for the Scarlet Knights, things don’t get much better defensively.\n\nOn the year, the team ranks 170th in scoring defense (74.5 PPGA), 196th in opponent field-goal percentage (44.8%), 239th in defensive efficiency (1.079) and 332nd in opponent three-point shooting (37.2%). Over the last three games, things have gone from bad to worse, as Rutgers has conceded 82.1 points on 48.5% shooting from the field (40.5% from beyond the arc). Not the kind of run of form you’d like to have when hosting a surging Michigan State offense that enters ranked 41st in field-goal percentage (47.9%), 47th in offensive efficiency (1.147), 71st in three-point shooting (35.8%) and 95th in scoring (79.1 PPG).\n\nBut while those numbers won’t jump out of the page at you, take a look at what the team has managed to do in its last six meetings against opponents that rank outside of the Top 200 in defensive efficiency:\n\n* Oregon (208): 68 points on 57% shooting (35% from beyond the arc)  \n* Maryland (278): 91 points on 61% shooting (47% from beyond the arc) \n* Toledo (286): 92 points on 51% shooting (43% from beyond the arc)  \n* Penn State (306): 76 points on 46% shooting (56% from beyond the arc)  \n* Oakland (333): 79 points on 46% shooting (27% from beyond the arc)  \n* Cornell (351): 114 points on 55% shooting (46% from beyond the arc)\n\nNot only did the Spartans go 6-0 in those contests, but they did so while averaging 86.7 points on 52.7% shooting (42.3% from long range). That includes shooting 51% or better in all but two games and shooting 43% or better from deep in all but two as well.\n\nIt will be the intangibles that will play an X factor in this one.\n\nMichigan State topped 30 fast break points against Maryland on Saturday, marking the third time this season the team has accomplished the feat—the rest of the Big Ten has only done so twice. Not surprisingly, the Spartans rank 7th in fast break points (17.3 PPG; 98th percentile). That’s an area the team should continue to thrive in against a Scarlet Knights team that ranks 156th in opponent fast break points (9.8 PPG; 57th percentile). But where the team truly struggles is in conceding second-chance opportunities to opponents, ranking 222nd in the category (11.7 PPG; 39th percentile). This is another area Michigan State should be able to take advantage, as the team ranks 28th in second-chance points (14.3 PPG); 92nd percentile).\n\nForget looking ahead. Expect Sparty to put together another dominant performance to springboard themselves into Friday night’s massive showdown with in-state rival Michigan.\n\nBOL if tailing, and as always, please do so responsibly. One bet should not have you crashing out all over Reddit.",

Houston has hit the under the last 5 games and  9 of the last 12 games for the Cyclones has hit the under as well. The under is 4-1 in the last 5 meetings between these two. Both teams are Top 10 defense adjusted; I see no changes.",

      "text": "**Record: 8w - 9L**\n\n**Net Units: +17.04**\n\n**Last:**  Wolfsburg vs RB Leipzig ML + Lyon ML vs Nice (5u) ❌ \n\n**Denmark Superligaen 18:00pm GMT | England Championship @ 20:00pm GMT**\n\n**Pick:** **Sonderjyske ML** v Silkeborg IF+ Coventry vs Middlesbrough **Over 1.5 Goals** **(4u)**\n\n**Odds: +127** (+171 for O2.5 SvS , +221 for ML + Over 2.5 CvM)\n\n**Write Up:** Just can't write it, Leipzig fall short despite dominating first half and owning Wolfsburg in most stats (4x the expected goals, 3x shots on target etc.) - simply one of those games that seems to go wrong. Lyon clear the second leg easily 2-0.\n\nFirstly we go to the Danish Superligaen where Sonderjyske(6th) host Silkeborg IF(10th). Sonderjyske need to win here at home to prevent themselves from sliding out of championship positions. They are on a 4 game unbeaten streak at home and against a mediocre travelling Silkeborg (2-2-4 W/D/L away record) they should see out a win here. In all form Sonderjyske have a record of 5-3-2 in their last 10 in this competition with Silkeborg going 2-3-5 in their last 10, with no wins in their last 6 (2 draws). Head to head Silkeborg tend to do well, however the reverse fixture finished in Sonderjyske's favour at 2-0. Im taking the Sonderjyske moneyline here as recent form suggest that the home team battling for championship spots should take all 3 points as Silkeborg are struggling recently with their last 6 games proving a slump, especially with them not scoring in 5 of them. It must be said that they did score plenty in club friendlies 17th-30th Jan but that was against weaker opponents, with their last game against a Danish Superliga team on the 8th Feb against Viborg(4th) ended 0-1. **Over 2.5 goals** is a solid bet too if you would prefer as their last 5 home games it has hit 5, in Silkeborgs last 5 away games it has hit 4 times and their last 5 head-to-head games it has hit 4 times, over 2.5 has a 73% rate in this league averaging \\~3.4 goals per game. But for the value I am backing an in-form Sonderjyske to beat an out of form weaker travelling Silkeborg.\n\nSecondly we go to the English second league where Middlesbrough(1st) travel to Coventry city(2nd). The reverse fixture for this finished 4-2 Coventry at Middlesbrough. I would like to preface this writeup as I am taking the line at over 2.5 goals BUT the odds for that plus the previous pick would put us past the +200 as per the rules at +236, tail that line if you will but 1.5 is the safer line. Firstly this matchup has seen over 2.5 goals in 4/5 games. Coventry at home have seen this line clear 7/13, Middlesbrough away have seen it clear 8/15. While these don't look particularly enticing lets look at current form. Coventry have won 4 in the last 13, with 5 losses - with injuries (noticeably their striker Brandon Thomas-Asante and starting goalkeeper Oliver Dovin) and a short squad Lampard's team are seemingly slowing down after a flying start to their campaign. Middlesbrough are on the opposite of the spectrum on a 6 game win streak, scoring 16 and conceding 4. Current form shows over 2.5 goals for Coventry in 4/5 and Middlesbrough 6/7. In a race for the title I expect a high tempo game with plenty of chances both ends just like the reverse fixture, especially if a team concedes then the game should open up. Over 1.5 goals is the safe pick but personally for the value I am going over 2.5 goals. In total Coventry have 32 goals for and 11 against at home, with 2 out of the last 3 seeing them concede and finish 2-1 against weaker teams than Middlesbrough and Middlesbrough away seeing 3 out of the last 3 away games over 2.5 and BTTS. Simply put current streaks and form show that both teams should find the net and all it will take is either the reliable home team to get two or the on-fire away team to secure 2 like they have in 5/6 with 3 of these seeing them score over 2.5 themselves.\n\nAlso shout out to Past\\_Article4977 for letting me know I got the date wrong for previous first leg pick - it was late and I misread it so apologies!\n\n**BOL and always bet what you can afford to lose!**",

I not only see them winning but I see them dominating Girona today. Raphina is back which is a big attacking threat that was missing from Barca in the past game. Girona has been a disappointment this season and I don’t see them standing a chance today given the circusmstances. Barca ML should be a straightforward one. \n\nTop two teams meet each other on this championship Monday night clash. These teams score for fun but also don’t have the best defensive record. In their past meeting there were 6 goals scored and I see another high scoring affair here. They have no reason to sit back, both teams need the win and withe Coventry having scored 63 goals in 31 matches this season and Middlesbrough 49, I see the match today having at least 2 goals.\n\nBOL",

But we all know how betting works. \n\nI do LOVE Houston at -130, get in while you can. Usually Houston isn't a top tier baseball program but they have had streaky years and for whatever reason Houston although not being the top Texas baseball program they are showing life like they want to be. 3-0 on the season against a 0-3 team that has yet to score 1 run this entire year AND also a team that has been 7 run ruled twice. I don't understand why the line is only -130 but I think you gotta jump on that and hammer it.  There is no reason a team that hasn't scored a single run so far this year, should win against a team that is undefeated.  It's sports but this is the value pick of the week.",

They were thrashed to tears 4:0 by Atletico Madrid in the Copa del Rey fixture last week and they are out for blood.\n\nNo need to pull up stats here since Barcelona is such an obvious high-octane all out team - you know stats will support any OVER it's just a matter of choosing your spots to play the OVERs.  \n(I mean even if you blindly play OVERs this season for Barca - full time or first half however you wanna slice it - you are in the money)\n\nThe opponent does not really matter because Barcelona's style of play means they can score and concede against anyone.  \nHaving said that - Girona is in decent form and they will not roll over for Barca tonight so I prefer the OVER vs taking the HANDICAP line.\n\nNote: There are different ways to play this rebound angle, e.g. you could take OVER 3.5 or OVER 3.25 on the full game. I personally like OVER in the first half for the possibility of the game pace diminishing later on.",

Macclesfield shocked the world when they beat Crystal Palace in the previous round 2-1. Macclesfield is in the SIXTH tier of English football. They are a semi professional team and most all of their squad have day jobs. I saw a fun graph after they beat palace, their annual operating expenses for the entire club are below the annual salaries of 23 Palace players...\n\nAnyway, I love a good Cinderella story so I decided to go for a shot prop. Jenson is a midfielder for Brentford, who can really sloy into any midfield position. He is the default penalty taker when Thaigo is not in the pitch, and had a great game last round of the FA Cup with a goal on two SOTs. I expect much of the Brentford team will get their shots in, as Brentford should have most of the ball given the differences in team tiers. **Watch for lineups** as I've mentioned before, Cup match lineups are tricky and while I think Jenson will start, there's always a chance he won't. \n\nBOL!",

Chose Aarhus for safety, it was the only one who lost. Ended up in profit for the day though because all the others won and my Midtjylland degen bets all hit.\n\nNow for today..\n\nPick: CFR Cluj win @ 1.88 \n\nWrite Up:\n\n15th place Hermannstadt hosts 7th place Cluj. Hermannstadt has 1W4D8L at home while Cluj has 4W5D4L away. These two played three times last year and Cluj won them all. In last 6 Hermannstadt matches, they lost 4, won 1 and 1 draw.

The bottom line is that Cluj is in good form and Hermannstadt is ass.\n\nSafety angle: You can get Cluj/Draw + O1.5 at 1.6.\n\nDegen angle: Cluj win & O2.5 goals is at 3 odds. Add U11.5 corners and you get 3.5 odds. I will sprinkle on these.\n\nAlso, something interesting. Future FC vs Ismaila are playing in Egypt. In L8 Ismaila matches, 6/8 has O2.5, 4/8 has O3.5 and 8/8 have BTTS. You can get 2.09 odds for O2.5, 3.75 for O3.5 and 2.04 for BTTS.

Number 3 Houston travels to 5 Iowa St. Both of these teams are used to winning, and both are great at covering spreads. Iowa St is 3-0 versus ranked opponents while Houston is 4-2. ATS Iowa St is 2-1, while Houston is 2-4. Houston hasn’t been a road dog this season, if that tells you how good they are. At home versus other Big 12 teams, Iowa is 6/6 covering -2.5. Houston has allowed -2.5 1/6 times. I also came across a neat stat: In games played among ranked teams, when the lower-ranked team is favored at home over a higher-ranked opponent, the home team is 11-4 SU and 10-5 ATS. To top it off, this game can impact March Madness seeding, and both of Houston’s losses have come on the road. \n\nIowa St ranks 10th in offensive efficiency, and Houston ranks 31st. The Cyclones hit shots at an extremely high rate, ranking 4th in 3P% - 39.7% & 35th in 2P% - 57.2% Houston sits average in both, ranking 179th in 3P% - 34.1% and 118th in 2P% - 53.3%. Houston doesn’t get many shots around the rim. They are extremely reliant on midrange and threes. This will be tough since the Cyclones rank 25th in limiting opponents three-point attempts, and both teams rank top 50% in opponent three-point percentage. Cyclones win the offensive battle. Both of these teams are defensive powerhouses. Houston ranks 3rd in defensive efficiency, while Iowa St ranks 5th. Both teams are similar in rebounding, so there is no edge there. Houston ranks 1st in limiting turnovers, but Iowa St ranks 9th in steals per game. \n\nEverywhere you look, this is a close game. This can easily be an elite eight or final four matchup, and we’re getting it early. The edge here is Houston’s two losses coming from the road. They rely a little too much on their defense, and have had some ugly games, granted, they’ve managed to still win them. With Iowa State at home, in one of the toughest places to play, I have to side with them. Yes, both teams are efficient on offense, but the Cyclones take more shots on a higher made %. They tote one of the best eFG% in the country, while the Cougars rank middle of the pack. Iowa State is averaging more possessions per game as well. If they can control the tempo and knock down threes like they have been (versus no. 9 Kansas, shot 37%), we have a good chance of cashing. GL\n\nhttps://venmo.com/u/SezaBC",

Sweden knows that they don't have much chance vs team USA(+2000 to win) so they'll definitely go with the same game plan that they did vs Czechia. Keep the score low and play defensively well enough to try to go for a 3-2 or 2-1 upset.

The visitors have scored three goals in three of five visits to bottom-half teams, and they can impress once again.

Humbert holds in the mid-80% range indoors and Marozsan sits around 80%+, so early breaks should be limited. Both rely heavily on first-serve efficiency and tend to settle in on serve before return games open up.\n\nWith two strong indoor hold profiles, first sets between players like this usually stretch into the 10–12 game range. A single break likely isn’t enough to keep this under, and anything on serve through 5-5 clears comfortably.",

In 2026 so far beaten some very strong Anubis teams (paiN/PARI as well as beating FUT/Falcons)\n* NAVI are 0% winrate on 1 map of Anubis in the L3 months, they have always been staying away from this map even when it was in the pool and have struggled on it. They lost to PARIVISION 19-16 in their only map . Despite NAVI having a very strong 2024 on Anubis, they really fell off in 2025 with a 1-5 overall record and avoiding the map at all costs\n\n**Player Anubis Stats:**\n\n* iM averaged a .57 KPR on Anubis in his only map in 2026, a .58 KPR in 2025, and a .67 KPR on the map in 2024. In this 3 year period total, he averaged a .64 KPR on Anubis, a -.06 KPR from his regular average making it one of his worst maps statistically\n* XANTARES has averaged a 1.07 KPR on Anubis in 4 maps played so far in 2026, a .79 KPR in 2025 on the map overall, and a .78 KPR in 2024. Overall he has averaged a .80 KPR in the three year period on Anubis, up +.05 KPR from his average making it one of his best maps. Most impressively is how big of a sample of games he has, it is much easier to see big jumps in KPR when sample is small-medium, but for a map he has played nearly 100 times, these are incredibly consistent and strong numbers\n* Lots of reasons why its such a good map but one of the big ones is with Wicadia as A anchor, a lot of his kill threat on CT Side goes down, XANTARES has been their big output on CT Side, even historically when the map was much more T sided/favored overall.",

I would have fairer odds closer to 1.7. After a really solid start to the season where Meddy won Brisbane, only dropping a single set, he has slightly slipped back into madness. He reached the fourth round in Melbourne beating De Jong 3-0, Halys 3-1, recovered from 2-0 down to Marozsan to seal a victory before being blown off the court by Tien 3-0. Last week, he played in Rotterdam where he lost 2-1 to Humbert and spent the entire match complaining about the balls (seriously a HOF crashout). Shang is entering the tournament with protected ranking as his body is made of glass but his level is very high whenever he plays. He started his 2026 with easy wins over Comesana and Sonego before falling to a red-hot Bublik in straights though had set point in the second. In Australia he took out RBA in four and lost to VDZ in straights but he was clearly unfit so I won’t read too much into it. \n\nSo we have a Medvedev that hasn’t been winning easy recently against a big hitting prospect on a pretty fast court. I wouldn’t be surprised if Jerry was an outright winner in this match-up. Shang is also lefty and Medvedev has really been struggling against them as of late. Both matches he lost this year were against lefties and has lost a set in 10/12 (2-0’d Mannarino in Beijing 24’ where he saved SP, Norrie Beijing 25’) matches against them on hard courts, being 4-8 in that time span. Whilst Daniil is genuinely one of the best counterpunchers we’ve seen and thrives on absorbing power to grind out rallies, his deep positioning is a detriment against lefties as he gets pushed so far off the court by the slider that a player like Shang can just attack down the line after a  backhand cross. Shang’s explosive game fits this pattern perfectly and can also hang in the longer rallies as his rallying/defensive skills are also very strong, though Medvedev will obviously have the upper hand in those scenarios more often than not so he’ll want to avoid these patterns and can attack a neutral ball. Meddy’s second serve has also completely deteriorated over time (+ groundstroke pop has slightly reduced) and I expect Shang to punish it. Whilst the Russian is still an elite returner, Jerry’s serving abilities helped by the conditions should limit break opportunities and I feel like this is a pretty favourable match-up for him so I do think he at least grabs a set.

We had great success at BLAST VI, and now we’re looking to carry that momentum into the opening day of DreamLeague Season 28.\n\n\nWrite up:\nIn DreamLeague, Group Stage 1 uses a Best-of-2 (BO2) format, which means the draw (1-1) is always a lurking threat. However, when the statistical gap is this wide, the \"Draw\" often becomes a value trap set by bookies. We are backing Tundra Esports to continue their total psychological and tactical dominance over MOUZ.\n\nWhile Tundra had a slightly \"shaky\" 7th-place finish at BLAST Slam VI, losing their streak to HEROIC, they remain a tier above MOUZ in every measurable metric. The head-to-head record is as one-sided as it gets: Tundra has won all 7 of their previous encounters. More importantly, in their last three meetings (Dec 2025 – Feb 2026), Tundra hasn't dropped a single map to this roster. On top of that Mouz has been horrific and ended their run at Blast slam by losing to a tier 3 Indonesian stack and bottomed the group stage.\n\nAt 2.38 odds, the bookmakers are giving us a \"Day 1 Discount,\" implying only a 42% chance for a sweep and favoring a draw. They are banking on Tundra being \"sleepy\" or experimental in the opening match or just because they lost against Heroic in Blast Slam VI. I’ll take that risk any day of the week—Tundra’s discipline in the laning phase (averaging a 76% win rate there) usually snuffs out MOUZ before they can even find their footing.\n\nFinal Play: Tundra 2-0.

To begin, playing on the road in the Big 12 is hard for anyone, I don’t care if you’re Houston. But Iowa State just pummeled Kansas and they get to carry that momentum 2 days later on their own court. Iowa State is 15th in the nation in points allowed (given the difficulty of their schedule that’s insane). They’re 12 in the country in Field Goal percentage, and 13th in the nation in assists. What does this tell us? They’re a very efficient offense that isn’t reliant on making difficult shots. They hound you on defense and work the ball around until they get THEIR shot. Their pace isn’t dictated by the other team. I say this because the Houston Cougars are a very smart and difficult team to play against, but Iowa State has proved this year they can show up against ANYONE. They have the home floor and it’s coming off a huge win against the Jayhawks. That place will be bumping and it will be ready to cash all of our slips. Why Iowa State will win, 1. Two-sided dominance 2. They can beat you a number of ways 3. Depth 4. Home court. Let me know if you’re tailing!

The recent **dismantling at the hands of Atleti** *(who then went on to lose 3-0 yesterday lol)* has definitely left its mark, and I think the **injury-riddled Barcelona team** is going to struggle out there again today. Their next opponents are Girona, who managed to steady the ship after a terrible start to the league campaign. After a solid run of results, they now sit in midtable. The clashes with their fellow Catalan outfit are always hard fought and Barcelona really struggled the last time these two teams met in the league. Quick refresher, Barcelona needed a last second Araujo goal to secure a narrow 2-1 win, and these teams head into today’s match in a completely different context. **Girona have made huge strides** since then, while **Barcelona have clearly regressed** and it seems that their **defensive vulnerabilities** of their ridiculously high line are finally coming back to bite them. If they already struggled so much then, I can’t imagine how tough of a game Girona is going to throw at them today. Another thing to consider is that **this game will be held at Girona’s ground,** which only levels the playing field even more.\n\n*To clarify, I still think Barcelona are the favorites to win it,* but I can’t see them winning comprehensively. And honestly, as long as Girona cover the spread, I really can’t complain. I’m so happy this game is on a Monday, because what’s a better way to start the week with than watching Barca get grilled? Feeling very confident, so another max unit play it is. Under 2.5 goals is also an option, as well as Axel Witsel to have a shot on target (he scored an absolute worldie in their last H2H), but I prefer taking money lines and spreads, so here we are.

I need a sign that I’m decent at this, even if I won’t attempt it often. \n\nOn the side note: My tactics won’t change by lowering the odds. The goal is to find high odds to play here. I’m trying to keep track of the results in all of the top leagues. We will **always aim for** **long term** gains here and make sure to manage your bankroll. I changed my mind in the end about lowering the units. The approach will rather be to **quit over/under**, if it goes horrible. I will try to post another pick in the coming days. Good luck everyone.\n\nBookie: **Leovegas** and a **5** unit bet. Gamble **responsibly**!\n\nAppreciate all the support:\n\n[https://buymeacoffee.com/longterm123](https://buymeacoffee.com/longterm123)\n\n[paypal.me/LongTerm123](http://paypal.me/LongTerm123)",

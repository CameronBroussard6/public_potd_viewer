This kazakhstan pair played 21 games compared to 6 games of their opponent.. in double i am biased when the pair is the same nationality, for me i think that they can better understand each other and with 21 games played this year they have the dynamics and chemistry.. also, individually they have higher rankings. So ill gladly take it 1.83 when it comes to paper.. i hope they will just play well today..\n\n\nTime: about 9hrs from posting\n\nBol\n\n\nMaybe you can tip me if i made you some money.

      "text": "**Record:** 34-17-1 (+15.33u) \n\n**Last:** (CBB) Arizona ML (1u) - ✅\n\n**POTD:** (CBB) No. 12 North Carolina (-3.5) vs Ohio State\n\n**Start Time:** 3:00 PM ET (CBS)\n\n**Odds:** -115 (DraftKings)\n\n**Units:** 1.5U\n\n**Reasoning:** Typically, when a team races out to a hot start, there’s always fear of a letdown on the horizon. \n\nHowever, don’t expect that to be the case for North Carolina. Although his team sits at an impressive 10-1--with victories over two Top 25 opponents—head coach Hubert Davis actually wants more from his players. \n\n“We’ve gotten off to fast starts and then we’ve had a four- or six-minute lull on both ends of the floor,” said the fifth-year head coach. “The consistency, that’s one of the biggest things with this team, just playing at that high level. We’ve shown that we can be there, but it’s the consistency to be able to do that for a full 40 minutes.”\n\nA Tar Heels squad keeping it in high gear throughout an entire game? That’s a scary thought, for a team that has still managed to go 7-4 ATS on the season, including covering in each three of its last four. Not to mention, North Carolina has managed to accomplish this all without its veteran leader and top perimeter defender Seth Trimble (14.5 PPG, 5.0 RPG), who is set to return to the lineup for the first time since Nov. 7. \n\nHis presence will only bolster an already formidable defensive unit.\n\nThrough 11 games, the Tar Heels rank 6th in opponent field-goal percentage (37.0%), 14th in defensive efficiency (0.901), 14th in scoring defense (64.1 PPGA) and 63rd in opponent three-point percentage (30.3%). Those numbers have been even better as of late, dropping to 60.3 PPGA on 36.3-percent shooting (28.8% from three-point range) over the team’s last three games. The unit will once again be tested against an Ohio State offense that packs a punch, ranking 15th in field-goal percentage (51.2%), 29th in offensive efficiency (1.185), 30th in scoring (87.6 PPG) and 125th in three-point shooting (34.8%). The return of Trimble comes at just the right time for North Carolina, as the Buckeyes (8-2) are led by senior guard Bruce Thornton (21.8 PPG) who shoots 60.2-percent from the field, including a blistering 50.0% from beyond the arc.\n\nOn the other end of the floor, look for the Tar Heels to take advantage of a slumping Ohio State defense. \n\nThus far, the Buckeyes have fared respectively on defense across the board, ranking 61st in opponent three-point percentage (30.2%), 83rd in opponent field-goal percentage (41.8%), 85th in defensive efficiency (0.987) and 135th in scoring defense (72.9 PPGA). However, over their last three contests, those numbers have ballooned to 86.0 points per game on 43.8% shooting (40.3% from three-point range). That should be music to the ears of a North Carolina offense that comes in ranking 68th in offensive efficiency (1.134), 80th in field-goal percentage (47.2%), 85th in scoring (80.7 PPG) and 205th in three-point shooting (32.7%). \n\nFinally, look for rebounding to play an X factor on Saturday afternoon. \n\nPer KenPom, the Tar Heels rank 1st in average height (79.5) and 8th in effective height (+2.3). That advantage has become evident on the glass, as the team ranks 4th in defensive rebounding (29.0 per game), 12th in total rebounding (42.1) and 116th in offensive rebounding (10.0) while ranking 58th in opponent defensive rebounding (20.2), 77th in opponent total rebounding (32.6) and 80th in opponent offensive rebounding (8.2). Conversely, Ohio State ranks 33rd in defensive rebounding (26.3), 111th in total rebounding (37.0) and 290th in offensive rebounding (7.7) while ranking 21st in opponent defensive rebounding (19.1), 34th in opponent total rebounding (31.3) and 115th in opponent offensive rebounding (8.5). However, unfortunately for the Buckeyes, those opponent rebounding numbers have only gotten worse over their last three outings, jumping to 22.7, 37.7 and 10.0 respectively. \n\nLook for Trimble’s return to spark North Carolina to a complete-game effort and get the job done.\n\nBOL if tailing, and as always, please do so responsibly. One bet should not cause you to crash out.",

      "text": "\nOverall record 75W-47L\n\nUnits +56.4\n\nBack with a premier League pick. After missing the last few game weeks just been too busy to really have time to research the games properly.\n\n\nLast pick:\n\nManchester United Vs West Ham \n\nManchester United win & Bryan Mbuemo to have a shot on target.\n\n(1.80) 2.5 units ✖️\n\nSome time ago now but a really unfortunate loss, Mbuemo getting his shot on target in the first half and United much the better team and was winning the match until the last 10 minutes when west ham scored from nowhere, United created more than enough chances to go 2-0 but poor finishing cost them the win here.\n\nToday's pick:\n \nPremier League \n\nBrighton Vs Sunderland \n\nBrighton win and under 4.5 goals \n\n(1.95) 3 units.\n\nBrighton host Sunderland, the long away day for the side from the north of England traveling to the South coast.\n\nSunderland have done exceptionally well this season, nobody could have predicted they would have as many points this season, this is down to a very strong home support and they've picked up a lot of points in their home games, but they have struggled on the road, managing the odd draw here and there, but they have been outperformed in almost every away match this season.\n\n\nSunderland are also the team which faces the biggest loss of players in the league to AFCON, **Sunderland have 6 first team players and 4 regular starters gone on international duty** ,with another 2 players out with injuries and suspensions also.\n\nSunderland are expected to line up very defensively with a 5-4-1 formation and will look to frustrate Brighton for as long as possible. Brighton will have a lot of the ball and chances here as they do against most teams at home, they will miss just 1 player to AFCON in balleba in midfield but still have all their attacking players available.\n\nI think there are too many first team players for Sunderland to survive, when they have already really struggled on the road, and I think eventually Brighton will break them down and get the win in a game that shouldn't have too many goals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**BOL and only bet what you can afford to lose!**",

      "text": "**Record**: 17-11\n\n**Net Units**: +4.88\n\n**Last Pick**: Jason Myers 8+ Kicking Points (-111 on DK) 1u to win 0.9u ❌\n\n**Todays Event** 🏈 NFL Saturday Night Football Packers @ Bears 7:20 PM CST 🏈\n\n**Todays pick:** Kyle Monangai 50+Rushing Yards (+102 on DK) 1u to win 1.02u\n\n**Writeup:** Battle for the NFC North, a heavily injured Packers unit face the Bears in Chicago. Both teams need a win and a little help from Rodgers out in Detroit Sunday night to beat the Lions to clinch. It is sure to be a heated game\n\nD'Andre swift is looking questionable with a groin injury. While I would take his under for my bet, he's played prior weeks after injury, even gong for 90 yards against the Vikings week 11. Rome Odunze and Luther Burden are also out, while Cole Kmet is questionable, giving Caleb Williams less to work with.\n\nMonangai has been an up and coming star especially in the 2nd half of this season, averaging 48.6 yards per game over 10.4 rush attempts, averaging 4.7 Yards Per Carry. He's proven he's a good backup behind Swift. He's cleared this number the last time they played Green Bay in week 14.\n\nPackers defense is top 10, only allowing just over 100 rushing yards per game with 3.9 yards per carry, but they've been declining through the year. They've lost star rusher Myles Garett last week, listed Collin Oliver as out this week, Listen Safety Evan Williams as questionable, and have been missing Devonte Wyatt since Thanksgiving. This defense will have lots of gaps for Monangai to exploit.\n\nFinally, Bears are favored this game. The spread is rather low at -1.5, No doubt since its an important Rivalry game at this point deciding who's the 2nd seed and who's the 7th seed (And possibly who gets home field advantage between them if they matchup in the wild card round). This suggests ample opportunity for rushing, highlighted by the lack of receivers like Odunze and Burden. If early rushes build up tempo and if Swift is limited, I can see Monangai getting plenty of touches and torching this line.\n\n  \nBOL everyone tailing!",

With Palmer back in the lineup I took a bit of a break playing Enzo while he settled in. Now that we've seen 3 Palmer games and Enzo is back to his box crashing self, we're returning to our favorite play at some really nice plus money odds. Enzo 1+ Shot on Target has hit in 9 of his last 10 matches, the only miss being a 3 shot game vs Leeds with Caicedo serving his first of 3 game suspension. I like this play even more now that Caicedo should be back and next to him in the midfield, that will empower Enzo to play further forward and attack the net. \n\nYou all already know why I love me some Enzo, we're backing our guy again for an SOT to start the weekend. We've cashed this play 4 times so far, let's make it 5. BOL and have a great Saturday!",

      "text": "__POTD Record:__ 65-32-1 (+71.23u)\n\n__Previous Pick:__ [__*Pending:*__ Alabama ML (-105), 3.15u](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/s/6QvM4xthZ7)\n\n__Event:__ NFL: Eagles @ Commanders 5pm EST\n\n__POTD:__ Saquon Barkley o75.5 rushing yards (-110), 3.3u to win 3u\n\n__Write Up:__ Despite 3 College Football Playoff games going down tomorrow, it pains me that I’ll be having to take this Saquon prop instead as it’s my favorite play of the weekend. __First let me breakdown the implications this game has on Saquon’s contract incentives.__ The Eagles signed the former Giants RB Saquon Barkley last March to a 3 year, $38 mil contract but rewarded him following his historic 2024 season where he rushed for 2,504 yards, breaking the single season record & leading his new team on its Super Bowl title run. The extension made him the highest paid RB in NFL history & included $36 million guaranteed at signing. Barkley is the first RB making $20+ mil/year & can make an additional $15 mil in incentives & escalators. The contract also includes an annual incentive package. Barkley gets $250k for 1,500 yards from scrimmage. It becomes $500k at 2k yards from scrimmage. If he rushes for 1k yards & Phili wins the NFC ship he gets $250k, that turns to $500k if they win it all. That’s up to $1.5 mil per year in incentives. Also, any incentives earned escalate each remaining year’s salary by the same amount. So say he earns the full incentive package in 2025, his base salaries in 2026, 2027, & 2028 increase by $1.5 mil each year. That leads to a max payout of $15 mil. After his 2024 performance, he’ll now make $33.5 mil, fully-guaranteed. So what does that mean for this week? __There are 3 games left in the regular season & as of right now Barkley sits at 1,213 total yards. To earn his $250k incentive he needs 287 yards. He needs to average 96 total yards per game to hit that mark, with another $250k waiting at 2k yards, plus escalators that bump future salaries by the same amount. As for rushing yards, he sits at 940, meaning he’s just 60 rushing yards away from another 1k season setting up another potential 250k/500k bonus.__ It it all starts this week in a crucial game for playoff implications against a Commanders defense that continues to be one of the most attackable run defenses in football. A team that he absolutely destroyed 3 times last season. \n\nThe Eagles (9-5) are traveling to Maryland to take on the Commanders (4-10) this Saturday afternoon. These two teams have not met this season & their last meeting was on Jan 26 in the NFC ship with Phili crushing them 55-23. This NFC East grudge match was supposed to have huge playoff implications for both teams when the NFL schedule makers set this game for a Saturday Week 16. But Washington limps into this game having already been eliminated from playoffs, & without their Star QB Jayden Daniels who’s out for the season with dislocated elbow. Washington came into the season with high hopes riding the high of an NFC Championship & started the season off 3-2. They then went on to lose 8 in a row, but did earn a 29-21 win last week over the Giants. The Eagles upheld their expectations with a chance to lock in the division title this week & jump up in the NFC standings.\n\n__Barkley’s 3 games vs Washington last year:__\n\nWeek 11: 26 carries, 146 yards, 2 TDs\n\nWeek 17: 29 carries, 150 yards, 2 TDs\n\nNFC Ship: 15 carries, 118 yards, 3 TDs\n\n__*More write up coming*__\n\n__Saquon Barkley o75.5 rushing yards__\n\nAppreciate the love!

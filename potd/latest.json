As big of a spread that is, I expect the Chiefs to dominate this game and feed Pacheco. He has cleared this line in the last 2 games against the Lions and Raiders. He had 77% snap percentage against the Lions (two weeks ago) which to me is a good sign that they are starting to trust him more and more over Kareem Hunt. Something to note but may not be of too much value is that Kareem Hunt was limited in practice on Friday and was a full participant on Saturday but the Chiefs may not feed him as much if Pacheco is running well.",

I expect him to take advantage of a young Jazz team that he has scored 30+ pts against in his last 4 matchups. With Beal and KD gone and Jalen Green still out, the Suns have little offensive power to rely on outside of Booker. While his shot volume is concerning, he has been getting to the ft line at a much higher rate than his career avg indicating aggression.

They beat the clippers in a dominating fashion and held it close against the kings. Although the sample size is low, the pieces feel in place for them to have another explosive home game win against a suns team that doesn‚Äôt look good. They beat the kings in their home opener while the kings were missing sabonis. Since then, they‚Äôve lost to the clippers by 27 and the nuggets by 22. Although betting on trash vs trash is bad, by transitivity and home court advantage, it seems like the Jazz are underpriced here to me",

Brondby, though defend much more solidly (just 14 conceded in the same number of games) and have won the last two head-to-head showdowns against Odense (Most recent h2h was a huge blowout, where Brondby won 5-1)\n\n\nSo, imagine Odense kicking off full of hope, only for Brondby to stroll in, nick control, pick holes in that iffy defence and stroll away happy with the three points. Add in the fact that Brondby maintain momentum and confidence at the moment, while Odense aren‚Äôt punching above their weight right now, and you‚Äôve got all the ingredients for the away win. And yes, Odense might score, but the history and statistics tell me Brondby are likely to come out on top. Considering the odds, im happy to make this my pick of the day.",

(-158 DK) \n\n(NFL Washington Commanders @ Kansas City Chiefs; 8:15 EST)\n\nWrite Up:¬†Keeping it simple is the name of the game! Today we have a matchup against the rising chiefs, who had a tough go at it to start the year but have since gotten back into contender form. We saw last week Rice get most of the quick look‚Äôs in zone coverage, as the Raiders (whose defense is admittedly devoid of talent for the most part) tried to suppress this loaded offense, and failed to do so. Rice recorded a team high 10 targets, hauling in 7 of those targets in route to 42 yards and 2 touchdowns. Though I will be the first to mention, 42 yards is laughable for a game where you receive the ball 7 times. However, this number is bound to go up even if by just 18 yards. Today, in a game where they are playing a former NFC champion hopeful in the depleted Commanders, we should see a display of what the Kansas City Chiefs are capable. With Rice stepping right back into his former roll of the dominate ball toucher (pause) in this offense, this lines value is much to sweet to pass up. Additionally this one is in arrow head, which is one of the biggest advantages in all of football. The spread is also in play here but that‚Äôs for someone else to pick lol. \n\nThis one seems climbable. \n\nTail or fade, BOL!!!",

Suggs could slow down Maxey but not stop him. **When Suggs rotates off to defend other players or takes a breather, Maxey faces Anthony Black and reserve Magic guards. That‚Äôs when he gets the clean looks he needs to hit 4 threes.**\n\nMaxey is in peak form from deep showing no signs of slowing down.

Both sides have developed reputations for playing open, attacking football, and when they face each other, goals tend to flow. Although youth football is often unpredictable, the patterns in both teams‚Äô recent results point strongly toward another high-scoring match.\n\nWatford‚Äôs academy side has been entertaining but inconsistent. They like to build from the back and push fullbacks high, which often leaves gaps when possession is lost. Their last few matches have featured plenty of scoring chances at both ends¬† Watford have conceded at least two goals in several consecutive games, but they also create opportunities through their pace in wide areas. Matches at home have been especially chaotic, with multiple games finishing 3-2 or 4-1 this season. The Hornets‚Äô approach prioritizes development and expression over results, which often leads to open games rather than cautious, defensive setups.\n\nSwansea U21, meanwhile, arrive in better form and with a more refined attacking style. The Welsh side is known for quick ball circulation and strong technical midfielders who can create overloads in the final third. They‚Äôve scored three or more goals in several of their recent outings, including impressive wins away from home. However, like many U21 teams, their defensive concentration sometimes drops, allowing opponents to score even when Swansea are in control of the game. Their matches have averaged well over three goals per game this season, and the over 3.5 line has landed frequently.\n\nThe head-to-head record between these sides supports the idea of another goal-filled match. In the last six meetings, every single game has gone over 2.5 goals, and several have cleared the 3.5 mark comfortably. Swansea‚Äôs U21s have generally had the upper hand, but Watford have managed to score in almost all those fixtures. That combination, both teams scoring, with one side having slightly more quality in attack,¬† often produces wide open contests where momentum swings quickly.\n\nTactically, this matchup suits an over goals scenario. Both teams prefer attacking transitions and aren‚Äôt afraid to commit numbers forward. Set-pieces also play a role; both sides have been vulnerable from corners and free kicks, which can add to the goal total. Neither team is expected to sit back, especially in a developmental league where the emphasis is on playing proactive football.\n\nOf course, caution is always needed when expecting goals in youth matches. Some games can stall if the intensity drops or if finishing is poor. Still, given recent performances and historical trends, there‚Äôs solid reasoning to expect a fast tempo and multiple scoring chances. If either team scores early, the match could easily open up further, as both sides tend to chase goals rather than protect leads.\n\nOverall, while nothing is certain, this fixture consistently produces entertainment. With both teams favoring attack over defense and recent form pointing to plenty of chances, the Over 3.5 Goals line looks like a realistic outcome , not guaranteed, but well within reach if the game follows its usual pattern. Expect an energetic, end-to-end match where youth football‚Äôs unpredictability keeps things lively right to the final whistle.",

Betting 1 unit \n\nWrite up: \n\nI don't particularly like betting on KC receivers and RBs because the offense is very spread out and there are a lot of good options for the team to use. I do, however, like betting on opposing teams facing the Chiefs.\n\nRight now, the Chiefs are on fire and handedly beat the Lions and Raiders. Their defense has also been impressive this year, despite the very apparent lack of DLine talent outside of CJ. I like this pick for a few reasons:\n\nOnly 3 QBs have thrown for 200 yards against KC this season: Herbert, Trevor Lawrence, and Jared Goff who are all much better passers than Mariota with arguably better weapons. I don't expect Mariota to be able to compete on the level of those guys against a very good KC secondary. [Source](https://www.statmuse.com/nfl/ask?q=qb+logs+against+chiefs+with+10%2B+attempts)\n\nMariota has only cleared this line once and it was against the Raiders team that Mahomes just shredded. Mariota also beat it by just 8 yards. Something to note is that in that Raiders game, he only threw 21 times and I expect him to throw a bit more this game.\n\nWashington is also a team that does not like to throw the ball as much as other teams. Neither Mariota nor Daniels has thrown the ball more than 30 times this season aside from one outlier game (42 attempts by JD against GB).\n\nRegarding the Chiefs spread, they're playing like mad men right now and I'd like to continue to ride that wave.  I don't see this game coming within 3 points either as their only losses have been by 3+ points each, meanwhile every game they've won was by a good margin. If the Chiefs somehow don't cover the spread, then that would mean Mariota had himself a great game and therefore both bets would lose so the risk of a hook is low. The addition of the spread is strictly a narrative addition, I don't see a case where one hits and the other doesn't.\n\nIf you disagree with this pick, please comment! Definitely open to criticism, as our money is on the line.\n\nBOL ü§ù",

Slight regression today going 3-5 but getting to the line 3 times was a good sign.  \n\nGood things are that the Pelicans have given up 43 (v Grizzlies) & 26 (v Spurs) free throws, with Herb Jones & Poole in particular a foul concern. In these games Harper, Castle, Morant & KCP all going well over with Vassell going 1-2 from the line. \n\nThe same theory as yesterday applies - his FTA line is 1.5 @ $1.68, his FTM line is 1.5 @ $1.95.

I think B2B are a big one even early in the season but it‚Äôs also an intangible to a degree - every player is different, so I‚Äôm choosing to go ahead with the play.

OVER 228 (-110) BETONLINE\n\nYesterday's pick was another brutal loss. 2 penalties taken away to which the announcers expected penalty and one was downright shocking and VAR only gave the official 1 camera angle to look at which was the worst angle not giving the foul deserving merit. Extremely odd. Throw in 3 more offsides goals with 1 where you couldn't even tell after VAR. Literally by \"a millimeter\" quoted from the announcer. Still  had 3 goals in the first half and an early second half penalty awarded to RM and Mbappe misses the penalty do to a world class save. Goes the remaining 40 minutes without a goal. Absolutely brutal result for a game that easily could've pitched 6+goals.\n\nToday going NBA where this one is set up for a lot of offense. Nuggets have great offense and so can the Wolves. I feel the Nuggets defense isn't great, and while the Wolves have a few very good defenders, its still early regular season where defense can tend to lax and Joker is unguardable. Lakers lit up the Wolves D without Lebron, and the Blazers even put up 114 on them. I think the Wolves' decision to bench Conley and start Donte D at the point favors the overs by adding more pace to the game pushing totals potentially higher and i don't think vegas has caught up to the fact the Wolves are going to be in some really high scoring games because of this. \n\nThe other thing here is that ANT MAN went out with hamstring tightness but reports are saying he's expected to be a go for today. If he gets officially put in the lineup (which I'm hoping and expecting) i think this line bumps up more. It also has a solid shot even without him.\n\nBetonline had the best line for this as other books were already a half point higher or more at the same odds.\n\nI've been having terrible luck lately but just post what i like most and am betting on.

I could easily see Brashard clear his receiving props but he‚Äôs becoming more and more touted this week and that scared me away.\n\nI then stumbled across Marcus‚Äôs longest rush line. Mariota has played starter volume of snaps in Week 3 (Raiders), 4(Falcons), and 7(Cowboys). In those weeks he has 10 carries for 94 yards, averaging 9.4 yards per attempt. He‚Äôs already passed the 11.5 longest rush mark in the 3 games mentioned above with his longest rushes going for 22, 22, and 25. Not to mention he came into the Cowboys game after Jayden Daniel‚Äôs was reinjured and Mariota still hit over this line albeit against a weaker Cowboys defense. Regardless of the inconsistent arm, Mariota can create big gains on the ground when the pocket breaks down, which is something Chiefs do well. \n\nThe Chiefs defense has allowed runs of 12+ yards to quarterbacks in four of seven games this year. Really this could easily have hit in five of the seven as this includes week 2 when Jalen Hurts longest was 11 on the dot. The Chiefs aggressive front often opens escape lanes, especially against mobile passers. With the Commanders expected to play from behind, Mariota should see more snaps in hurry up or broken play situations ‚Äî good spots for a quarterback run. \n\nLastly, Washington‚Äôs offense gets a boost as Terry McLaurin and Deebo Samuel are both expected to play. This gives the KC defense more offensive weapons to focus on covering all game, further opening running lanes. \n\nGiven his ability to evade the pocket and Kansas City‚Äôs track record against 10+ yard rushes to QBs this season, I feel pretty confident we can get home on another POD. \n\nExpected outcome: Mariota longest rush 17 yards",

Scherzer has made one postseason appearance and pitched for 5.2 innings striking out 5 batters, walking 4 batters and letting up 2 runs. I also dont see any way the Chiefs lose this game at home against the Commanders as the Commanders will be without quarterback Jayden Daniels again.

He also ended up defeating David Goffin via retirement to qualify for the main draw. \n\nPatrick Zahraj (ATP #243)'s form has significantly dipped since the start of the year, which saw him make a surprising run to the final of the Pau Challenger. Most recently, he crashed out of the Sioux Falls Challenger in the first round, winning just three games as the favorite. Still, I feel like this is the perfect match for him to regain some confidence and get a win under his belt. \n\nThai-Son Kwiatkowski is actually unranked right now (career high of #181), as he hasn't won a professional singles match in over a year. In fact, it would be a stretch to call him a full-time player at this point, as he has only played three matches all year and now works at a crypto investment company. He's obviously still an extremely high-level player, but the reality is that it's just tough to be competitive at this level when you're only playing a few matches a year. This is especially true when you play the type of game he does, which relies on agility and timing as much as power. \n\nEven if Zahraj is out of form, I still believe that he has the weapons, including a big serve and solid net game, to to take control of this match. A lot of books have this around -150, but I would still play it for 1 unit at those odds. \n\nNote: The [POTD Capper Tracker](https://potd.lol), which you may remember from its Google Sheet days, is finally back in a cleaner, more robust website format!

Shame mbappe couldnt get more goals but we take the W. \n\n\nToday there are not many football/soccer matches and the betis-atletico game looks kinda unpredictable (will probably put a pick for the game in the soccer thread) .

Cobolli looked really solid there, especially the level he showed against Sinner in the second set. If he brings even something close to that, he should be able to win this easily.\n\nMachac is so up and down, and right now it‚Äôs definitely one of those down phases. He hasn‚Äôt beaten a good opponent in a while and his confidence looks shot. Cobolli at least keeps a solid base level and usually gets through his first match at tournaments.\n\nFor me it‚Äôs simple: Cobolli is playing better tennis, he already proved the matchup works for him, and Machac looks like he‚Äôs counting down to the offseason. Straight-sets win feels like the most likely outcome.\n\nGL on your bets\n\nEdit: comfortable win for cobolli in straights ü•≥",

Copped two penalties, had a goal disallowed, and looked like they'd score plenty of times.¬†¬†\n\nIt was also away from home in Dyche's first game.

No one can win them all and if they can, well they aren't on this thread.

Funnily enough the one goal they Conceded was an own goal. Porto have been solid in the Portuguese league not only keeping clean sheets but also holding opposition teams expected goals very low. An average of 0.49 Expected goals against Porto. They are just far too solid defensively and attacking they are also in good form. Scoring 19 goals with an XG of 2.01. Analysing Morierense aren't a bad side, they score goals and win games but against sides in the top 4 they are 0-2 this season. Losing 2-0 and 3-0 and getting dominated. The 2 top sides in the league right now and Porto and Sporting and when Sporting played Morierense they won 3-0 and had over 5XG with Morierense getting 0.16XG. I'm not expecting Porto to hit 5XG they aren't as good going forward as Sporting but they are a lot more solid defensively and that's what they build off. I expect Porto to win 2 or 3-0. \n\nIf my picks help you and you'd like to show your appreciation a thumbs up is perfect, if you'd like to tip which is never expected but always appreciated and does help motivate me for the research here you go.

Over that stretch, they lead the NFL with 390.6 yards per game, they‚Äôre 5th with 29.6 points per game, & they‚Äôve committed only 1 turnover, fewest in the league. The Chiefs have turned the ball over on a league low 3.1% of their possessions.__ This run has put them in the lead for Super Bowl Odd & QB Patrick Mahomes as the favorite for the MVP award. They are coming off a 31-0 shutout vs the Raiders where Mahomes just kept passing. The Chiefs had a 1st down differential 31-0 & the Raiders had 0 1st downs on 30 plays. The Commanders on the other hand will be without their star QB Jayden Daniels & will be starting backup Marcus Mariota. Even with Daniels starting the last 2 games Washington lost both to the Bears & Cowboys, with the Cowboys winning 44-22. That‚Äôs a lot of points, now they‚Äôre facing the hottest offense in the NFL led by Patrick Mahomes. \n\nPat is an elite form. __Mahomes has a higher completion percentage than the week before in 5 straight games. Over the last 4 weeks, he has a 71.3% completion % for 7.9 yards per pass with 11 TD‚Äôs & just 1 INT.__ KC is a heavy favorite at -11.5 in a game where Mahomes is going to light up a weak pass defense. __Washington‚Äôs defense has allowed a league high 8.3 yards per pass attempt, the most yards per completion (12.9 yards), & a 5.6% TD rate (22nd). They‚Äôve allowed 54 plays of 15 or more yards, (2nd worst). They have a takeaway on 4.1% of opponent possessions (2nd worst). In the last 4 week they‚Äôve given up 2.59 points per drive (27th).__ To make things worse for Washington, Dorance Armstrong was just put on the IR, who led the defense in sacks (6) & pressures (22). __Which won‚Äôt be good vs a KC offense that has reached the red zone on 14.9% more drives than their opponents (highest in NFL). The Chiefs are now 2nd in the NFL in scoring rate per drive (52.3%) & points per drive (2.86).__ This has been due to the rate at which their passing & the success. __KC leads the NFL in success rate on passing plays over the past 4 weeks (59.5%), while dropping back at a 72.1% rate in neutral game scripts (highest rate).__ Last game their offense was at a completely different level with 3rd year WR Rashee Rice returning from suspension.\n\nPlaying in his first game since Week 4 of last season, Rashee Rice made an immediate impact. __Rice caught 7 of 10 targets for 42 yards with 2 TD‚Äôs & he was on the field for only 47.5% of the dropbacks with Mahomes, but he was targeted on 52.6% of his routes with 2.21 yards per route run.__ The Chiefs scored a TD in all 4 series he played rotating in. Head coach Andy Reid said on Friday: ‚ÄúWe set out to get him to 40% or around that area‚Ä¶ but I think he can keep his numbers going up.‚Äù Rice is just the 2nd player for KC to earn double digit targets in a game all season & he did so in only 2.5 quarters. __Over his last 10 games, Rice is averaging 2.91 yards per route run & 10 with a target rate of 31.3% of his routes. The last time he was targeted on less than 20% of his routes was Week 11 of 2023.__ Now he gets a juicy matchup not only vs the entire defense, but the specific corner that will be covering him. __Rice played 43% of his routes in the slot. Washington CB Mike Sainristil is their corner who covers the slot & he is allowing the 4th most yards per coverage of any slot defender (min. 50 slot snaps). In fantasy football, they give up the most points per game to the slot (15.7).__ Rice was utilized on a lot of short passes last week & it felt like he was open every play. There were designed screens, there were flip plays, & there were back shoulder timing plays. __Rice averaged 0.8 air yards per target. It was 4.8 and 5.2 air yards in the previous 2 seasons.__ Both the routes and depth to pick up as the weeks continue. __I prefer reception over yards but it should be mention Washington is surrendering a 70.8% percent completion rate on the road, as well as 14.1 yards per catch to wide receivers specifically.__ He also didn‚Äôt have much competition for target. Their WR2 Xavier Worthy is in a bit of a slump since producing 121 yards in his return from injury in Week 4. In his 3 games since then, he's totaled only 125 yards & 1 TD. The 2024 1st rd pick‚Äôs target share dipped to just 11.4%, the lowest it has been in a full game since Week 9 of last year. As for Travis Kelce, he had just 3 receptions on 3 targets. __Here are the target shares from the other pass catchers last week in Rice‚Äôs 1st game back: Brashard Smith - 14.3%, Xavier Worthy - 11.4%, Marquise Brown - 11.4%, Travis Kelce - 8.6%.__ Rice is going to get open a ton & Pat will be looking for him.\n\nThe Chiefs play the Bills next week & it‚Äôs clear Pat wants to make up for lost time with his top WR & get back up to speed. With KC back to their scoring ways, Rice‚Äôs instant involvement will only grow.\n\n__Rashee Rice over 6.5 receptions__\n\nAppreciate the love!

Still up 9 units. On to the next. Let‚Äôs get to 10 wins. \n\n**POTD** Ohwaki Yui ML vs Kawagishi Nana (+137) 4u (bet365) ‚ùå fuck\n\n27.10.2025, 01:30, Makinohara ITF, Qualification - round of 16, hard\n\n6:30PM MST (**starts in approximately 15 minutes**) 9:30AM local Japan time 10/27. Apologies for the short notice, was hoping the thread would be posted sooner. Tennis matches are often delayed beyond the official start time, sometimes by hours, so might still be some time to catch it.\n\nOhwaki has been on an absolute tear as of late, winning 10 of her last 11 matches. Her lone loss during this time period was to a good player, Kayla McPhee, who has a hard court record of 66-9 this year and has been as high as the top 200 in rankings. Very impressively, Ohwaki avenged this defeat against McPhee a month later in straight sets, as a +400 dog.\n\nThat was last week, and the very next match after that, she annihilated a certain Kawagishi Nana (6-1, 6-3). The same Kawagishi who‚Äôs playing in the match we‚Äôre betting on today.\n\nTheir head to head record is 1-1 (Ohwaki lost to her back in April), but she was in pretty awful form at that time going off of her results around then. She had failed to qualify in her previous 4 matches prior to the defeat, losing in the first two rounds of qualifying in 5 straight tournaments, including the match vs. Kawagishi.\n\nThis is in stark contrast to her current form, in which she is dominating. In the first qualifying round of this tournament she double-bageled her opponent. That‚Äôs (6-0, 6-0) for those unaware, and it‚Äôs a good indicator that she‚Äôs going to destroy Kawagishi again today.\n\nKawagishi has been in dreadful form. In her previous two matches before this tournament, she lost as the favorite twice‚Äîto an unranked player as a -450 favorite and then to Ohwaki. Her record on outdoor hard this year is 13-20 and she has been getting bounced in the first two rounds of the vast majority of her tournaments this season.\n\nTo summarize: Ohwaki is in excellent form, just handily beat her opponent last week, and her opponent is in poor form. At +137, this is very good value. She should be the favorite at more like -150 to -200 in my opinion. ITF women‚Äôs tennis can be unpredictable, so be warned, but I like this bet.",

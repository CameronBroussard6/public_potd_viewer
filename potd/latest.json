They are flying. Maresca tactically is very superior to Regis Le Bris. Also, Chelsea depth is amazing, plus, fatigue wouldn’t be a concern because of the easy 5-1 win against a 10-men Ajax.\n\n- Chelsea average 5.8 corners per game with 57% possession, while Sunderland concede 4.7 corners, favoring Chelsea for most corners.\n\n- Sunderland has injuries to key defenders (Alderete) and a short backline expose Sunderland to Chelsea’s set-piece prowess (8 goals from set pieces, 6 from corners).",

Brest have been competitive this season and usually push forward at home, which could leave space behind for PSG to exploit. Still, Brest’s defensive structure might slow the tempo and keep things tighter than expected. The over 3 Asian handicap could land if the game opens up in the second half.",

St James Park is a tough stadium to play at, the last five games here (Including Champions League and EFL competitions) 3W from 5 with the two defeats coming from club giant’s Arsenal and Barcelona (Both ended 1-2). \n\nThey have played 4 games at home this EPL season, losing and conceding in 2 of the games (Arsenal and Liverpool) and were able to pull off a win to nil against Nottingham and Wolves. On the otherhand, Fulham have lost their last 3 away games by 2 goals. \n\nThe Toon’s did have a midweek game in the Champions League but I feel their squad depth is enough to get them through this week’s fixture. \n\nI strongly feel this Newcastle side will be able to get a lead and hold on for the win. All the best to those who follow! 🤞🏻",

The Hornets have had two days off, and last season when coming off two days rest LaMelo averaged 7 FGM on 19 attempts. We know that LaMelo is prone to inefficiency, and with the Sixers also allowing the 6th least FGA per game last season and LaMelo only going above 17.5 FGA vs this team once in his entire career, I expect him to shoot below the mathematical 47% it should theoretically require him to reach this number, given that’s he’s failed to hit that mark in 80% of his last 20 regular season games and notably relies on a heavy diet of difficult shots. I expect the gameplan to be for guys like Brandon Miller, Miles Bridges, and Kon Knueppel to take advantage of Philadelphia’s questionable wing defense.",

      "text": "Record: 1-0\n\nLast 10: ✅\n\nNet Units: +2.0  \n\nBasketball | NBA | Thunder v Hawks | 7:30PM | Eastern Time\n\nPOTD: NBA: Thunder:  Dort O2.5 3pt Made: +102 (1u to win 1u) FD\n\nThis is just another one of those “gut” plays like my last SGA 1Q under ✅. Just have a feeling that Dort is gonna show up tonight. There was a little data to indicate a possible slow start for SGA in my last POTD, as there is in this case with Dort, but you never really know which way it’s gonna go on those 1Q bets. Thankfully, this one is for the full game! \n\nLast season Dort’s first 4 games featured 3PM/3PA of 0/2, 1/3, 4/6, 6/8. He started out slow, and got hot a few games into the season. So far this season he’s 0/8, 1/4, and both of those games went 2OTs.  Dort could be counted on for 10-12PPG last season, and so far he’s had two duds to start off his post-NBA Champion career.\n\nI think Dort might hit 4-5 3PM in this game, especially considering the Hawks’ perimeter D isn’t exactly known to be elite…\n\nSince I haven't noticed as many 3PM/3PA as usual from Dort, and with the injury riddled team that the Thunder will be playing with later tonight, I expect Dort to air it out every time he’s open. And he’s probably gonna get some looks against a below average defensive unit in the Hawks. Somebody has gotta score, right? \n\nIn his last 5 against the Hawks he’s put up 6/11, 4/6, 2/3, 2/5, and 3/6 3PM/3PA. He's also scored in double figures in points in 8/10 career matchups vs the Hawks. I feel pretty good about Dort O2.5 3PM tonight. \n\nAlso expect more minutes for Wiggins in this one with Jalen still out and Wallace likely out as well. So you could sprinkle a little something on Wiggins’ points over as well. \n\nAs far as SGA goes, I haven’t seen the line yet, but if it’s -110 or better, I wouldn’t hate a 1Q under as he’s historically underperformed in 1Qs vs the Hawks, but I also wouldn’t be surprised if he puts up 15 in the 1Q and another 40 on the night considering the Thunder injury report. The burden falls on the superstar in these situations. I hate that line of 33.5. So fucking sharp, but if you put a gun to my head, I pick over. \n\nPersonally, I’ll be live betting SGA looking for a O29.5, hopefully prior to the half, before I pull the trigger on his points prop. \n\nGood luck!",

The hawks in their first two games ranked 29th in the league for defense. Although the Hawks held the magic guards to decently low scoring games, they don’t compare to SGA. While SGA’s stats have been boosted due to the extra minutes, coming off a rest day I expect the thunder to do quick work against the hawks. The hawks have historically given higher amount of free throws to opposing teams, SGA will likely be able to capitalize off this quite well. The hawks are severely missing front court and back court presence, and as such I believe SGA will cook the hawks tomorrow",

With that kind of start, a 40 pt performance seemed well within reach. \n\nBut as the game progressed, Giannis shifted into facilitator mode, and the expected usage I anticipated simply didn’t materialize. Cole Anthony became the story off the Milwaukee bench, erupting for 23 points. Something he’s known for doing while he was with the Orlando Magic. \n\nI can’t hate that Giannis was smart enough to recognize Anthony’s play and make him keep delivering. We still got the win after all that but something to keep a note of for future reference. \n\nNBA | CHI Bulls @ ORL Magic | 7PM EST\n\nNext Pick: **Franz Wagner Under 23.5 Pts** (-110 on Bet365) Bet 3u to Win 2.73u\n\nWhile Wagner went over this line in both season games thus far (27 vs Atlanta, 24 vs Miami), this matchup and situational dynamics favor the under tonight and here’s why.\n\nWith Coby White sidelined for the Bulls they will rely heavily on defenders like Dosunmu and their length to slow down Orlando’s perimeter players. I expect the Bulls defensive game plan to lock down the wings (Wagner, Bane) and force Banchero to beat them inside.\n\nLooking at Wagner history against the Bulls: March 2025 he scored 18pts 6-17 shooting. In fact **he’s only averaged just 16.5ppg against bulls last season on 35%fg.**\n\nFatigue is also an angle I’m looking at here as Wagner logged 35+ minutes in both games so far this season and **this game is a b2b.**\n\nToo many factors to not think the under is appealing here, expect Bane and Banchero to share the usage enough to keep Wagner under his total points for this game.\n\nIf tailing, only risk what you can afford to lose! Best of luck family!",

The Virginia Cavaliers are facing off against the North Carolina Tar Heels and the Bill Belichick era has been a nightmare in Chapel Hill. They are off to a 2-4 start with their only wins coming on buy games against Charlotte and Richmond and their offense has looked like a joke all season. Quarterback play has been abysmal and the Tar Heels rank 123rd in scoring offense averaging just 18 points per game. Virginia on the other hand comes into this one 6-1 riding a 5 game win streak with wins over Florida State, William and Mary, Stanford, Louisville and Washington State. I expect them to handle the Tar Heels and shutdown their offense in this one. I think the Tennessee Volunteers bounce back after last weeks loss against Alabama as the Volunteers are 5-2 with their two losses coming against top SEC teams Alabama and Georgia and even though Kentucky put up a good fight against Texas (who I think is the most overrated team in the SEC and maybe the nation) I dont think their offense will be able to keep up with the high scoring and uptempo Volunteers offense. The Vols are averaging 45 points per game on the year while Kentucky averages 22 and they have failed to score over 14 poins in three straight SEC contests. Kentuckys only wins this year have been on buy games as well against Toledo and Eastern Michigan so I dont see them beating a superior opponent in this one.\n\nPrediction: 31-24 Tennessee, 27-17 Virginia\n\nLast pick:⚾️Dodgers F5 ML🅿️They got off to a good start but ends up in a push. Better than a loss, onto the next.\n\nBest of luck to everyone tailing and remember to bet responsibly!

Dinamo had 75% possession, 3 times the number of shots, 2x shots on target and 3x corners.  Complete domination yet they simply could not win. Too many of those days are occuring.\n\n**New Event:** – Bulgarian League – Levski Sofia vs Dobrudzha\n\n**Pick:**  Levski Sofia ML & Both teams to score “NO” @ 1.70 (Usual 3 units)\n\nTirade time.  As much as any of you who have tailed my picks may be pissed at recent losses, noone is more upset than myself.  Not because of the money losses as I do this for fun and am not stupid enough to get in too deep, but because I am very selective with the picks I do writeup.  My goal is to get to a 70% win rate on POTD, so I am trying to be extremely selective in finding bets with a high probability of success.  I don't post every day unless something catches my eye.  But unfortunately this is sport and anyone can beat anyone as we have seen time and again especially this year.  All I can do is side with the better team and hope the match plays out as its supposed to.\n\nThat brings me this pick, in Bulgaria's Parva League. The best team in the league, Levski Sofia, sits alone at the top of the 16 team table with 29 points and a +15 goal differential after 12 matches played.  They are hosting Dobrudzha, the worst team in the league, last on the table with 7 points and a -10 goal differential.\n\n* Sofia has not allowed a goal by a bottom half side in all their home matches this season.\n* Sofia has only allowed 3 goals in their last 7 home matches overall. They have had 4 shutouts.\n* Last week Sofia won 3-1 while visiting 5^(th) place Cherno More.\n* Dobrudzha has scored 2 goals in their last 6 away matches this season. They have been shutout 4 times.\n* Last week Dobrudzha hosted 2^(nd) placed CSKA and lost 1-0.\n\nWhy would I post a pick so weird? Well full disclosure, I know nothing about the Bulgarian league. What I do know, however, is that teams atop of a league playing teams at the bottom of a league usually ends in a shutout, and an ugly one. I have been playing this strategy myself for some time with success. This holds true for leagues where the disparity in quality and monetary value is abysmal. In this case Levski Sofia is worth around 30 million Euro, while Dobrudzha is worth less than 6 million Euro. That 5x difference is huge in the transfer market and talent acquisition.\n\nThis one should not even be close. But based on my recent results, apparently being on the better side means nothing.",

We will never know if the outcome would have been different if that penalty had not been given, but Milan definitely let Pisa stay in that game and were lucky to come away with 1 point.\n\nApologies to those that tailed, I am going to shift back to my 2 leg parlay strategy for today’s pick.\n\nLet’s see if we can bounce back with our Saturday POTD.\n\nOn to the next💰\n\nSaturday’s Pick\n\nGerman Bundesliga 2 & Norwegian First Division\n\nArminia Bielefeld v Elversberg (6:00 AM CT) & Lillestrøm v Ranheim (9:00AM CT)\n\n2 Leg Parlay  // Elversberg +1 & Lillestrøm -1\n\n(+120 on Fanduel) - 3.5 units to win 4.2u\n\nAlright, I really went down the soccer rabbit hole today after a very disappointing outcome from AC Milan today. I had originally set up a 2-leg alt line college football parlay for two of the games I’ll be watching on the Saturday slate, but ended up going deep into the various european soccer divisions. After watching Pisa nearly take down AC Milan, I got curious about the lower level divisions in Europe. Pisa played in Serie B last season which means they were promoted to Serie A for this season, so they were a top finisher in Serie B. If they were able to compete like this, with a perennial Serie A powerhouse, I started to wonder how they performed against lower level teams in Serie B. \n\nMy line of questioning: Is their a bigger difference in teams at the top/bottom of a table when comparing a first league (La Liga, PL, Bundesliga, Serie A, etc.) vs their second league counterpart? If Pisa can compete with AC Milan, did bottom of the table teams compete with Pisa last season in Serie B? Do smaller market matches with less $ wagered on them, tend to end more in line with expected pre-match outcomes?\n\nSo I spent a few hours today digging through all of the second tier leagues across Europe learning about a ton of random teams from cities and towns that I’ve never heard of. It was honestly a pretty interesting day and I decided that rather than use my 2-leg NCAAF play for my POTD, I would give these a test and see how they do!\n\nThe first match that I found was Arminia Bielefeld v Elversberg from the German Bundesliga 2. I looked at a bunch of the stats from both of these teams and really felt like Elversberg should win this one. Although they are away, Elversberg has a lead defending rate of 78% (they have only conceded an equalizer 2 times after taking the lead 9 times). In games where the other team took the lead, 67% of the time they scored an equalizer. To me this means that they capitalize on leads, and are able to find a goal when needed to bring them back into a match. In terms of non-crucial scoring, they’ve scored 11 non-crucial goals (extend their lead, reduce opponent lead) and only conceded 1 non-crucial goal (decreased existing lead, or increased opponents existing lead).  Their form is great and they have scored 22 times this season, only conceding 6 times. Although they are away, I couldn’t pass up +1 at -175 for the first leg of my parlay.\n\nThe second match that I keyed in on was from the Norwegian First Division (which is actually the second division… weird I know). Table leaders Lillestrøm are hosting Ranheim in a tale of two very different teams. When I looked at Lillestrøm on a map, it’s only about 20 minutes from where my sister used to live in Oslo and I spent a ton of time visiting over the last 5 years. \n\nAnyway, this Lillestrøm team basically destroys every team they play at home. They have won 85% of their matches at home, while drawing the other 15%. In 13 matches at home they have 35 goals and have only conceded 7 times. In the last match between the two teams, Lillestrøm won 4-0 and that was at Ranheim. Ranheim is a middle of the table squad and has a -4 goal differential over 27 matches. Sounds middle of the road? Sure. Well, Lillestrøm has a +63 goal differential over 27 matches. Give me Lillestrøm -1 over Ranheim for the second leg of my parlay.\n\nBest of Luck to those who tail, as well as those who don’t! Please make sure to bet responsibly and only bet what you can afford to lose.\n\nI generally spend a couple hours a day combing through as much action as possible from across the world, in order to find value. I do have my own bankroll behind all my picks, but if you are feeling generous, any tips will just go towards enjoying a cold, 22 oz lager at the bar down the street (they're only $4.50 each during happy hour).\n\n[Sponsor a cold, 22 oz 🍺](https://buymeacoffee.com/ceaselessaction)",

Still, he was able to get the job done in a quarter to two hours. \n\nInteresting Paris qualifying matchup between two talents who aren't playing their best tennis right now. Comesana is one of those rare Argentinians who is actually as comfortable on hard courts as he is on clay, though his biggest upset of the season (a three-set scalp of Alexander Zverev in Rio) came out the dirt.  He doesn't have a ton of experience indoors, but he comes off two straight weeks playing in these conditions, in which he went 1-1 against David Goffin (who has been playing better tennis as of late) and lost a close match to a peaking Collignon. Comesana's Tennis Insights performance rating exceeded 6.5 in all of those matches, a sign that his level is reasonably high right now. \n\nIn comparison, Luca Van Assche, a 21-year-old who appeared at the Next Gen Finals has often been named as one of the top French prospects. However, his form has taken a bit of a nosedive this year, as injuries and inconsistency have sent him spiraling down to the Challenger Tour. He's not a bad indoor player, and seemed to be rounding into form recently with an Olbia Challenger title, but a recent loss to Sacha Gueymard Wayenburg in Brest (6.08 performance rating). means that I'm not too confident about his level coming into this match. Van Assche is a smart player who isn't afraid to take the ball early despite lacking heavyweight power. However, Comesana gets a lot more pop out of his serve, and tends to cause trouble to players who fall into orthodox patterns with the sheer variety of shots he can pull off. Finally, Teelo's AI model gives Comesaña a 65.2% chance of winning here (as compared to 50.0% implied here), which inspires further confidence that these odds don't make a ton of sense. Comesaña did get quickly pushed down from an opening price of around -140 to even money, which is why I wouldn't put a huge stake on this. However, I believe that buying the dip is worth a unit, as the opening price was fair in my eyes.  \n\nNote: The [POTD Capper Tracker](https://potd.lol), which you may remember from its Google Sheet days, is finally back in a cleaner, more robust website format!

With no major injuries or suspensions reported for either team, both sides should be near full strength and ready to push for goals. Additionally, their head-to-head history supports a high-scoring trend — the last six meetings have all seen both teams score and at least three goals in total.

In terms of eye test he is even better than what the statistics make him out to be, during the NRL season his trys are nothing short of brilliant also winning try of the year he creates trys out of situations that seem unrealistic.   \n\nLastly this could play as a doubled edged sword which is the reason why I think the pick is a bit short leashed is that he is in a team with superstars in all positions who smell trys just as much as him like Walsh, Addo-Carr and Staggs however the reason why I still decided to back this pick for my debut is due to the playstyle of his teammates we saw from this season’s NRL that Reece Walsh loves to send deep balls past the centre straight to the winger for a try however not only that I can imagine the Kangaroos will constantly try capitalising on one of Mark Nawaqanitawse’s greatest strengths his vertical which I think he will be the main target of, which will come from the one and only Nathan Cleary.      \n\nWith his debut for the Kangaroos aswell as the amazing lineup he is surrounded by, I will gladly take my chances at Mark Nawaqanitawase to score a try.

It looked like we were cruising with the Bhoys applying more pressure to find an equaliser but it was all she wrote in the first half for corners. Celtic then got two corners within 3 minutes at the 61st (which they both scored from) and we finally won in the 75th, ending the match on 9 corners and a 2-1 win to the Hoops. BTW what a player Tounekti is, absolutely tormented Graz’s RB but has issues with end product yet will be on my watch list for sure.\n\nKenin has had a poor year all things considered, bowing out early in the majority of tournaments and except for a final in Charleston (+ a decent tournament in Dubai) hasn’t picked up many impressive wins. That was until the QF’s here in Tokyo where she fought back from 5-2 down in the third set against Alexandrova (saving MP’s in the process). Her backhand caught fire at the end and will give her confidence going into this match. Bencic has had a very successful return from maternity leave, winning Abu Dhabi and reaching Wimbledon semis to make it to world No.13. Despite this she’s had some pretty shocking exits at times which includes an absolute blow-out at the hands of Sofia in Charleston and will be made to work in this match-up. Kenin has averaged a 5.1% double faults rate on hard courts over the past year. Using both players’ serving/returning + ELO stats I get an expected 3 double faults across 22 games from the American.\n\nThat gives this play an estimated 72% chance of winning.

After a horrid start with a 3rd minute goal from a rebound it looked as if we were in for a tough bet from the get go. An early goal changes game plans and really was the worst possible scenario for our bet.\n\nThis was followed by a 15th minute goal from a corner before the game really had time to settle. This corner was 1 of 3 awarded roughly until the 60th minute mark. We stayed in the bet until the 90th minute as Leeds were stubborn for a long time and held out well to restore hope.\n\nHowever, West Ham managed an amazing last minute goal from Bowen's ball into Matheus Fernandes (an unlikely header of the ball) which killed our bet.\n\nI feel my judgement was okay here contrary to what people may believe. West Ham were pretty toothless once again and that extremely early goal really was a dagger.

Game will start in 8 hours roughly.\n\nPerth Glory will travel to Melbourne for the second round of the A-League after a 2-2 draw with Wellington Pheonix (who had to travel 7 hours to get there). Perth only retained 29% possession in the game, opting for a counter attacking approach.\n\nThey are notoriously bad travellers, and only managed 4 wins from 26 games last year which was good enough for last place in the league. Comparatively, City finished 2nd on the table and were eventual Champions, defeating Victory in the Grand Final.\n\nCity managed a 1-1 draw away from home against Western Sydney in the opening round (who I think will be really strong this year). They also played midweek in the Asian Champions League managing a 2-1 come from behind victory against Thai side Buriram, showing good character in both games to be down and manage results.\n\nCity's defence should be too good for Perth. I can't see Perth getting more than a goal in this game, although I do worry a touch about veteran striker Adam Taggart who managed a goal last week but comparatively Max Caputo is in great form for City, scoring in the last 2 matches. The striker has just returned from the Under 20's World Cup with 2 goals to his name in the competition as well.\n\nI like the fact that City have a bit more game time in their legs having played more competitive games recently than Perth. Overall I think the class of City is too much for them, and they'll be hungry to get their first win on the board in the league against a starting 11 of aging players that managed 29% possession at home against a jet lagged Wellington.\n\n\\-\n\n**12 wins in 16 bets**, well done to any followers. No pressure whatsoever, but if you are willing, any help will go a long way.\n\nBuy me a coffee! - [https://www.paypal.com/ncp/payment/K4C6AK2VCT9EJ](https://www.paypal.com/ncp/payment/K4C6AK2VCT9EJ)\n\n**Thanks, GL**",

Norm just didn’t shoot much cause he didn’t have to. Bam killed Memphis in the first and while Powell was out, Jovic, Fontecchio and Jacquez put them up 40. Maybe Miami is actually legit, maybe Memphis is the worst team in the league, or maybe it was a fluke both ways. We move on!\nPick: Aleksandar Rakic ML -112 (FanDuel)\nEvent: UFC 321 Main Card 2:00 PM EST.\nExplanation: I was between this and 3-4 other picks on UFC 321 but landed on Rakic for a number of reasons.\n\nI’ll start with the negatives first. Rakic is on a 3 fight losing streak. He’s facing 15-0 undefeated Azamat Murzakanov. Rakic has been KO/TKO’d twice in those last 3 while Azamat has KO/TKO’d 4 of his 5 UFC opponents. Rakic is a bit chinny and Azamat has late round power that could steal the fight.\n\nHowever, if you look into the numbers you’ll get a much fuller story. Rakic has lost 3 straight to 3 former titleholders in Jan Blachowicz, Jiri Prochazka and Magomed Ankalaev. Against Jan he was a win away from a title shot and had just dominated the 2nd round before his knee gave out early in the third, requiring him to take 2 years off. He came back last year to face Jiri in a fight in which he looked incredibly sharp in. Rakic dominated with leg kicks in round 1 and 2, hard enough to arguably fold any other fighter in the division but the insanely durable Jiri. He’d get caught late in the 2nd and TKO’d but looked great despite a 2 year layoff. He’d quickly turn around to face Ankalaev in another fight he’d look good in. He’d win a close round 1 before losing round 2 more decisively. If you remember his coaches were feeding him terrible information and he fought a solid but careful third round before losing 29-28 on all scorecards.\n\nRakic could’ve won all 3 of those fights which is a big what if but shows his position as being closer to the elite of the light heavyweight division than being another can. \n\nRakic has a number of things in his favor. He’s massive compared to Azamat as he’ll be around 6’4 230 on fight day compared to Murzakanov being closer to 5’10 220. His leg kicks are elite and should be a massive advantage against a guy who he has a big reach advantage on and an athleticism advantage. He’s also fully capable of fighting a boring, controlling fight where he mixes in wrestling and controls the range with his kicks and jabs.\n\nHow can he lose? Murzakanov has big time power. He’s aggressive and can walk through shots to get in range and bomb overhands through Rakic’ guard. \n\nMy prediction is a decision win for Rakic. I don’t think it’ll be sweat free and there will probably be a moment where Rakic gets hit but I think he’s just much more talented as mixed martial artist. Rakic is desperate for his first win in over 4 years and has switched camps to his home country as opposed to the knuckleheads who might’ve thrown his last fight. \n\nRakic could get a TKO/KO set up by leg kicks but I think the undefeated Murzakanov will be overwhelmed by the pressure as opposed to jumping into the fire. Expect a slow fight of mostly stand up, if Murzakanov gets into a clinch then you could see Rakic drop for a single leg and take him down, another strength of his. He should know that if he keeps the fight on his terms he’s winning 99/100 times and has the skill to keep it there for at least 2/3 rounds.",

They beat the hell out of a highly ranked Illinois team, 63-10 a few weeks back. They beat the hell out of Michigan State 38-13 (Which should have been a cover but Michigan State has some sneaky sneaky stuff going on over there in regards to spreads and head scratching late game decisions), and handedly dispatched their 2 other OOC opponents for an average win margin of 60+. The only team that scratched and clawed was Old Dominon in Week 1, which is a bit of an outlier.\n\n\n\nLast year at home they beat the hell out of UCLA at the Rose Bowl, and ran over every other team that was lesser than them all season long. Their insane point differential was one of the biggest reasons they made the playoffs last year in spite of their pretty sub-par SOS.\n\n\n\nUCLA is not good. If you’d like a full breakdown on my thoughts of UCLA’s recent success you can look at my pick from last week’s UCLA vs Maryland game. A lot of it still holds true, and they weren’t able to cover against Maryland at home, looking extremely vulnerable in the second half of that game.\n\n\n\nI’m keeping it simple. Curt Cignetti is fired up for this matchup against a Cinderella story UCLA team and is pretty excited to curb stomp them in front of 52,000 IU fans. UCLA doesn’t have the firepower to compete with Indiana, and they don’t have the ability to sneak up on them because they put themselves on alert with any teams that face them in the future by winning 3 straight. Indiana will take this game seriously and beat the piss out of UCLA. I like Indiana first half cover as well, removing the chance of a backdoor cover, which is always a possibility with a big spread like this. I think they come out strong early to set the tone.",

UK time 15:00\n\nMan we've had some bad luck this season, united score when the play should stop for a head injury and Liverpool then have countless really good chances which they miss, they definitely should have won that game. \n\nThis leads me on to this pick, united are still not a very good team. They've finally won two PL games in a row for the first time in forever and I can see them coming back down to earth here. They didn't impress me against Liverpool despite winning and I made this same pick for the same fixture last season, Brighton won with ease. I don't expect it be that comfortable here but the odds are far too good. Until united prove they are a good team and can beat the likes of Brighton regularly then I will continue to bet against them which has won me a lot of money over the last couple of seasons. \n\nBrighton are a very decent side, they've beaten man city and Newcastle this season and have a great young coach who consistently gets Brighton performing well in big games. Following a good win last week I can see them getting a result here too, be that a draw or a win",

Ross Smith looks primed to take down him by a couple of legs tomorrow…his recent form and stats just stack up stronger across the board. Smith’s averaging around 97 this season, a few points higher than Gurney’s 93, and he’s been throwing heavier scores with far more 180s (0.36 per leg vs 0.24). Over a long best-of-19, that kind of power scoring builds real momentum. Add in a slightly sharper checkout rate (42.5% to Gurney’s 40.8%) and better accuracy on his doubles, and it’s easy to see how Smith can edge out the crucial legs that turn a tight game into a 10-8 or 10-7 type win.\n\nMomentum’s also firmly on Smith’s side…he’s fresh off a red-hot run in the Players Championships where he hit multiple nine-dart legs and looked full of confidence. Gurney’s got the experience, sure, but he’s not been as consistent lately, often dipping below his best under pressure. Across a long format where scoring power and rhythm matter most, Smith’s steady averages and knack for clutch finishing should let him break free late and close it out by a comfortable two-leg margin.\n\nSide note the only reason, IMO, that Gurney even is in round 2 is because Gerwyn Price couldn’t hit a fucking double to save his life. Price went fucking 3/17 on check out and average a, in this level, pathetic 91 average. GURNEY averaged LESS at 90, the checkout of 6/11 is the ONLY reason he won. Price had an off day and I don’t expect Gurney to come out of the boonies and win tomorrow.\n\nAs always, BOL, PLEASE DON’T OVER BET THIS, I know I’m on a “heater” 🤞 we make it 8 in a row tomorrow, but there’s still plenty of darts in the season. Don’t think this sport isn’t subject to dumb shit because I lost big on Gurney beating Price yesterday….\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/64n8p28yz4xf1.jpeg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4905c0176b3e0f3e66422a4f7b34a6f91a9bbd0b",

They just destroyed Club Brugge 4-0 in the Champions League on Wednesday night, and before that beat Dortmund 2-1 in their last league match. Harry Kane is the main reason for their incredible goal-scoring form with 12 goals in just 7 Bundesliga games this season, and he has 20 goals in all competitions already, showing he scores in almost every single match. The team also has Luis Díaz with 5 goals and Michael Olise with 4 goals supporting Kane, so goals can come from anywhere on the pitch.\n\nBorussia Mönchengladbach are sitting at the bottom of the table with the worst record in the league, having scored only 6 goals all season while letting in 15 goals in just 7 games. They have zero wins, lost 3-1 to Union Berlin last weekend, and their defense is so weak that Bayern should score multiple goals easily. Bayern have already hit over 2.5 goals in six of their seven Bundesliga matches this season with scores like 6-0, 5-0, 4-1, and 4-0, proving they almost always score at least three goals per game. With Gladbach's terrible defense and Bayern's unstoppable attack led by Kane, this match should easily finish with three or more goals from Bayern. \n\n\nIf you found these picks helpful, tips or donations are greatly appreciated as they support the time and effort I put into creating them: [buy me a beer🍻](https://buymeacoffee.com/hercules.son.of.zeus)",

I wasn't able to watch the match, so can't comment too much, but from the extent highlights I've watched, Victory looked rubbish. In hindsight, if there's no bet I like, I probably should just skip the day and save the record. \n\nWe move on.\n\nToday's Pick: Lillestrom to win v Ranheim IL and o2.5 goals. 5u @ 1.61\n\nPick: Today's Pick: I had a whole writeup for Coventry -0.75 but I'm basically going to milk this Lillestrom cow until it stops giving milk. \n\nThey're the best team in the Norwegian second division by a massive margin. They've got a 21-point lead on second place, and recently have just been demolishing teams. \n\nThey host 7th place Ranheim in this game. \n\nHere's the last 5 Lillestrom league games (most recent game first)\n7-1 win away \n5-1 win at home\n4-0 win at home\n5-1 win away\n4-1 win at home\n\nRanheim have been mid table in both home and away form this season. But honestly, I just think Lillestrom are a class above, and they show no signs of coasting through to the end of the season. I find it very unlikely that they don't win this at home, and as you can see from previous games, the o2.5 looks a play too. \n\nIn fact, you can even jump on them to score 5 or more for like $6.50, which considering their most recent form isn't crazy. I also found them to score in the 3-4 range for $2.40. So you can play around with those too. \n\nBut for me, POTD is the win and o2.5.",

Searle can explode with power scoring and tidy finishing when he’s in rhythm, but his tendency to drift mid-match makes Van Veen’s consistency the safer side to trust. Over a race to 10, that superiority should naturally stretch into at least a 3-leg margin.\n\nI think Noppert offers excellent value, especially with the +2.5 line. I also think Schindler will come through against Joyce.\n\nOdds: 5/6\n\nUnits: 1",

They won’t have the space to counter like they did vs Liverpool.\n\nBrighton are in good form, confident in possession, and have the exact attacking patterns that expose United’s defensive fragility and poor pressing. But Brighton themselves concede chances and United still have enough up top to score at Old Trafford.\n\nI am  expecting goals and both teams contributing.\n\nPrediction:  I dont think United will win this one and can see Brighton winning this. \n\nGood Luck on your bets",

They cant afford to continue dropping games which they would usually win while being 1 point behind Marseille on the table. With Dembele back, a convincing 7-2 thumping of Leverkusen in UCL, and leading the H2H with 9 wins and 1 draw in the last 10 matches vs Brest I can't really see them losing.\n\nNow onto our next leg we move to the UFC heavyweight division. Tom Aspinall is a great fighter but the heavyweight division lacks good prospects. Tom has basically been inactive for a year because the last fight to make at heavyweight was him vs Jon Jones but Jones ended up retiring and vacating the belt and is now left to fight Ciryl Gane because there's not really anyone else. Aspinall is notorious for his quick finishes, across 18 fights his average fight time has been 2 minutes and 2 seconds which is the shortest in UFC history. Admittedly we haven't seen Tom go past the second round and this will be a 5 round fight but regardless I do not see this going all 5 rounds. Ciryl Gane is a high level striker but this will be his third title fight and he lost the first two which were to Francis Ngannou and Jon Jones. Takedown defense was an issue in both of those fights as Ngannou was able to secure 4/5 takedowns on him that fight to a unanimous decision and Jones was able to secure a submission victory and Tom can definitely take advantage of this as well as match him on the feet with his freakish athleticism and power. Trusting in both PSG and Aspinall to come through for us tomorrow BOL and bet responsibly.",

One goal disallowed by VAR gave us the red for our combo paying 2.05, annoying but we keep going!\n\n\n\n\nBrentford have scored in five of their last six home matches, and despite a few mixed results, they are averaging 1.4 goals per game over their last 10 league outings, with Igor Thiago leading the line and Jordan Henderson adding experience in midfield. Liverpool come in off a confidence-boosting 5-1 win over Frankfurt, and even with some injuries, their attack is clicking, scoring 1.7 goals a game, and Gakp and Ekitiké are all contributing regularly.\n\nDefensively, both teams are conceding around 1.5–1.6 goals per match, which supports a high-scoring scenario. Liverpool's last five head-to-heads against Brentford have seen BTTS land in three of them and over 2.5 land in four, with their last meeting at this ground ending 2-0 to Liverpool but generally open games between these two. Team news sees Liverpool missing key defenders but still possessing plenty of attacking firepower, while Brentford remain solid at home, losing just once in their last four at Gtech Community Stadium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPS: Glad to hear so many of you are enjoying the write-ups and making profits from the tips!

Shelton has looked like a top 5 player this entire tourney and has continued to exceed expectations. I think his serve is truly unbreakable at this point, and Sheltons return game has drastically improved. \n\nI expect the first set to be close but Shelton should feed off the crowd and show the tennis world he is a true major contender.",

First, Cleveland won their **last encounter against Orlando**, showing they can control the game and exploit Orlando’s weaknesses. The Cavs have a **balanced offense** led by their key scorers, who are all healthy and in good form, allowing them to consistently put up points. Defensively, Cleveland matches up well against Orlando, who struggles against teams that can shoot efficiently from the perimeter and move the ball quickly. Additionally, Cleveland has a strong track record of **covering similar spreads against lower-ranked teams**, making it likely they’ll win by at least 5 points again. Overall, the matchup, recent head-to-head history, and team form all favor the Cavs covering this spread.\n\nFYI I make the bets that i'm sharing. I want to get to a point where this becomes profitable.",

Girona, while solid, tend to be more pragmatic against compact sides and are comfortable winning without pushing the tempo. Recent head-to-head meetings and overall scoring trends for both teams show very few high-goal games, with one side often failing to score.\nWith neither team built to play end-to-end football and both prioritizing structure over risk, this sets up well for a 1-0 or 2-0 type result rather than a shootout. That makes BTTS No combined with Under 2.5 goals the most logical angle for how this game is likely to play out.",

While their attack still looks capable of creating chances, defensive lapses have started to creep in. Sydney FC arrive with mixed form, showing flashes of control in some matches but falling apart in others. Victory are coming off a 2-1 loss away to Adelaide United, following a narrow 1-0 home defeat to Western Sydney Wanderers. Those results have disrupted what was previously a strong run at AAMI Park, where Victory had been scoring freely and playing with confidence.\n\nBefore that setback, Melbourne Victory put together back-to-back home wins against Perth Glory and Wellington Phoenix, scoring eight goals across those two matches. Their attacking threat hasn’t dropped off, but the recent losses exposed moments where control slipped late in games. At AAMI Park, Victory have scored at least two goals in three of their last four league matches. However, they have also conceded in three of those games, which is why matches here often remain open and competitive well into the second half.\n\nSydney FC come into this after a 2-0 home loss to Wellington Phoenix, a game where they struggled to create chances and looked shaky at the back. That followed a 0-0 draw away at Melbourne City, which showed a more cautious and disciplined side. Away from home, Sydney have been fairly effective, winning two of their last four league matches. A comfortable 3-0 win at Macarthur and a tight 1-0 victory at Perth Glory both came from staying organised and taking their chances, rather than dominating the game throughout.\n\nSydney’s away performances show better balance and game management, while Victory come into this after back-to-back losses that exposed defensive issues despite their attacking threat. Overall, the teams look quite evenly matched, and this game should be decided by fine margins.\n\nEven though it’s an away fixture, I think Sydney has a slight edge. The head-to-head also leans their way, with Sydney winning two of the last three meetings and keeping clean sheets in both wins, including a convincing 3-0 victory earlier this season.\n\n**NOTE: Please only stake what you can afford to lose; know that no picks are 100% guaranteed to hit.

      "text": "2026 record: 8-9 (-2.6 units)\n\n2025 record: 55-41 (+26.5 units)\n\nLast 10 (most recent on right):  ✅❌❌✅✅❌✅❌✅❌\n\nLast Pick: Alexander Bublik 🇰🇿 ML vs Alex De Minaur 🇦🇺 ❌\n\nEvent: Australian Open R4 🎾\n\nPick of the Day: Ben Shelton 🇺🇸 ML vs Casper Ruud 🇳🇴 5 units to win 3.1U @1.61 (Bet365)\n\nWas waiting for some extra line movement but I still like these odds and find that a fair price would be around 1.5 for the play. Shelton turns into a different animal in grand slams, being 16-4 in the category since last year. His losses have come against Sinner, Alcaraz which are understandable and… Mannarino so it’s clear how dominant he becomes at this level. The No. 7 has built a lot of his ranking on these prestigious tournaments as it’s clear he brings his best tennis to the big stage better than anyone else. He made his proper breakthrough on tour here in Australia in 2023 when he reached the quarters, losing to Tommy Paul. Shelton has built a lifetime 14-3 record at the happy slam with his other two losses coming against Sinner in the semis last year and… Mannarino in 2024. Thank God it’s Ruud and not Mannarino in front of him today. Ben hasn’t dropped a set this tournament despite having a really tough opener against Humbert and as per usual in slams has been excellent on serve with the forehand still firing missiles. When his serve + one combo is in full flow it becomes completely unplayable and so very tough to break him. He only conceded a singular break point in his last two matches to Vacherot and Sweeny. The progression of Shelton has been remarkable over the past two years as his baseline game and patience have drastically improved. Despite them being far from perfect, he will have more chances to break serve than Ruud will on return. \n\nRuud has also had a pretty solid run to the fourth round defeating Bellucci, Munar and Cilic. He could leave the tournament to be with his wife at any moment’s notice with a baby on the way. I’m not factoring this into the write-up as it means nothing. The AO historically hasn’t smiled at Ruud with him being 11-6 at the tournament and never gone past the 4th round of it. For a former No. 2 it’s less than ideal. He went very close to going five sets against another big server in Cilic, who was a break up in the fourth and stayed competitive despite a low first serve percentage of 53% and with more flaws at this age than Shelton. Whilst Casper can certainly play on hard courts, it’s clear that clay is his surface with two French Open finals and a masters 1000 on the surface. He likes having time and use his excellent topspin forehand to push the opponent back and create angles, a strategy that is extremely effective on clay courts but not as good on faster courts. However when he’s rushed the errors start to undo his game and loses grip in rallies which is exactly what Ben will do to him. Especially since Shelton is left handed and therefore his forehands will often land on Ruud’s inconsistent backhand this could be a problem for the Norwegian as the match continues.  I predict Ben to win 3-1. BOL !",

Ndiaye has cleared this line in his last 4 EPL matches, and looked really bright in AFCON for Senegal. I am expecting him to slot right back in and make a big impact here. Everton should control possession and Leeds should be pressing and attacking as they find themselves back in the middle of a relegation battle. \n\nBOL and have a great Monday!",

Bet 2.4u\n\nWriteup: Let’s go for win number 40 with a plus money play. In my mind, there are only 3 truly elite teams currently in men’s college hoops. 2 of them are Duke and Arizona. \n\nLet’s start with Duke vs Louisville. Louisville actually has a really solid offense, I would argue top 10 in the nation. However, their weakness (relatively speaking) is their defense, ranking around the top 35 mark. Duke has a top 5 unit on both sides of the court, which doesn’t help Louisville considering they haven’t really been challenged with an elite offense this season. Louisville’s offense vs Duke’s defense could go either way, but I think Duke has had more experience against better teams and should have their offense rolling with their home crowd supporting them against the Louisville defense.\n\nNow for Arizona vs BYU. Arizona is arguably the top team in the nation, and a similar argument for Duke can be used here as well. Arizona also has a top 5 unit on both sides of the ball, with the biggest standout being their height and size advantage. They go up against a BYU squad with a defense outside the top 25 and Arizona has been lighting up top 50 defenses all season, with many of their wins being double digit victories. BYU’s offense should be able to be relatively effective throughout the game, but even with their home crowd supporting, I expect Arizona’s size to be the difference here and to have a big rebounding advantage.\n\nRemember to only bet what you can afford to lose, and BOL!",

      "text": "Record 9-3 (Pending)\n\n**POTD: Jalen Johnson over 22.5 Points.**\n\nRisky bet I'm taking a chance that he is back to his old self.\n\nHis last 3 games showed that he is most likely back to his old self, 23 points 18 boards 9 assists, 32 points 15 boards 8 assists, 28 points 16 boards and 6 assists. However, the three games before that were shocking: Lakers 13 points 3 boards and 6 assists, Portland 12 points 11 boards and 6 assists and Celtics 12 points 8 boards and 5 assists. \n\nIndiana is a decent matchup for Johnson and I think he will have more opportunities than Onyeka due to the fact he usually sits on the three point line. I think Johnson being the main ball handler will open more gaps for himself then everyone else.\n\nPlayers that can get to the rim have a fairly good success rate in scoring, JB 30 points, Zion 27 and 29 points. \n\nNow these are assumptions that may actually have nothing to do with his performance but this is why I think these stats are starting to increase again. His poor performance began when CJ joined this team, it quite literally started when CJ played his first game with Atlanta, his playstyle is very dominant and plays a similar or identical game to Johnson. This can be seen with CJ taking the game winning shot running the clock against the Bucks which led to the loss.The teams were on the road or against very good defenses for his matchup, for example Celtics, Blazers and the Lakers.",

      "text": "Record: 175-145, +6.77 units\n\nLast Pick: Thiago Seyboth Wild to win 2-0 vs Adolfo Daniel Vallejo (+175, 1 unit): Loss\n\nTennis | Quimper Challenger | 6:20 AM EST (estimated)\n\nToday's Pick: Pavel Kotov vs Christoph Negritu | **Negritu ML at +150. 1 unit.**\n\nWrite-up: Kind of a frustrating match. Seyboth Wild showed great resilience to get from 3-5 15-40 to 5-5 in the first set, but was promptly broken and lost it. He won the second set, but then started having fitness issues in the third set, which was why I was concerned about taking his ML. In reality, though, I probably should have avoided the match altogether. \n\nAs the Australian Open moves towards its conclusion, the Challenger circuit is also heating up, with a pretty stacked event in Quimper, France beginning on Monday. The market has moved slightly towards Kotov since this match opened, and in some ways I understand why. Kotov is a former Top 50 player who even made an ATP final on this surface in 2023, and while he experienced severe backsliding in terms of his fitness and results in 2024 and 2025, a new season always brings new possibilities. However, I was able to find some footage of a French interclub match that Kotov played a couple months into his offseason, and was not impressed at all by his level. While the result of the match, a third-set loss to Arthur Bouqier, doesn't seem terrible, his movement looked slow and lumbering, and it felt as if Bouquier's errors were the only thing keeping him in the match. He was also having a ton of trouble getting first serves back in play, and that could mean trouble against Negritu, who does most of his damage with a booming serve. Negritu has played three indoor tournaments to start the season, and while he hasn't experienced great results, his opponents have also played quite well, and he did win a doubles title in Glasgow. I think Negritu's match sharpness should help him here against a Kotov playing his first match of the new season, and he has enough consistency from the baseline to move Pavel around. On paper, Kotov is a superior player, but it's been so long since he's shown that level that it's hard to justify him being the favorite here.",

Not even close \n\n\nEvent: Pacers at Hawks \n\n\nPick: Jalen Johnson over 9.5 rebounds \n\n\nWrite Up: I continue my pattern of losing spectacularly. One thing with my picks lately, there's no sweat. Either win or lose, it's not close. Henderson barely even saw the field, lowest snap count all year. \n\n\nMoving on, the Pacers visit the Hawks. Jalen Johnson is averaging 10.5 rebounds on the season, 10.3 at home. Over his last 10, he's averaging 11.3, and he's hit this total in 6 of his last 10, but 4 of his last 5. Last time he played the Pacers, he had 13 rebounds. \n\n\nThe Hawks are also on 3 days rest, and Jalen averages 11.4 rebounds on 3 days rest. Everything looks good on his side to at least make his average. \n\n\nNow on the other side, Indiana is the worst in the NBA at rebounds allowed, and they're worse on the road. Not much else to say about them. \n\n\nAll the factors are in place for Jalen to at least hit his average, which is all we need. Very likely on extra rest and against the team who allows the most rebounds in the league, he'll go over his average. \n\n\nHoping for the good kind of no sweat game where he clears this easily like 4 of his last 5, not the bad kind where he inexplicably only gets THREE SNAPS THE WHOLE GAME FOR NO REASON or something like that, not that I'm bitter. \n\n\nJalen Johnson over 9.5 rebounds. ",

This is my last day posting on this account before my account Own_Topic5302 is unbanned, let’s keep this insane momentum going! The Kings are coming to Columbus to play the Blue Jackets. For the Blue Jackets, Jet Greaves is in net, he has been great this season holding a .908 save percentage and a 2.66 goals against average. Last game against the lightning he had 5 goals on him, but this is a good bounce back opportunity playing a low scoring team like the Kings. In net for the Kings is Darcy Kuemper, Darcy has been consistently good every year, having at least a .900 save percentage every season but 2 in his 12 year career. This season, Kuemper has a .902 save percentage and just a 2.45 goals against average. Blue Jackets don’t get a lot of offense, ranking 19th in goals this season. On the other side, the Kings struggle very much offensively ranking 30th in goals this season but they are good at limiting shots against their goalie. This season the kings allow the 11th least shots against their goalie. With the Kings not being good offensively and Jet Greaves being in net. I believe this will be hard for them to score. On the other hand, the Blue Jackets are pretty bad offensively, and Kings are good at limiting shots on goal.\n\nTake The Under 6.5 Goals!",

      "text": "Record:1–1–1\n\nNet Units: +0.32\n\n❌🅿️✅\n\nLast POTD: Atalanta win & over 1.5 goals @1.66 (2) units ✅ Result:4–0\n\nFootball / Serie A / Verona vs Udinese\n\n  Pick: Udinese win or draw (X2) & Under 3.5 goals @1.69 1Xbet (1unit)\n\n Write-up:\nNot the most exciting game on paper, but a very important one for both sides. Verona are bottom of the table and in terrible form with just two wins in their last 23 matches and only four goals scored in their last six games. On top of that they’re dealing with a long injury list and still look very short of ideas going forward.\n\nUdinese aren’t in great form either but they’re clearly the more stable side overall. They have the better squad on paper and usually get results against Verona with many recent H2H meetings ending in draws. Verona are under huge pressure to survive, and that often leads to nervous and cautious football rather than anything positive which is why I’m happy to side with Udinese to at least avoid defeat here.\n\nI’m also expecting a low scoring game. Both teams have serious problems in attack, and even the managers have admitted they’re lacking quality in the final third. The last four meetings between these two finished under 2.5 goals, and given the current form and situation, it’s hard to see this turning into anything open or high scoring.\n\nThe main risks are an early goal, especially if Verona score first, which could change the game flow, or a red card that turns a slow match into chaos. There’s also the motivation factor Verona are desperate for points, while Udinese are comfortable in mid-table, so a narrow home win is still possible.\n\nOverall, based on form, quality, and trends, Udinese avoiding defeat in a low-scoring match feels like the most logical and safest angle. Realistic scorelines are 0–0, 0–1, 1–1, or 1–2.\n\nGood luck to anyone riding with me on this one, hope it lands ✌️",

      "text": "**Record:** 41-20-1 (+22.02u)\n\n**Last:** (CBB) Florida -11.5 (1.5u) - ❌\n\n**POTD:** (CBB) No. 1 Arizona (-2.5) at No. 13 BYU\n\n**Start Time:** 9:00 PM ET (ESPN)\n\n**Odds:** -110 (FanDuel)\n\n**Units:** 1.5U\n\n**Reasoning:** No other team in college basketball has a bigger target on its back right now than undefeated Arizona.\n\nNight in and night out, the Wildcats (20-0) are consistently on the receiving end of their opponents’ best shot. But the team doesn’t just absorb the contact, it counters with a knockout blow of its own. And it isn’t just a bunch of slouches that Arizona has been beating up on, as the team has racked up a national best eight Quad 1 victories, including wins over then-No. 3 Florida, No. 3 UConn, No. 12 Alabama, No. 15 UCLA and No. 20 Auburn. It all leaves the Wildcats just one win shy of their best start since 2013-14 and two shy of matching the program-best 22-game win streak set from 1914-17. \n\nIt’s been a multi-pronged attack on offense that has led the way for Arizona.\n\nOnly once this season has the same player led the team in scoring in back-to-back games with seven different players topping 20+ points this season. The combined effort has the Wildcats among the nation’s best offensively, ranking 5th in field-goal percentage (51.6%), 7th in offensive efficiency (1.207), 8th in scoring (89.8 PPG) and 54th in three-point shooting (36.4%). The unit will be challenged against a stiff BYU defense that enters ranked 23rd in defensive efficiency (0.955), 37th in opponent field-goal percentage (41.0%), 71st in scoring defense (70.1 PPGA) and 85th in opponent three-point shooting (31.8%). However, the unit has been a little more generous as of late, conceding 78.9 points on 44.5% shooting (38.9% from beyond the arc) over its last four games.\n\nFurthermore, take a look at how Arizona has fared against opponents who rank Top 50 in defensive efficiency: \n\n* UConn (8): 71 points on 46% shooting (20% from beyond the arc)\n* Cincinnati (13): 77 points on 43% shooting (23% from beyond the arc)\n* TCU (31): 86 points on 51% shooting (44% from beyond the arc)\n* West Virginia (32): 88 points on 53% shooting (43% from beyond the arc)\n* Florida (41): 93 points on 49% shooting (40% from beyond the arc)\n\nNot only did the Wildcats still average an impressive 83 points per game, but the team topped 46% shooting in all but once of those games. Not to mention, outside the contests against the Huskies and Gators, the rest of the games were decided by 13 points or more.\n\nFortunately for the Cougars (17-2), they pack a punch of their own offensively.\n\nThrough 19 games, the team ranks 20th in offensive efficiency (1.183), 20th in scoring (86.8 PPG), 25th in field-goal percentage (49.1%) and 99th in three-point shooting (35.4%). Fresh off a 43-point effort on Saturday, star freshman AJ Dybantsa will look to stay hot. Unfortunately, Arizona has just the defense that can fan the flames, ranking 5th in defensive efficiency (0.908), 13th in opponent field-goal percentage (39.2%), 31st in scoring defense (67.6 PPGA) and 71st in opponent three-point shooting (31.4%). Not only is the unit coming off consecutive games of holding opponents below 60 points and 35% shooting, but in seven contests against offenses ranked in the Top 100 in offensive efficiency, the Wildcats have conceded a respectable 73.6 points on just 40.3% shooting (32.2% from deep). Conversely, in six outings against opponents who rank Top 100 in defensive efficiency, BYU has managed just 75.5 points on 43.3% shooting (32.5% from beyond the arc). \n\nLook for Arizona’s size to prove to be a difference-maker in this one. \n\nPer KenPom, the Wildcats rank 7th in average height and 30th in effective height. That size has paid dividends especially on the glass, where the team ranks 2nd in total rebounding (43.4 per game), 3rd in defensive rebounding (28.5) and 6th in offensive rebounding (12.4) while ranking 2nd in opponent defensive rebounding (17.8), 9th in opponent total rebounding (29.9) and 70th in opponent offensive rebounding (8.2). That could make life difficult for a Cougars defense that ranks just 116th in opponent points in the paint (30.2 PPG), 130th in opponent offensive rebounding (8.6) and 289th in opponent second-chance points (12.4 PPG). To make matters worse, Arizona just so happens to rank 2nd in points in the paint with 45.9 points per game. \n\nIn what should be a back-and-forth game, look for the battle-tested Wildcats to pull away when it matters. \n\nBOL if tailing, and as always, please do so responsibly. One bet should not cause you to crash out all over Reddit.",

Despite defensive issues (key defenders like Shane Duffy, Gabriel Forsyth, Jeff Schlupp and Mirko Topic out injured) and limited numbers at the back, Clement has praised the team’s collective attacking output (five different scorers in the 5–0 West Brom win) and wants to continue building confidence through forward momentum. That lifting of the attacking ethos is crucial — a bottom-of-the-table side that historically leaks goals is now encouraged to take risks high up, and that often translates to open games with multiple goals.\n\n\\- On the other side, Frank Lampard’s Coventry are chasing a Premier League promotion push and his press comments make the priorities clear — his focus remains on intense attacking football and staying ‘diligent’ in creating chances, even after recent setbacks. Lampard has masterminded a team that scores at will while also continuing to generate momentum and club optimism, with players urged to attack vertically, move the ball forward quickly and pressure opponents constantly — a style that statistically yields high xG and goal involvement. Although Coventry’s recent winless streak has shown some vulnerability, Lampard has described wins like the 2–1 vs Leicester as “massive” and praised his side’s ability to control difficult games and score key goals under pressure.\n\n\\- With both coaches publicly committing to proactive attacking approaches, struggling defences (especially Norwich’s injury-hit backline), and Coventry maintaining one of the league’s most potent goal outputs, this fixture is tactically structured to see chances at both ends rather than cautious containment — making Over 2.5 goals a highly plausible and compelling outcome.",

ADC's have the highest kill share of any role and are currently set way too low in both cases. Earlier on when this line opened, Viper was 5.5/6.5 at + money. \n* Viper is averaging 5 kills per map so far this split. Last split in LCK Viper averaging 5.3 kills in Summer split, both well above this line. BLG are currently between -200/-220 favorites to win this series so they are decent favorites coming into this game\n* Viper has a 8/12 hitrate so far this split for BLG with 7/8 cover rate in wins with the only miss being a hook. JDG just beat BLG 2-0 and in this series Viper got the least kills of mid/jungle/adc. This isn't a normal trend for this team and expecting them to make the adjustment and focus on getting Viper kills/resources in this series the second time around\n* In map wins viper is averaging 6.12 kills per map so far, as said above most adc lines that are favorites is set to 5.5 kills at lowest you will see 4.5, this line is an error, BLG should win this series and are the better team overall. \n* Slamming this pick and also laddering O 4.5 Kills at + money is insane value. As said above Gala line is also currently an error on Thunderpick, would highly recommend playing both lines as their is almost 100% guarantee 1/2 hit their error line and both hitting is very likely with both being 2 kills lower then what they should be.",

He’s won all 3 matches in straight sets despite having a pretty tough draw so far. He has always done well in this tournament and has a lot of points to make up for his ranking. With Sinner likely waiting in the quarters, he will want to be as fresh as possible for a chance at an upset.\n\nHe’s going up against Ruud, who has also been playing well in this tournament. His only lost set so far was to Cilic in the last round. However, he’s never advanced farther than the 4th round here in Australia, and I suspect that to continue here. Ben has more weapons and if he is playing well, I don’t see Ruud being able to do much to stop it.\n\nGood Luck!",

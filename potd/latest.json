Both teams are very solid inside on defense while struggling a bit on offense especially from long range. Both these teams do get to the FT line often but we’ve seen recently we can’t rely on that either way. As long as we don’t see a 3 pt explosion which is always bound to happen this game should stay in the 140-142 range. Let’s get back to it!",

Over his L10, he's averaging 16.2 points on 7.2 three-point attempts per game, clearing this line in 7 of 10 (70%).\n\nThe matchup tonight favors scoring. He dropped 22 points with 5 threes against this same Clippers team on January 30th in just 25 minutes. The Clippers have been inconsistent defensively, allowing as many as 128 points in a game over their last 10.\n\nTHJ's role in Denver's offense is secure -- he's played 25+ minutes in 9 of his last 10 games and has been the primary bench scorer with consistent volume (10.1 FGA/game L10). At -110, this is a solid price for a line he's been clearing comfortably.\n\nBOL for anyone tailing! ",

Gotta wait almost another week for that though so in the meantime I’m sharing my favorite NBA look of the night.\n\nPoeltl has been out for a majority of the season with a back injury but he finally played his first game just before the All Star break. As expected, when a player comes back from injury his minutes are usually limited which is what we’ve seen here with him splitting play time with Mamukelashvili, both recording 20 minutes that game. In those 20 minutes Poeltl posted 6 rebounds, so just add another 6 minutes of playtime and I’m positive he hits this line. He is expected to play around 23 minutes (according to rotowire), but the second and third backup centers (Murray-Boyles and Mamukelashvili) are both gametime decisions. \n\nOver the last 30 days, Chicago has been allowing an average of 14.1 rebounds to opposing centers. They recently allowed 6 boards to Queta (on 15 min of playtime) and 11 to Vucevic (26 min) in the same game, 10 boards to Claxton and 14 boards to Jokic. The Bulls have been allowing more than enough rebound opportunities and Poeltl is looking good back on the court. If this wasn’t his second game back from injury I’d risk more than 1u on this play, but even with restricted minutes I see Poeltl soaring past this line.\n\nI will be laddering this play at 8+ rebounds (+146) 0.5u and player to record a double double (+700) 0.25u. I hope we can see some green tonight and cash before half.\n\nBest of Luck",

Tiafoe ML (-161) 3U\n\nEvent: ATP Delray Beach\n\nI just built this model based on my own custom algorithm that shows the win percentage for each game as well as my tennis knowledge.\n\nSvajda is in good form but there is levels to this and he’s gonna learn that today. Svajda is a scrappy kid and he's definitely been putting in work on the Challenger circuit to break into that top 100, but let's be real here. Tiafoe's power is just on a completely different level. In Delray, the courts play medium-fast, which is basically a playground for Tiafoe's heavy forehand and that improved serve he's been leaning on. Plus, you can't ignore the history, Big Foe won his first title right here back in 2018, so the vibes at this tournament are always 10/10 for him. He knows he has a massive opportunity with this draw to make a deep run and stack some much needed points.",

Marshall is averaging 80.4 points per game while App is only at 71.2.\n\nMarshall is coming off a strong win over South Alabama while App is coming off a loss to a (imo) weaker opponent in JMU. \n\nTo be honest, I'm a recent app state alum so I've been watching the team for awhile. And one thing I know about our basketball team, we get off to a very strong start most seasons, and then at the end of the season we shit the bed.\n\nAnother option is the under at 144.5. this one imo is more of a dice roll. App is a defense sided team that can struggle with offense (one game ended 52-50). But marshall is a pretty consistent high powered offense that just might push this game over",

Sinner is just serve botting at this point, his serve is more efficient than Federer's at his best. I know it's crazy, but apparently also true. Mensik doesn't have the best return game, he is more serve oriented. Also, he will probably struggle in the baseline game against Sinner, so I don't expect a good day at the office from him.\n\nGood luck to everyone!",

They also let their opponents score. Even the weaker teams in the turkish league. Nottingham is a weaker team in the PL, however in the EL they scored 15 goals in 8 games. In my opinion these 2 are almost evenly matched teams top2 in turkish league vs PL team who can find a goal against everyone. I think Fenerbahce takes this game, but they will let Forest score for sure.",

How Arsenal could have thrown a 0-2 lead into a draw. It's a well deserved loss for me and we move on to the next one. Now to the Dinamo Zagreb game. We got a team who has won the last 4 home games and building something here. Racing Genk is not a bad team either, but Dinamo Zagreb has a lot more experience in these competitions + has the home field advantage. I think that the odds are too good to miss out on. This is more of a value bet and the thrust in their homefield + recent results at home pointing it to this direction. Their last loss was 5 games ago vs Betis, and Betis is a strong team. \n\nLeague wise: Dinamo Zagreb is sitting confidently on the first place currently. Genk on the other hand is sitting on position 7, where 4th is within their reach as its only 2 points there. I won't put too much energy on the Europa League positioning here as Dinamo Zagreb has picked up their form at this rate. The expectations are for Dinamo Zagreb to win with more than a goal, therefore the Asian handicap. The safety here is that we get our money back in case of only a victory with 1 goal difference. Therefore more than happy with the pick + the odds being soo high for it.\n\nOn the side note: My tactics won’t change by lowering the odds to less than 2. The goal is to find high odds to play here, such as the range of 2,2 to 3,3. I’m trying to keep track of the results in all of the top leagues. We will **always aim for** **long term** gains here and make sure to manage your bankroll. I will try to post another pick in the coming days. Good luck everyone.\n\nBookie: **Coolbet** and a **5** unit bet.

Robinson is going up against the Pistons who are without Duren and Beefstew. Robinson has covered almost every game 32/40 and 20/22 at home, which is 91%. I think this line is severely mispriced. He is averaging 9.5 rebounds on 13.9 rebounds chances per game. So we just need half here.\n\nQuickley is 40/52 on his line this season, and 22/25 on the road - 88%. Bulls give up a lot of assists ranking 28th and 25th to point guards. With the starting lineup (poeltl is back) he is 12/13 and 8/8 on the road. He is averaging 6.8 assists on 12.5 potential assists per game. \n\nExtreme value here, you can play both SU or parlay like I did. Robinson at home - 91% and Quickley on the road - 88%. That gives us implied odds of -400 and we are getting it at +155. \n\n[https://venmo.com/u/SezaBC](https://venmo.com/u/SezaBC)\n\nAlso note. If you’re going to tail ANY pick in the thread, you should do so responsibly. You shouldn’t be crashing out over one pick. I do not want (grown men?) crying in the comments because they do not have the emotional capacity or discipline to accept a loss - which is inevitable. Great reads can lose, and bad picks can win.

This is due to the American domination in their h2h group stage game, American's elite two way hockey leading to a current +- of 30, and the Canadians not looking at unstoppable as years prior. Despite this, I think this has been a major overreaction and will jump on this 2.5 spread happily. These two teams have met in nearly every Olympic final and have never had a game end with more than a 2 goal margin. These stats may seem arbitrary considering the makeup of the rosters evolves with time, but there is something to be said about the intensity both teams consistently bring to these matchups. Canada's Marie-Philip Poulin will be at the heart of this intense matchup, after missing the opening game where the Canucks fell 5-0. Captain Clutch has scored in every Olympic final she has been in, and will provide the Canadians the leadership required. The game's total leans towards U5.5, suggesting a low scoring affair. The total is more significant when considering a 2.5 goal cushion over the traditional 1.5, as empty net goals in a gritty 2-1 or 3-2 type of final will not ruin the bet. \n\n[https://buymeacoffee.com/ch1cken](https://buymeacoffee.com/ch1cken)",

Tauson is the No. 15 and is defending finals points here in Dubai. This masters event has been an absolute sham with all the withdrawals and the walkovers which has led to a really open draw for quite a few players. Unfortunately for the Dane, I see her adventure ending here. She’s had a pretty bad start to the season and struggled with fitness earlier on and was knocked out easily by Siniakova in Qatar. She’s done well so far this tournament with straight set victories over Kenin, Stearns and Linette but this is another level. Pegula reached the semis of both Brisbane and the AO where she ended up losing to the eventual winner Rybakina in the latter. Jessie steamrolled her way past Gracheva and Jovic to make the quarters here.\n\nTauson is a player with a big serve and aggressive groundstrokes which translates fairly well to the medium-fast courts of Dubai. However, she is really going to need her first serve percentage to be perfect to have a real shot in this match. If she sustains the 42% and 55% from the two previous rounds Pegula is going to have a field day on the second serves. The match-up is pretty bad for Clara as Pegula is going to force her to move a lot which is a major weakness of hers. Jessie’s returning is also excellent which is going to force a lot of neutral balls even on Tauson’s serve. The No. 5 has built a reputation as a player who commits few errors, will force you to play the extra shot by absorbing pace while keeping it deep and provide little angles to attack her from which forces errors from the opponent most of the time. As a result she usually falls short against the elite players who manage to hit through this more defensive tactic but Tauson isn’t part of that group and I can see this be an error fest as the match goes on especially with her movement issues. I can only realistically see one close set before Pegula pulls away and with the prices similar to Jessie 2-0, I would rather take the under games just in case Tauson puts out the performance of a life time and fires winners with no possible response like when she beat Sabalenka 3 and 2 here last year. Pegula had seen the under clear pretty easily in 8/9 of her matches and routinely defeated better power hitters such as Anisimova and Keys in Melbourne. I would give more appropriate odds to be around 1.60 for this play. BOL !",

The important thing is the only real competitors are the US and Canada. Since the start of women's hockey in the Olympics, only Canada and the US have won gold. When they played a few days back, the US won easily 5-0. Key part is the Canadians were missing their star player, Poulin.

They ended the year on a 17 map winstreak before losing their last game of 2025 to 9INE, meaning they are 23-1 in their last 24 Inferno maps played.\n* Johnny Speeds are 50% winrate on 6 maps of Inferno in 2026, they are 1-3 in their last 4 overall on the map. In 2025 they were 14-12 with a 54% winrate on the map, however it wasn't quite a strong map for them but one a lot of teams picked against them, they also had a couple farm wins at local lans against bad teams as well.\n* Two big keys for Alliance, they are 57.6% winrate on T side, and 57.1% of pistol rounds won, they have dominant starts and come out swinging for big first halfs\n* Johnny Speeds have struggled on both their CT sides and pistol rounds on Inferno, winning only 46% of CT rounds and only 48% of pistol rounds despite their positive overall winrate. Alliance have outscored Johnny Speeds on T side Inferno 28-8 in their h2h matches or \\~78% of rounds\n\n**Final Notes:**\n\n* I mentioned yesterday we almost never see a team with a perma ban choose to ban their opponents best map instead, which is very true, however, if their was ever a series I think a team would try it, it may be this one. Alliance have pummeled Johnny Speeds 13-4 in three straight h2h's including 8 days ago.\n* Despite this possibility, Johnny Speeds have a small history on Ancient and it has been awful, they were 1-7 on Ancient as a team and lost mostly one sided games, Alliance are on a 4L streak on Ancient, however the teams they have lost to were mostly tier 1.5 teams (BC Game/OG/BIG), they are historically a strong Ancient team, still 56% winrate in the L3 months overall despite the loss streak and 40-17 overall. Just wanted to put this as a possibility I am aware of and would back Alliance just as hard on Ancient as Inferno.\n* Alliance -2.5 rounds Map 2 or 1x2 ML are strong alternatives if you don't like the juice at -145",

PAOK had the highest scoring matches in the entire Europa League in their first 8 matches, averaging 4 goals per game. Celta Vigo average 3.2 goals per game, and only one match had less than 3 goals and that was against RSB, the team with the lowest average scoring games in the league. \n\nBOL if you choose to tail, happy Thursday!",

I do favor Gamba to progress from this match, but I do have some question marks about their offensive ability, especially if the opponent is sitting back. Both of Gamba’s league games so far have ended 0-0 and we saw it very much against city rivals Cerezo when they had a player sent off and sat back in a low block, how the Gamba players could not break them down. Gamba also without some big players in the attack from last season like Mitsuta and Juan Alano, it also looks like their big star Takashi Usami is also missing the game, but not 100% sure about that. \n\nPohang Steelers saw very few goals in their end of season run-in, especially away was there few goals, as only 2 of their last 14 saw more than two. They come here pretty much full strength after not losing anyone important during the winter window. I think the highlight from the game in South Korea was the Steelers goalkeeper who had another really good game and had kept five straight clean sheets before that. \n\nWe could always get some nonsense like what we saw in the Sanfrecce game, where they first gave away a stupid penalty, before one of their players made a nice diving header to send the ball into their own net… However, I think we will get a game where Gamba will pass and pass and pass the ball around trying to find a way through, and Steelers will hope they can grab a goal on the counter. In the end neither side will see much success.  \n\n",

They've scored at least 5 every single game, including 5-0 against this same Canada squad a week ago. \n\nUSA has beaten every single team ranked in IIHF\"s top 6 (except themselves) with a combined score of 25-1.

AC draw out the game thanks to a second half goal. Nice little cash for you guys, lets keep the ball rolling now. Have a great day folks!\n\nFirst and foremost we go to the WTA Dubai where Pegula (ranked 5th) and Tauson (ranked 15th) are facing off. This is their first matchup, so no previous head-to-head data to work from. Based off **singles outdoor hard** information we can see this: Tauson owns a 7-3 record in her last 10 since 19th Jan, going 3-2 in the last 5, with wins in the last 3 - Pegula comes into this fixture going 8-2, 4-1 in the last 5. Many of Pegula's most recent wins are coming from players under ranking 20 (3 of the last 5 she has beaten were ranks 60, 20, 17 and 6) all in straight sets, losing to rank 3 Rybakina. Tauson has not faced a player in the last 5 games under the rank 30. Now, this information itself is not indicative of future results, based off recent opponents, ranking and form I see Pegula winning this one, maybe not in straight sets like most her wins as I think Tauson keeps it close but she can see it out.\n\nRugby League World Club Challenge is for leg two. Since the start of 2025 Hull own a home record of 13-2, Brisbane have an away record of 8-6. It must be said that Brisbane do look to be favourites with good reason, but they have not played a game this year yet. Hull have played two, both away with a 104-0 win at Lock Lane and 19-18 shock loss at York. Brisbane's forwards tend to win the collisions, gaining more ground after contact - with this also comes an advantage in territory pressure and scoreboard results. Hull tend to struggle against strong rotation in the middle and ruck speed is an issue - BUT I do think the extra games, the home advantage, the travelling team coming from Australia to the UK (different environment, weather, grounds etc.) can force the game to be close even with the Broncos being strong favourites. I think they can keep it within +12.5, feel free to buy down to +14.5 or +16.5 if that makes you more comfortable.\n\n**BOL and always bet what you can afford to lose!**",

Zhang didn't necessarily play badly, but Mensik was excellent. I don't think too many people tailed though, because my post didn't appear until a few hours before the match due to automod issues. I'm always willing to admit when I had the wrong read on a player's form, and I'm actually backing Mensik today. \n\nInteresting match between Sinner and Mensik here, as it's actually only the second time Sinner or Alcaraz has met one of the three players in the younger generation (Fonseca, Mensik, and Tien), with the first one being Sinner's 6-2, 6-2 win over Tien in last year's Beijing final. However, Mensik has already shown that he's not afraid of the titans of the game, having beaten Novak Djokovic in last year's Miami final and taken a set off him the year before. A lot of comparisons have been drawn between Mensik and Alexander Zverev, who is widely regarded as the best player to never win a Grand Slam - they both have strong, high-percentage first serves, questionable second serves (Zverev has improved on this quite a bit), elite backhands, and powerful, but error-prone forehands. Indeed, Zverev has generally played tight sets against Sinner if you ignore one drubbing at last year's Paris Masters. However, one distinguishing factor I see between Mensik and Zverev is mentality. Even at 20 years old, Mensik seems to be willing to be aggressive on big points, to have the composure to truly take down his idols and not just come within a few points. He also tends to stay focused even when he's down in a set, so I would trust him not to start throwing away service games even if Sinner secures an early break. \n\nThe serve is Mensik's biggest weapon, and he showed it in his first two matches here (8.3 and 8.4 serve ratings). In comparison, Sinner maybe hasn't been as dialed in on return as usual (7.5, 7.6), and failed to cover this spread in R2 against an out-of-form Alexei Popyrin. The conditions here in Doha are often viewed as quite slow, but I would say that the courts themselves are actually medium-speed. The variable desert winds and low humidity are the real X-factors that can make life tough for big hitters, but conditions have been quite mild so far, and that should continue tomorrow with highs of around 26 degrees celsius, 7 mph wind, and 30% humidity expected tomorrow. Mensik already played on this center court in the first round, and the crowd is honestly pretty nonexistent, so I don't expect him to have any trouble adjusting to the moment. I don't expect him to break Sinner's serve, but Sinner's forehand hasn't been quite the weapon we've seen in the past this year, and I expect Jannik to be tinkering with his game a bit in lower-tier events like this one. I'm not concerned about whether Mensik can hold up on the backhand wing, but the only question mark is whether his forehand breaks down. Honestly, though, all aspects of his game have been firing this year, and he's already won a title and made the second week of the Australian Open. My only concerns about him in the second round were physical due to his injury layoff, but those are mostly gone now after seeing how he performed. I think this spread is a bit wide, and I expect him to cover it. \n\nNote: The [POTD Capper Tracker](https://potd.lol), which you may remember from its Google Sheet days, is finally back in a cleaner, more robust website format!

Celje were without a doubt the greatest underdog story of last season, reaching the quarter finals of the Conference League and only narrowly losing to Fiorentina on aggregate in what was their first ever European appearance. In the process, their midfielder, Seslar, set the record for the most assists in the competition's history. Super impressive stuff. A lot of that success has to be credited to their manager, **Albert Riera, who is now no longer at the club,** having recently taken over Frankfurt midseason. This is going to be a **huge blow for Celje,** who have already dropped some points in the league immediately after his departure.\n\nNot only that, but they've **sold their best striker,** Kovacevic, to Ferencvaros. For those unaware, Kovacevic was at one point **the most in-form striker in Europe,** bagging goals for fun. For a short period of time, he even had more than Kane and Haaland *(granted, he played in a weaker league, but it's still nothing to scoff at).* They absolutely haven't found the replacement for him yet.\n\nI think the odds just haven't updated yet and don't reflect the sheer drop off in quality that Celje now possess after losing one of the most talented managers in Europe rn, as well as their main attacking output. And it’s not like their European form’s been perfect. After an impressive start of three wins on the bounce, they **failed to win their next three games,** including a heavy 3-0 loss to Rijeka and then being held to a 0-0 draw by the lowly Shelbourne, proving they can be **shut out by a weaker, yet defensively compact team.**\n\n*Drita are still a slight underdog* heading into today’s matchup, but these odds for what is essentially a DC are too good to pass up on. They're very **defensively sound,** and neither team is going to push too hard in the first leg. **Celje are playing away from home,** so their main goal is coming out of this game undefeated. Everything is going my way atm so I'm going in with 5 whole units. Feeling a low scoring affair here, so Under 3.5 goals sounds good if you want to ramp the odds up even further, but I'd just stick to the outlined POTD personally. BOL and let's enjoy an exotic football matchup ☘️🫡",

It seems reasonable as Detroit is a top rebounding team that ranks #5 in fewest RPG allowed to opponents.\n\nHowever, Detroit will be without their first and second center, Duren and Stewart, due to suspension, moving Paul Reed to starting center position. Robinson, coming off the bench, will therefore be matched up against either 4th-string center (Tolu Smith) or a small-ball lineup with no true center. Either case should prove a favorable matchup for Robinson.\n\nBetter still is homecourt advantage, where Robinson’s rebounding average is much higher (9.7 home vs. 8.5 away).\n\nAnd in 22 home games this season, **he is over this line in 20/22**. In both of the two misses, Robinson was in the starting lineup, which brings down his rebounding numbers. In today’s game, he will be in his natural role coming off the bench, backing up KAT instead of playing alongside him. When coming off the bench in home games this season, **he is over this line in 14/14.**\n\nThe odds aren’t all that juicy but the line is well-supported this season in this spot.",

Vikingur at home don’t change their style, they attack, press high, and create chances in numbers. Against a team like Reykjavik that usually leads to an open game. Vikingur are deadly when there’s space and can easily score two or three themselves. If this turns into a back-and-forth battle, five goals is very live at this price.",

Huge thanks to everyone tailing the heat.\n\nPARIVISION has been a revelation this tournament. With Puppey’s veteran coaching and their new offlaner, they are sitting pretty at 7-1 at the group stage. Meanwhile, Yandex has been a disaster, struggling at 1-7. They just dropped a map to a Tier 2 Chinese stack and practically have one foot out the door. Mathematically, Yandex needs to win 4 maps in a row just for a *chance* at tiebreakers. The motivation gap here is a canyon. PARI is playing for top seed, while Yandex looks like they’re already checking out of their hotel and some possible EPT points xd. This is as close to a \"lock\" as you get in Tier 1 Dota.\n\nThe gap between Tundra and Execration is just too wide. Tundra is a legitimate contender for the Grand Finals and has looked clinical in their macro play. Execration, on the other hand, has been the group’s punching bag, losing every single map except for their series against the bottom-tier NA squad. I believe both these matches have over an 80% chance to hit. BOL\n\nUpdate; Many people asking why taking such low odfs of double chance and not take Pari ML. This is a Bo2 dota 2 game and in bo 2 games “draw”’ is a very likely outcome. Pari ML is 2.25 makes the parlay too risky for a 5 unit bet. Pari DC is simply a “ lock in” bet.\n\nBoom another one in the bag, Congrats",

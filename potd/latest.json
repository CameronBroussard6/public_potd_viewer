Tracker on the bottom, as per. \n\nToday's POTD: Al Hilal v Al Nassr - Saudi Pro League - 12.30 PM EST - BTTS YES + Al Hilal Double Chance - (1.90) - 5U\n\nBoth of these arabian juggernauts have the squad (and the money) to compete in any of the big european soccer leagues. Where old washed up players go to cash out big checks and score crazy ass goals in front of empty stadiums. I am going to make this easy. \n\nBTTS has hit for these teams their L6/6, and Al Hilal has won 18 STRAIGHT games (crazy) and has not lost in the past 25 games. Their last loss was in july, crazy. \n\n  \nSo just basically need Al Nassr to kick one in and Al Hilal to do what they have been doing since july. \n\nBOL and tail responsibly, as always. \n\n  \n[TRACKER](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-PHX-U7eiB5neVpbTJVkzwquGE1KyGVQA5nfejcDT_A/edit?usp=sharing)",

      "text": "__POTD Record:__ 71-36-1 (+74.3u)\n\n__Previous Pick:__ [❌ Dalton Kincaid o40.5 receiving yards (-110), 3.3u](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/s/00wQDlrQlz)\n\n__Event:__ NFL: Texans @ Steelers 8:15pm EST\n\n__POTD:__ Aaron Rodgers o20.5 completions (-105), 4.2u to win 4u\n\n__Write Up:__ The Wild Card Round finished up on Monday night as the hottest team in football, the Houston Texans (12-5), head to Pittsburgh to take on the Steelers (10-7). After losing their first 3 games of the season, & ending up at a 3-5 record after 8 games, the Texans went on to win 9 games in a row to close the season, longest active winning streak in the NFL. Houston is just the 7th team in NFL history to make the playoffs after starting a season 0-3. Their winning streak started with a 36-29 comeback victory over the Jaguars, and it was actually Davis Mills that got Houston across the finish line there. However, things went to another level when C.J. Stroud returned in Week 13. Houston had a Dropback EPA per play of 0.142 from Week 13 on, ranking 9th in the NFL. This led to now the 3rd season in a row that Texans QB C.J. Stroud & head coach DeMeco Ryans have won 10+ games. The Steelers on the other hand, barely made into the playoffs winning 4 of their last 5 games. The Pittsburgh offense is on its best stretch of the season. They have averaged 23 points in their last 5 games & have scored 26+ in 4 of their last 5 games, including 26 points last week. After losing to the then 4-12 Cleveland Browns Week 17 in what should’ve been a must win game, they then went on to beat the Ravens in the last week of the regular season after the rookie Ravens kicker missed a FG, putting Pittsburgh Steelers in the playoffs for the 13th time in Mike Tomlin’s 19 seasons & saving his job. In a game with 2 good defenses & not extremely explosive offenses, this one has the lowest game total of the Wild Card Round. Pittsburgh averaged 10.6 plays of 10+ yards per game (27th). Houston averaged 11.2 per game (24th). Houston ranked 28th in offensive success rate (38.8%), the lowest of any team in the postseason. Pittsburgh ranked 20th (41.1%). The Steelers have scored 101 points off turnovers (3rd) while Houston has scored 90 (4th). A Steelers streak will be ending on Monday night, Pittsburgh will get their 1st playoff win since 2016, or they will have their 1st loss in Pittsburgh on Monday night in 35 years. Pittsburgh’s 6 consecutive playoff losses is the longest active streak in the NFL. The only way they’re going to have a shot at winning this one will be an high performance game by their 42 year old QB.\n\nSteelers QB Aaron Rodgers is making his first playoff start since 2021. He ranks 4th all time in career playoff yards (5,894) & 3rd all time in career playoff TD’s (45). Rodgers comes into this game throwing the football more than he has all season. Rodgers finished the year by throwing for 247.2 yards per game over the last 5 games after averaging 189.6 yards per game before that. His 3 highest yardage totals came in that span. In the Steelers last 3 games, he threw the ball 39+ times, the most he had thrown before those games was 36 back in October. __Rodgers now has 5 games in a row with 21+ completions, averaging 25 completions in his last 5.__ Last week in a must win game vs the Ravens, Rodgers threw 47 times & completed 31 passes. Rodgers finished with 21+ completions in 10 of 16. The way he is able to rack up so many completions is his extremely fast time to throw. __Rodgers time to throw on average is 2.56 seconds, fastest in the NFL amongst all 36 QB’s with 250 dropbacks. 56.4% of his passes have come within 2.5 seconds of the snap, the highest rate in the league.__ All of his passes have been short quick throws. 22.9% of his attempts are behind the line of scrimmage & 45% are between 0-9 yards downfield. He is averaging just 6.7 yards per pass. __On top of that the Texans defense primarily runs use Cover 3 coverage. Rodgers has a 67.7% completion percentage, completing 90 of 133 passes vs Cover 3 this season. Also, when facing QB’s that get the ball out in less than 2.56 seconds, Houston has allowed a 69.2% completion percentage for 1,777 yards, 6.2 yards per pass, 12 TD’s, & 4 INT’s this season.__ When opponents have held the ball longer, Houston allowed just a 47.7% completion rate (3rd) & 6.9 yards per attempt (4th). Houston has been elite at getting after the QB this season ranking 4th in the NFL in pressure rate (40.7%). Rodgers quick pass style & the Steelers OL have led to the Steelers allowing the lowest pressure rate in the league at just 25% & lowest now blitz pressure rate at 25.4%. On top of that the Steelers have passed on 58.81% of plays this year, 8th most. While Texans opponents have passed on 59.39% of plays, 8th most. The Texans rank 4th in the NFL in rushing yards allowed per game at just 93.7. They rank 3rd in the NFL in Rush EPA per play allowed (-0.124 The Steelers are going to look get Rodgers going in this one. Especially with star WR DK Metcalf back from injury after decking a fan. __The Texans have allowed 21+ in 3 of their last 4 games & 2 of those QB’s were Riley Leonard & Jacoby Brissett.__ With the Texans having one of the best secondary’s in the league, all signs point to Rodgers peppering his WR’s at close range & dumping it off to RB’s.\n\nThe 42 year old QB gets us back in the green.\n\n__Aaron Rodgers o20.5 completions__\n\nAppreciate the love!

Will add some personal information in this write-up as well.\n\n• ⁠Model has Texans ML set at 58% \n\n• Model projects Texans -3.5 hitting at 54% \n\n• EV better betting 100$ = 10-12$ for this play\n\n• I am all over Texans defense in this one - they have one of the best defenses in the league, giving up only 298 YPG, and averaging 17 PPG - they have a top 5 defense in almost every category this season - they are flying high, leaning on their defense, riding a awesome 9 game win streak - When you look at their turnover differential as of late, they are +17 - I can see the Steelers having some turnover issues in this game because of Houston’s D - I am not sold on the Steelers, they are a very average team at most - I really don’t see how Rodgers is able to have a vintage Rodgers game with this Houston defense - The defensive edge that Houston brings is the top reason why I like them -3 today - I don’t see how Rodgers and the Steelers do much against this defense, and believe the line would be closer to -6.5 if the Texans played at home - Although the Texans offense isn’t GREAT by any means, I think they squeak this one out - let’s hope Stroud can turn it up, Nico Collins get’s his & the Texans go back to Houston with the W - Texans -3 \n\nPOTD History: [https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/SoggyDatabase2348-bvjHUn](https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/SoggyDatabase2348-bvjHUn)\n\nBOL!\n\n**POTD: NFL: Houston Texans -3 vs. Steelers -105 (1U TO WIN 0.95U)**\n\nTips are greatly appreciated - Proceeds will be going towards my student loans and my morning cold brews.

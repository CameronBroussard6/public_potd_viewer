Although the Ivy league might not be strong this year - I love Penn. They currently have the best coach - Frank McCaffery and player - TJ Power in the Ivy league. They outmatch Lafayette in every category this season but two (FT% and Turnovers). Penn with a Kenpom ranking of 235 and Lafayette with a ranking of 331 - give me Penn at home. \n\nCharleston Southern -3.5 - They currently have a top 25 scorer in Brycen Blaine and have been competitive in every single game they have played this season besides their first game at VTech. They are playing a SC State team who is HORRIBLE. They are constantly getting beat by double digits game in and game out. I bought some points to make it safe at -3.5 \n\n\n\nCharleston Southern -3.5 - Currently , they have a top 25 scorer in the nation with Brycen Blaine and they have been competitive in every game they have been in this year besides their first game at Vtech.

They have had a tough road show with two losses in a row and they are going to look to finish strong against the kraken who have lost 5 in a row. The Wild have the tenth ranked PP but the Kraken have the worst defensive PP in the league so look for the Wild to capitalize on that for the win.",

I could make all the excuses in the world as to why neither team won but we don’t do that here. Chalk it up as an L and bounce back. We move. \n\nA lot of people are going to look at this game and jump on Incarnate Word. They are the easy choice especially if you glance over at the New Orleans side and see that UNO has lost six straight. \n\nSure, UNO is on a six game skid but I have to remind myself that they have played a gauntlet of a non conference season so far. Majority of their losses were actually close battles vs P5 opponents. I also look at their wins and want to remind everyone that New Orleans two wins this year came against TCU and Tulane. They also almost sneaked one out against a solid Miss State squad. \n\nI also really like how New Orleans forces offenses to up their tempo by putting a lot of ball pressure on the opponents. Which is something Incarnate Word doesn’t like to do (being speed up) as they rank 339th in the country in avg length of possession. They like to run sets and fail to get out in transition much whereas UNO doesn’t mind running and speeding up the game. UNO also ranks 49th in avg length of possession on the defensive end. I think we see UNO bring the pressure and speed IW up and never allow them to get into any rhythm. \n\nIncarnate Word on the other hand just had a big win vs Mcneese the other day, yet followed it up with a bad loss to a 1-7 Nicholls State team. Besides that Mcneese win they haven’t really beat anyone noteworthy. \n\nIncarnate Word is also one of those teams that lives and dies by the three. This bodes well towards UNO as they rank 64th in the country in defending the three. Adjusted tempo is what has been my main tell all sign regarding capping these games. UNO is 96th overall in the country whereas IW is ranked 300th in adjusted tempo. \n\nFinal thoughts:  Incarnate Word hasn’t won an away game this year. Meanwhile UNO hasn’t won at home this year. Something’s gotta give and I believe it will be UNO putting this game in the win column. UNO is talented and that reflects in the wins they had at TCU and at Tulane they just have had a brutal schedule so far which reflects in their record. \n\nHow I officially see this game going is IW has a few guys in foul trouble early which limits them from running the lineup they like to run 25% of the time. I also think the ball pressure and 3 point defense from New Orleans will cause havoc and get IW all out of their offensive scheme. Which is slow slow slow then jack up a three. \n\nNew Orleans at home in plus money is such beautiful sight to see. When UNO is on they beat teams that are P5 and P6 and even when they don’t have their best stuff they aren’t getting blown out. \n\nI think New Orleans is a gift here at +110. I wouldn’t be shocked to see this line move to +120 maybe even +130 before tip.\n\nPrediction New Orleans 79 Incarnate Word 74\n\nThanks for reading and good luck. Let’s get back on the winning train why don’t we. \n\nBC 🫶",

Silly typo!\n\nToday’s POTD: 🏈 Justin Herbert under 31.5 passing attempts (-104).\n\nGame starts at 8:15pm EST. Bet 4.5U\n\nWriteup: For Monday Night football, we have the LA Chargers hosting the Philadelphia Eagles. There’s a lot of uncertainty in this game given some injuries on both sides of the field, as well as players coming back from or playing through an injury. Chargers RB Omarion Hampton is making his first start in 7 weeks, and the market is absolutely smashing the over on his rushing attempts. While there is a lot of validity to this, I think it is safer to assume that the Chargers would like to establish their run game as a whole instead of relying on a player coming back from injury. Defensive superstar Jalen Carter will be out for the Eagles in this one, giving the Chargers another reason to want to establish a run game. Given this likelihood for a run-heavy attack, I like looking at the passing attack and saying that Herbert will throw the ball less than 32 times in this one, especially considering he is also dealing with a hand injury he is playing through.\n\nRemember to only bet what you can afford to lose, and BOL!",

Hurts has dipped below 200 passing yards in four of his last six starts against top-10 pass defenses, often relying on his legs (he’s over 30 rushing yards in 8 straight) when the pocket collapses under pressure from LA’s front seven, which ranks top 10 in sacks and QB hits. The Eagles scheme might lean heavier on Saquon Barkley to grind out yards (he’s cleared 70 rush yards in 7 of 10 games), limiting Hurts dropbacks and targets to A.J. Brown or DeVonta Smith—projections model him around 175-185 yards here, making the under a sharp play at -112 with the line holding steady across books and value against a total of 42 that screams defensive battle.",

United are finally playing with that spark again, you can see it in the passing, the movement, the grit. Wolves will come in snarling like they always do, but United will pat ’em on the head and send ’em home quiet. The midfield’s tighter, the attack’s sharper, and the defense finally looks like it drank its morning coffee instead of hot water. Back in my day, we called this “handling business,” and that’s exactly what United will do. Goals will come, mark my words — one early to hush the noise, another late just to show who’s boss. Trust these old bones, lad… United are taking this one ⚽️⚽️",

I feel like he’s gonna be a difference maker in this game and fill up the stat sheet. Anybody who’s watched the Pacers over the last few years knows how important of a role he plays on this team and even down the stretch coach Carlisle relies on him to run the offense and be the steady hand. He’s gone over this line in 7/10 games, and playing against the Kings I love our chances. Kings are 26/30 in defensive rating and playing the Pacers at home McConnell feeds off that Indiana crowd. I like the Pacers to cover also, but going with arguably the best backup PG(based off how he impacts winning) in the league tonight!

The line tells me they expect them to break the goalless streak today.  Man U gives up almost 2 goals a game on the road.  Wolves are giving up more than 2 goals a game at home. Wolves can essentially already be penciled in for relegation so I expect to see an open game with a lot of chances from both teams.  Good luck",

He was a full participant in Sunday's practice and assuming he comes back and gets atleast 20 minutes, this is a very attainable line against the Pelicans.\n\nCastle is having an amazing year two as a primary ball handler for the Spurs and is averaging 7.5 assists per game. He’s had 5+ assists in 89% of games this season and 6+ assists in 69%. When playing 20+ minutes this season, Castle is averaging 13.6 potential assists, with a 75% hit rate on this prop.\n\nHe gets a very soft matchup against the  Pelicans who allow the second most assists this season. Castile has already played against them twice this season, averaging 9.5 assists on 15.5 potentials and going over this line both times.\n\nOther combo guards have found success playmaking against the Pelicans include:\nEgor Demin (7 AST)\nAustin Reaves (8 AST)\nCam Spencer (7 AST)\nTre Jones (11 AST)\nBrandon Williams (12 AST)\n\nCastle will likely allow DeAaron Fox to be the primary scorer for this game and focus on running the offense and facilitating. Even if he’s limited, he can get this done in 20-25 minutes.",

Los Angeles will be looking to rely heavily on their running game with Justin Herbert's hand injury and Hampton's return couldn't have come at a better time. \n\nAlthough the Chargers offensive line in pass protection is the teams most blaring weakness, their ability to run the ball has been respectable, even with their injuries at RB all season. Philadelphia has struggled defending the run and has allowed 160 yards and 4.8 per carry over their last 3. Also on top of not being able to effectively stop running backs on the ground, the Eagles rank 28th in receiving yards allowed to RBs (39ypg). Without Jalen Carter in the lineup, Philadelphia will have their work cutout for them in stopping the Chargers heavy offensive sets and outside runs.\n\nBefore his injury Hampton hit this mark in 4/5 games and will have fresh legs coming into this game. Even if the Chargers plan on having Hampton on a snap count, I believe he should clear the line easily.\n\nTail or fade BOL to everyone and cheers! 🍻",

Let’s go baby!\n\nEvent: Sabres @ Flames (NHL) (8pm central)\n\nPOTD: Over 6.5 (+115) (1U) \n\nWrite up:\n\nThe Sabres enter this matchup trying to snap a two game losing streak in which they have allowed a combined 9 goals in those two games. Meanwhile the flames enter having won two straight at home and will remain at home for this one. They have heated up recently. In their last 10 games both teams are bottom 12 in goals allowed. The Sabres though are 8th in goals scored over this period. Both are top 9 in goals expected over this period with the Sabres ranking first. Both are bottom 12 in save percentage over this period as well. The Sabres are also 2nd in shots on goal with the flames sitting around 15. The flames have been playing a lot better as of late and look the odds are -110 both ways. If this game is expected to be competitive than the over is worth a look at + money because the Sabres will be highly motivated to get back on track offensively after two blowout losses but their defense hasn’t been great and the flames have some momentum on home ice. However we know damn well the Sabres can light up the score board and the flames have got some momentum of their own. Not to mention both teams rank inside the top 5 in high danger shots for over the last 10 games. Not to mention these same two teams played each other last month and the Sabres lost 6-2 at home! There will be revenge on their minds going into this game as they look to get back on track offensively here. Not to mention the Sabres have allowed 4+ goals in 5 of their last 10 games and the flames have won 6 of their last 10. Gimme the over for the plus money. As always, cheers 🍻",

Their first-quarter scoring has been above league average, largely due to their disciplined ball movement, ability to hit open shots, and tendency to exploit mismatches early. Tonight’s matchup further favors the Spurs, as their opponent has struggled historically in the opening quarter, often allowing fast-paced teams to dictate tempo and rack up early points.\n\nAdditionally, the Spurs’ depth on both ends of the floor gives them an advantage over a team that relies heavily on one or two primary scorers. This not only increases the likelihood of a first-quarter lead but also positions them to sustain that momentum into the full game. The -135 odds on FanDuel for a first-quarter winner and match winner represent value given their statistical trends, matchup dynamics, and recent form. A 5-unit allocation is justified for this play, considering both the probability of hitting and potential payout.",

However, they are coming off a late 4-3 win on Saturday vs Seattle on the road. They proved they can play the whole game from start to finish with a late goal to win.\n\nDetroit’s defensive/opponent-goals-against numbers (GAA) are slightly better or comparable to Vancouver’s. \n\nDetroit is scoring more aggressively than Vancouver (higher GF/G) and also is slightly out-shooting them (SF/G).\n\nDefensively, Detroit also gives up fewer shots per game and slightly fewer goals per game (GAA) than Vancouver — indicating modest defensive and goaltending edge.\nDetroit’s power play and penalty–kill rates are significantly better than Vancouver’s.\n\nVancouver has been struggling this season, at the very bottom of the Pacific Division standings. The Red Wings look back on track to how they started the season hot after Saturday’s win. There’s no reason why they can’t jump right back onto their winning train. They’re on the road again vs Vancouver, but that shouldn’t phase them since they’re coming off an intense road win.",

I will take this one on the chin...it was just a tough loss honestly but really pleased with my read of the game. While the Bears had a lackluster first half, it felt like the only thing the packers found success on offensively was when the Bears sent blitz packages which Love absolutely diced up. It was unfortunate in the end that they had Jacobs bottled up on 3rd and 1 and couldn't make a tackle that would've given the Packers 3 instead of 7. Then caleb unable to find moore underneath on the final play that would've scored the TD. Had he even thrown it to the end zone with a little more velocity and not underthrown it, feel like this would be a different story. just the way it goes sometimes :(\n\n**Event:** Los Angeles Chargers vs Philadelphia Eagles NFL\n\n**POTD:** Los Angeles Chargers Moneyline (+115) 5 units\n\n**Rationale:** Will keep it short and to the point. The Eagles offense has looked lackluster lately (15.5 point average over the past 4 games) and I expect it to continue against the Chargers. The issue is that they're not utilizing Saquon well and Hurts has clearly taken a step back. They found some signs of life feeding Brown, but I anticipate LAC will key in on this to neutralize Brown and Smith as much as possible. More importantly, the Chargers defense has been rock solid against the run all year, barely giving up anything on the ground and consistently getting off the field on third down. Offensively, they finally found rhythm in the run game last week with nearly 200 rushing yards and a pair of scores, and now they get a Philly front that’s been leaking yards and losing leverage in the run game all season. With the return of Hampton, I anticipate this Chargers offense to find its groove backed by the likes of QJ, Gadsden, and Allen. Put those pieces together, and this is a spot where L.A.’s strengths line up perfectly with the Eagles’ weaknesses\n\nJust to reiterate, in conjunction with my model, I use the eye test as well as my gut feeling to play what I believe is the most-valuable pick on the slate. Cheers to a great game, and please remember to gamble responsibly and to only wager what you can afford to lose.\n\nBOL!",

Good to be back to winning ways.\n\nSport: Italian Serie A - Torino vs. AC Milan @ 2:45pm EST\n\nPick: AC Milan Win + Under 4 Goals = +130 (5 units)\n\nWrite Up: Torino has been in poor form, they’re not a great team. They’re currently on a five game losing streak and took a big home loss to Como on Nov 24th, proving their grounds aren’t a “12th man.” AC Milan, on the other hand, has the best defence in Serie A so far this season, they’ve only let in 9 goals. AC Milan isn’t a team that wins by large margins either, they’ve scored 5 goals in their last 5 games (2 of which were against Parma). Allegri has kept AC Milan very focused on defense and therefore I believe they’ll score first with the fire power they have (Pulisic, Modric and Leao) and then do what they do best, defend. \n\nIf you find my insight useful, please feel free to donate to BuyMeACoffee:\n\nhttps://buymeacoffee.com/5c2y4cxvy5e\n\nAs you all know, bet only what you're willing to lose!\n\nBOL!",

She's quite short, but her court speed and agility are fantastic. Not only that, but she also serves at a high percentage for someone with her height and has a powerful backhand. Currently ranked 69th, she certainly can be at least a top 30 player.\n\nPieri was never able to get out of the top 200, and fast surfaces were never her speciality. If we look at her current season, she played 52 matches on clay and only 13 matches on hard courts. When it comes to recent form, she isn't performing particularly well, having lost 5 out of her last 6 matches in straight sets (all on clay). The Italian player is only 1.60m and should struggle to close service games against a player of Kartal's quality from the baseline.\n\nThese types of handicaps can certainly be dangerous when the underdog has the possibility of doing a phenomenal game, but I'm quite certain that this will be a walk in the park for Kartal. Expect her to dominate Pieri on an indoor hard court.\n\nGood luck!",

      "text": "__POTD Record:__ 59-29-1 (+65.0u)\n\n__Previous Pick:__ [✅ Chris Rodriguez o41.5 rushing yards (-115), 3.5u](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/s/v30qKRN7sL)\n\n__Event:__ NFL: Eagles @ Chargers 8:15pm EST\n\n__POTD:__ AJ Brown o60.5 receiving yards (-110), 3.3u to win 3u\n\n__Write Up:__ The 8-4 Philadelphia Eagles are traveling to LA to take on the 8-4 Chargers on Monday Night Football. Just 2 games ago the Chargers were blown out 6-35 by the Jags, then luckily had a bye week the following week. They used the rest & put a beat down on the (2-10) Raiders 31-14. They are currently 2 games back behind the Broncos in the AFC West & are looking to gain stay in contention for the top spot of the Division. The Eagles suffered their 2nd straight loss last week to the Bears on Black Friday in their last game 24-15, but they still are on top of the NFC East. Starting OL Lane Johnson was injured with a foot injury & has this has significantly affected the Eagles run game, leading to more passing.\n\nNo team in the NFL has won more games than the defending Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles (47-16), since the start of the 2022 season. The Eagles offense has been stagnant lately, but they have played some good competition. Whereas the Chargers have had a weak schedule. The Chargers have done really well at shutting down the pass. LA ranks 7th in the NFL in EPA/Dropback allowed. Phili hasn’t been great through the air lately, but they are still above average passing, ranking 13th in the NFL in EPA/Dropback. QB Jalen Hurts has been slinging deep this season. __Hurts is 2nd in the league in rate of throws 20+ yards downfield (15.2%). He ranks 4th in the NFL in completions of 40+ yards with 8. Hurts has a 118.6 passer rating on those deep throws, the fourth highest in the NFL. Spreading the field has also helped Hurts, who has a league leading 113.3 passer rating in sets with four or five wide receivers.__ Who has Hurts primary downfield target been lately? Star WR AJ Brown. The Eagles may have had a rough game vs the Bears last week, but Brown had a huge game, catching 10 balls for 132 yards & 2 TD’s. Brown has become the focal point of this Eagles offense the past few weeks. __AJ Brown has double digit targets in 3 straight games. Brown leads the NFL in designed/first read targets over the last 3 weeks with 32.__ Over that same time period, other Eagles star WR DeVonta Smith has only 23 designed/first read targets. The pecking order has been reestablished in Philadelphia & AJ Brown is the clear WR1. Brown has been the best receiver in football since then. __In his last 2 games he ranks #1 in Receiving Yards (242), #1 in Receptions (18), & #2 in Targets (22). He has 47% of the Eagles receiving yards in those games.__ He has been the guy the guy all season that they get the ball to when they need to move the ball. __Brown has the 3rd most receiving yards amongst WR’s in the 4th quarter with 268. He has had 50% of the red zone targets over the last 5 weeks.__ The Chargers have great stats this season at shutting down opposing WR’s, but most of the WR’s they’ve played this season have to wear helmets off of the field as well. __All of the pass catchers they’ve played this year that don’t have the tism’ all hit this number this season- Bowers: 4/63, Jakobi Meyers: 5/64, Jettas: 7/74, Alec Pierce: 5/98, Waddle: 6/95, Deebo: 8/96, & Sutton: 6/118.__ Not only is this a good play due to AJ Brown’s recent success, but also due to the Chargers defensive scheme. __The Chargers run Zone coverage at the highest rate in the league, as they only run man on 14.1% of their snaps, the league’s lowest rate.__ Brown has been a monster vs zone defense lately, & Hurts has been targeting him way more than other star Eagles WR Devonta Smith. Here are the 2 WR’s stats vs Zone coverage over the last 3 games:\n\nBrown: 1st Read: 48.8%, Yards/Route: 3.59, Targets/Route: 0.37, Air Yard Share: 44.3%, 1st Down/Route: 0.18, ASS: 0.106 (Average Separation Score)\n\nSmith: 1st Read: 24.4%, Yards/Route: 1.54, Targets/Route: 0.20, Air Yard Share: 36.4%, 1st Down/Route: 0.06, ASS: 0.05\n\nSmith also has been playing in the slot in a majority of his snaps this season. __Devonta has ran 59% of his routes from the slot. Whereas AJ has ran 89% of his routes out wide.__ That’s not good news for Smith as he’ll be lined up against Chargers star defensive back Derwin James Jr. The Chargers have been using safety Derwin James Jr. as their primary slot coverage player. __Among qualified cornerbacks & safeties, James allows the lowest yards per slot coverage snap (0.28), ahead of notable safeties like Kyle Hamilton (0.42) & Minkah Fitzpatrick (0.49).__ Smith is going to struggle this Monday night opening up even more opportunities for AJ. Brown is also much bigger than the Chargers DB’s & I think Hurts continues to target him all game, especially with the run game situation. \n\nEagles RB Saquon Barkley has been a shell of what he was last year. Barkley had 14 games with 100+ rushing yards last season. This season he has just 1 game with 100+. He has only rushed for more than 60 yards twice in his last 10 games, getting held to less than 50 yards in half of those. This week he’ll be behind an offensive line that will be without star LT Lane Johnson. Barkley is not the same back with Johnson off the field as he is with him on. __On 124 rushes with Johnson on the field, Barkley has ran for 4.2 yards per carry with a run of 10 + yards on 11.3% of his carries. With Johnson off the field, Barkley has ran 74 times for 218 yards (2.9 YPC) & a run of 10+ yards on just 4.1% of his carries (38th in the NFL).__ The Eagles are going to have trouble getting things going on the ground & will have to turn to Brown through the air.\n\nIn a defensive game where points are going to be hard to come by, AJ Brown is going to get fed as the most efficient weapon on the field.\n\n__AJ Brown o60.5 receiving yards__\n\nAppreciate the love!

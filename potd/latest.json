They have also split the two games they've played against each other this season. Great value on the dog here.",

He’s been in great form recently, hitting double figures in 7 of his last 8 games and averaging around 15 points during that stretch. Merrill also torched Minnesota in their last matchup, scoring 22 points while playing over 30 minutes, showing he matches up well against their defense. With Cleveland still relying on him for shooting off the bench and his minutes staying consistent, he should get plenty of looks from three. As long as he sees his usual run and knocks down a few shots, the odds favor him clearing 10 points again.",

They have been consistent against mid table and lower sides, especially when they can control possession and dictate the tempo. Oviedo have struggled to create clear chances against stronger opponents and often sit deep, which suits Betis’ patient build up play. With Betis still pushing for important points and showing solid defensive structure away from home, I expect them to get the job done here by at least one goal.\n\nGood Luck! ✌️",

So do other teams. Difference is Rams has a mainly explosive passing offense with a QB with the most passing touchdowns this season. Rams also have stafford throw a lot of 1-yard TDs in the red zone. I think this game is going to be entirely decided on if the panthers defense can handle the rams one more time. Devante Adams returning as well makes this a reasonable pick to take.",

But that also means he's on 1 day rest after dropping 37 in one of the fastest, most frenetic games in recent NBL history. Those aged legs will be feeling it.\n\nI'm expecting some big games from Hunter, Brown and maybe even Foxwell who's been increasingly effective offensively recently. This will detract from Sobey's need to dominate games like he has in the last few.\n\nPerth already hold the stingiest defence against guards this season and coach Rillie just came out saying his team needs to increase their effort on defence, especially against the 3 ball. 44% of Sobey's points this season have come from the 3. Another 18% come at the free throw line but Perth have allowed the fewest free-throws this season.\n\nEverything lines up nicely for a 5U max play.\n\nBOL",

They are incredibly efficient from the field, boasting a 49.4% team shooting percentage and an elite 59% success rate on two-point attempts. This high-powered offense is led by Rafael Castro, who dominates the paint with 16.6 points per game on highly efficient shooting. This makes it very difficult for opposing teams to keep pace, especially a Loyola Chicago squad that has struggled significantly to find its rhythm this season.\n\nIn contrast, Loyola Chicago has faced major uphill battles on both ends of the floor. The Ramblers are currently averaging just 68.8 points per game, ranking them near the bottom of Division I (326th). Their offensive struggles are compounded by a defense that allows over 75 points per game and ranks 350th in defensive rating. Statistically, this creates a \"perfect storm\" for a blowout; George Washington’s elite offense is going up against one of the weakest defenses in the Atlantic 10. With a scoring margin of nearly +15 points per game for the Revolutionaries and a -6.8 margin for the Ramblers, George Washington is well-positioned to cover this spread at home.\n\nFurthermore, depth and home-court advantage play a significant role in this 14.5-point line. George Washington has been reliable at home, covering the spread in 11 of their last 18 games at the Charles E. Smith Center. They feature multiple scoring threats beyond Castro, including Garrett Johnson and Tre Dinkins, which prevents Loyola from focusing their defense on just one player.\n\nI know this is not a fun pick since there is a ton of ball today, but this is the only game where my model picked up an edge.

Towson has also been slipping, losing 4 of their last 5, only putting up 50-60 points a game.  Obviously Towson is a better defensive team and Northeastern is a better offensive team, but if you look into it a bit more, most of Towson's defensive prowess comes from their ability to stop threes (ranked 61st in the nation), but their defense in the paint, the place where NE shoots  60% of their shots, they're ranked 305th defensively.  Although NE isn't a fantastic defensive team, Towson is barely a top 300 offense this season, and NE is an elite team at forcing turnovers, which will allow them to get a ton of free off-steal points. With both these teams playing on 1 day off, I'll take team that played that game at home vs the team having to travel.   Not that it matters much with such a small sample size, but NE is also 3-0 on 1 day off this season, suggesting they might perform better when there's less time between games compared to Towson 0-1 ATS.\n\nModel details: AdjEM model trained on current season data, utilizes a scaling isotonic calibration system to improve model predictiveness without overfitting.  The model existed as a Monte Carlo model but since adjusted it for simplicity and automation purposes as I have a lot less free time nowadays.  Model uses layer 2 adjustments after prediction output to further adjust for less for trends (such as look ahead, rest advantages, let down spots, travel, bounce back etc).  \n\nROI for potds so far is ~34%, overall model performance this season is 10.1%.\n\nGL if tailing as always.\n\n[BMAC](https://buymeacoffee.com/theforecastcard)",

Home team underdogs have a fantastic record in the first round of the playoffs, so let’s capitalize on it.\n\nThis bet is mainly due to the fact that this game will be played in some snow and high winds, along with the Packers defense being quite weak ever since Micah Parsons went down with an injury. I expect Bears coach Ben Johnson to have some nice designed run packages in this game to take advantage of both of those previously mentioned factors. The Packers run game has looked weak recently as their running back Josh Jacob’s has not been himself. I also prefer Bears QB Caleb Williams over Packers QB Jordan Love in these conditions, as Caleb has been able to throw with much more power to cut through the high winds and snow. I also think the Bears kicker will preform better in these conditions compared to the Packers. At the end of the day, there are a ton of small factors that cumulate together to create a scenario where the Bears should be the better team in this one. Not a ton of stats beyond the fact that the Bears should find some solid success running on this Packers defense, and I like them as the better team in this one. Worst case, they’ll lose to a last second field goal and only lose by a point.\n\nRemember to only bet what you can afford to lose, and BOL!",

Caleb Williams has **covered this 5 in a row & 15/17 on the season**, with one of the two missing by 3 yards. In this most recent run he’s **thrown for 186 & 250 against these very Packers**, both crucial games in the NFC North battle.\n\nHis improvement this season has surprisingly been above the hips, as he’s shown immense growth in his decision making throwing the ball. Because of this, **I expect him to have to sling it no matter if Chicago is winning or losing this game.**\n\n*Green Bay do have a strong Pass D*, but as we’ve seen over the last few weeks, Williams has shown the ability and trust to throw the ball when the game is on the line. I’m expecting this to cover based on pure situational volume alone. **Williams was 6th in the NFL in 4th quarter passing yards, with 19 plays of 20 yards or more (2nd in the league)**.\n\nWhy am I bringing this up? It’s a script, that’s why: **Williams has 5 4th-quarter comebacks this season, the most by any player in the NFL in 2025**. ***This is a tortured fanbase, and I expect the game to come down to another Caleb Williams drive - win or lose, we should get the yards.***\n\nLast play review:\n\n***CFP - Indiana -2.5 (-151) 1.5u*** ✅\n\n(A sweat free domination - what we deserve after that Miami bullshit. Not much to dwell on here, a good old fashioned college football ass whooping)\n\nBOL if you’re tailing, and if not BOL in general.",

PSV are top of the league and have won most of their recent games, while Excelsior sit lower in the table and have lost most of their away matches. In their head-to-head record PSV dominate, winning nearly every meeting and scoring many more goals than Excelsior over time. Even with some injuries to key PSV players, their squad depth and attacking strength remain strong and they should control possession and create plenty of chances. Statistics show PSV score a lot at home, averaging well over two goals per match, and they often hit three or more against weaker opponents like Excelsior. Given this form and history, PSV look likely to score at least three goals and keep Excelsior to few chances, so PSV over 2.5 team goals looks strong, and both teams to score is unlikely because Excelsior struggle to score against top sides. Expect a comfortable PSV win with multiple goals for the home team.\n\nThis is the one Ive been waiting for.  If i lose this one .. Im quit this sub.\n\nBest of luck.",

They are walking into this game 2-0 in SEC play, and 7-1 in their last 8, with 3 of those 7 coming against ranked opponents. They have the #12 rated offense in the country, and a defense that holds its weight at #63. Freshman Darius Acuff Jr. has really found his groove within this offense, scoring 26+ against Tennessee, Ole Miss, and Houston, who has overall looked like a top-10 team in the country on the defensive side of the ball. He will be the player to watch in this game.\n\nNow let's turn to Auburn. Steven Pearl's crew has played 5 ranked opponents this year, and has lost *every single one.* Although, I'll concede that they played then-ranked #1 Houston really close. They have yet to show the ability to win against top competition, even at Neville Arena. Their defense has been lagging, and currently sits outside of the top 100 in net rating. \n\nAnother metric I have my eye on is the pace both teams play at. Arkansas games have been fast-moving, whereas Auburn games have been relatively middle of that pack in that regard. If Arkansas can establish their tempo, they should have no issues with scoring.\n\nWhile Auburn is no doubt a formidable team with plenty of high-value players, I believe that the Razorbacks match up well and are the stronger team heading into this contest and I love the value I'm getting at -102.\n\nBOL🫡",

I personally find it hard to believe Love is gonna march into Chicago and steal this game after not playing a full game in about a month. Obviously the Bears don’t have much to show for themselves in recent memory but you can sort of feel a culture being restored there. That place is gonna be rowdy as ever especially against the Packers. I really don’t expect the Packers offense to come out strong given what’s transpired the last month. And given the fact the Bears have the best turnover differential the outcome of this game is truly up to Chicago. So all things considered, why will Chicago win this game? 1. Green Bay will be out of rhythm, 2. Turnover battle, 3. Home field advantage/new chapter in Chicago. Best of luck guys, let me know if you’re tailing and have a great saturday!",

The line currently sits at 10.5, so for not much more juice I’ve bought the extra point at -9.5 to leave it as simple as a win by double digits. As of this writing, 62% of the public is on the Panthers to cover - accounting for 51% of the handle. I’ll fade that all day. \n\nThe Panthers did beat the Rams during the regular season, but that was a Rams squad that wasn’t at full strength in a letdown spot after having not lost in over a month (this was a stretch with dominant wins over playoff teams like Jacksonville, San Francisco & a nail biter over Seattle). With reinforcements back by the names of Davante Adams & Tyler Higbee to accompany Puka Nacua, MVP candidate in Matthew Stafford at QB and one of the best coaches in the league in Sean McVay - you know the Rams are going to come out with the intention to make a statement. These are different stakes & there will be no looking past these Panthers after last time - it’s going to be pedal through the floor. To be frank, the Rams are simply much more talented & have been here before, with championship pedigree up & down the roster.\n\nMeanwhile, Carolina is here on the technicality that their entire division stinks, & they happened to stink the least. Having a losing record yet getting to host a playoff game is laughable. While the franchise is definitely trending in the right direction long term under Dave Canales, and they are at home, the time is now for the Rams. Gimme LA to roll through Carolina onto the divisional round. \n\nBut of course, what do I know?",

They are the defending champions, have played the best football this tournament and probably have the most well rounded squad. They are a young, dynamic team with ability going both ways. It should be enough to see of Egypt. Egypt haven't played all too well this competition. And despite their forward line, I think they are outclassed in the middle of the field by the Ivorians. Egypt have largely underperfomed in the past 15 or so years and they're in a slight bit of a transition period and are weaker now than usual.\n\n**Additional Thoughts**: Short write up with very little facts or arguements. It's just I feel that Ivory Coast are the better side, nothing else. I wouldn't blame you at all for ignoring it. But it's a bit of fun to maybe have someone to cheer for in the tournament if you don't already. Heartbreaking end to the game yesterday.

Fortunately though, she hung in just long enough to get us our win. 💰💲\n___\nBack to the same logic for Kostyuk's next match versus Jessica Pegula.  Their last meeting in China last October went 3 sets with Pegula finally pulling away in the 3rd with a 6-1 win, but this is an even more competitive version of Kostyuk that Jess will be facing today. \n\nBoth of these ladies have been shown to be resilient and willing to wiggle into long rallies which usually leads to more games.   Pegula has strong baseline consistency and Kostyuk has the ability to extend points and win breaks.  Although Pegula is slightly favored, I again predict that Kostyuk will start strong and steal at least a set (if not win the match outright, but choosing a side here is incredibly difficult).  Even when she finds herself behind, Pegula is definitely not one to concede anything, and both are both confident enough to create long, drawn-out points.  The close line (Pegula -135) is also a strong indicator that this may be a close match.  I see this one going back and forth quite a bit, so OVER 21.5 total games is once again the pick.  BOL!",

Both teams have done well to get to this stage, but Team USA has struggled a bit more thanks to inconsistent performances from Taylor Fritz and Coco Gauff. Fritz played more matches than almost anyone on tour in 2025, but he unfortunately didn't get to enjoy a relaxing offseason, as he revealed that he's currently battling some \"pretty serious tendinitis\" in his knee, and his main goal in the offseason was to rehab it. In three matches here at the United Cup, Fritz hasn't looked great, losing to clay-courter Sebastian Baez and a resurgent Stefanos Tsitsipas but scoring a narrow victory over Spanish grinder Jaume Munar. He didn't look terrible in the most recent match against Tsitsipas, but struggled immensely on return, generating just two break points. While Hubert Hurkacz also has some fitness concerns given that this is his first event back from a long injury layoff, he hasn't exactly showed it so far, with the highlight being a massive win over ATP #3 Alexander Zverev in his first match back. Hurkacz always plays well here in Australia, as the lively conditions boost his already incredible serve, and it's tough to see Fritz breaking him much. Hubi also has an aggressive enough baseline game to take over rallies if Fritz falls into a pattern of pushing off the backhand wing. If this match goes long, I trust Hurkacz's fitness more right now, and I feel that he should be a slight favorite here. I chose the +0.5 games handicap because I prefer these odds, but Hurkacz ML at around +100 is also a totally reasonable option. Just note that they aren't exactly the same bet (as +0.5 games could cash even if Hurkacz loses, or the other way around).",

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 8-26-3 *A very rare no sweat cash! As predicted, Ross County turned UP despite their problems and had everything under control for a smooth 2-0 victory. Yeah, I can't believe it either. Only time will tell if it's just a case of a broken clock being right or if I can actually get a winning streak going for real. I have to say I really like today's football schedule and it was really difficult to pick between 3 picks, but I've picked the one I have the most faith in (be on the lookout for the other ones that I'll post in the other thread). That said, it's been ages since I've hit two picks in a row, so faders might be in a good spot today 👀*\n\n*I just want to say a huge shoutout to the three tippers, your contribution means more than you know.*\n\n**Last Five:** ✅❌❌❌✅\n\n**Event:** A-League Men, Melbourne Victory v Sydney Wanderers, starts in 6 hours and 4 minutes\n\n**POTD:** Sydney Wanderers 0.0 Asian Handicap, +175, 1 unit\n\n**Write Up:** Using the same logic here and fading a team that seems to be the strong favourite on paper, yet their ML odds are suspiciously high. Just from my experience, these kind of matchups often have slip-ups, especially in the UK and the Australian leagues, so I'm looking forward to this one.\n\nHear me out. Yes, Melbourne Victory arrive into this match on 4 wins in a row and 6th on the league table. Yes, Sydney are basically the complete opposite with 3 losses in a row (4L 1D in the last 5 league matches) and are dead last. But this is a rivalry and all logic seems to fly out of the window in those, especially in the Australian league that's full of upsets.\n\nThe H2H proves my earlier point. Looking at direct meetings, Western Sydney still match up well historically. In 34 previous league meetings between these two clubs, Victory have 16 wins to Wanderers’ 12, with **six draws**, showing this fixture’s competitive nature. Victory’s average of almost *2 goals per match* *against Western Sydney* is balanced by the fact that **Wanderers have secured draws in over 40% of H2H meetings** and I believe they're capable of even more today. Both teams have been involved in **matches with over 1.5 goals fairly frequently**, but draws and narrow margins remain common in A-League rivalry fixtures. All things considered, I'm taking the 0.0 AH here (also known as DNB, but with better odds on some books), just in case a draw does occur. If Melbourne weren't playing at home, I wouldn't even bother taking the DNB and would go straight to the Sydney Wanderers ML. If you want to take the BTTS and the over 2.5 goals route, I don't mind those either. BOL, let's get an early one out of the way and enjoy the weekend ☘️🫡\n\n☘️ Tip jar: [https://buymeacoffee.com/sigmabale](https://buymeacoffee.com/sigmabale)",

Victory are aggressive going forward at home but often concede chances, while the Wanderers attack with speed and intensity. Neither side is comfortable sitting back, which usually leads to an open game. With both teams capable of scoring multiple goals and defensive mistakes likely, this matchup strongly points toward over 3.5 goals.",

This is only the 14th time a team has been favored by at least 10 points in the Wild Card round. Teams favored by 10 plus points are 12-1 SU, 10-3 ATS all time in Wild Card games. Teams who made the playoffs last season vs a team that didn't are 33-16-1 ATS (67.3%). Road Wild Card teams entering on a one game win streak are 16-4-1 ATS (80%). Wild Card hosts that missed the playoffs the year before are 14-30 ATS (32%). The Rams have the 2nd best odds to win the Super Bowl. Over the last 10 years, each Super Bowl winner had 11+ regular season wins, averaged at least a +4.5 ppg game margin, had at least 365 yards/game, & allowed no more than 130 rush yards/game. The Rams are one of just 2 teams that fit that criteria this year. The Rams enter the playoffs as the league's highest scoring offense & have the 2nd highest point differential (+172). Carolina is 23rd in point differential (-69), & the only team in the postseason this year with a negative scoring margin. Only 3 teams have had a worse point differential & made playoffs in NFL history. Panthers coach Dave Canales limped into the playoffs this year for the first time in his head coaching career with a 8-9 record, having lost 3 of his last 4 games. He’ll now face Sean McVay who is one of the rare coaches with a winning career playoff record (8-5) & a Super Bowl ring. The Rams are #1 in EPA/Play (0.13) & points per drive (2.8), #1 in down conversion rate (78.8%), & #1 yards per play (6.2). Panthers defense allows a 74.9% conversion rate (26th), 2.3 points per drive (25th), & are 20th in DEF EPA (-0.03). \n\nThey played earlier this season with the Panthers upsetting the Rams. Carolina had a pick 6, a deflected INT in their own end zone, & a strip sack with the Rams in game tying FG position. Those 3 plays resulted in a -16.1 EPA for the Rams, the most significant turnover swing for the Panthers in a game this season & the worst for the Rams this season. Carolina had the ball for 35:16 of the clock, their largest time of possession this season. The Rams averaged 7.4 yards per play (4th highest). The Rams only faced 5 third downs all game, had 1 penalty, & scored a TD on 4 of 5 possessions w/o a turnover. They had a 76% rushing success rate, averaging 0.53 EPA/rush, highest in the NFL. They averaged 3.05 yards before contact. Kyren injured his ankle & left in the 1st half & with just 13 carries & still had 72 rushing yards. __Kyren has 70+ rushing yards in 8 of his last 10 games, averaging 78 ypg. The last 7 games that he had 13+ carries he rushed 72+ yards in every game, averaging 83.3 yards in those games.__ He hasn’t had fewer than 12 carries all season. The Rams have the best run blocking OL in the NFL. They avg 2.0 yards before contact (best in the NFL) & a 13.2% run stuff rate (5th), allowing the fewest sacks. Carolina has allowed the 7th most ybc this season at 2.36 & have given up 157.3 rushing yards in their last 3 games, 4th most. The Panthers rank 27th in Rush EPA (-0.025) & have allowed the 6th most rushing TD’s (20). Since the Panthers upset vs the Rams they have averaged just 16 ppg in the last 4. The Rams averaged 36.8 ppg in their last 5. Opposing RB’s are averaging 29.8 carries a game vs the Panthers in their last 5 games (minus the Saints). Books have his rush attempts at 14.5. He’s over in 6/6 games this season with at least 14+ carries. The opposing lead RB has cleared their rushing line in 9/10 games vs CAR: Irving 62.5 -> 85, Charbs 38.5 -> 110, Bucky 63.5 -> 71, Kyren 64.5 -> 72, CMC 68.5 -> 89, Bijan 74.5 -> 104, Kamara 37.5 -> 83.\n\nWilliams has been one of the best RBs at Zone concept runs. He averages 5.19 yards per carry, with a 63.7% success rate (1st). He ranks #1 in rate of man gap run rate, on 48% of his rushing attempts. Against man gap runs Carolina is allowing 5.8 ypc (30th) & 2.9 ybc (31st). Kyren is the #1 RB in the NFL in Run Success rate at 50.1%. Also McVay loves to feed Kyren come playoff time. He has even said publicly he has given Blake Corum the RB2 work this season to keep Kyren healthy for the playoffs. In last year’s playoffs, Kyren averaged 17.5 carries for 91 yards. In their elimination loss to the eventual Super Bowl Champion Eagles, Kyren ran for 106 yards on 19 carries, averaging 5.6 yards per carry. The Eagles last season had the 2nd best EPA run defense in the NFL (-0.194). He’ll have plenty of chances too as the Rams average 63.9 plays per game, 7th most. They rank 6th in tempo running a play every 28.9 seconds.\n\nThere’s a 75% chance of rain with 15 mph winds & gusts up to 40 mph. Having had 3 TO’s last game vs Carolina McVay is going to want to play it safe & run the ball. The Rams rank #1 in offensive efficiency with the lowest offensive variance in the NFL, while having the #2 toughest schedule. 13 of their 17 games came were against teams with 8+ wins. Against non division playoff teams, Carolina is 2-5 with an avg score of 28-14. They scored 16 points or fewer in all but 1 of those games. All 5 losses came by double digits. Meanwhile, the Rams already have 8 wins by 14+ points. The Panthers offense are 26th in the NFL in EPA per play (-0.025) & average the 6th fewest yards per play (5.0). They rank just 24th in in red zone TD scoring rate (53.33%). The Rams defense is the 3rd best allowing a TD on just 46.15% of red zone attempts. Carolina ranks 30th in pass block win rate. Since Week 14, the Rams ranked 2nd in pressure rate & the Panthers have allowed the 5th highest pressure rate. That’s bad news for Bryce Young who will be starting in his 1st playoff game. QB’s making their 1st playoff start vs QBs who have playoff experience are 20-40 SU & 20-39-1 ATS since 2002. The Rams are also the most disciplined team in the NFL. The Rams have had the fewest penalties in the league every year since 2020. This year they have just 75, lowest in NFL. But they have benefited from opposing teams getting called 121 penalties, 5th most. That net of +46 penalties is the most in the NFL. Clete Blakeman has been chosen as the head official. Blakeman’s crew ranks #1 calling 3rd down defensive penalties & awarding automatic 1st downs. The Panthers surrender automatic 1st downs on 40% of 3rd downs. The Rams rank 30th at just 17%. The Rams rank 7th as beneficiaries of automatic 1st downs. In games Blakeman’s crew has officiated, playoff home teams are just 4-9 ATS. The Panthers were penalized a record 12 times by Blakeman in their Super Bowl 50 loss to the DEN. Carolina is just 1-6 SU / 2-5 ATS with Blakeman since, including 0-2 SU/ATS as home dogs.\n\nRams win. Panthers stinks. Kyren eats.\n\n__Kyren Williams o65.5 rushing yards__\n\nAppreciate the love!

That 2nd team should be plenty to control this game. Many of their 2nd team have been playing in Champion's League matches, gotten sub time in the EPL, and played in the EFL cup matches late last year. This will also be their first game under their new manager, and many of these players are fighting for 1st team time. I expect them to show out.

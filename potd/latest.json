All picks 1 unit, unless stated otherwise.\n\n\nLast event: Soccer/Football, [World Cup qualifiers] Belarus vs Greece\nLast pick: Belarus over 2.5 corners @ 1.80 loss\n\n\nEvent: Soccer/Football, [Champions League Women] PSG W vs Bayern W\n\n\nPick: BTTS + Over 2.5 goals @ 1.90\n\n\nSo far, both teams have seen some pretty high scoring games in the CL - this line covered for PSG in 2/3 games, interestingly failing to score in a 0-4 loss away to Wolfsburg, where they should have scored at least 2 probably. Other than that game, PSG hit this in tough matchups vs Real and Man United and are in need of points. Bayern have covered this line in 3/3 CL games, they allowed a goal as heavy favourites vs Juventus, and hit btts + over 2.5 in more even games such as vs Arsenal, Wolfsburg. The two teams have met very often in the CL in recent years with last 5/6 games between them hitting the btts and over 2.5 goals.",

There haven't been a lot of bright spots for the Bills offense this season outside of Josh Allen willing his team down the field. Even then, his lack of weapons have even made the 2024 MVP show his fair share of struggles throughout the length of the season. This week will not be any easier for them coming off a short week, on the road and against one of the toughest defensive units in the league. This year the Bills have hit the under in 3/4 games and have averaged 24 points in those matchups.\n\nThe Texans are also a majorly struggling offense and nothing is expected to change against Buffalo. With CJ Stroud already ruled out for the game, Houston will be relying on the backup once again Davis Mills for their offensive production. The biggest weakness the Bills defense exposes to their opponents is their ability to stop the run but Houston hasn't been able to run the ball well all season and ranks bottom 10 in every major category. This season the Texans are 3-6-1 vs. the under and have hit the over in only 1/5 of their home games this season. The Texans defense only averages a total of 16 points per game and have a total combined average of 38 points this season. \n\nMy prediction for this game is Bills 20 Texans 16.\n\nTail or fade BOL to everyone and cheers! 🍻",

Coaches said in interviews a few weeks ago that they want to get Collins the ball more. The Texans game plan is designed to make Collins the heart of the offense. Since then his is receiving more looks with Davis Mills under center. Mills has targeted star WR Nico Collins an insane amount. Nico has seen an increase of almost 10% 1st read share with Mills at QB. Mills filled in for Stroud 3 weeks ago. Collins has an incredible 36 targets in those 3 games. He’s had a target share of 28.2%. He’s also had 7+ receptions in each of the past 3 weeks, & 10+ targets in 4 straight games. His targets over those games: 10, 15, 11, & 10. Without CJ Stroud this year Collins has 3 straight games of 75+ receiving yards (75, 136, 92). With CJ Stroud he's only had 2 games over with 75+ yards. Collins is also 6th in the NFL in red zone targets this season (14). Collins has been used more in the slot lately, leading to a higher volume of targets & better production. In the last 2 games, he's been targeted 7 times from the slot, that’s more than he had in his first 7 games combined. Also, Buffalo has allowed an average of 6 receptions (4th most in NFL) & 86.9 yards per game (most in NFL) to WR1’s. The Bills are favored by 6 points, so the Texans will most likely be playing from behind. Mills has thrown the ball 41+ times & had 274+ yards & 1+ passing TD in both of his starts, & they won both games. Imagine how many times he’s going to throw when they’re down. He’s going to target the hell out of Nico.\n\n__Nico Collins o5.5 receptions__\n\nAppreciate the love!

      "text": "POTD Record: 9-1\n\nNet Units: +7.78u ROI: 49.27%\n\nPrev POTD: Takuya Kumasaka +6g -180✅ +1u\n\nThat makes 8 POTD’s in a *ROW* now🌟\nHottest handicapper in this subreddit\n\nSport: Tennis Tournament: Colina Challenger Time: 11:00AM EST \n\nPOTD: Laura Pigossi ML +142 1u\n\nAnalysis: the funny thing is I actually faded Pigossi last match with two positions. Now after watching her match vs Vergara Rivera, I feel confident to back her at this price vs Jeanjean.\n\nWe really got to see a glimpse of 2021 Pigossi in her 6-1/6-1 domination of AVR. She was *blasting* her forehand and painting lines I could swear I watched 20+ winners. Only landing a rusty 42% of first serves but they were solid serves winning 83%. Probably the craziest stat of the match is AVR was able to land a *very* high 74% of first serves… the only problem for her was Locked In Laura on the other side of the net sending back *72%* of those FS’s as her own point. It was a returning masterclass as she also won 73% of second serves on return. I think Pigossi is really gonna try to make a run here in the Colina altitude.\n\nPigossi and Jeanjean have actually met 4 times already. JJ won all 3 of the hard court encounters while Pigossi was able to beat her on clay (same surface as today’s meeting) @ Buenos Aires 3 years ago.\n\nJeanjean is *not* impressive. Shes at best a top 75 player but at 30 years old she’s likely to plateau at the T100 mark. One things for sure tomorrow, she should *not* be a -185 favourite in this spot tomorrow. I’m not convinced she’s back. She was playing consistent tournaments until the USO (Aug,25 R1 loss to Hon {semi-lol}) and then two weeks later São Paulo (another R1 loss to Tjen{valid}). Then two weeks later shes all the way in China losing *yet another* round one. This time to Lepchenko {big lol}. She demotes herself to entering a challenger while she’s in China to only get one win (vs Inglis who was a lucky loser LOL) and then bounced in R2. She tries one more in China and it’s a big one; Guanzhou. *Take a guess what happened*… yup, ANOTHER R1 loss to Seidel (valid).\nTo summarize Jeanjean across the last 3 months: \n6 tournaments \n2 Wins 4 losses\n*all played on hard court*\nNow she’s made a successful first match transition to clay in Colina beating Riera who’s been decent recently. \nStill, ALL things considered, nothing warrants Leolia Jeanjean being a -185 favourite over Pigossi in this spot. \nPigossi is playable all the way up until +110.\nTell me who you know confidently put a 8 win streak and 9-1 overall record on the line with a +142 ML? Thats why they NVS🌟 I’ll see you all at the cashier in 16 hours. \n\nIf I made you money this wild run and want to tip since I can’t promo my socials🍀: [BMAC☕️](https://buymeacoffee.com/nvsbets) | [BTC](https://pastebin.com/0Lf0mHqu) | [ETH](https://pastebin.com/D2QRi3Bx)",

The sharks give up the most shots on goal of any team in the nhl and Dallas scores when given those types of opportunities. Dallas being home with one of the best pp in the league I expect Dallas to score a lot and win by 2 easily.",

Another one in the win column, even if it had the heart racing after a goaless first half. That was a serious sweat, hopefully none of you cashed out early, because West Ham’s new boy Magassa came up clutch late on and dragged us over the line. Another W secured. We go again, lads. ⚽🔥\n\n**Record**: 3W-0P-1L | **Net Units**: +3.74u | **Form**: ✅️❌️✅️✅️ \n\n⚽️Soccer | 🇫🇷Ligue 1 | Lille vs Marseille | 3:00pm EST \n\n**Today's POTD**: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to Score or Assist (+130 Draftkings) [2u]\n\nAlright boys, this one is a bit speculative, but the form Aubameyang is in right now is too good to ignore. The man has either scored or assisted in four straight matches for Marseille, and it’s especially worth noting that he dropped a goal and two assists in their last away outing against Nice. When a striker is this confident, you ride the wave.\n\nHis consistency lately is undeniable. Aubameyang is reminding everyone why he’s been considered one of the top strikers in world football for years. The movement, the finishing, the creativity, he’s delivering big performances week after week, and Marseille are leaning heavily on him to spark their attack again tonight.\n\nThat said, it is still a speculative play because Lille’s defense is no joke, they’ve shown plenty of structure and discipline this season. For that reason, I’d recommend keeping this to no more than 2 units, trusting the form but respecting the matchup. Let’s see if Auba steps up for us again, boys. ⚽🔥\n\n*Tail responsibly.

It’s a nightmare matchup for them. Getting 2.25 on the league leaders against a relegation candidate feels like a gift. My adjusted numbers see an edge here. Backing the best defense against the worst offense at plus money is a no-brainer. Düsseldorf's tendency to dominate in possession when playing at home is a perfect match for Schalke's style under Miron Muslic. Solid defence and quick counterattacks! \n\nBut, it could easily be a goalless draw, so under 2.5 Goals might also be solid value @ 1.93 odds.\n\n  \n**Please only bet money that you can afford to lose.

      "text": "\nRecord 12-12-2\n\nLast pick: Josh Giddey “U” 21.5 Points (-105)❌\nPlayed: HardRock | Bet: 1U\n\n\nPick of the day : Pascal Siakam OVER 30.5 points + rebounds (-125)\n\nReason • \nSiakam has been an absolute wagon for us this season and were going back to him here, let me break this down👇\n\nSiakam has been the clear #1 option for the Pacers this season with a lot of their players being injured he has stepped up big for them, This season Siakam is averaging 31 PR a game on 11.7 rebound chances per game and 18.2 FGA per game, compared to last season where he averaged just 25.9 PR a game on 11.7 rebound chances per game and just 14.7 FGA per game.\n\nScoring matchup breakdown👇\n\nSiakam gets an amazing matchup versus the Bulls who allow the most PPG to PFs(26.70). Siakam sees a combined 47% of his points from Transition, Free Throws and spot up where the Bulls rank (18th, 20th and 20th), this is gonna be great for Siakam as the Bulls are a bad defense against all of Siakam’s scoring types so I expect him to see high shot volume here.\n\nWhen playing teams that rank 15th or worse against transition Siakam is over this line in 5/7 games avergaing 33.1 PR per game.\n\nWhen looking at scoring zones Siakam gets a great matchup as well, Siakam gets a majority 31% of his points from the RA, a zone the Bulls allow the most PPG against, and the Bulls run a small ball lineup with their tallest player being vucevic who is just 6’9, which is gonna lead to Siakam being in the interior a lot which is gonna lead to great rebounding volume.\n\nSIakam also gets a great matchup when looking at shot types, as he gets 46% of his shots from <10 feet where the Bulls allow the most PPG against.\n\nRebounding matchup\n\nThe main reason I am leaning towards PR here is because this is a great matchup for Siakam against the Bulls who have been getting killed on the boards this season allowing the 10th most rebounds per game to PFs(10.23) and the 6th most total rebounds per game.\n\nIn Siakam’s last matchup versus the Bulls he recorded 9 rebounds on 14 rebound chances in that game.\n\nWhen seeing just 12+ rebound chances Siakam is over this line in 9/14 games avergaing 35.8 PR a game.\n\nThe Bulls struggle against forward’s/centers who are big and fast.\n\nRecent performances versus the Bulls 👇\n\nMichael Porter Jr. 43 (Line: 32.5)✅\nMiles Bridges: 30 (Line: 27.5)✅\nAlex Sarr: 27 (Line: 25.5)✅\nKel’el Ware: 34 (Line: 21.4)✅\nLauri Markanen: 54 (Line: 33.5)✅\nEvan Mobley: 32 (Line: 29.5)✅\nGiannis Antetokounmpo: 56 (Line: 43.5)✅\nKAT: 35 (Line: 33.5)✅\nWemby: 50 (Line: 38.5)✅\n\nWhen seeing matchups like this, versus teams bottom 10 against transition and bottom 10 in rebounds allowed Siakam has cleared this line with ease going over in 5/6 games avergaing 34 PR a game with.\n\nSiakam saw great usage in his last game versus the Bulls going for 24 points on 23 FGA and he saw 9 rebounds on 14 chances in that game.\n\nWhen seeing just 15+ FGA on 11+ rebound chances Siakam is over this line 9/11 games avergaing 35.5 PR a game.\n\nSiakam’s numbers go up when you look at him when playing just 32 minutes clearing this line in 11/15 games when seeing 32+ minutes averaging 33.5 PR a game, and I expect 35+ minutes here in a game that should be competitive favoring the Bulls by +5 so I’m expecting this to be a close game, as in their last matchup the Pacer’s won by 2 on a Siakam game winner.",

It helped that Lamb went down with an injury, but fluornoy stepped up really well in his absence and nearly took over the game. Why I don't trust the Cowboys is because of their defense, and they got absolutely gashed on short throws and Goff had his way even though his final statline doesn't indicate how dominant of a performance this was from Detroit. Glad to have gotten the win and keep the streak going!\n\nEvent: North Texas vs Tulane NCAAF\n\nPOTD: Tulane Moneyline (+115) 5 units\n\nUNT (North Texas) has a VERY explosive offense (points per game (46.8) and yards per game (512)) so I'm expecting a lot of points here tomorrow. They have a wide arsenal of weapons that makes their pass game look almost effortless at times. Tulane, however, is a proven battle-tested team and while they have not looked as good at UNT down the stretch, I see this as another classic case of overvaluing of a team that seems to be clicking at the right time, but in my perspective of watching UNT play, they feast on bad teams. They trot down the field against bad teams. They make football look easy against bad teams. Where Tulane has the advantage here based on watching their film is a highly-physical defensive line, and if they can generate pressure on Drew Mestemaker and neutralize the likes of Caleb Hawkins and Wyatt Young, then I think Tulane has the potential and talent to win this game. Their main gripe, however, is their inconsistent play so if you want to reduce your unit size, that's understandable. If Tulane can capitalize on their opportunities, I expect this to be a grind-out victory for them. This game should have a playoff-like atmosphere and I love backing home CFB teams in this spot. \n\nJust to reiterate, in conjunction with my model, I use the eye test as well as my gut feeling to play what I believe is the most-valuable pick on the slate. Cheers to a great game, and please remember to gamble responsibly and to only wager what you can afford to lose.\n\nBOL!",

Both teams inside  the top 25 in Kenpom adjusted tempo and love to push the pace! They both average above 37% from downtown which both rank inside the top 60 nationally and on top of that, quinnipac is allowing almost 34% from downtown. Iona has only allowed 16% from downtown but I do believe negative regression will seep in soon. They allow almost 25 attempts from downtown per game good for 255th nationally and their schedule has been against teams who don’t usually shoot well form downtown but that will change here! \n\nBoth teams also rank below 330th nationally in opponent field goals attempted per game! Meaning they allow a shit ton due to their pace \n\nOn top of this iona is 6-2 to the over and quinnipac is 4-3 to the over\n\nThe line has moved to 163.5 after opening at 161.5 but I like it still.

Boise State and UNLV have faced off earlier in the year and the Broncos trounced the Rebels 56-31 and the Broncos just could not be stopped on offense in that game. Runningback Dylan Riley had his best game of the year against this Rebels defense, running for over 200 rushing yards and averaging over 13 yards per rush attempt, he looked like former Broncos runningback Ashton Jeanty against this Rebels defense and I think he will have another great game against them in this conference title. The Broncos will also be getting their star quarterback Maddux Madsen back who missed that past few games due to injury and when he faced off against UNLV earlier this year he had an amazing performance throwing for 4 touchdowns and averaging 11 yards per pass attempt. These two teams are very different on the defensive side of the ball, the Broncos have a top 10 pass defense in the nation only allowing 167 passing yards per game while the Rebels are ranked 113th in pass defense allowing just about 250 passing yards per contest. Boise State also has the defensive edge in rushing yards per contest and points allowed per game. Boise State also has home field advantage in this one as the Mountain West title game isnt played on a neutral field so I see that as another huge advantage in this one. I expect Boise State to win by more than field goal again against the Rebels and take the Mountain West title for the second straight year.\n\nPrediction: 34-27 Broncos\n\nLast pick:🏀Indiana -2.5/LSU -1.5💩Indiana has no business being in the top 25 after that performance.\n\nBest of luck to everyone tailing and remember to bet responsibly!

Great play here, especially against the number 1 seed in the tournament.\n\n**Tennis** | **Challenger Angers (Women)** | **12:30 PM (Eastern Time)**\n\n**Plays will always be shared as 1 unit for fair record purposes**\n\n**Pick:** **Parks vs Korpatsch - Parks ML @ 1.63**\n\nAlycia Parks, currently ranked 71st in the world, is the number 1 seed in this tournament and needs to defend her title points, since she also won in Angers last season. She's one of the tallest players on tour, which gives her a big advantage on this surface (Indoor Hard), with the ability to get free points on her first serve much more frequently than most of her opponents. She produced 26 aces in the last round, which might be a good indicator that she can use her best weapon once more to increase her chances of winning the tournament. Her game does have some problems, especially when playing outdoors, as she moves a bit slowly compared to the tour average, and she hits really flat. With this, she ends up making a lot of unforced errors when outdoor conditions nullify her serve power, but the same can't be said here in Angers, where she feels much more comfortable.\n\nKorpatsch is a veteran of the circuit now at 30, always seen as an average player with a decent rally tolerance and baseline game, but a weak serve, which has prevented her from standing out from the rest of the WTA tour. Last year, she was defeated specifically by Parks in this tournament in straight sets.\n\nWith this, Parks knows that most of her ranking points need to come from Indoor tournaments, and defending this title should be a major priority. With her powerful serve, she should be to simplify each point and win the match. Keep in mind that in order to win this tournament in the previous year, Parks had to defeat Belinda Bencic in the final, the current number 11 in the world.\n\nGood luck!",

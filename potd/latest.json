      "text": "Record: 148-134, -10.17 units\n\nLast Pick: Mariano Navone to win 2-0 vs Hady Habib (-140, 1 unit): Win\n\nTennis | Costa do Sauipe Challenger | Time TBD\n\nToday's Pick: Juan Manuel Cerundolo vs Gustavo Heide | **Cerundolo ML at -135. 1 unit.**\n\nWrite-up: Two days were fully rained out in Costa do Sauipe, but Habib and Navone were finally able to play today. Navone 2-0 closed around -175, and he ended up mostly cruising to victory. \n\nSimilar angle to the Navone one here. Juan Manuel Cerundolo, younger brother of Francisco, struggled a bit during the hard court season (though he did win a Challenger title during the Asian swing), but his game is much better suited to clay courts. In this season alone, JuanMa has managed to defeat Felix Auger-Aliassime, Alex Michelsen, and Casper Ruud on the surface. His biggest tournament this year in Gstaad came in pretty different conditions to these, as Gstaad sits at a much higher altitude, but he's also found success in lower-altitude SA clay tournaments like Buenos Aires.\n\nIn comparison, Gustavo Heide is also a strong clay player, though his season was disrupted by a long injury break in the middle of the year. He possesses a heavy serve that does a ton of damage on the surface, but I don't feel that he's nearly as adept a grinder as Cerundolo, and his overall results haven't been quite as impressive. Heide certainly comes into this match with plenty of rest having played his first round on Monday, but I honestly think I prefer Cerundolo's situation. Juan secured a fairly straightforward victory over Sebastian Gima, and I feel like he got in rhythm with losing much energy. Meanwhile, I'm not sure how much practice time Heide has gotten since Monday given the rain situation (and the fact that all the R1 were packed into today), and this could be a difficult mental spot for him. \n\nThis is definitely a slightly different spot from the Navone-Habib one, as Heide is a legitimate clay-courter. However, I expect Cerundolo's lefty grinding game to be extremely effective in these conditions, as RealFeel temperatures are expected to climb into the 30s tomorrow, and I feel that he should be a bigger favorite here. \n\nNote: The [POTD Capper Tracker](https://potd.lol), which you may remember from its Google Sheet days, is finally back in a cleaner, more robust website format!

However, I assure you that I could tell who would win 7-1 every day I'd be on my own private beach sipping cocktails and not sharing them on Reddit. \nGood win today though; 3-1 win. \n\nWas a classic game of two halves. We were 1-0 down at half time, and playing bad in some terrible weather. However, three goals in the second half (one of which in injury time, so it felt like a 2-1 more than a 3-1) got us over the line \n\nToday's Pick: Melbourne Victory to win at Newcastle Jets 1u at $2.15 \n\nPick: I don't really have too much that I like a lot in the price range today (I backed Coventry over Watford -.75, then realised that game is tomorrow in the states), so I'm going with a one unit bet that is - and this isn't great to say - largely vibes based because the season in Australia is so new (this is round 2).\n\nNewcastle Jets have been rubbish for years. There's a bit of optimism after they won the biggest cup competition in the country recently, however that ends in the preseason for the A League, so most teams don't really take it too seriously. The ones that do take it seriously definitely aren't match-ready. Proof of this is that there were so many \"cupsets\" over the course of the comp this year.  With semi-pro teams knocking out A League opposition.\n\nYes, Newcastle look better, and there are some really signs. But they just copped three goals to a Central Coast team that is an absolute disaster. \n\nBasically, I think some people are upping Newcastle a tad too much. \n\nVictory had a rough patch last season and their reputation suffered a lot. But they turned it around, and made the Grand Final. \n\nI think Victory have a way better chance at winning this than the price tag says.... But I'm only 1u confident because it's the A League and anything goes.",

Definitely got lucky!🍀\n\nEvent: DAY 2 PDC Machinesheeker European Championship match at 2:05pm est\n\nPick: James “The Machine” Wade to WIN vs Mike “Small” de Decker at -146 on FD for 2.5u to win 1.7u\n\nWriteup: Alright I was looking at this matchup from the jump. I think we have a statistically balanced matchup but recent form I believe leans in James Wade’s favor. Even if Mike de Decker wins the first throw, Wade has the edge in consistency and experience. He’s been floating around a 94–95 average over the past year, hitting close to 46% on his doubles. He may be getting older but he still knows how to grind out wins on the big stage. Wade’s recent mid-90s averages and calm under pressure, show he’s still got that old-school composure that wins short, tense matches.\n\nMike De Decker’s got plenty of talent and can throw heavy when he’s on, averaging about 94 himself, but his finishing sits lower at around 39%, and he’s been a bit streaky this season. Really just consisting of one good run followed by a few flat games. The head-to-head and odds lean Wade’s way, and in a short best-of-11 format, that experience in closing legs is massive. Unless De Decker finds top gear early. With that being said the odds aren’t great but I’m a big fan of Wade’s swagger and demeanor. I have a feeling Wade will break de Decker and will hold throw.\n\nTrust “The Machine” on his first game in the 2025 PDC Machineseeker Championship.\n\nAs always, BOL, if you have any interest in darts this may not be the Biggest game on the slate but I think it will be profitable… only bet the shmeckles you’re willing to wipe your ass with. let’s keep the streak alive!!!\n\n![gif](giphy|YlRyARavj55JWtL1xn|downsized)",

They were gutless moving the ball forward last game.\n\nLeeds have shown defensive capabilities this year too producing a few clean sheets along the way, and struggled to break down somewhat stubborn defence in Burnley (also league strugglers) last week, failing to score.\n\nLeeds have only registered 6 goals in the league, including an anomaly 3-1 win against bottom place Wolves which gives them 3 goals in their 7 other games.\n\nWest Ham hold a near identical record with 6 goals, and 3 of them coming against Forest who funnily enough Nuno was managing at the time before being sacked.\n\nAll of West Ham’s games with Nuno in charge have seen the under 2.5 mark hit. Everything points towards under goals, I just see the right value here.\n\n-\n\n**12 wins in 15 bets**, well done to any followers. No pressure whatsoever, but if you are willing, any help goes a long way.\n\nBuy me a coffee! - https://www.paypal.com/ncp/payment/K4C6AK2VCT9EJ\n\n**Thanks, GL**",

      "text": "Overall record 17W-10L\n\nUnits: +3.91 (All picks are 1 unit)\n\nLast pick: LaMelo Ball 4+ threes made (-102) ✅\n\nLaMelo cashes for us with a clutch three late in the 4th quarter on his last attempt of the game. Admittedly he was passing more this game than I thought he would due to the Nets occasionally sending double teams on him and then his teammates would never really look to get him the ball back but LaMelo comes through for us in the end unlike Shai in our previous bet.\n\nToday's match: North Texas vs Charlotte (CFB)\n\nPick: North Texas over 41.5 Team Total Alternate Line (-140, Draftkings)\n\nGoing back to college football today, last week we faded Sam Houston State and today we are taking a similar route. North Texas is having an incredible season, they started 5-0 for the first time since 1959 before eventually falling to USF who are currently ranked 18th in the AP Top 25. North Texas leads the NCAA in scoring with a whopping 45 ppg and 42 total touchdowns. Admittedly their scoring is mainly due to their matches outside of the USF game being against weak competition but that should not be a concern because their opponents today are definitely the weakest competition they will be facing this year so far. Charlotte currently ranks 110th in the nation in stop rate standings with a 54.4% stop rate and allows 2.84 pts per drive and have allowed 32 touchdowns on them this year which is in the bottom 10 for touchdowns allowed. With North Texas and Charlotte being on complete opposite sides of the spectrum on offense and defense I'm trusting in the Mean Green to get the job done today with an alt line that would cover exactly 6 touchdowns.

Maryland ended up covering the +3.5 but did not hit the ML. I think I had the correct  read, just tried to get too cute with it and ended up paying for it. We move onto the next pick.\n\nPOTD: Cal +5.5 -112 4u to win 3.89\n\nCalifornia Golden Bears @ Virginia Tech Hokies. Lane Stadium, Blacksburg, Virginia. 7:30pm EST Kickoff.\n\nThis line is a headscratcher. You’re telling me a 5-2 team is 6 point dog against a 2-5 team? It really piqued my interest so I did a deep dive on both programs and tried to understand what the hell Vegas is seeing.\n\nSTATS SECTION:\n\nAccording to nearly every power rating computerized system, this game should be a Cal lean on a neutral field. Sagarin rating has Cal as the 77th rated team in the country with a rating of 67.74. Their recent metric is sitting at 65.77. ESPN SP+ has them rated as the 75th team in the country with an overall rating of -2.3, offensively at 97th in the country with a 23.0 rating, and 59th in the country at 25.3 defensively. Their Resume SP+ is -39.9, 63rd in the country. PFF has them at 78.1 overall rated, offensively 68.5, defensively 84.5.\n\nVirginia Tech is the 76th rated team in the country per sagarin with a rating of 67.99. Their recent metric is sitting at 66.53. ESPN SP+ has them rated as the 91st team in the country with an overall rating of -5.7, 91st in the country offensively att 23.6, and 88th in the country at 29.6 defensively. Their Resume SP+ is 109th in the country at -62.2. PFF has them rated at 74.5 overall, offensively at 64.5, and defensively at 77.0. \n\nIn nearly every metric that I care about, Cal either matches VA Tech, or beats them handedly. Cal is the better team in a lot of statistical metrics, and both are just as undisciplined, in the bottom quartile of penalties in their last three matchups.\n\nI’m not in love with stats, but Vegas is, which makes sense why they’re giving Cal 5.5 points on the road. Their computers likely indicate a pick’em, typically a road team gets a 2.5 point bump, and I’m assuming a cross country road trip is worth an additional 2 points. \n\nEYE TEST:\n\nDefensively, VA Tech gave their most recent opponent, Georgia Tech ZERO struggles offensively. Georgia Tech is rated highly and run an untraditional offense with a lot of strange run sets that are difficult to scheme against. Georgia Tech had 0 notable negative plays that weren’t turnovers, and were effectively able to do whatever they wanted on the ground, scoring 35 points. G5 Old Dominion beat the piss out of VA tech, throwing for  nearly 300 yards, and rushing for 250, averaging 8.5 YPP. Both teams notably have running QB’s. Offensively they operate successfully in the run game by handing the ball off to Terrion Stewart, who is liable to cut loose for a 25 yard gain on any given play, or in the pass game by getting lucky with blown coverage. Their receivers can’t catch, can’t run routes well, and the line doesn’t block well in pass pro. Don’t gift VA tech a wide open receiver in off coverage and contain the RB and you’ll be in great shape to win against Tech.\n\nCal’s key to victory? Score 21 points. 3 touchdowns. That’s all they need. I’m not worried about their defense, it doesn’t take an elite defense to stop this VA Tech team. (It does help that Cal has a pretty good defense, rated in the top half of the ACC.). Cal has scored at least 21 points in all but one game this year. In watching their game against Minnesota and having a really good understanding of Minnesotas defense, they operated very successfully in both phases. Passing the ball is their strong suit, and their QB is very precise, manages the pocket well (not the cleanest of pass pro’s by any stretch of the imagination but he handles it well), and receivers get open. I’m extremely impressed in his discipline of diagnosing coverages and hitting the pockets in zones. Receivers aren’t great playmakers by any means, but they catch the ball well and sit down in routes well.\n\nINJURIES:\n\nVA Tech’s #1 contributor offensively is listed on the injury report, Terion Stewart. He’s currently listed as probable but if he’s not ready to go, I don’t think VA tech has a glimmer of hope.\n\nTL:DR:\n\nI think 5.5 is a lot of points to give Cal. At the end of the day, records DO matter, and teams that consistently win ballgames are better than teams that don’t (Duh). This may be a matchup that is relatively similar on paper, but Cal has the momentum and history to prove they’re a better team than Tech this year. One of Tech’s two wins on the year comes from a team called Wofford. I don’t know where the hell Wofford is, and I know damn well if 50% of your wins come from schools that nobody has ever heard of in week 9, you’re NOT a good football team. Their only other win came from NC State, which was a 2 point win.\n\nCal is the better team. I’m sprinkling a little bit of the ML, and definitely taking Cal + the points in this matchup.",

I jumped back and forth about 50 times writing this as to whether I wanted to add one more leg and rock a 2-leg Football+Futbol parlay or keep it to one. Ultimately, I decided that I will keep it simple for today’s pick and not give the anti-parlay purists any ammunition /s. If you are interested in the 2-leg parlay that I’ll be taking with this pick and a football pick, feel free to shoot me a DM and I’ll send it over! I’ll probably toss a unit on that and drop this straight bet from 4u to 3u.\n\nAfter an odd day of Europa League matches where we saw a ton of favorites stumble (which was preceded by a bunch of favorites winning in CL the two days before), I am headed away from Football and am moving back to the pitch for some Futbol. We are headed to Italy for a beautiful night game at the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza in Milano. AC Milan is playing host to Pisa, and according to every data point out there, the home team *should* cruise here. \n\nAC Milan sits atop the Serie A table through 7 games in which they have collected 16 points and are 5-1-1. They are one point above a three team, 15-pt tie of Inter, Napoli, and AS Roma. So far this season AC Milan has played exceptionally well, scoring 11 times and only conceding 4 times. Those 4 goals have come against Napoli (1), Fiorentina (1), and Cremonese (2). The Cremonese match is their only loss this season, and was on matchday 1. Their form has been tremendously improved since that loss, with their only draw coming away against Juventus (0-0). They have held a clean sheet in 4 of 7 matches (including the Juve match) and all of those games have been against teams a fair bit stronger than Pisa. Serie A table leaders on 4 days of rest, at home, against the Serie A bottom dwellers. What’s not to love? Give me AC Milan to take this one.\n\nFor the second portion of this straight bet, we are looking at AC Milan to keep a clean sheet and see zero goals conceded to Pisa. I kind of hate these bets because you are watching the whole match for something to not happen, which is way worse than waiting for something to happen (in my opinion). Nevertheless, I think there is good value in the win to nil bet here.\n\nSince AC Milan’s loss in their first match, they have only conceded 2 goals in 6 matches, and those were to a more formidable Napoli side and a Fiorentina team who has also netted against Napoli and Roma. Pisa on the other hand has only scored 3 times through the first 7 matches of the season, and have gone their last 4 matches without scoring. They have only got on the score sheet in 2 matches so far this season and against one of the top defenses in Serie A, there is good value on Pisa to go another match without a goal.\n\nBest of Luck to those who tail, as well as those who don’t! Please make sure to bet responsibly and only bet what you can afford to lose.\n\nI generally spend a couple hours a day combing through as much action as possible from across the world, in order to find value. I do have my own bankroll behind all my picks, but if you are feeling generous, any tips will just go towards enjoying a cold, 22 oz lager at the bar down the street (they're only $4.50 each during happy hour).\n\n[Sponsor a cold, 22 oz 🍺](https://buymeacoffee.com/ceaselessaction)",

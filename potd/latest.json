Both sides arrive creating high-quality chances consistently. At evens I’m seeing this is a price above fair value. \n\nOdds: EVS\n\nUnits: 3-5",

Winnipeg Jets ML vs Buffalo -130 (1.3u to win 1u)\n\nSaturday’s Pick - Manchester City win and over 2.5 goals -155 (1.55u to win 1u)\n\nMan City should handle business here, as they are -390 on the 3 way line. This is really a bet on how many goals they can score. Man City’s totals are higher than 2.5 goals in 4 of their last 5 and by themselves, they are averaging over 2 goals a game. I think they get 3 here. \n\nGood luck!",

Both teams have the quality to break through each other's defenses because Frankfurt will not sit back defensively away from home and will try to win the match, meaning Leipzig's attack will find space and Frankfurt's attack will create chances as well. Leipzig have been in excellent form winning most of their home games and Frankfurt have scored against even tough opponents, so expecting both teams to score is very realistic and has happened in most recent meetings between these two clubs. The over 2.5 goals requirement is almost guaranteed because this is an open attacking match where both Leipzig and Frankfurt will try to win. \n\nIf you found these picks helpful, tips or donations are greatly appreciated as they support the time and effort I put into creating them: [buy me a beer🍻](https://buymeacoffee.com/hercules.son.of.zeus)",

They have already beaten this Georgia team earlier in the season in a close game, away in Athens and I'm predicting this one to be a very close one as well. Both teams rank very similarly in offensive and defensive numbers this season, with the exception of the Bulldogs having an elite top 10 run defense. Even then, the Crimson Tide is more known for their passing game and I don't believe the run game to be much of a factor for them coming into this game. Alabama is 8-3-1 against the spread this season and are 9-0 in their last 9 SEC championship appearances. This game has all the makings for a down to the wire finish in what feels like a coin flip matchup.\n\nWith my second leg I have Indiana covering within 10.5 points in this clash between the 1st and 2nd ranked teams in the nation, with what really feels like a pick em matchup. This matchup features the nation's best scoring defense (7.8 PPG allowed) against the second best scoring offenses (44.3 PPG). While the Buckeyes are favored and have a 30-game winning streak against Indiana, the Hoosiers have an elite rushing attack and I believe they can control the clock and keep the Buckeyes offense off the field to keep this game within striking distance. So far this season Indiana has performed well against the spread with a 7-5 record and I believe they will be able to cover this line as well at a neutral site that is one hour north of their home stadium in Bloomington.\n\nTail or fade BOL to everyone and cheers! 🍻",

I see them struggling to keep constant pressure on this Arsenal side, but more than enough to see us cover here.\n\nWith Ariel demons, Saliba, Gabriel, and Mosquera out tomorrow, Arsenal will struggle to defend those dead balls into the box as well as they normally do. Don't see Villa getting too much space in the box which will naturally force them out wide and into corner opportunities. Wingbacks will have to adjust to the changes, which will cause more errors, leading to set-piece play.\n\n**In Villas' last 10 Prem games, they've averaged 5.1 corners per game with this line hitting in 8/10 games (80%).**\n\n**Anyway BOL!**",

Every point that needed a bit more endurance was getting sent to the net and the first serve percentage was around the mid 40s. The opponent was at a good level but this play was lost from the start with how Parks showed up yesterday. \n\n**Tennis** | **Challenger Angers (Women)** | **7:30 AM (Eastern Time)**\n\n**Plays will always be shared as 1 unit for fair record purposes**\n\n**Pick:** **Korpatsch vs Friedsam - Korpatsch ML @ 1.80**\n\nKorpatsch has been showing up at a good level in this tournament and this play isn't influenced by the fact that she was able to beat Parks playing at 30% of her level but by the fact that Korpatsch has been playing solid tennis and increasing her serve percentages as the tournament goes on. Friedsam is aggressive but struggled a lot against Sonmez in the last round, where she could have easily been knocked out of the tournament. I feel like there will be a lot of baseline rallies in this match and I favor Korpatsch to win this. These two faced each other in this tournament last year, with Korpatsch winning 2-0\n\nGood luck!",

Lets start with the first one, Stuttgart and Bayern. The monsters from Münich are very good this season, but they have not been flawless. They have conceeded in all of their last 6. They have cleared the O2.5 line in every single game this season except for one, which finished 2-0. Meanwhile Stuttgart have scored in every single home game this season and have hit O2.5 in 13 of the last 13 H2H with bayern. Next up we have a similar story in Barca. They are looking excelent this season, with an insane attack but also a subpar defense. They have conceeded in every single away game except for their first against mallorca this season, and scored in all of them except the one at Stamford Bridge. Betis have scored in all but 1 home game the whole season and we expect a lot of goals here. Barca has covered O2.5 in 17 straight games and i dont see it stopping today. Lock these plays in and lets cash together.\n\nBOL and gamble responsibly",

Purdue’s offense is one of the cleanest in the country efficient, well-spaced, and always generating high-quality shots inside or kick-outs. They’re averaging high-80s because they don’t waste possessions, and against Iowa State’s pace they’re going to get even more opportunities than usual. Iowa State doesn’t exactly slow the game down either. They’re sitting in the mid-90s per game because they run, attack early in the clock, and force a tempo that most teams struggle to match. Add that to Purdue’s tendency to play up to the pace of aggressive teams, and you suddenly have a game that’s naturally trending toward the mid-150s without either team needing an outlier shooting night.\n\n This matchup isn’t about whether one side clamps the other  it’s about two high-powered offenses trading efficient possessions, fueled by tempo and ball movement.",

      "text": "**Record:** 30-16-1 (+12.43u) \n\n**Last:** (CBB) Tennessee -6.5 (1u) - L\n\n**POTD:** No. 2 Arizona (-7.5) vs No. 20 Auburn\n\n**Start Time:** 10:00 PM ET (ESPN)\n\n**Odds:** -120 (FanDuel)\n\n**Units:** 1U\n\n**Reasoning:** You’d be hard-pressed to find a team with a better resume thus far than Arizona.\n\nAfter opening the season with an impressive 93-87 victory over then-No. 3 Florida, the Wildcats (7-0) also added wins over then-No. 3 UConn (71-67) and then-No. 15 UCLA (69-65). The team was just as impressive in its other four outings, winning by an average margin of 32 points. \n\nConversely, results have been all over the map for Auburn to start the season.\n\nThe Tigers (7-2) opened the season with a scare against Bethune-Cookman, needing overtime to escape with a 95-90 victory as a 24.5-point favorite. The team rebounded to taken then-No. 1 Houston to the wire in a 73-72 loss before getting flat-out embarrassed against then-No. 7 Michigan, 102-72. Since then, Auburn has seemingly turned things around, shooting 60.8% from the field (56.7% from three-point range) over its last three halves, including a 55-point second half to knock off then-No. 14 St. John’s 85-74. \n\nHowever, don’t expect that offensive prowess to continue Saturday night.\n\nDespite ranking quite impressively thus far—27th in offensive efficiency (1.195), 35th in scoring 87.9 PPG), 43rd in field-goal percentage (49.2%) and 121st in three-point shooting (35.1%)—the Tigers have only faced two defensive units that rank Top 75 in defensive efficiency. In those two games (Houston, Michigan), the team shot a combined 44-of-120 from the field (36.7%). Look for it to be another frustrating shooting night against a stifling Arizona defensive unit that ranks 24th in defensive efficiency (0.908), 41st in scoring defense (67.0 PPGA), 56th in opponent field-goal percentage (40.5%) and 168th in opponent three-point shooting (32.7%). \n\nOn the other end of the floor, look for the Wildcats offense to take whatever it wants.\n\nThrough seven games, the unit ranks 12th in field-goal percentage (51.8%), 33rd in offensive efficiency (1.183), 37th in scoring (87.3 PPG) and 64th in three-point shooting (37.2%). That could be a cause for concern for an Auburn defensive unit that ranks just 131st in defensive efficiency (1.012) while also ranking 79th in opponent field-goal percentage (41.5%), 153rd in opponent three-point shooting (32.4%) and 167th in scoring defense (74.4 PPGA). Look for the Wildcats to take advantage on the break, where they rank 27th in fast break points (16.3 PPG; 93rd percentile) while the Tigers rank just 202nd in opponent fast break points (11.1 PPG; 45th percentile). \n\nThe battle on the glass should prove to be a major X factor in this one.\n\nArizona dominates the boards on both ends of the floor, ranking 15th in total rebounding (42.6 per game), 20th in offensive rebounding (12.6) and 26th in defensive rebounding (27.0) while ranking 3rd in opponent defensive rebounding (17.1), 15th in opponent total rebounding (29.7) and 90th in opponent offensive rebounding (8.1). Meanwhile, Auburn ranks 46th in offensive rebounding (23.9), 58th in total rebounding (39.3) and 112th in defensive rebounding (23.9) while ranking 52nd in opponent defensive rebounding (19.9), 105th in opponent total rebounding (33.7) and 243rd in opponent offensive rebounding (9.8). To add insult to injury, the Tigers struggle to defend the paint, ranking 144th in points in the paint allowed (30.9 PPG; 61st percentile). That will be a major issue against a Wildcats offense that ranks 3rd in the category (46.6 PPG, 99th percentile). \n\nTaking care of the ball will also be crucial for Arizona.\n\nThus far, the team has struggled to play clean basketball, ranking 192nd in turnovers per possession (17.4%), 199th in opponent steals (7.0 per game) and 224th in turnovers (12.9). Although Auburn ranks 51st in steals (8.6), the team only ranks 122nd in turnovers forced (13.2) and 136th in turnovers forced per possession (18.0%). This could go a long way in deciding if the Wildcats can cover the number. \n\nTrust Arizona to show out in front of the home crowd.\n\nBOL if tailing, and as always please do so responsibly. One bet should NOT lead to a crash out.",

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 28-38-5 (Avg Odds +126)\n\n**Previous Pick:** Enzo Fernandez 1 + SOT (+125)✅️\n\n**Today's Event:** English Carabao Cup (Soccer) | Man City vs Newcastle (12:00PM PST)\n\n**Pick:** Antoine Semenyo To Score or Assist (+105) 1 unit to win 1.05 units\n\n**Write Up:** Maybe I should only play Enzo Fernandez for my POTD. That was our 8th win playing Enzo for the POTD, every one of those was plus money other than one. The game played out much as expected, with Chelsea having the majority of possession and Arsenal playing defensively. Enzo came through for us again in less sweaty fashion as he lands an SOT before halftime. Gotta love it!\n\nToday we've got the last semi final for the EFL Cup as Man City host Newcastle. City is already up 2-0 on aggregate here. This should be an even more open game as Newcastle need to score at least 2 goals. We have cashed Semenyo a few times in the soccer thread over the last few weeks and I like him here again today. His goal over the weekend was on a counter attack and I expect that to be City's main threat today. \n\nSemenyo has been on a tear since joining City, scoring a goal in 4 out of 5 games played. He has scored in two straight EPL games and also scored in this reverse fixture a few weeks back at Newcastle. I'm buying down the risk a bit here as ATGS is +190, since City have been moving towards a two pronged attack with Haaland and Semenyo up front. The two have had great link up play the last few games, so I love that we are still in plus odds and adding the option of an assist to cash. \n\nBOL and happy Wednesday!",

I see today going differently as they are now having to learn the new meta and picks and bans are slightly different. This series also isn’t as important for WE as it is for EDG. Let’s see a good 3 game banger here. BOL if tailing ",

Besides that these two teams their latest encounters have all hit over the line, in Blast V in Novemeber last year their BO1 match lasted 56min , in Dreamleague in December their match lasted 46min for map 1. Not only this, Falcons played 4 games today and 3 out of 4 games hit over 40min , XG also hit this line in two games out of 4. Also it’s a morning match, as a gamer usually these players are night owls , when their match is at 9-10am they play very bad and make a lot of mistakes which causes the game to be longer.",

He had a solid run in Australia, qualifying for AO and won his first match against Erhard, who has been playing well recently. He is currently number 117 in the world and meeting number 306 in the world. \n\nShelbayh made a good progression the last year but has not really shown a good form recently. Besides his match yesterday, he has not won a match since October last year and I believe this match is going to be a too big a mouthfull against a Maestrelli who has won 5 out of his 7 matches this year and played all matches on hard court (and one of the matches he lost was to Djokovic, which almost shouldn't count as a lost match in this statistic).\n\nI see a good value in this bet and good luck!\n\n\\_\n\nIf you follow my bets, I would appreciate a little tip - I spend a lot of time analyzing the bets day to day.

Taxes. Another Sparty donation?\n\nThere hasn’t been a lot of coin respecting going on when it comes to Michigan State as of late. That’s largely in part to some slow starts, as the team stumbled out of the gate in each of its two games last week against Rutgers and Michigan, trailing at the half by nine and 16 points respectively. But while a second-half surge helped the Spartans (19-3) outlast the Scarlet Knights in overtime, it was a case of too little, too late against the Wolverines. The loss snapped a seven-game win streak and dropped the team to 4th in the Big Ten standings.\n\nBut if there’s one thing head coach Tom Izzo knows how to do, it’s to bounce back: Michigan State is 31-13-2 ATS following a loss over the last five years.\n\nHowever, don’t expect Minnesota to make it easy. Despite a 3-8 mark in conference play—and having lost each of its last seven games—the Gophers (10-12) have been a tough out in the opening half of games. In fact, the team has either led or been tied at the half in four of its last six contests. That includes being knotted up at 34 against then-No. 13 Illinois and leading 36-30 against then-No. 7 Nebraska. Elite defense has been the name of the game, as Minnesota ranks 10th in first half scoring defense (29.7 PPGA).\n\nUnfortunately, that’s about the only positive the team can hang its hat on.\n\nAfter a 10-5 start to the season, it’s been all downhill for the Gophers. Through 22 games, the team ranks 125th in field-goal percentage (45.5%), 163rd in offensive efficiency (1.064), 242nd in three-point shooting (32.7%) and 245th in scoring (71.8 PPG). Not the kind of numbers you want to bring into a matchup with a Spartans defense that enters ranked 8th in opponent field-goal percentage (39.1%), 9th in scoring defense (64.4 PPGA), 11th in defensive efficiency (0.928) and 40th in opponent three-point shooting (30.4%). The last time the team came off a loss, the unit limited USC to just 17 first-half points and 51 for the game on just 33% shooting (18% from beyond the arc).\n\nThings don’t get any more promising on the defensive end.\n\nOn the year, the Minnesota defense can be described average at best, ranking 48th in scoring defense (68.8 PPGA), 97th in opponent field-goal percentage (42.9%), 102nd in defensive efficiency (1.020) and 195th in opponent three-point shooting (34.2%). However, over the last six games, the unit has been leaking water, conceding an average of 76.2 points on 46.2% shooting from the field (40.7% from long range). For a Michigan State offense that ranks 53rd in offensive efficiency, Wednesday night’s matchup could be like stealing candy from a baby. Especially with point guard Jeremy Fears Jr. (14.9 PPG, 8.8 APG) playing the way he has as of late.\n\nTrust Sparty to bounce back convincingly.\n\nBOL if tailing, and as always, please do so responsibly. One bet should not have you crashing out all over Reddit.\n\nTracking Link: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P5YErUwS5fI-JqVXGYOP96Zr7TsHgaZaJq6tV8tDaGk/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P5YErUwS5fI-JqVXGYOP96Zr7TsHgaZaJq6tV8tDaGk/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**SPLITS (PER GOOGLE SHEETS DOC)** \n\n* **Away:** 21-4-1 (+20.81u)\n* **Big 10:** 26-11-1 (+15.71u)\n* **Spread -5 to -9.5:** 15-6-1 (+11.0u) \n* **Michigan State:** 6-4-1 (+2.07u)",

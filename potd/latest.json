Last time they met McDavid recorded 3 points and Canada beat the Czechs 5-0 including a goal in the first period. That was also Canada’s first game of the tournament. Before the team were completely comfortable with each other. McDavid has scored 3 points in multiple games now so I think it should be no problem for him to get 2 this game. Celebrini has also been hot and is on a line with McDavid so look for some goals and assists from the Hockey god.\n\nBOL if Tailing!",

Try to not parlay my picks together or just play them as straights unless I am that confident. \n\nToday’s Picks( I am parlaying them for +133): \nPOTD 1: Rybakina Total Win Games U 12.5 -190\n\nShe has been on a roll this year and should win this 2-0 comfortably. Getting better odds at this as she should get 6-4,6-4s at the least. \n\nPotd 2 : Jannik Sinner Total Games U 19.5 -190\n\nNot much to say, I would expect a 6-3, 6-3 Game so you can take 18.5 if you are feeling confident. Sinner is really good in these early rounds and usually thrashes people as he beat no.32 in 17 games in the first round and this one is against no 52. \n\nLeans: There is a game with vidmanova playing a basically outside top 1000 seed, should be an easy u17.5 games and i really like it if your book offers it.\n\n\nIf I help you win, do think about giving 1% of your profit on the bet or buy me a coffee :)\n\nwww.buymeacoffee.com/Onedevelopment\n\nBest of luck!!",

Despite their records, Great Britain have looked like the better team so far. They should have the advantage at both the lead and fourth positions as Morrison and Jackson have been playing very well. My model had Great Britain as the higher rated team coming into the Olympics and the underlying stats would suggest the same thing so far in this event. The only time these two teams have played each other was at Worlds last year where Great Britain won.",

Arsenal w at home don’t change their style, they attack, press high, and create chances in numbers. Against a team like arsenal w that usually leads to an open game. Arsenal w are deadly when there’s space and can easily score two or three themselves. If this turns into a back-and-forth battle, four goals is very live at this price.",

Atmane in my opinion is the streakiest player on tour as his all-out-attack style is obviously inconsistent as hell but when it’s firing he can literally be unplayable. We have only really see him play like this once at the top level when he reached the Cincinnatti masters semis from qualifying and has unsurprisingly been playing fairly poorly since. He picked up just his second win in 11 matches against Kypson in round 1. On the other hand Cobolli, similar to last year, is having a disastrous start to the season. In 2025 it was a 1-8 start and 2026 is looking no better having been battered in his three matches so far against players outside the top 100. Not ideal for a player who’s 20th in the world.\n\nCobolli doesn’t like to be rushed (hence why he struggles on the fast courts that he’s been playing on this year) whilst Atmane’s massive swinging is error prone. With the courts being slower, I expect Cobolli to be the small favourite but I feel this match is going to depend on the first set dynamic. If Terence comes out firing in S1 I don’t see Flavio, being completely out of form and confidence, putting up too much of a fight to claw his way back into the game especially if the Frenchman is untouchable on serve. On the other hand, Atmane has a tendency to fully lose his ways when things aren’t going his way and then it gets ugly as the match progresses, hitting error after error similar to a Paire would do (semi-tanking). He only really gives his best when he’s winning and the only reason he stuck around against Tiafoe and Kypson is because he won the first set. Both players see very little long matches because of these profiles, Cobolli has seen U2.5 sets in 12/13 matches and Atmane in 13 of his last 17 matches since their match in Cincy. That match did quite literally go the distance but the conditions were different and both players were in quite different form so I strongly doubt that happens again. I would have fairer odds closer to 1.5. BOL !",

CST\n\nSame bet as last round here. Sinner came out and looked dominant in his R1 match against Machac. Conditions seem to suit him and mentally he looks right back to normal after the AO. He just recently crushed Popyrin at the US Open last year in straight sets and I expect nothing different. Coming into this tournament Popyrin was on a 10 match losing streak and got a cupcake R1 match against a Challenger level player. Don’t expect him to hang with Jannik from the baseline, meaning he would need a top tier serving display to make this one close.\n\n[PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/micahpugh?locale.x=en_US)\n\n[Venmo](https://venmo.com/u/Micah-Pugh)",

Even away from home, they control matches through possession, structure, and consistent chance creation. When they face mid-table sides, the quality gap usually shows over 90 minutes.\n\nWolves tend to struggle against elite opposition, often conceding territory and relying on limited attacking moments. In addition to that, Arsenal is the best defense in EPL\n\n**BOL!**",

The first tournament they added Zweih, they went 4-0 on Mirage, they beat Spirit, Falcons, Aurora and FURIA all without giving up double digits\n* This tournament has been a disaster for PARIVISION on Mirage, they have played the map 3 times and are 0-3 on the map so far this tournament losing each of the last 3 days in one sided fashion. They lost to G2 13-8, FaZe 13-2 and FURIA 13-8, while none of these teams are \"bad\" at Mirage, none of them are top teams/stand outs on the map in my opinion either. They have lost 69% of rounds in the last 3 days on Mirage and yet to win a pistol round on Mirage for the entire tournament, with low 30% winrate on both CT and T side\n* FUT are 86% winrate on 22 maps of Mirage in the L3 months, they are 7-1 in the last month overall. They are just coming off an insane 13 winstreak on this map, they lost to MOUZ today but I think their is a lot they can take from that series to help them here, I think FUT will look back at that game and feel like they beat themselves more then that MOUZ heavily outplayed them. \n* As said FUT were on a 13 map winstreak on Mirage before today, they have beaten multiple teams this tournament already on Mirage including Astralis, FURIA, Aurora, they also beat G2 and Astralis earlier in the month, these are two of the teams that PARIVISION have gotten destroyed by the last two days\n* Think the main two things lacking against MOUZ after they got their 7-2 lead was they got very sloppy/off script on T side, and got antsy on CT side and were trying to make too many plays and get too much info. These are things PARIVISION are great at punishing with Jame's system, so this gives FUT strong footage to review and use. On top of this, PARIVISION were the last game of the day and FUT knew that if PARI lost they would face them tomorrow, so they were watching today map 3 when FURIA and PARIVISION faced on Mirage and watched them get picked apart.

I expect a similar performance to their away game against Leeds.\n\n\\---\n\nWolves are coming off facing 10 shots on target against 17th placed Nottm Forest who literally sacked their manager after the game… I expect home ground to give wolves a boost but this Arsenal side will look to be as clinical as can be and look for an early lead, force wolves to press up, and kill it off with a second.

      "text": "Last 5 POTD : ✅️✅️✅️✅️✅️\n\n**Previous pick**: Switzerland vs Italy under 6.5 goals (+100) (Went exactly like expected, Switzerland put up a lot of shots but their firepower is not the same as Sweden or Finland to blowout the Italians!)\n\n**POTD Record**: 28-21\n\n**Today's Pick:** Finland vs Switzerland 12:10 pm EST (Olympics/Men's Hockey)\n\nFinland Puck line -1.5 (+125)\n\nStill perfect in these Olympics! These odds seems pretty high for a Finland win by 2. Like I said in the previous POTD, Finland has a **full NHL line-up** while Switzerland only have 9 NHL players and the rest of the team plays in the Swiss league. Combine this with the fact that Switzerland played today while Finland coaching team was watching them and finding ways to exploit their weaknesses it feels like an obvious win for Finland tomorrow. \n\nSwiss goalie Leonardo Genoni will be in net for sure and he's 38 years old. I know he didn't stop too many shots today vs Italy but tomorrow vs Finland it will be way different. There's a big difference between an NHL shot and an Italian player shot and I don't think the old goalie playing both games will be ready to stop this Finland offense that destroyed Italy 11-0 and Sweden 4-1. Meanwhile Finland will have Juuse Saros in net a proven number #1 goalie in the NHL that has played better and better each game and now hasn't allowed a goal in the last 95 minutes he was on the ice.\n\nFor me it goes down to 2 scenarios that could happen. First one is Finland destroys a less skilled team that played the day before and just can't keep up with them. Second one is Switzerland keeps it close but Finland the much better team and greater NHL experience manages to take the lead and then Switzerland pulls out their goalie and Finland ends it in an empty net. I just don't see Switzerland taking the lead tomorrow in any way except maybe in the first period when it's 0-0. Finland is on a 2 win streak where they dominated their opponents so they come with full confidence which will be important in a win or go home situation. They also have big expectations in Finland with the country winning the gold in 2022's Olympics so a quarterfinals loss would be nothing but a big dissapointment for them. (I know it's not the same roster from 2022 but still this roster is definitely confident enough that they can aim for a medal)\n\nBOL!\n\nIf I made you some money during these Olympics and you'd like to tip!\n\n[Buymeacoffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/lordestros)",

On the road to the title, the chances of them dropping points in a match like this are very slim, and honestly, I don’t think this game needs a ton of stats or deep analysis.\n\nI’ll just say this: In the 23 matches between the two teams, Arsenal have scored at least 2 goals in 17 of them (73.91%).",

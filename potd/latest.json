Hope everyone had a great Christmas yesterday. This is my first time posting, although I’ve been lurking here for a while, so let’s see how it goes. Quick note before we start: every pick I post will be for 1 unit, with the occasional 2‑unit play only when I’m extremely confident. Personally, I don’t see the value in going higher if your unit sizing is right, but of course that’s up to you.\n\nToday’s match takes us to the CBS Arena, where league leaders Coventry host 19th‑placed Swansea City. Coventry have been outstanding this season under Frank Lampard, already **scoring 53 goals** — and it’s only Christmas. For context, the next closest side is **3rd‑placed Ipswich with 38.**\n\nCoventry have hit a slight dip recently, collecting just **5 points from their last four league matches**. Even so, they’ve **only lost once in that stretch**, bringing their total to just **two defeats in 22 games**. That loss came away to 3rd‑placed Ipswich, hardly a disastrous result. Their three draws were against **Bristol City (9th), Preston (5th), and Southampton (11th)** — the latter played mostly with 10 men after a red card.\n\nThe biggest factor behind today’s pick, though, is Coventry’s home form. They’re unbeaten at the CBS Arena this season, turning it into a complete fortress. They’ve **won 8 and drawn 2 at home, scoring 26 and conceding only 7.** They’re also the league’s best away side, but if we’re nitpicking, their 3-0 loss to Ipswich last month did come on the road.\n\nStatistically, Coventry average **2.41 goals per game this season, rising to 2.6 at home**. Defensively, they’re the second‑best unit in the league, **conceding 1.05 per game overall and just 0.70 at home.** They’ll be without Jay DaSilva after his red card, but three first‑team players return after missing the Southampton match through illness.\n\nNow to Swansea. After finishing 11th last season, they find themselves down in 19th — not quite in the relegation scrap, but far from the playoff picture. Since appointing Vítor Matos at the end of November, they’ve improved noticeably, **winning 3 of their last 4 after losing the previous 5**. However, their away form remains a major concern. Their only defeat under Matos came away at Stoke (8th), and overall this season they’ve played **10 away matches, losing 6, winning 2, and drawing 2**, with a goal difference of **9 scored and 14 conceded.**\n\nSwansea score an average of **1.09 goals per game** this season, dropping to **0.90 away from home**. Defensively, they concede **1.36 per match overall**, rising slightly to **1.40 on the road**.\n\nAll things considered, Swansea do look improved under Matos, and this won’t be the walkover it might have been a month ago but Coventry’s dominant home form combined with Swansea’s struggles away should give the league leaders the edge on Boxing Day. As for the over 1.5 goals, the numbers speak for themselves backed further by the fact that **82% of Coventry’s matches** and **73% of Swansea’s** have gone over that line, and that trend hasn’t changed under the new manager.\n\nI expect Swansea to make this competitive, but Coventry’s attacking quality should still see them through with something like a 2-1 or 3-1 win at the CBS Arena to extend their lead at the top of the table to 9 points.\n\nFeel free to drop any thoughts or suggestions — like I said, first time doing this. Enjoy the rest of your Boxing Day, and best of luck if you’re tailing.",

Let's give this a go.\n\nFirst pick\n\n18:00 CET, basketball, Partizan-Maccabi Tel-Aviv\n\nPick: 4/5 units\n\nKK Partizan is in all sorts of turmoil; coach left, fans are booing their own players when they score. Defense is shite and so is the atmosphere in the team. Whether or not the new coach can solidify the team, I think after 3 days of signing that it'll not be on time.

With **Cory Joseph out**, their guard rotation becomes shorter and more ball-dominant through **Mike James and Okobo**, which usually slows the game down and leads to longer possessions rather than early offense.\n\nReal Madrid, on the other hand, are a team that clearly reduce tempo on the road. They prioritize defensive balance, limit transition opportunities and are comfortable playing through structured half-court sets. Against Monaco’s physical perimeter defense and switching schemes, easy points should be limited.\n\nFrom a matchup standpoint, there is a lot of defensive versatility on the floor: Diallo, Blossomgame and Theis for Monaco, and strong positional defenders on Madrid’s side. This usually translates into contested shots, fewer fast breaks and a game decided more by execution than rhythm.\n\nThe total at **174.5** feels a bit inflated for a game where both teams are likely to control pace, especially in the second half. Barring an unusually hot shooting night from both sides, this sets up well for an **under**.",

Defensively they’re solid too, conceding only 1.2 goals per game with a strong 1.02 xGA and a 40% clean-sheet rate.\n\nOur model gives Hull a 51% chance to win, compared to just 25% for Sheffield Wednesday.

A tale of two seasons between the teams, with Connah's Quay up in 2nd place and Flint Town United down around 10th (3rd to bottom of the table). The last two games between the sides has also resulted in wins for Connah's Quay, one with a dominating 4-0 victory, and the other a closely contested 3-2 win for Connah's Quay (Quay outplayed Flint Town by more than the score showed). I think this line should be closer to -200, and as I have been writing this, the line has already moved closer to that.\n\nOverall: As always my plays will be to win 1u.

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 5-14-3 *Our journey in Vietnam ends in disappointment as my losing streak is extended to five, and I'm pretty sure I'm winless in well over 10 picks by now. If you've been diligently fading me, congrats, you're probably a millionaire now. Guess I should've paid more attention to the H2H in that last game, but I think the Christmas miracle just wasn't meant to be. Inversely, I'm pretty sure that had I bet on under 8.5 goals, they would've found a way to score 9, bonus points if half of them would've come past the 80th minute. Anyway, moving on to the competition that I still haven't managed to tame (the AFCON), but I'm determined to change that with my next, well-researched pick. Let's get it done*\n\n**Last Five:** ❌❌❌❌❌\n\n**Event:** AFCON, Angola v Zimbabwe, 7:30 am EST\n\n**POTD:** Zimbabwe Win or Draw + Under 3.5 goals +130, 4 units\n\n**Write Up:** Despite both Angola and Zimbabwe losing their opening AFCON group stage fixtures - Angola narrowly went down 2-1 to South Africa while Zimbabwe were dramatically beaten 2-1 by paper favorites Egypt - there are solid enough reasons to back **Zimbabwe to avoid defeat today**. Angola’s AFCON history shows they’ve **only won one of their 10 opening games** at the tournament and have often dropped points in their second fixture after an initial loss, with draws in 1996 and 2006 following opening defeats. Meanwhile, **Zimbabwe have historically absolutely held their own against Angola**, and the overall **H2H is well balanced,** with both teams winning **eight times apiece and registering three draws** across their numerous encounters.\n\nZimbabwe’s squad is certainly not noticeably weaker than that of Angola, and it carries momentum from the recent goalscoring form, including **Prince Dube**, who scored a silky goal against Egypt, and they’ve shown they can score in successive matches. Angola are missing striker **Zini** through injury, which could blunt their attack and give Zimbabwe a tactical edge. Add to that Angola’s inconsistent form and Zimbabwe’s resilience in tight games, and a **Zimbabwe win or draw** looks like a sensible, value-backed prediction for this crucial AFCON group game. There's also the possibility of neither team wanting to risk it ahead of the important Egypt - South Africa clash, thus making the draw even more likely (works for us). I'm certainly loving this pick and **pairing it with an Under 3.5 match goals** leg (I'm very positive this will be a **low scoring affair,** *personally feeling a 1-1 or a 2-1 Zimbabwe masterclass).* They've **nearly stunned Egypt,** so why can't they take it a step further? Exactly, there's no reason they can't. I've spent hours researching the underlying data behind this pick, so I'm feeling very confident that it's gonna hit and finally release me out of the shackles of the horror run that I'm having atm - staking 4 units on this. Covering two outcomes and sprinkling an Under feels like great value for these odds, and the more I look at it, the better I feel about this. I don't mind the BTTS Yes pick either, but I've gone with the outlined POTD in the end. BOL whether you tail or fade, let's have some fun and hopefully make some money together ☘️",

The data shows Ipswich creating higher-quality chances while the game profile still supports goals without needing a high-scoring shootout.

Oddly enough there's only one match today, but it's bound to be an entertaining one as 7th place Man United hosting 11th place Newcastle. This is an important match as both teams are vying for spots in European football next season. \n\nManchester United has been a mixed bag this year. They score a lot of goals and concede a lot of goals, in fact they have the highest # of total goals per match in the EPL. They are currently missing a ton of players, including their leading Goalscorer and leader of assist with Mbuemo,  Bruno Fernandes, and Amad all out due to AFCON/injury. They're going to be looking for creativity and Cunha looks tocbe the guy to try to fill those shoes. \n\nCunha has been on a year lately, after some injuryy struggles early in the season. In his last 3 games, he has really turned it on. In these last 3 matches, he has averaged 7.3 shots/game, 2.7 SOTs per game, and scored 2 goals. With Bruno now out, I see him getting even more of the ball and taking more shots. The books currently have his as Man U's most probable Goalscorer, most probable shot taker, but behind Sesko and Zirkee in probable SOTs. I think this line is mispriced based on these trends, but we will certainly take it. \n\nNewcastle is a decent team defensively, but play much better at home than on the road. They have not had a lot of tough road tests this season, but notably they conceded 7 SOTs on 15 shots away at Brentford, 9 SOTs on 15 shots away at West Ham (who only had 38% possession). Predicting a lot of shots and goals here - love this line in this spot. \n\nBOL and hope you all had a great Christmas!",

I foresee and conclude too many things that can go right for New Mexico , and too many things that can go wrong for Minnesota.",

If anybody's been around, we’ve been on a roll the past few years and looking to continue with more of the same. It’s a pretty even split this year as far as the playing field goes. A clear top 5, a Slovakia team that can be a little scrappy and the last 4 fighting to stay out of relegation.\n\nWith that being said, we’re going to start the slate off with the US covering against the Germans. The Americans have the Germans number in this tournament, routinely dominating them year in and year out. The US didn’t bring a gold favorite to the tournament like last year, but they should still comfortably fight for a medal. The Germans on the other hand will be fighting to stay in the top division for another year.\n\nWe only have a few pretournament games to go off of for both teams, but luckily for us they already played eachother 4 days ago, with the Americans winning by 8. Germany did start their backup in this game, but it wouldn't have mattered much. USA also sat a few of their returnees to get some looks at depth players before the final round of cuts. Expect a pretty big mismatch between a gold medal hopeful and a team trying to just stay afloat to start us off",

Under Kim Hellberg, Boro have climbed to second in the Championship thanks to consistent performances and an aggressive, possession-oriented tactical setup that sees them dominate games and control midfield play — a philosophy Hellberg has publicly praised for its intensity and control in recent press comments after big wins like the 4-1 rout of Hull. At home they are particularly dangerous, with seven wins in ten league matches this season and a habit of starting games strongly, making them favorites in front of their supporters. Injuries to Lenihan and Fry are a concern, but Boro’s defensive reinforcements and creative balance — including form attackers Strelec and Conway — mean they have more depth than struggling Blackburn. Conversely, Blackburn’s squad is stretched with key absences including potential issue with Gudjohnsen and other regulars, and coach Valérien Ismaël has recently admitted attitude issues in training, undermining consistency and preparation. With Boro’s clear motivation to consolidate an automatic promotion spot and Blackburn still fighting just to climb away from the bottom, the hosts have both the tactical edge and psychological incentive to take all three points.",

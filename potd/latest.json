Neat. \n\nNCAAB // Loyola Chicago Ramblers @ Wichita State Shockers\n\n**Pick: Wichita State -3.5 (-110) 1u**\n\n  \nGoing back to the literal only thing that's worked in the last week, fading Loyola Chicago. They come in at 1-2 with a lackluster resume including a horrific 8-point loss to Mercyhurst (#332 in KenPom). Now they have to hit the road for the first time this year and are coming up against a Wichita State team who has looked good to start the season albeit against bad competition. \n\n  \nWichita state is 2-0 and dropped 105 points their last time out. Wichita State has been shooting the ball well and has been dominant on the glass so far boasting a rebound margin of +14 per game. Meanwhile Loyola Chicago has struggled in this area sitting at a rebounding margin of -8. Keep in mind that is coming against much worse competition than Wichita State as they got outrebounded by both Cleveland State and Mercyhurst. \n\n  \nIt is hard to see a way that Loyola Chicago overcomes what should be a huge rebounding discrepancy, which should lead to a lot of one and done possessions for them and a lot of second chance opportunities for Wichita State. \n\n\n\nWichita State: #106 in KenPom\n\nLoyola Chicago: #139 in KenPom\n\nWichita State: 2-0 ATS covering with an average margin of +16.5pts. \n\nLoyola Chicago: 0-3 ATS not covering by an average margin of -15.7pts. \n\n  \nLet's take a look at some of Wichita State's chants and cheers via their school's official website:\n\n* \"LET'S GO SHOCKS!\"\n* \"GO SHOCKS GO!\"\n* \"YOU DON'T WANT TO GO TO WAR, WITH THE SHOCKERS, DON'T START NO STUFF, WON'T BE NO STUFF!\"\n* \"HEYYYYYY OHHHHHHH, SHOCKERS GONNA SHOCK YOU AGAIN!\"\n* \"HEY GO SHOCKS! HEY GO SHOCKS! HEY GO SHOCKS! WE'RE GONNA BEAT THE HECK OUT OF YOU, AND YOU, AND YOU AND YOU AND YOU!\"\n\n  \nWow, if that doesn't instill confidence in this pick than I don't know what would. \n\nGive 'em the shocker!",

      "text": "Record: 50-29 (+43.6 units)\n\nLast 10 (most recent on right):  ❌✅✅✅✅❌✅✅✅❌\n\nLast Pick: Rayo Vallecano +1.5 corner handicap vs Real Madrid (or +2 corner handicap) ❌\n\nEvent: UEFA World Cup Qualifying ⚽️\n\nPick of the Day: England vs Serbia O3.5 total cards 4U @ 1.90 (Bet365)\n\nWrite-up: Bit of a frustrating loss to be honest, Vallecano really gave Los Blancos a tough game ending in a 0-0 draw. As a result of this being a good result for Rayo and not so much for Real, the leaders expectedly piled on pressure towards the end of the match which provided more corner opportunities. The home team were actually leading on the count 5-4 in the 80th when Madrid were mistakenly given a corner as Vini clearly kicked the ball out himself. This was then followed by Fran Perez intentionally letting the ball run out of play thinking it would be a goal kick but added another corner. The count ended 8-5 to Real, let’s bounce back.\n\nTuchel-ball is in full flow and has got the England fans dreaming of a second World Cup success after their 1966 victory. The Three Lions have a new generation of players after the last couple of golden generations came short and I do seriously see them as contenders in tournaments to come having narrowly lost the Euros final to Spain last year. England have won all 10 matches under Tuchel and conceded just one goal in that time frame though the opposition has been pretty light and are a lock for WC26 qualification. Meanwhile this is a big game for Serbia who sit 3rd in Group K and will be battling it out with Albania for a play-off spot. They last failed to qualify in 2014 but their destiny is out of their hands unless they can get a win tonight at Wembley. It won’t be an easy task but Panuović’s men won’t go down without a fight and I expect this to be a feisty affair which is good on the cards front.\n\nEngland has averaged 1.6 cards for + 2.3 against cards in their last 20 competitive whilst Serbia has 2.4 and conceded 1.7 in the same timeframe. Using more recent stats and home/away splits I get an estimated 3.6 total cards (1.5 for England, 2.1 for Serbia). Slovak referee of the day Ivan Kružliak has averaged 4.3 cards per match this season with a career 5.2 handed out on average. Using his card-friendly weighting I get an approximate 2.1 cards for The Three Lions and 2.9 for the Eagles (4.9 total). That gives this play an estimated 72% chance of winning and the line cleared in the reverse fixture. BOL !\n\nI’m raising money for Movember, ALL proceeds will be going to a good cause. Donations aren’t expected but very much appreciated so if you have profited from my picks please do consider donating, a little goes a long way.

The Jets began the season 0-7, but they are coming off 2 straight wins vs the Bengals & most recently the Browns. Yes, 2 very bad teams. __This was after New York traded their 2 best defensive players at the trade deadline, DT Quinnen Williams & CB Sauce Gardner. And now they will be without star WR Garrett Wilson being out the next few weeks with a knee injury.__ They’re down to crumbs. As for the Patriots, they started the season 1-2 after 3 games & have not lost since, looking for their 8th straight win. They are now 1.5 games ahead of the Bills in the AFC East Standings. __The Patriots have covered the spread in 5 of their last 6 games.__ This is mostly due to Drake Maye playing some good football at QB, but the run game exploded last week as well.\n\nPats QB Drake Maye has been a beast this year. __The 23 year old QB has 250+ passing yards in 5 of his last 6 games, throwing for 270 yards last week.__ He has 2555 passing yards on the year, with a 19 to 5 TD to INT ratio. Nate has been the most accurate passer in the league so far this season. __Maye ranks #1 in the NFL in Catchable Ball Thrown Rate at 83%. Inside 10 yards on quick passes, his 92.8% well thrown pct on quick passes trails only Josh Allen while the Pats convert 53.3% of these concepts into successful plays, 3rd best in the NFL. His completion pct on 10+ yard throws is 63.7% this season, (2nd). He’s also 2nd in the league in 20+ yard passes (35), 30+ yard passes (14), 40 yard passes (6), & leads the league in 50+ yarders (5).__ He’s been able to do so because he has been reading defenses at an extremely elite level, even when coverages are hidden. __Maye leads the NFL with 700 pass yds & 6 pass TD against disguised coverages this season.__ This is key because the Jets run disguises coverages more than any team in the league. __They use a base scheme that leans zone (67% of snaps), but they frequently switch to man after snap (33% 8th most in NFL), especially in key situations. Against man coverage, Maye is averaging 9.7 yards per pass (2nd). He also has a league high 14% scramble rate against man coverage, which will be a problem for a weak Jets DL.__ The Jets have struggled to pressure opposing QB’s, even moreso now after trading their best DLineman. __The Jets are 31st in pressure rate (28.9%) & do not have a single INT this season. When Maye is not pressured he has a 78.6% completion pct (4th) for 9.0 yards per pass (3rd), & a 7.3% TD rate (7th).__ Why does all of this matter? Because the Patriots are going to torch them early, then feed TreVeyon. __The Patriots have led at halftime in 7 straight games. They dominate in the 2nd Quarter with a +35 point differential (3rd in NFL). Now they face a Jets team that has a point differential of -50 in the 2nd Quarter (2nd worst) & -28 in the 1st (5th worst).__ Maye is going to do some damage, take a big lead, & make the defense focus on him. Then it’s going to be Rookie 2nd round pick, TreVeyon Henderson time…\n\nIt may have taken a few injuries, but Henderson finally had the breakout game we’ve all been waiting for. __Henderson broke out in a big way last week, putting up 147 yards on 14 carries with 2 TD’s against a tough Buccaneers defense. The explosion was on full display, as he ripped off not one, but two long TD runs (55 & 69 yards). He hit 22.01 MPH on those runs, the fastest by any Patriots ball carrier since 2018, and the 5th fastest overall this year.__ But what is more important what how often he was on the field. With starter Rhamondre Stevenson out with a toe injury (also ruled out this week), Henderson was promoted to starter & flourished. __Not only did Henderson set season high’s in carries (14), rushing yards (147), TDs (2) but he also set a season high in snap percentage at 84%.__ The other RB, undrafted 2nd year Terrell Jennings left the game with a knee injury & is listed as questionable this week, but it was clear regardless that this was Henderson’s backfield as even with Jennings active in Week 9, Henderson played 75% of the snaps, so Henderson should be set up for another high workload game. His improvement these past 3 weeks have been unbelievable. __In Week’s 1-7 he averaged 3.56 YPC (36th of 42 RBs) & 0% explosive rate (last). Week 8-10: 7.29 YPC (3rd) & a 13.2% explosive rate (2nd). His 10.5 YPC was the highest in the NFL this past week. He had 93 rush yards over expected. Rhamondre Stevenson has 20 RYOE on the SEASON. Henserson now ranks ranks 2nd in yards before contact per attempt among RB’s with 25 carries.__ Schematically this is a matchup nightmare for the Jets. __Henderson has been significantly more successful on zone rush concepts, with a 57.7% success rate compared to a 41.2% success rate versus man/gap concepts. The Jets are the 6th worst vs zone rush concepts allowing 4.5 YPC.__ As for when he does run in gap concepts he loves the B & D gaps. __He averages 7.1 YPC in B Gap (most in NFL) with a 52.8% success rate 8.0 YPC with a 64.0% success rate in the D Gap (compared to 3.3 YPC & 37% success rate in the A & C gaps). The Jets give up most the YPC to the B & D gaps at 5.33 YPC.__ But the biggest way he earned trust from the coaches was in practice last week. In their previous game before the Bucs, when pass blocking Henderson allowed 3 pressures for a 28.7 pass block grade. He practiced it hard all week & it paid off. __Last game Henderson allowed 0 pressures in pass protection, good for a 79.6 pass block grade, both season highs.__ Now he faces a bad Jets defense that has been torched on the ground. __The Jets are allowing 104.5 rushing yards per game to backs (23rd) & they allow the 6th highest EPA/rush (0.02). Opposing RB’s vs the Jets have exploded this season (starting with the most recent): Judkins 22/75, Brown/Perine 21/167, Dowdle 17/79, Javonte, Williams 16/135, Achane 20/99, & Cook 21/132. They’ve allowed the 6th most YPC their last 3 games (5.1). Opponents run on the Jets 49.02% of their plays (4th most in the league.__ Also Jets QB Justin Fields is bad. He completed just 6 passes for 54 yards last week, & has throw for less than 54 yards in 3 out of his last 4 game, completed less than 10 passes in those games. He’s also failed to top 31 rushing yards in 5 straight games. Jets avg 143.8 passing yards (last). Now they’re without their best WR.\n\nThere’s a lot more but ran out of room. Pats -12.5. OL is fantastic. QB playing great. The Jets suck. Coaches will let Henderson eat.\n\n__TreVeyon Henderson o76.5 rushing yards__\n\nAppreciate the love!

Even if they don't take the map outright, I think we see a much closer game overall. Of TYLOO's recent 4 Nuke games, they have upsets against Vitality/FaZe and a 13-11 loss against 3DMAX who are another fantastic Nuke team, I think they are a better Nuke team then they showed against paiN\n* DGT has struggled on Nuke heavily, especially recently, DGT is averaging a .54 KPR last month on Nuke, a .59 KPR L3 months, and a .64 KPR since joining paiN overall. Solid drop off especilly considering the strong results paiN have showed on this map, meaning the drop is even more substantial\n* Jamyoung has maintained strong Nuke stats throughout the last year despite TYLOO's struggles on it as a team. He is averaging a .71 KPR L3 months on the map, a .81 KPR L6 months and a .81 KPR in the last year as well on the map\n* DGT will start on T side, since joining paiN he has had solid T side numbers compared to most players but still weaker then on CT side by a slight margin averaging a .63 KPR average on T side Nuke\n* JamYoung will start on CT side, in the last year he has averaged very strong CT side numbers averaging a .80 KPR on CT side, but is quite good on T side as well giving him a strong balance overall\n* Last time they faced h2h, DGT beat Jamyoung on Nuke 11-9 in kills, this was despite a paiN 13-6 win. On top of this, Jamyoung has played 21 maps of Nuke in the last 12 months, against paiN was the only map he has ever dropped single digit kills",

      "text": " Record: 22-14\n\nNet Units: +14.17\n\nYesterday's Pick: Atletico MG to win vs Fortaleza 3u @ $1.61\n\n3-1 up and drew 3-3 with an injury time goal. Spewing. \n\nOnly slight positive from the game is that the Fortaleza player who scored a hatty played for Atletico last season and apologized after scoring three times. I don't think I've seen that before. \n\nToday's Pick: Mbappe to score anytime vs Ukraine 3u at $1.57\n\nI got this at $1.61, and it's already down to $1.57 at the time of writing, which is about 4 hours before the post goes live. \n\nIt's an important game for France, so I'm expecting all the big guns to come out. \n\nIf Mbappe plays for France recently, he scores. In his last two international windows (3 games) he's scored three and assisted two. \n\nOne of those goals was the away game vs Ukraine. \n\nMbappe is also the penalty taker, so that will be another way he can score. Always nice to have the pen taker when picking a scorer. \n\nLike I said before, it's an important game for France... There is only 3 points separation between France and Ukraine and a five-goal difference... So a loss can really make things tight, where a win can secure qualification.\n\nFrance won't want to mess about here.\n\nIf the $1.57 isn't to your liking, I also don't hate Mbappe and Olise both to score or assist at $2. ",

His average sits lower than the line at 32.2, but since week 5, he's been seeing more usage, averaging 1.8 targets with 1.4 receptions weeks 1-5, meanwhile weeks 6-10 having 4.8 targets with 3.8 receptions. While his target share has been low at only \\~12% in 2025, Kayshon Boutte has been ruled out, along with TE2 Austin Hooper, which will pump his numbers up, with the potential to be WR2 behind Stephon Diggs\n\nWhile Hollins is versatile and can play generally well in both, he tends to do better in zone coverage which is what Jets run about 2/3rds of the time. Not only that but the Jets do worse against outside receivers  Jets also allow 8 yards per target to opposing receivers. Another thing to note is that outside Cornerback Azaraeye'h Thomas has been ruled out for this game, allowing for easier matchups for our outside receivers, and makes it less intimidating as the jets hold the 8th best pass defense.\n\nThe last bit of info i'd like to add is that this is a Thursday night divisional game, if I was superstitious, i'd say something about the last 3 snooze fest primetime games. The lines are heavily in Patriots favor, yet recently (post Tom Brady Patriots), Jets mostly have been able to keep the game within 1 score, with November 24th of 2021 being the last time Jets lost by more than that 1 score. If this is potentially a trap game, there could be a larger chance for more passes, and more to our boy Hollins.\n\nBOL to anyone tailing!\n\n[Tips Greatly Appreciated ☕](https://buymeacoffee.com/pefpef)",

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 2-0\n\n**Previous Pick:** Morgan Gibbs White 1+ SOT (-110) ✅️\n\n**Today's Event:** UEFA World Cup Quals | England vs Serbia (11:45 AM PST)\n\n**Pick:** Elliot Anderson 1+ SOT (+110), 1 unit to win 1.1 units\n\n**Write Up:** Hello again friends! We're back after a few days break with some world cup qualifier action where we're into the last two games of the group stage. In case you can't tell by now, I love SOT plays. They're quite fun to root for while watching a match. Our first two plays both hit within the first 3 minutes of their respective games, great start to POTD! I was waffling here between this pick and England 3+ goals, but landed here because this one could be a slog. England have qualified for the world cup, so this is technically a meaningless game for them. But England boss Thomas Tuchel wants his side to continue to gel and build momentum. He also loves himself some Elliot Anderson. Anderson has played nearly every minute for England since his first cap with the senior squad in September. Anderson also fits the mold for my favorite kind of player to back, scrappy hard working midfielders who like to take long shots. We're getting good odds here because Anderson has only recorded a SOT for England in 1 of 4 matches. But in his last match against Latvia, he took 5 shots. While none of those found the target, the uptick in shot attempts are promising as his confidence builds and he cements himself in England's midfield. \n\nNow to Serbia. They currently sit 3rd in the group, 1 point behind Albania. Serbia needs a point here to stay alive in qualifiers. I expect them to park the bus and invite shots from a distance, as they won't win a high goal shootout with England. This is Anderson's shooting range and I fully expect him to find the target here, if not the back of the net. \n\nBOL!",

Moldova at home though to get just 2 corners, when they got 6 in the reverse matchup seems great, so far with 6 games played Moldova covered this in all but 1 game away vs Norway. At home, Moldova got 6 vs Norway. Moldova have also previously gotten at least 2 vs Romania in a friendly very recently and vs Poland. Italy have given up 2 or more corners in 5/6 games during the group stage. Simply expect the home side to show a respectable performance and get at least 2 corners here.",

Maye has been leaning on short and middle reads, especially to his TE which Henry already averages about 3.8 receptions and 44.9 yards per game with him.\n\n\nAustin Hooper’s absence removes the team’s TE2 and a reliable underneath target. That means Henry should get nearly all tight end snaps.\n\n\nKayshon Boutte missing will hurt their WR core, so the Patriots may funnel more targets toward Henry . Also The Jets this season allow tight ends to average about 42.6 receiving yards per game when being targeted. ",

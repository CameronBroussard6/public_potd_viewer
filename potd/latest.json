He doesn’t play because he needs money. He plays for the chance at raising another Lombardi and accolades and of course proving people wrong. I saw enough out of him the last two games to say that since Dublin he has been starting to shake the rust off and get a decent passing game going. First few games he was completing an average of 17 passes and the last two games his completed passes is 22 avg. he finished with 249 in Cincinnati and before that he threw for 235 against a Cleveland defense that isn’t bad at all. He can grab this and my God I almost said to take him at better odds for 220 but seeing how we missed the mark by 2 yds I wanted to make sure we hit lol. Bol everybody let’s get a W and win number 50 on the year.",

Rodgers is back to face his former team, you know straight off the bat this is going to be a good high scoring game. This season, both teams have at least half their games over 45.5 scoring. Packers have been average just over 26 points per game with the Steelers averaging 25. Steelers have been giving up some major yardage this season. With deep threat Watson back, along with Kraft and Doubs who have been really shaping up this season, the Packers are looking good to get a few scores. On the flip side, Steelers have home advantage with Rodger playing his former team. WIth a tough run defense from the packers, Steelers will be using weapons like DK Metcalf who's been averaging nearly 70 yards a game, or screen passing to Gainwell. I could see this game going over 50, BOL everyone tailing.\n\n[http://buymeacoffee.com/Pefkov](http://buymeacoffee.com/Pefkov)",

I'll just preface this by saying I know I'm not the best capper in the world, but hey, a 1.2% ROI is still plus money at least.\n\n  \nLet's start with Dak. He's gone over in 4/7 games, missing the over in 1 game by 3 yards and hitting in back back. We all know he has great weapons in CD, Pickens, and Fergie, but what really excites me is this Broncos D. Yes they have Surtain, and yes, they're the 6th best in the league and only allowing 180 passing yards per game, but let's breakdown those 7 games:\n\nAgainst Bad QBs:  \nCam Ward - 112  \nJustin Fields - 45  \nJake Browning - 125\n\nAgainst Good QBs:  \nDaniel Jones - 316  \nJustin Herbert - 300  \nJalen Hurts - 280  \nJaxson Dart - 283\n\nAgainst bad QBs, they're averaging 94 passing yards given up versus 295 against good QBs with good QBs going over in all 4. This defense is getting gashed and Dak, the league's second leading passer, is a good QB. Take the over.\n\n  \nAnd what do I really have to say about Bijan? He leads the league in yards from scrimmage per game at 152 and is going up against the league's worst rushing defense in the Dolphins. I don't really care who's in at QB, I'm trusting the talent here.",

The Hornets will be on the second game of their B2B and might have lost Miller to injury who did not return after the second quarter. They don’t have the depth that the Wizards have, and I don’t trust Ball to carry them here. At home let’s bet on the in-form and energetic Wiz covering their spread.",

Out of the 8 games so far, he’s scored in every game but one. He’s scored 11 goals from 8 games in EPL and 4 goals from 3 UCL games. \n\nHaaland did have a mid-week game but expect him to start. I’m placing a unit on this bet purely based on the run Haaland’s had this season, he’s a prolific striker who’s not only in the right position, but has strength and speed over 90% of the league’s defence. \n\nBest of luck to those who follow! 🤞🏻",

The tiny team from an even smaller town clinched the Swedish title away from home in their last match. \n\nMjallby have been great this season, going 20-6-1 in their 27 games so far. \n\nTheir performance has been on the back of their league-leading defence, having conceded only 17 goals in 27 games. While they're not at the top in clean sheets, they've only concealed more than a single goal twice this season (one was day one of the season, and the other was in May). So they are known to give little away. \n\nNow they go back home in their first game after being crowned champs and host 13th placed Norrkoping, who sit just outside the relegation spots in a 16-team league. \n\nNorrkoping obviously need points here to help secure their safety, but I think Mjallby will be too good at home. Especially when you consider Norrkoping have only won 3 away games all season, and two of those were early on.\n\nMotivation after winning the league is always an issue, but this will be the first home game since, and you want to celebrate with the fans.\n\nWhile I'm thinking almost everything points to a Mjallby win here, I'm not convinced it'll be a big score. Only 5 of Mjallby's 20 league wins this season have cleared the o3.5 goals threshold, and the last of those was early August. \n\nAnd only six of their 27 total league games this season have had more than 3.5 goals scored.... 3 of which were in their first 5 games this season. \n\nIf you want to be safer, you can find Mjallby outright at over $1.50 in most places, but I'm confident enough in the game going under 3.5 goals.",

Backfields this year have averaged \\~103 rushing yards on 22–23 attempts (4.61 YPC) against them, allowing chunk-yardage efficiency.* \n\n*This has allowed every high useage back to cover this line this season:*\n\n*Rico Dowdle - 15 Longest Rush Attempt*  \n*Breece Hall - 22 LoR*  \n*Josh Jacobs - 19 LoR*  \n*Saquon Barkley - 16 LoR*\n\n*Stylistically, this sets up for Dobbins. He’s a decisive, one-cut runner—hit the landmark, stick your foot in the ground, and go. Against Dallas’ front, that cutback lane shows up a few times a game.*\n\n*The Cowboys’ run metrics are solid snap-to-snap, but they allow above-average yards after contact and have coughed up explosives when backs get through the first wave. That’s Dobbins’ wheelhouse.*\n\n*With a realistic 12–16 carries in a neutral script and the way Dallas has given up sporadic gashes to RBs, you’re live on every early-down touch.*\n\n*Dallas looks sturdier against zone than they do against man/gap concepts, where higher yards per carry and a bump in explosive rate is allowed. Dobbins favors in gap runs, having 59 carries there compared to the 44 zone carries.*\n\n*Dobbins is a perfect fit for those gap looks: downhill, decisive, and a strong finisher through the second level. One clean B-gap crease on GT counter or duo, and you’ve got the one play you need to clear 15.5.*",

Barcelona are still missing key finishers like Lewandowski and Raphinha, and their current front line can be very wasteful.\n\nI think madrid has been defensively the much better side with huijsen and militao being in good form. Also the keepers are a big mismatch, missing joan garcia is a big problem for barcelona. \n\nIf cubarsi and garcia start as the projected lineups suggest, then i think mbappe will feast. This is the type of game where araujo should start and christensen if he is fit. \n\nAll things considered, with the home advantage and Mbappé in top form, I see Real Madrid as clear favourites for this one.\n\nGood luck on your bets",

As expected it was a battle between the two with Bencic coming out on top in three sets. 2 double faults in the first set followed by another 2 in the second necessitated none in the third from Kenin. Unfortunately she waited until the last game of the match at 5-2 to DF a fifth time. \n\nWe should be in for an entertaining game at the Emirates as this is a fixture that has historically brought goals aplenty, ending 2-2 and 1-5 last year. Arsenal are top of the league at the moment and have established themselves as the best defence in the world only conceding 3 all season. Meanwhile after a very promising start to the season, winning the Community Shield after the FA Cup last season, Palace are winless in their last three. Referee of the day Thomas Bramall is amongst the most lenient referees in the league averaging 4 booking points per match. Meanwhile, Palace have received an average of 2.25 yellows per match this season. What really amazed me while analysing this match is the fact that this line has been cleared in the last 22 matches between the two sides, dating back to 2014. That is honestly quite absurd and though doesn’t represent a whole lot of a deal, shows that despite being a “London derby” tensions usually remain low, which should help with decreasing bookings. Using all factors I get a mean of 1.90 bookings for Palace.\n\nThat gives this play an estimated 68% chance of winning. By building in the H2H I would give it closer to a 73% chance of winning (1.70 bookings). BOL !",

I will be back to normal now and try get a potd out every day, anyway Haaland had me sweating after the first half but he cleared this line and more and the statistics still stand. 7 in a row, let's come back with a bang and keep making money. \n\nTODAYS BET \n\nEVENT/S = Arsenal VS Crystal Palaca\n\nPARLAY BET =  Arsenal to win Second half and Viktor Gyokeres to have over 0.5 shots on target @2.07\n\nUNITS = 3U to Profit 3.21U\n\nSUMMARY =  I looked at a lot of games and a lot of players, even looking at the NBA which I am also a big fan of but statistically and for value I have decided on Arsenal. Arsenal have won every second half this season aside from 2. Their win against United earlier in the season had a second half with no goals and the wonder free kick Conceded against Liverpool from Szoboszlai. I actually see Arsenal winning both halves after a strong performance last time out against Atletico Madrid I think their form will be too strong and the fact they are a team that closes out games is a good sign, Crystal Palace form isn't too relevant here but they haven't been great recently, they do score goals but their 2nd half stats are far too inconsistent to hold any relevancy to me. Now onto the second part of the bet, Gyokeres has been a pretty average striker for majority of the season so far but he had a really good game against Atletico Madrid bagging 2 goals for himself. He has hit one shot on target in every game this season apart from 3. The game against city that ended 1-1, the loss against Liverpool previously mentioned and the opener against Man United. Every other game he has hit 1 shot on target if not more. I feel like he scores in this game but getting value for 1 shot on target is even better. Let's make it a winning return and 8 wins in a row. \n\nIf my picks help you and you'd like to show your appreciation a thumbs up is perfect, if you'd like to tip which is never expected but always appreciated and does help motivate me for the research here you go.

      "text": "Record: 17-8 (+21.43u)\n\nLast 10: 💰💰💰✖️✖️💰💰💰✖️💰\n\nLast POTD: 🏈 Oronde Gasden II 25+ alt receiving yards + Under 52.5 alt total points (-139). 💰\n\nWriteup: Gasden is going to be legit in this league. Not only did he hit his actual line of 44 yards but he hit the 60-100 range I mentioned in the last writeup. The under got a little squirrely at the end with LA having a chance to score a touchdown late, but they were stopped for a field goal. \n\nToday’s POTD: 🏈 Jonathan Taylor under 20.5 Rushing Attempts (-114)\n\nGame starts at 4:25pm EST. Bet 2.75u\n\nWriteup: Going for a non primetime game this weekend as we are once again going with a Colts bet. We are taking the under on JT's rush attempts, and this is actually because I continue to have a positive outlook on the Colts. They are going up against the Tennessee Titans, who are probably a bottom 3 team in the NFL. The spread for this game is Colts -14.5, and I like the Colts with their points in a decisive victory. Over the course of the season, JT has been averaging 18.5 rush attempts and has only gone over this line twice. Over the last 5 weeks, Jonathan Taylor has been under this line 4 times. Those 4 games were ones where the Colts were up big by the 4th quarter, and they would pull JT to rest him in the 4th because he wasn't needed in order to win. The one time he went over this line, by 1 rush attempt, was against the Cardinals. This game was won by the Colts by only 4 points and came down to the wire - JT was needed all game. The second game where he went over was against the Broncos - another close game. You see the pattern? If we follow the trends here, JT and the Colts will have yet another effective game where JT will not need to run much, and he could once again get pulled early. There are still games in the 5 game stretch where he wasn't pulled and still stayed under this line, so don't worry about that. The last time the Colts played the Titans, JT only had 17 rush attempts. If the Titans defense manage to stop JT on the ground, this only helps us. The Colts are genuinely playing for the Super Bowl - if they can rest their stars, they will whenever they can. JT does not need to and will not go over 20.5 rush attempts in this game.\n\nRemember to only bet what you can afford, and BOL!",

Max Caputo scored a double to put City up 2-0 within the first half, putting us in a comfortable position.\n\nThe game ended 4-0 with 2 long range efforts in the end to seal the bet and land a win at good odds. 💰\n\n-\n\n**Today's POTD:** Football - A-League - Brisbane Roar v Wellington Phoenix - Under 2.5 Goals - $1.90 - 1.0 Unit - *starting in roughly 2 hours..*\n\nBrisbane will travel to Wellington for their second game of the season. The catch is that Wellington have just gone to Perth and back (15 hours of flight time), so they are more likely to be affected if anything.\n\nBrisbane enjoyed a 1-0 win at home to Macarthur in their first game, and only registered 6 shots, creating 1 big chance, with 36% possession of the ball. But what’s impressive was their ability to shut them out as the Roar were playing with 10 men from the 58th minute onwards.\n\nWellington managed a 2-2 draw with Perth away from home. Perth conceded 4 to City yesterday and were looking quite amateur, so the Wellington result doesn’t read so well considering they only managed 0.78xG for their 2 goals.\n\nI believe Brisbane will take the safe approach here, as they don’t want to drop any points after a strong start. I expect them to have more ball than last game but Wellington may struggle to break them down resulting in a low scoring game. If Brisbane get a lead they will try to manage the game and inevitably park the bus.\n\nThis fixture has hit the under 2.5 goal line for the past 5 matches and the last time it produced more than 2 goals was back in 2023. They both lack natural goal scorers and only averaged just over a goal per game each last season.\n\nI do have a slight concern about their defensive records from last season, so I’m keeping it safe with a 1 unit play.\n\n-\n\n**13 wins in 17 bets,** well done to any followers.

They have a 100% first ban rate of Mirage, and last time they played SAW (Feb 2025), they banned Mirage first. SAW should ban Inferno, it is their worst map by far and one 3DMAX are dominant on\n* SAW have first pick in this series, I'd be really stunned to see them go anything but Nuke as their first pick. 3DMAX weren't known as a great Nuke team earlier in the year but recently have been red hot on the map. Their winrate has climbed and they have begun first picking the map with a 65% winrate on 17 maps played with most of these games being against tier one teams which is very impressive.\n* Despite this, SAW have a 92% winrate on Nuke and are on a 10 map winstreak on the map, they are so dominant and so good at this map that even teams that don't normally first ban Nuke have started to ban it against them. They first pick this map in 59% of their matches which is an insanely high amount and for good reason.\n* Ag1l leads SAW on Nuke, this is his best map by far on the roster. He is averaging a .85 KPR in the L3 months on Nuke (+.11 KPR) over a strong sample of rounds, and a .81 KPR in the L6 months on Nuke (+.10 KPR) on the map overall. Not only is it a GREAT map for KPR/his overall kills, but his headshot number is also fantastic on this map. His headshot % goes up to 58.7% in the L3 months (+7.4%) and 59.3% in the L6 months (+9% overall).\n* Ag1l is 14/16 hitrate on Nuke (both misses being at 6 headshots), needs \\~11-12 kills to hit this line with a kill line currently at 13.5/14.5",

The Bucs are 3.5-point favorites & the total is set at 46.5 points scored. The Saints give up a ton of points. __The Saints have trailed for 88.6% of their offensive snaps, highest rate in the league. They are allowing 2.45 points per drive (28th).__ This is going to lead to a ton passes from the Saints offense, especially since The Bucs are one of the most pass funnel defenses in the league.\n\n__The Bucs rank 4th in rushing success rate allowed & EPA per rush allowed.__ They have only allowed one 100 yard rusher this season & limited Saquon Barkley to 43 yards on 19 carries, Christian McCaffrey to 54 yards on 17 carries, & Bijan Robinson to 24 yards on 12 carries. In their last 3 games they’ve given up the 3rd most passing yards per game (284 ypg). Teams would much rather pass facing that elite run defense. Tampa also blitzes  a ton. __The Bucs blitz at the 6th highest rate defensively (36%) & they generating pressure on 53% of their plays (5th highest). Saints QB Spencer Rattler has actually done well when facing pressure, completing 58.1% of his pass attempts (5th) averaging 7.1 yards per attempt (8th). When facing a blitz, he has completed 70% of his throws (5th) for 7.3 yards per attempt (15th). The Bucs are allowing 7.7 yards per pass attempt (26th). Who has Rattler thrown to on blitzes? Saints star WR Chris Olave. Olave accounts for more than 50% of the team’s receiving yards, has a team-high 40% 1st read target rate, & averages 0.85 points per route run on blitzed dropbacks. Opposing offenses use play-action at the lowest rate in the NFL vs. TB (19% dropbacks). Which is significant because Chris Olave averages 0.46 points per route run with & without play action. Consistent production compared to the Saints WR Rashid Shaheed who averages 0.93 points per route run with play action and 0.26 without it.__ And by points I mean fantasy points, odd stat but I thought it was an interesting add. In the past few weeks Rattler & Olave have connected a ton. Olave has been used on some deeper routes. __After averaging under 10 yards per catch in every game over the first 5 weeks, over the past 2 weeks, he has had 98 receiving yards in consecutive games.__\n\n__Weeks 1-5: 1.4 Yards Per Route Run, 8.8 yards Average Depth of Target, 35% air yards, 36% endzone targets__\n\n__Weeks 6-7: 3.5 YPRR, 15.5 aDOT, 45% air yards, 100% endzone targets__\n\nThe cause of this has been Rattler is starting to air it out more. __In Weeks 1-5 Rattler had an aDOT of 7.4. Weeks 6-7 his aDOT has risen to 10.2 aDOT.__ This has led to a ton of utilization for Olave. __Olave ranks 2nd in the NFL in targets with 68 targets. In the last 2 weeks, Olave is the #4 WR in Fantasy Life’s Utilization Score for the season, No. 7 (83).\nAnd now this week he's going against the Bucs, who have been dominated by every mid-sized perimeter WR1 they've faced. Week 3 Garrett Wilson went 10/84/1 receiving on 13 targets, Week 5 JSN went for 8/132/1 receiving on 9 targets, & Week 6 Kendrick Bourne went for 5/142/0 receiving on 9 targets. Part of this is because the Bucs offense has done so well you have to pass to keep up. __The Buccaneers have turned the ball over on 5.2% of their drives, the 4th lowest rate in the league. Tampa Bay has scored 8 TD’s from outside of the red zone, 2nd in the league. Now they face the Saints that have allowed 6 TD outside of the red zone, most in the league.__ The Bucs defense allows I ton of explosive throws. __They given up 25 passes for 20+ yards (3rd most) & 4 passes for 40+ yards (7th most).__\n\nThe Saints have lost 2 pieces to their run game with Kendre Miller & Erik McCoy ruled out & they are dogs playing in a dome. Rattler has the potential to throw the most passes of his career, against a blitz heavy defense. Olave will eat.\n\n__Chris Olave o59.5 receiving yards__\n\nAppreciate the love!

Barcelona have big injury problems that will hurt them badly, missing key players like Raphinha, Dani Olmo and Robert Lewandowski. Furthermore, Barca manager Hansi Flick will not be at the touchline due to the red card in the last match and therefore cannot give instructions during the match. Real Madrid also have few injuries, but players including Trent Alexander-Arnold, Dani Carvajal and Hujisen will be available for the el classico, and their attack is deadly with Kylian Mbappé scoring in eight straight games before the Champions League and having 10 goals in 9 La Liga matches. \n\nThe both teams to score part is almost guaranteed because the last six El Clasico matches produced 33 total goals, and Barcelona have conceded in their last six matches including a 4-1 loss at Sevilla, while Real Madrid's defense is also weak without their main defenders. With both teams needing to attack and both having defensive problems due to injuries, this match should have plenty of goals from both sides while Real Madrid's home advantage makes it very unlikely they will lose.\n\n\nIf you found these picks helpful, tips or donations are greatly appreciated as they support the time and effort I put into creating them: [buy me a beer🍻](https://buymeacoffee.com/hercules.son.of.zeus)",

Our bet went through in the first half, 39 minutes was all it took. It ended up 3-2 to Brentford. On to the next one, with the biggest football match in the world, El Classico.\n\nTomorrow’s El Clásico at the Santiago Bernabéu is the best spectacle football has to offer, and this edition is loaded with narrative, stats and two teams desperate to attack from the outset. Real Madrid arrive as league leaders with 24 points in 9 matches, while Barcelona trail closely with 22 points, making this a true top-of-the-table clash where a win would create daylight in the La Liga race. The numbers behind this fixture are staggering: the last six El Clásicos have averaged over 4 goals per game, with both teams scoring in every clash, remarkably, none of those matches ended goalless at half or full-time. The “BTTS & Over 2.5 Goals” angle has landed repeatedly, and five of the last six encounters saw at least two goals after halftime as both teams emptied their tanks chasing results late on.\n\nRecent H2H backs this up: Barcelona triumphed 4-3 in their most recent league meeting, and also produced a 5-2 win and a 3-2 cup final thriller earlier this year, while Real have netted in 14 of their last 15 matches in all competitions. Kylian Mbappé, leading the scoring charts with 10 goals in just 9 league matches, is historically devastating in this fixture, scoring 11 times in 8 previous El Clásicos. Barcelona’s attack has also been rampant, under Hansi Flick, they average 3.3 goals per league match this term, and star men Lewandowski, Raphinha and Yamal (Lewandowski and Raphinha will not be playing this match due to injury) have each contributed over 10 league goals already.\n\nFor the pick: Both Teams To Score & Over 2.5 Goals & Over 1.5 Goals in the 2nd Half, paying 1.75 is exceptional value considering these performances. Only two of the last ten meetings have stayed under 3 goals, with the majority featuring a frantic second half as both sides chase the result. The refereeing tends to let the game flow and, crucially, attacking players on both rosters are in peak form. The quality of this rivalry demands a big show, and the stats almost guarantee it: goals, drama, and a fast, open game from start to finish. Backing this with odds at 1.75 stands out as a strong value bet for tomorrow’s main event.\n\nLet's cash it!\n\nPS: Glad to hear so many of you are enjoying the write-ups and making profits from the tips! If any of the picks have helped you out and you’d like to show some appreciation, feel free to drop me a small tip, it keeps the motivation and energy flowing for creating even better content.

      "text": "Record: 2-0 (3.28u)\n\nEvent: Miami Heat vs Toronto Raptors, 7:30 PM EST\n\nPOTD: Heat -4.5 at 1.91 odds (-110), 2 units to win 1.82 units\n\nWrite up:  \nThe Heat are generally inconsistent mostly due to Spo getting more than most from a roster without as much talent, this generally makes pockets in the season where they are undervalued. I believe this is one of them. \n\nToronto has scored just 177 points in their last two games (88.5 PPG), including a humiliating 81-point output against the 7-19 Nets, and ranks 29th in three-point shooting at 31.1% while missing RJ Barrett. Miami is 10-4 at home and leads the NBA in pace (104.25), which they'll use to expose Toronto's sluggish offense that plays at 99.58 pace. Even without Herro and Jovic, Miami still has Norman Powell, Bam Adebayo (18.3 PPG, 9.4 REB), and Jaime Jaquez Jr. providing efficient scoring. Miami commits the 3rd-fewest turnovers in the league and sends opponents to the free throw line less than anyone, while Toronto's only real advantage is offensive rebounding against Miami's 25th-ranked defensive rebounding. The Heat will push tempo at home, force Toronto into a track meet they can't win, and cover the 4.5 points comfortably.",

      "text": "💎POTD: 🏒 Maple Leafs ML\nOdds: -140 on FanDuel\nWager: 2 units\n\nNHL. Penguins at Maple Leafs, 4 pm ET 12/23/25\n\nRecord: 7-9\nNet Units: -5.4 Units\n\nExplanation: Toronto can beat Pittsburgh tomorrow because their most repeatable edge in this matchup is usually offensive ceiling + special-teams leverage, and those are exactly the things that tend to decide NHL games that aren’t perfect 60-minute efforts. \n\nThe Leafs’ roster construction is typically built around high end finishing and power-play conversion, which matters a ton against a Penguins team that has been more vulnerable when games turn into track meets or when they’re forced to defend multiple areas for long stretches. \n\nIf Toronto can get more shot attempts, more inner-slot chances, fewer odd-man rushes against—they put Pittsburgh in a spot where the Pens have to keep up offensively, and that’s where Toronto’s depth scoring and top-line star power can separate. \nToronto needs to start fast, get Pittsburgh chasing the game (which increases defensive risk), stay disciplined enough to avoid giving the Pens repeated power plays, and then let Toronto’s own power play be the difference if whistles happen. Add in that goaltending volatility often swings this specific matchup—Toronto doesn’t need 40 saves if they control the slot and limit second chances—so if the Leafs get even league-average goaltending while generating the higher-quality looks, they’re in a strong position to win.",

Will update soon.\n\n**Today's Event:** NBA 🏀 Chicago Bulls @ Atlanta Hawks (4:30pm PST)\n\n**Today's Pick:** Bulls +4.5 (-115 on DK); 4 units\n\nThe books are giving us the same line at nearly the same odds as they did for this matchup two days ago. Perhaps it's stubbornness, inertia, or arrogance, but they seem to be daring me to go double or nothing. I will oblige. \n\nI made this same pick two days ago for this same matchup, so I am repeating much of my reasoning below for comprehensiveness, but now with updated stats. \n\nHere we have an almost perfect storm of ATS records. \n\nThe Hawks are now 4-9 ATS at home, 5-10 ATS as the favorite, and **0-6 ATS as the home favorite**.\n\nThe Bulls are now 11-3 ATS as underdogs, and 6-2 ATS as road underdogs. \n\nThe Bulls have now won both of their prior matchups outright against the Hawks, despite being 2.5-point (in Chicago) and 4.5-point (in Atlanta) underdogs. Both matchups included Trae Young and he is expected to play in today's game as well. \n\nTrae is a great player and had a strong game against the Bulls last time but it wasn't enough. He is a liability on defense and can't do anything against 6'8\" Giddey who can get to the rim out will, drawing doubles and initiating endless drive-and-kick plays. Trae is also useless in transition defense and the Bulls are doing really well on fastbreaks, especially with the return of Ayo Dosunmu. \n\nIf you are concerned about the Bulls' ability to beat the same team twice in a row in a \"baseball series,\" rest assured that (1) they don't have to win, only cover a +4.5-point spread, and (2) they accomplished that very feat against the Cavs just last week.\n\nThere is no better ATS fade than the Hawks as home favorites, and the Bulls make it even more appealing. Obviously anything can happen but the evidence points overwhelmingly at this pick.",

Back now, let's get some wins.\n\n \n\nNext Pick: **Toronto Raptors vs Miami Heat -4.0 @ 1.91**. 3U play.\n\nBoth these teams have looked mediocre recently, but the Raptors missing both RJ and Poeltl is much more significant for the Raptors. The Heat will be at home here, and Kel’el and Norm continue to look really good, so with the supporting cast of Wiggins, Bam and Davion, I am confident they can stifle the Raptors’ middling offense. In terms of recent form, the Raptors just got destroyed by the Brooklyn Nets, and had lost to the Cs by double digits prior to that. They've won only 3 of their last 10 (and only 2/L10 ATS). The Heat haven't been much better but put up much better fights in their last couple games against the Knicks and Cs. \n\n \n\n*If you’ve enjoyed these picks, tips are always appreciated:* [Coffee Link](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/TheBrat)",

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 5-11-3 *We come out empty-handed once again. In an unlucky turn of events, Levadiakos did what was expected of them and comfortably saw off a convincing 2-0 win against the lowly Panserraikos; sadly, though, Bologna let us down and played like they'd never seen a ball before. Despite all that, I'm determined to make it out of this slump, and I've (perhaps rather ambitiously) eyed up just the perfect event to help me achieve this goal - the AFCON*\n\n**Last Five:** ❌❌🅿️❌❌\n\n**Event:** AFCON, DR Congo v Benin, 7:30 am EST\n\n**POTD:** Benin Win or Draw +110, 2 units\n\n**Write Up:** The beloved AFCON is an unpredictable tournament with historically tight matches, and that is exactly why I'm backing Benin to cause a minor upset in today's outing. DR Congo enter this matchup as slight favorites, boasting stronger recent results, a deeper squad, and a greater tournament pedigree. However, football matches are never played on paper, and that is especially true when it comes to the AFCON, where things constantly refuse to follow the script. Let me emphasize that Benin are far from a pushover. They finished **level on points with Nigeria** in their World Cup qualifying group and **just a point off the eventual group winners, South Africa**, proving **they can sustain a competitive streak against highly ranked African nations** (not to mention their group was slightly tougher than that of the DR Congo). What's worth noting is that Zimbabwe finished bottom of Benin's group on measly 5 points and a goal difference of -7 (compared to Benin's 3rd place finish on 17 pts and a GD of +1), yet held their own against Egypt, so why couldn't Benin go a step further and snatch a point off their opponents? *I certainly don't see a reason not to take this value bet at the juicy + odds that cover not one, but two outcomes.* As for their key players, amid some absences, **Jodel Dossu is likely to lead the attack with creativity,** while **Rodrigue Kossi and Sessi D'Almeida fulfill the central midfielder roles,** serving as an **outlet for build-up and transition** (key **Benin strength**). The DR Congo players are expected to control the match flow and tempo, but I can absolutely see Benin sustain any and all pressure being thrown their way, while **killing them off with quick transitions.** Their **form looks good** too (they even **pushed Morocco** all the way in a recent friendly), so I can't see why they wouldn't give the DR Congo a serious run for their money. Trying to save one's record in AFCON of all places is always a challenging task, but one I'm certainly up for, and I expect a cheeky point (or more) to finally break out of this massive, unexpected downtrend. Going with just the measly 2 units today. BOL if you do tail and let's cash out together ☘️",

Detroit’s goalie John Gibson has won 7 straight starts and has a .920 save percentage in the last month. \n\nSo why am I picking Dallas? Well they’ve won 4 in a row, 8 of their last 10, and Oettinger, who I think is going to go tomorrow, has a .923 save percentage in the last month. \n\nAs far as comparing the two teams, Dallas impresses me a little more than Detroit. Dallas has a ton of firepower and Detroit can give up goals, whereas Dallas is a little more sound defensively. Dallas is 13-2-4 in road games this season while Detroit is 11-7-1 at home. \n\nGood luck!l",

Ended in a five set win for Osadchyi featuring 92 points. Not saying whatsoever this was the case here but it does seem a bit too easy to throw a game here and there considering how short the matches are and how many they play so I’d rather not take the risk again. Quality was pretty average as well, I’m not a fan of you Setka Cup.\n\nThis is a play that is very strong statistically across all fronts that will somehow find a way to lose and I’ll be questioning my life choices. Regardless when I see the stats I simply cannot ignore it whatsoever, no matter the outcome that I don’t control. I would stake a lot more units on this but keeping it disciplined until the new year where in 2026 we’ll be hoping for big things. 15 games into the season and Scandicci are in second spot whilst Cuneo are 10th (out of 14). So this isn’t even a case of a fully dominant team top of the league playing against some dead-beat rock bottom side like this line would suggest. This corresponds roughly to their standings last year where the home team finished third and the away side 11th. Scandicci have gone over the line in 13 of their last 14 home league matches (93%). Meanwhile, Cuneo have cleared in their last 22/23 away league matches (96%). Statistically + logically, this is arguably the best play I’ve put out and I struggle to find why the line is set so low. To be fair the reverse fixture in October lost by 0.5 but not for the reason you might think of - Cuneo actually won 3-0 which is simply anomalous (odds are @41.00 for it). Looking past this, the line has been covered in 12/14 (86%) H2H league matches, including the last 9/10 (90%).

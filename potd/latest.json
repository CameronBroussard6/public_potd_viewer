Honestly such is the way to lose like that, plus Brentford going down to 10 men early didnt actually help as Villa struggled to break them down once they got 1-0 up, sitting behind the ball and playing well defensively. It is what it is onto the next. Man U vs Fulham saw 10 corners at full time, a bit sweaty but that line cashed nonetheless.\n\nTodays is the first 5 unit play im going with. Offensive trends and defensive gaps lead me to believe that both teams see the back of the net. I almost went with Malaga ML as they are on a 6 game win streak and coming into this fixture in good form, especially at +150 odds. BTTS has happened in 4/5 last meetings with the latest two games they faced off seeing 5 goals IN EACH GAME. For over 2.5 goals, like just mentioned there has been a fair share of the goal scoring between these two. In all fixtures Mirandes are on a 6 game streak seeing over 2.5 goals and Malaga 5/6, with both teams to score being seen in 5/6 and 7/9 respectively. I do think this is once again a high scoring fixture with both teams possessing the quality to get their names on the scoresheet, especially since their defences are both conceding plenty. Lets hope this game sees plenty of attacking output to secure this for us.\n\nApologies about yesterday, so close once again.\n\nBOL and always bet what you can afford to lose!",

Both teams usually combine in the mid 150s, not the high/mid 160s, and neither plays at a pace that consistently creates shootouts. You’re buying a 10+ point cushion (in NCAAB) unless both teams catch absolute fire. Fade the inflated number, let normal basketball win🍹",

The visitors are flying having won six on the bounce, but they’ve shipped 14 goals in 11 away trips this term. So, ideally this would be a BTTS play, but my luck with this has been terrible, so going safe with over 2 asian, which still gives decent odds\n\nLeg 2 : Over 2.5 goals have been scored in all of both teams' last five games. Lets just hope it doesnt devolve into a slugfest of shots with no goals\n\nHope we get the W & BoL",

I mean he has scored in eight games straight, with a total of 13 goals scored! Last round he surpassed Ronaldo thanks to a hat-trick, and with talks about Ronaldo boycotting Al-Nassr’s game today, he has a good chance putting further ground between them at the topscorer table.  \n\nAl-Hilal hasn’t even been that good lately either with back to back draws. In their last top game they beat Al-Nassr at home 3-1, but it wasn’t easy for them, it could quickly have ended differently if the guests just hadn’t lost their heads completely. \n\nIvan Toney scored twice against them at home earlier this season, which was his 5th & 6th goal against them from just four games! He should have a good chance of getting something again today. He recently also gave an interview where he talked about how well he has settled down there and his ambitions of doing well to get into the England squad for the World Cup. ",

His line was also at 2.5 with a +150 odds. Leafs had no powerplay that game so even better for us that he got those shots without the man advantage. \n\nWhy i'm confident about this pick however is that Morgan Rielly left last game for the Leafs and will not be available tonight(to be announced this morning so maybe wait for the confirmation just to be sure). Rielly usually is on the first powerplay unit and LOVES to shoot as the quarterback. With his absence, i'm banking on Nylander, who is also on the first powerplay unit, to receive the puck more and to take the shots that Rielly would usually take on 5v4. Combine this with Calgary being the third most penalized team in the league this season and this should result in at least 1 or 2 additional shots for Nylander tonight. 3 out of his last 5 games vs the Flames he went over that line and in his last game in Calgary he got a hat-trick with 6 shots.\n\nLeafs have won their last 7 vs Calgary so to me this looks like the perfect game on the road for a healthy Nylander to shake off the rust and prepare himself for the Olympics next week.\n\nBOL or fade me to oblivion!",

Love to see it.*\n\nWrite Up:\n\nMost of the best straight picks have already been tipped so I'll go for this instead.\n\nMallorca may be in the relegation zone but they are formidable at home having lost only 2 out of 10 games there in the La Liga this season with one of the losses being to Barca. Today, I believe they'll be playing for a win but might end up with a draw which puts them in the safe zone (for now). Also, they've hit over 2.5 SoT in every home game except the two they lost.\n\nTheir opponent is Sevilla who are having a bad run right now with only 2 wins in their last 10 games and 3 wins in their last 10 away games. I believe Sevilla still has some fight left in them which is why I believe the match could end in a draw but I don't see an angle in which they win unless Mallorca is **extra** sloppy today or get a red card. \n\nHopefully, this is a straightforward game with no surprises.\n\nGood luck if you tail! 🍀",

He has covered this line recently versus the Spurs, Thunder, and twice against the Grizzlies. He did have a bit of a letdown spot last game against the 76ers. This season, he is 21/35 and 12/19 in away games, and also 10/16 with the starting lineup.\n\nCharlotte is ranking 8th in iso matchups defensively and 1st in opponent free throws denied. However, when Zion is going against good iso defenders, he is heavily covering his line at 83% (86% with starters). Versus teams that rank top 10 in denying free throws, he is still getting his way, covering in 62% (86% with starters). He is also torching top transition defenses, where the Hornets rank 8th. Zion has covered 69% (89% with starters). In games where he has had 1 day of rest, he has covered 13/20 and 8/9 with the starters. When it's his third game within a 4-day stretch, he is a perfect 6/6. \n\nHornets have a rank-16 defensive rating in their last five, and Zion has been consistent against these mediocre teams. Ultimately, it really depends on what Hornets team shows up. During this stretch, they have some lockdown D, then in other games, they fall flat. It's hard to take a guy going against the Hornets right now, but a lot of power forwards are hitting their line in: PJ Washington, Flagg, GG Jackson, JJJ, Banchero, Green, LeBron, and Leonard. Zion is also 2/3 against the Hornets, so this is not new to him. In Zion's last 10 games, he is shooting 71% from the field, with 9 potential assists / 9 potential rebounds. I feel like Zion is going to dominate inside the paint, hopefully runs over this small Hornets interior, and dominates as Flagg did. If he comes in aggressive and looking to drive and initiate contact for those fouls, we're going to cover. Also need him to get the same or more touches, since he doesn't get a ton, but he is a bucket getter, especially with his midrange jumper that he has been working on.\n\nHere we go!",

In 16 games with key pieces of the rotation (LaMelo, Brandon Miller, Miles Bridges, Sexton, Kalkbrenner, and Diabate) playing, he has only gone over this line 5 times. Over these 16 games, he averages 11.3 field goal attempts a game. As efficient as Knueppel is, 18 points on 12 FGAs (rounded up the average FGA) is extremely tough to do.  \nI can really only see one thing really going wrong here: Knueppel being crazy efficient. In 4/5 of the games he went over these were his splits (in the format) FG/FGA | 3M/3A | FTM/FTA\n\n9/12 | 6/9 | 2/2  \n5/10 | 4/7| 6/6  \n7/10 | 3/5 | 2/2  \n10/16 | 8/12 | 6/6\n\nHe can be insanely efficient, and if he is this bet is dead. The one game I didn't include was his 21 point game against the Cavs. No one on the Hornets could get anything going; the final score ended up being just 94-87. Knueppel was forced to step up and make plays. He ended up taking 21 shots that game. While he was unusually inefficient (because the Hornets needed him to be), that amount of volume would definitely kill this pick. I doubt something like this will happen again. Excluding the 16 FGA game against the Mavericks (which I'm sure he was extra motivated to get shots up in because he was playing his college teammate), the next highest amount of shots he had in a game was just 12 (and that happened only once).",

Syracuse comes off a win over Notre Dame this weekend that snapped a 4 game losing skid.  UNC comes in with a 3 game win streak in ACC play.  Syracuse have struggled and despite getting right against ND, I expect the UNC with a home crowd advantage to win this game.  UNC has relied on the 3pt ball shooting 25.7 3PA per game while also offensive rebounding well as a team.  UNC can score in transition as well as from half court sets and puts up 83ppg. UNC has several NBA prospects with Caleb Wilson heading that group as an outstanding freshman talent.  Syracuse plays a more balanced offense relying on half court sets moving the ball and getting quality 2pt shots, their offense avgs 76ppg.  The Orange pride themselves on defense and protecting the rim but I expect UNC's fire power and home crowd to be too much for them.  I like the tarheels to cover the spread and team points, but I feel the more conservative take is over team points.",

He scraped home against Blancaneaux despite winning less points overall. He served a higher 1st serve % but only managed to win 70% of them - on an indoor court for a guy that relies on first serve dominance and winning most of this points within 3 rally points of the serve, this is poor. Especially against a Blancaneaux who just lost to Tirante, who we know shouldnt have even been testing Blanca based on how he got blown off the court by Belluci when we bet it.\n* Now Grenier has to face Vavassori who just absolutely crunched Carballes Baena without even facing a BP on his serve. He won 90.7% of his first service games - pretty incredible considering Blockx was in the form of his life when he played Baena (albeit outdoors) and only managed 76.5%.\n* Vavassori didn't get a lot of court last year due to injury and then focusing on doubles on his return, but in one of the few singles tournaments he did play prior to injury, he demolished  Blancaneaux on indoor courts and then Felix (a monster on indoors) before understandably losing to Alcaraz.\n* Vavassori is the form player out of the two right now (have a look at his run in Adelaide) and given it's now indoors, these odds are too good not to take.\n\nMake sure to bet on a bookie that pays out retirements and voids bets on the retiring player. \n\nBOL",

The Winnipeg Jets are coming to Dallas to play the Stars. In net for the Stars is Jake Oettinger, who is great every year and is having another good year this season. On the season, Oettinger has a .900 save percentage and a 2.66 goals against average. Connor Hellebuyck is in net for the Jets and he has been a monster goalie every year, despite not being quite up to his typical standards, he is still great this year. This season, Connor Hellebuyck has a .902 save percentage and a 2.71 goals against average. The Jets are pretty weak offensively this season, ranking 22nd in goals and just 25th in shots on goal. On the other hand, the Stars are decent, but they aren’t exactly a big threat. The Stars rank 11th in goals this season, but are way down at 28th in shots on goal, which is going to be a problem against a goalie like Hellebuyck who has constant high save percentages. The Stars are also good at limiting shots, ranking 9th in least shots on goal allowed, which is going to be key at limiting the Jets scoring. With 2 proven goalies both having yet another good season, and both offences being pretty mediocre, this is a great low scoring matchup.\n\nTake The Under 5.5 Goals!",

H2H history supports this too, with 5 of the last 7 meetings finishing over the 2.5 line.

At +125 odds, this stands out as one of the most confident spots on the slate.",

Kotov closed at around -206, so I don't feel too bad about it, but it still represents a continuation of what has been a rough patch of form for me. \n\nAdrian Mannarino is an interesting player in that his level seemed to be declining sharply in 2024, but an excellent 2025 campaign essentially revived his career at 37 years old. Mannarino has now gone winless since October of last year, but I feel that this home event could be a bounceback spot for him. Mannarino has always had extremely flat groundstrokes that work best on grass and fast courts. What has changed, however, is that he has lost much of the defensive ability of his younger self and filled the void by nearly perfecting his version of the lefty slider serve. Now, windy conditions tend to take a lot of the bite out of his groundstrokes and serve, and he can no longer compensate by hanging behind the baseline. For this reason, I wasn't surprised that he didn't do well in Australia; I was a bit surprised about him losing to Remy Bertola indoors in Quimper last week, but his performance rating (6.68) wasn't terrible, and Bertola ended up making the final. \n\nOn the other side of the net, Pedro Martinez should represent a good chance for Adrian to get back on track. Martinez is a Spanish grinder who has always preferred clay courts, and doesn't seem to have fully recovered from knee and shoulder issues that affected him in 2025. He did capture a Challenger title on outdoor hard courts earlier this month, but he didn't beat anyone in the top 200 to do so, and indoor courts tend to be worse for his game. Last week in Quimper, he was pushed down to even odds against Sascha Gueymard Wayenburg, an indoor specialist who relies heavily on the serve, and ended up getting broken 3 times in a straight-sets loss (6.72). Martinez's serve is nothing special, and he's not going to be able to rush Mannarino off the ground in the same way someone like Bertola can. If Adrian can raise his level here, I expect him to win in two straightforward sets, but this bet also covers the possibility that he just doesn't show up or doesn't have the energy, which is always a possibility at this age.",

Instead, the Jayhawks (16-5) responded with a season-revitalizing, 84-63 thrashing of the Cyclones. Four more wins followed and suddenly Kansas is riding a five-game win streak and on the cusp of a Top 10 ranking.\n\nWhat’s been impressive is that the team has executed on both sides of the ball.\n\nWhile the Jayhawks offensive number’s won’t jump out of you from the page—39th in field-goal percentage (47.9%), 48th in three-point shooting (36.5%), 72nd in offensive efficiency (1.121) and 101st in scoring (78.8 PPG)—the unit has turned it up a notch as of late. Over the last five games, the team has averaged 83.1 points on 51.6% shooting from the field (39.2% from beyond the arc). That includes hitting at a mark of 51% or more in all but one of those contests while converting from long-range at 42% or better in all but three. The defense has held up more than its bargain, conceding just 67.6 points on 37.6% shooting (33.6% from the perimeter) over its last five games. But that’s hardly unusual for a Kansas defense that through 21 games has ranked 3rd in opponent field-goal percentage (38.3%), 13th in opponent three-point shooting (29.4%), 28th in defensive efficiency (0.967) and 35th in scoring defense (68.0). So not surprisingly, the team is listed as the 3rd best team in the nation (9.829 Barthag), per Torvik, while ranking 4th in adjusted offensive efficiency (131.6) and 7th in adjusted defensive efficiency (92.5) over that span.\n\nUp next? A battle with Texas Tech and JT Toppin.\n\nOn the season, Toppin paces the Red Raiders (16-5) with 22.4 points and 10.9 rebounds per game. But over the last five, the star junior’s play—27.6 points on 60.2% shooting (47.1% from three-point range)—has helped the team average 86.8 points on a sizzling 51.4% shooting from the floor (44.4% from beyond the arc). That includes topping 88 or more points in all but three games while shooting 38% or better in all games. Fortunately, the Jayhawks know a thing or two about slowing down stars. Most recently, the team limited BYU’s AJ Dybantasa to just 17 points—his second lowest total of the year. Kansas also downed two birds with one stone against Iowa State’s Milan Momclivoc (18.6 PPG) and Joshua Jefferson (17.2 PPG), holding the duo to just 11 and 12 points on a combined 7-of-23 (30.4%) from the field.\n\nBut a reeling Texas Tech defense will be what tips the game in the visitor’s favor.\n\nThrough 21 games, the unit ranks just 129th in opponent three-point shooting (32.9%), 156th in defensive efficiency (1.046), 166th in scoring defense (74.4 PPGA) and 174th in opponent field-goal percentage (44.6%). But things have gotten even worse in recent weeks, as the Red Raiders have conceded 78.4 points on a whopping 46.2% shooting from the field (37.4% from beyond the arc). That includes allowing each opponent to top 42% or better from the floor while allowing opponents to hit at a 33% clip or better from the perimeter in all but two. But the biggest achilles heel for the team is its inability to control the paint, ranking 224th in opponent points in the paint (33.0 PPG; 39th percentile). That has been something the Jayhawks have been pretty successful with on the season—80th in points in the paint (35.3 PPG; 78th percentile)—and it should continue Monday night.\n\nTrust the Jayhawks to stay hot on the road and keep us within the number.\n\nBOL if tailing, and as always, please do so responsibly.

Bet 2.5u\n\nWriteup: Let’s go back to what we know with some alt parlays (and hopefully stay there). We’ll start with Charleston Southern vs Gardner-Webb. This one is simple, as Charleston Southern is simply better in every way. Gardner-Webb is literally rated the 3rd worst team overall in men’s college hoops. The only thing that gives me a slight pause is that, while Gardner-Webb has a 3-20 record, they have played far better quality of opponents compared to Charleston Southern. Even still, this Charleston Southern defense should be quite stifling, and with the 14th fastest paced offense in the league, they are bound to get many points in transition. I’ll put some respect on the fact that Garnder-Webb is used to playing far better opponents (considering how bad they are), so we’ll bring the spread down to -9.5.\n\nNow for UNC. The big advantage here will be the Tarheel’s offense against Syracuse’s defense, who have a top 20 offense and a defense below top 60, respectively. UNC should also have a huge offensive rebounding advantage, allowing for multiple second chance opportunities. UNC is also one of the best teams in the country playing at home, and while playing much better ball as of late, I expect a solid showing from them. Syracuse has been a bit more consistent this season, so just to be safe, we’ll drop the spread down to -5.5.\n\nRemember to only bet what you can afford to lose, and BOL!",

A win here for Sunderland puts them in 8th place and, believe it or not, this newly promoted team is in striking range of European football for next season. Burnley are fighting for their lives at 11 points from safety, at this point it will take a special run of form to pull themselves out of the bottom 3. \n\nBrobbey has been on a great run of form at Sunderland's first choice striker, scoring a goal in 3 of their last 4 matches. While his shot volume is not huge, he has a great SOT conversion rate on his shots. He's a willing runner, chasing everything sent his way and great both with his feet and in the air. He didn't take over as Sunderland's main striker until midway through the year, so while the numbers aren't huge, he has looked great over the last few weeks. \n\nI also like this play because Burnley concede the most SOTs in the EPL and it's not particularly close, at 140 so far this year. They also struggle against center forwards - recent notable matchups were conceding 2 SOTs to Ekitike on 6 shots, 7 SOTs to Sesko on 8 shots (2 goals), and 2 SOTs to Wissa on 4 shots. I think there's great value here given the data and current form of Brobbey.\n\nBOL and happy Monday!",

All Roma wins***. They beat these boys 2-0 at home back in November, and before that it was the same story , Udinese can't buy a result against us. Head-to-head is brutal: **Roma have won like 9 out of the last 12 or something stupid**. Udinese haven't beaten us in forever.  No crazy risks here Roma might not blow them out, could be a boring 0-1 or 1-1 if Udinese park the bus, but they don't lose this. Their attack might miss a couple guys, but they still have enough to beat them.\n\n‎Now for **Porto ** First, head-to-head is a massacre. Porto's unbeaten in like 10 straight against Casa Pia  **won 9, drew 1, and they've smashed them plenty***. Last meetings? **Porto 4-0, 2-0, clean sheets galore**, and Casa Pia barely scores ***(they've got like 3 goals total across 8-10 games vs Porto)***. These boys just can't handle the Dragons Porto owns them. Second, Casa Pia are in the mud right now. Sitting 16th, just scraping above relegation, **winless in their last 4, and leaky as hell at the back – conceding 9 in recent games or whatever the stat was**. They've got one of the worst attacks too, **third-fewest goals in the league**, so they park the bus but it doesn't hold vs top sides. Porto are league leaders or right up there (18-1-0 form vibes), smashing away games, and their attack is clicking versatile, quality everywhere, they grind or blow teams out when they get space.\n\n\n\n\n‎Lets Make it 6 in a row !!",

Second half, Villa scored… but the goal was disallowed, and that’s it. This ends our streak. I even added 0.5 units at half time because I didn’t believe they would bottle this against Brentford with a red card.\n\nI also had BTTS as a hedge lmao.\n\nNow for today..\n\nPick: Sunderland to win @ 1.8\n\nWrite Up: Burnley will probably be in a fighting mood. However, Sunderland are undefeated at home with 6 wins, 5 draws and 0 losses, while Burnley are very poor away with 1 win, 2 draws and 8 losses. \n\nNo gigantic injury list here like in the Villa game.

Udinese at home are 14th and have a 3-4-4 record. In the H2H Roma hold an 8-1-1 lead in the last 10 games and have an 6 game winning streak ongoing. At the stadium of Udinese they have won 2 straight and in the Serie A Roma are on a 2 game winning streak when playing away. Managerial H2H in favour for us (2-1-0).\n\nSince this is still Serie A though, I would recommend staking wisely... random ahh stuff happens here.",

Casa Pia's stadium has been affected by the storm, and the pitch won't be in the best condition. In Portugal, teams tend to resort to set pieces when there are no conditions to play \"normally\". Additionally, when Casa Pia is forced to defend at home, they often concede a lot of corners. FC Porto has also been very strong in set pieces throughout the season.\n\nBOL!",

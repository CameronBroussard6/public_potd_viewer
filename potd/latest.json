A sweat in hindsight but it still hit.\n\n\n\n\nSoccer + Tennis | Saudi Pro League + Australian Open | Al-Hilal v Al-Feiha / 12:30 EST + Coco Gauff v Hailey Baptiste / 18:00 EST\n\n\nPick: Al-Hilal ML + Gauff 2:0 (-200 DK)\n\n\n4u to win 2u\n\n\n\n\nWrite up: This is a massive lock. Poor odds but high likelihood. Gauff is great form recently, winning her last 3 matches easily in 2 set fashion; including a beating of world no. 2 Iga Swiatek 6-1, 6-1. She has also beat Baptiste 2:0 in 2023 by a score of 6-1, 6-4. Gauff should roll, she is great on hard when she has momentum. As for Al-Hilal, they are first in the Saudi Pro League, wining 5 of their last 5 & playing a team in tenth place that has lost 7 games out of 16. I don't like the spread for this game as Al-Feiha are one of the better bottom half teams in the SAP, especially as of recent. Roll with the heavy faves this time, it isn't glamorous but if it ain't broke don't fix it.\n\n\n\n\nBOL!",

This galloper was performing consistently but finding it hard to break through again, that was until 2 starts ago. Since then we’ve seen two dominant 3 length wins that have produced ratings that would easily take care of this field in their current forms.    \n    \nWe’ve got the same jockey on board from its last two wins, and after scratching we come in from barrier 8 to barrier 5. We jump well and we sit 3rd, or we go back and sit 5th I don’t mind, as long as we get to the outside and not cluttered up on the fence.    \n    \nKeeping the exact same formula as its last win with 3 weeks in between runs, I’m expecting a copy of that last run here.     \n    \nThe rest of the field is currently out of form, or first up, so a large level of improvement is required for them to match what we are putting down right now, and it’s hard to see where that would come from.

The lineup wasnt quite what I expected, but Caicedo came through regardless against the deep low.block of Pafos. Great to hear that many of you got the play at +225 to +250 odds! Let's see if we can keep rolling. \n\nShort writeup today, but a very similar play to yesterday. Tielemans has battled a few injuries this season so not a huge sample size, but he has been playing great football lately. He tends to play further forward than Caicedo, but Fenerbahce has a better defense than Pafos. This has hit in his last 2 Europa League games and I expect Villa to lean on his experience here.\n\nBOL and happy Thursday!",

They are excellent when ahead, but the real shining star has been their tenacity to extend losing positions and compete in the lategame, resulting in long games that end in a comeback win.\n\nThe gameplan is clear, funnel all the resources and play towards Bot. Mid+Jungle proximity in the first 15 minutes lie heavily towards botside and dragon pit, allowing their up and coming star player Diable to scale into the later stages with relative safety and maybe even a lead. If it doesn't pan out in the early game, FearX's midgame skirmishes have been strong, showing great engages during neutral objective scuffles.\n\nGen.G to no ones surprise has hit the ground running from the start. 2-0 in matches, 4-0 in games, a clean sweep for THE domestic powerhouse of Korea. They play the prototypical Korean style, start slow, build up advantages through superior individual play, and break the game open with neutral objective teamfights.\n\nOn paper, this match is a wash, most likely a clean 2-0 for Gen.G, BUT Gen.G in their first two series had a map 1 duration of 29:43 against DRX, and 31:12 against KT Rolster, with an average just a few seconds under 30:30. Compare this to their map 2 duration, and its night and day. Map 2 against DRX in 24:29, and map 2 against KT 28:02, cutting down the game timer significantly. FearX is better than both in current form so they'll keep it more competitive.\n\nGen.G takes the first game slow and methodical, feeling their opponents out and figuring the best approach to win. FearX has shown incredible form so far, the momentum of their great Week 1 results will keep their spirits high heading in. Their ability to stay and prolong games will shine and give them the edge to extend the game timer. As an added bonus, they will have pick priority during game 1, so FearX will have the draft advantage and play their strong champions from the get go. BOL!\n\n**Map 1 - Over or Exactly 30:30 Map Duration 2-Way (1.83) 2u to win 1.66u**",

CST\n\nNot much of a different write up here. Took this in R1 and it was well on it's way to cashing if Gaston had not retired. If there is one thing you can count on, it is consistency from Sinner, especially on hard courts. He is going to come out, put pressure on his opponent in every one of their service game, and limit his unforced errors, After he settled in against Gaston, he was right at home ripping on the forehand and backhand. I don't expect that Duckworth can put enough pressure on Sinner. Another reason he is so successful at this bet is that it just destroys opponent's mentality when they throw everything they have at home and work so hard just to win a couple games. If Sinner can take the first set in the usual 6 games, then I see this one taking care of itself.\n\n[PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/micahpugh?locale.x=en_US)\n\n[Venmo](https://venmo.com/u/Micah-Pugh)",

Goals flying in from all angles, Lewandowski scoring an own goal and then remembering he's supposed to shoot on the other goal, and grabbing one on the other end too. Just crazy stuff, but of course Barca just about covered the handicap, dealing me another loss.

Also, Darwizzy **Nunez's form is patchy** and he's been dealing with injuries, so I don't expect the Al Hilal attack to be as relentless today. BTTS Yes is certainly another option if you want to gamble with that. BOL and let the 10 game winless streak commence ☘️🫡",

      "text": "Record: 175-143, +7.09 units\n\nLast Pick: Yosuke Watanuki to win 2-0 vs Omar Jasika (-165, 1 unit): Loss\n\nTennis | Oeiras Challenger | 8:00 AM EST (estimated)\n\nToday’s Pick: Francesco Passaro vs Stefan Kozlov | **Passaro ML at -148 (DK). 1 unit.**\n\nWrite-up: Really tough loss. Watanuki led by 6-4, 2-0 before falling apart and ultimately losing the entire match. That brings me to 3 losses in a row for the first time in quite a while, but I’m still in the green on the year and up over 20 units since September, so I don’t feel terrible about my current process. Nevertheless, if you have any criticism, feel free to share it (preferably before the match, though — maybe others could benefit from your knowledge of why the pick is terrible). I am happy to discuss tennis with anyone, and I know that my reasoning is far from perfect or even complete. \n\nFrancesco Passaro is a young Italian prospect best known for his clay-court game, but he also has a sneakily strong hard court resume, including a strong performance at last year’s US Open, where he qualified before taking world No. 26 Cobolli to five sets. Passaro gained entry to Australian Open qualifying earlier this month and performed pretty well, taking out a dangerous HC player in Lajal before falling to Boyer in 3 sets. He also had a strong indoor season last year, making a Challenger SF and qualifying for Metz, so he should be prepared for the conditions here. While his performance rating in an easy first-round win over Hemery was nothing exceptional (6.8), it still exceeded Kozlov’s average mark through three matches (6.67). \n\nKozlov was once one of the top American juniors, making two Grand Slam finals and earning a main-draw US Open wildcard in 2017, but his pro career has been up-and-down, and he currently resides in the middle of the Challenger level. His results this year haven’t been as good as Passaro’s, and the market’s recent pricing of him has me think he should be a bigger underdog here. He was nearly even money against Kukushkin in qualifying; however, Kuku was later a +175 dog against Lajal, who was himself a very narrow favorite over Passaro at the AO. Of course, this isn’t quite apples-to-apples, but Passaro was also a similar favorite to this against Boyer at the AO, yet I feel that Boyer is playing at a higher level than Kozlov right now. Overall, I think Passaro should be at least -160 here, and I expect his serve and forehand to be the biggest weapons on the court.",

      "text": "POTD Record 25-23 (+1.4u)\nJanuary Record 9-9 (-0.62u)\n\nWednesday’s Pick ✅ - Nuno Borges + Frances Tiafoe +104 (1u to win 1.04u)\n\nThursday’s Pick - Shapovalov -1.5 game spread -112\n\nFYI, this match is Thursday in Australia, but it’s Wednesday night in the U.S., so you’ll have to get in quick.\n\nWe have a matchup of big hitters here. I’m going to lean on the side of Shapovalov. He plays his best tennis on the hard court slams. He has a very high ceiling and if he is playing well, he will be too much for Cilic. If he isn’t playing well, then Cilic can certainly win this. Shapo had a good first round showing and I expect that to continue into rd 2.\n\nCilic of course has had a great tennis career, winning a slam all the way back in 2014 and was a finalist here in 2018. However, it’s been a while since he’s been able to go deep in a major (he did make 4th round in Wimbledon last year). This is the first time he’s been past the first round in a hard court major since 2022. He had a ton of respect and experience and could certainly pull this off, but I think he’s getting a little too much from the books.\n\nGood Luck!",

Happy to help\n\nWriteup:\n\n**Casting U 3.5 Kills Map 1**\n\n* This is definitely the \"safer\" of the two legs in my opinion but I love both a ton. To understand why I think their is so much value, we must look at the state of top lane as a role at the moment, top lane in league was already the lowest kill participation role, and often the lowest kills besides supports in the game. This has been exemplified by the recent meta changes of incentivizing split pushing, the summoner spell changes to teleport, and the heavy kill meta in the jungle especially early on in series. This has lowered top liners kills by a significant amount and brought it even lower. Looking at the major regions, in LPL, their is currently only 1/13 top liners averaging more then 3 kills per map, In the LCK their are only 2/10 top liners averaging more then 3 kills and one is mainly because Faker is a very low kill share mid lane.\n* Casting has played 5 maps in the LCK so far, he has averaged 1.4 kills per map in the 5 games so far, he has a 0/5 hitrate on this line this split so far with his top kill game being 2 kills so far this split. He has the lowest KP% in the entire LCK at the moment as well\n* BRO are massive underdogs in this series, HLE were considered a super team and they started 0-2 and are itching to make it right, this is likely to be a stomp and it is one of those games you kind of feel bad for BRO for being the unlucky ones that draw against HLE on the schedule.\n* While 5 games this split isn't a ton of data, we also have Kespa Cup and 2025 pro data we can utilize. In Casting's LCK games so far, he has a 1/19 cover rate in map losses on O 3.5 kills which was a hook to the over. He has averaged 1.21 kills per map loss in the LCK so far. Even in his map wins, this isn't a guaranteed cover as he has hit in 5/8 wins so far in LCK. As said HLE are -1000 favorites, Zeus is one of the best top laners in the world, nightmare matchup imo for BRO.\n\n**Clear U 3.5 Kills Map 1**\n\n* Everything written about the top meta and top lane also applies to Clear as he also is a top laner. He also enters this game with a nightmare matchup going up against GenG and Kiin, GenG have run LCK for 2+ years now, barely dropping series, they are 4-0 so far and despite FearX impressive start, GenG have dominated them only dropping 1 map to FearX in the last 2 years\n* Clear and fear have performed much better with an 80% map win rate in 5 maps, but despite the wins, he is only averaging 1.8 kills per map, amongst the lowest in the league. He has a 1/4 over rate in map wins so far this split and a 4/5 under rate overall. Clear is slightly scarier in my opinion as he does have more pop off games, in his last 50 map losses in the LCK, he has a \\~15% cover rate and also hits this line in a higher % of wins then Casting does\n* However with that being said, the thing I am most focused on is the h2h matchup. A lot of Clear's stats last split were inflated because of the LCK format, they only played bottom tier teams + Damwon, allowing them to pad stats and only play against weaker top laners making Clear look better.\n* H2h against Kiin, this has been a nightmare matchup for Clear, Kiin is 15-1 lifetime against Clear in the head to head, Clear has gone U in 14/16 of those h2h matches. Lifetime Clear is averaging 1.56 kills when he faces against Kiin, the last time he covered the Over was February 4th 2024. In his last 13 map losses against Kiin, he has only totaled 12 kills overall meaning he has averaged 0.92 kills against GenG/Kiin in map losses. IF this isn't enough, GenG are similarly -1250 favorites, both matches should be one sided blowouts, both guys easily clear their unders here in my opinion",

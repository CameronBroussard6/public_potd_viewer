      "text": "POTD record 86-5-65 (W-P-L)\n\n**CS2: Vitality to win against Faze -1.5 maps handicap, 2u @ -118**\n\nThis Vitality team has been the dominant force in Counter-strike all year with an incredible win rate- they have won half of the tournaments they have entered (7 trophies out of 15 tournaments). Faze on the other hand hasn’t won anything all year and this is their first tournament final of the year. It’s really a Cinderella story and I expect Faze to put up a really good fight here so rather than bet on a 3-0 we will take a one-map buffer and if Vitality win 3-1 this bet will still cash. The prediction is 3-1, Vitality have too much experience and talent for scrappy underdogs Faze. Here are some other stats:\n\n* Vitality win rate over 3 months: 75% (Faze at 56%)\n* Vitality win rate in Bo5 finals in 2025: 7-2 (Faze 0-0)\n* Vitality bo3 wins over Faze in 2025: 3-0 (2-1 each time)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c4ov6ksz837g1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=39dabcc8c1d61c47eeb2d1dd372f81f64ca90213",

They are undefeated in the Swiss stage and coming off a massive 2-0 sweep against Team Spirit yesterday. Their playstyle has improved significantly, especially their team fighting skills, which looked flawless in that series.\n\nWhile Team Falcons are also undefeated, they have looked slightly more vulnerable, dropping maps to lower-tier teams like Pipsqueak+4 and Passion UA earlier in the week. With the momentum OG has and their upgraded coordination, it is extremely unlikely they get swept 0-2 here.\n\nI'm actually so confident in their form that I even throw a few extra units on the OG Moneyline as a sprinkle.\n\nBOL!",

      "text": "Record: 51-34 (+30.8 units)\n\nLast 10 (most recent on right):  ✅✅✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n\nLast Pick: Alejandro Catena (Osasuna) 2+ fouls committed vs Barcelona ❌\n\nEvent: Portugal Primeira Liga ⚽️\n\nPick of the Day: Joao Carvalho (Estoril) 1+ shot on target vs Famalicao 1.7 units to win 2U @ 2.20 (Bet365)\n\nWrite-up: Only one foul late on unfortunately from Catena, just how the ball rolls sometimes. Osasuna did well to hold out for 70 minutes before the pressure eventually allowed Barcelona to get their breakthrough as they ended up winning 2-0. Had Barça scored earlier it maybe would’ve increased foul opportunities due to how deep Osasuna were but I can’t be mad.\n\nI had quite a few picks to choose from today but I’ve gone with this one as it seems to be the best value to me. Carvalho is predicted to start on the right wing against Estoril but has played left wing and attacking mid. He’s been averaging 1.1 shots on target this season in the league, clearing the line in 10/12 (83%) of those. In away games his average has been of 1.2 - covering a shot on target in all six and in his last 8/8 matches. With Joao being predicted to start on the right, Famalicao have been conceding an average of 1.3 SOT’s from his flank this season at home, conceding one in 6/7 games (yes I know I’ve just opened a can of worms with that). He’s pretty much nailed for 90 minutes as well and overall this price is one that screams value based on all factors even with the price coming down from the 2.50 it opened at. BOL !\n\nNote: on the off-chance that Carvalho doesn’t start, choose a book that voids the pick. It could save you a lot of money.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qmlcoss9u27g1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d8148480625e36e7158c2cbf7621dfe385cc2d4b",

Blau-Weiß Linz’s coach is under intense pressure to arrest their slide, and his predicted 3-4-2-1 aims to maintain width and offensive outlets despite defensive frailties and long-term absences like Anderson and Goiginger, which have disrupted defensive cohesion and wing play. Their form suggests they often keep games close early but fade after halftime, opening spaces and creating transitional chances for both sides. Rapid Vienna’s interim coach Stefan Kulovits has publicly demanded belief and a fighting mindset, stating that those not committed should “go home,” underlining his motivation to spark an urgent offensive reaction and reinvigorate his squad tactically after a poor run. Rapid also plan to control via a 4-2-3-1, but multiple defensive and attacking absences (including Dahl and uncertainty over Kara) force improvised defensive structures and reliance on creative midfield interplay rather than a settled shape. With both coaches pushing for attacking rectification, weakened defenses likely to be exposed, and recent trends showing space and goals once intensity increases, this match has tactical conditions that strongly favor over 2.50 goals.",

      "text": "POTD Record: 29-13 (+19.2U)\n\nLast Pick: Arkansas ML (+110) (1U) ✅\n\nWhat a great game. Brazille is him.\n\nEvent: Ravens @ Bengals (NFL) (12PM central)\n\nPOTD: Ravens +5.5 (alt line)/ over 44.5 (alt line) 2 leg parlay (-120) (1U)\n\n(Bet to win 1U)\n\n\nWrite up:\n\nRavens +5.5\n\nThis rematch is a perception-versus-reality spot. The public is glued to that recent loss in Baltimore, where the Bengals handled the Ravens at their place, and they’re piling on Cincy because it feels easy. Yet the market is still hanging Baltimore as a short road favorite—despite that home loss to this very opponent—which is a tell that the matchup fundamentals and power ratings lean toward the Ravens. Baltimore’s defense tightens in key spots, their run game controls pace, and Lamar’s legs stress a Bengals front that’s been leaky against sustained drives. Baltimore also profiles as a classic bounce-back team: they win in the margins (field position, penalties, situational calls), and they’re built to travel with a physical identity that holds up outdoors in December. +5.5 gives us protection against early swings and late-game chaos while aligning with the deeper signal the number is sending. The public can have the Bengals; the favorite on the road is there for a reason—even after that home loss. Baltimore still averages 5.6 yards per play to the bengals 6.3 yards per play allowed and the raves have a 37% third down conversion rate to the bengals 47% rate allowed. Derrick Henry and co have also averaged 5.2 yards per carry and the bengals are near the bottom of the league in yards per rush. Let not forget the ravens also turned it over a ridiculous 6 TIMES on Christmas including a fumble in the endzone resulting in a touchback which completely changed the course of that game. And the total still reached 46 despite these stalled drives which brings me to my next point…\n\nover 44.5\n\nThis total sets up as a game-state mover. Both teams have paths to explosives: Baltimore can create chunk plays off play-action and quarterback runs, while Cincinnati forces tempo through its passing game and red-zone aggression. The Bengals’ defense has been vulnerable to breakdowns at the second level and coverage busts when forced to defend extended plays; Baltimore can punish that with designed movement and layered route concepts. On the other side, Cincinnati’s offense isn’t shy about pressing downfield and is capable of quick-strike scoring, which naturally lifts possessions and snaps. In a rematch, you also get built-in adjustments—more scripted answers early, more fourth-down aggression late, and fewer conservative punts (especially with two teams with little to lose)—which tends to add points. Dropping the total to an alternate 44.5 captures the volatility and raises the floor: even if one offense stalls for a quarter, a couple of explosive drives plus short fields can still push this over the number. The bengals have also allowed a ridiculous 26 points per game over their last 3 and 31 per game on the year compared with a league low 61% allowed red zone scoring percentage for touchdowns. And the ravens did allow a ton of yards to the Steelers last game despite holding them to multiple field goals. But I’m not so sure the bengals will be settling for as many in the red zone tomorrow.\n\nThe ravens are favored for a reason tomorrow and I like getting them over 5. And I believe this will go over 44.5 comfortably.\n\nLet’s continue our streak. As always, cheers 🍻",

Please, forgive me father, for I have sinned… now that I got that off my chest….\n\nTomorrow, Lukas Wenig feels like a really solid pick here, especially with what he’s put together this year. He’s had a proper breakout stretch in 2025…quarter-final run at the Grand Slam, some strong Euro Tour appearances, and a steady climb up the rankings that shows he’s doing it week in and week out, not just in flashes. His game has been sitting around the low-to-mid 90s, with doubling generally in the high-30% which should be plenty to get past the fist round at Ally Pally. He’s also been comfortable in short formats, which is huge in a best-of-five where you don’t get much time to settle.\n\nWhat really sells Wenig is how he hasn’t been panicking when things done go his way( gets broken, etc.. he scores solidly without needing to go crazy, and tends to take his chances when looks at a double come. On the big stage this season he’s shown he belongs, and that confidence matters a lot under World Championship chaos. If he turns up anywhere near his usual level, keeps the scoring ticking and doesn’t miss sitters, Wenig’s got all the tools to get the job done and book his spot in round two. And at plus odds I like putting 2 units down.\n\nAs always best of luck! Bet or fade responsibly, and let’s fling on!!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eh6joowoi27g1.jpeg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7932f9edfa68c8d915d4d2a53a83b5df2287fb1d",

If one of these passers gets close to 300 all the other needs is 225 which is very very doable with either set of receivers.

With these conditions, it makes it difficult for any team to be able to find any consistency through the air.

We have 2 teams trending in completely different directions. The Cardinals come into this matchup having lost 5 straight games & sit in last place in the NFC West. The Texans have won 6 of their last 7 games, including 5 straight & are battling for the divisional title in the AFC South, 1 game behind the Jags.\n\nNico has had 75+ yards in 5 of his last 6 games. He is averaging 100.4 yards over his last 5 games. In that span he has had 40% of Texans air yards (11th among WR’s), 27% of Houston’s targets (WR11), & has averaged 2.66 yards per route run (4th among WR’s). Arizona’s defense runs Cover 3 & Cover 4 over 50% of their snaps. Collins has lit up those coverages for 2.6 yards per route run. Arizona secondary is banged up missing some key guys, with outside CB Max Melton not practicing this week, as well as 2 safeties including Jalen Thompson. Arizona’s defense has a 51.5% success rate defending passing plays, 3rd worst in the NFL. Arizona ranks 27th in PFF's defense grade & 23rd in defensive EPA. In their last 5 games Arizona has allowed a 68.5% completion rate (3rd most in the NFL), 8.7 yards per pass (most in NFL), 8.7% TD rate (most), & allowed a 15.2 yards per catch to opposing WR’s (most). They just allowed Puka Nacua to go off for 7 catches for 167 yards last week. Arizona has allowed 2.60 points per drive over their past 7 games, 29th in the NFL. Now they face a Houston offense that is a home favorite with their highest Vegas total of the year (26 ppg), while Arizona allows 26.8 ppg (26th). CJ Stroud averages nearly 40 more passing yards at home vs away the last 2 years, his home/away splits are unbelievable. 2 completely different QB’s. This has naturally led to Nico Collins to performing better at home compared to away. Nico averaged 16.54 yards per catch at home, 3rd most among players with 20+ receptions. He has had 7 catches for 20+ yards at home in 5 games. On the road he averages 2.51 yards less at 14.03. In the CJ Stroud Era, Collins has averaged 5 catches for 84 yards at home compared to 4 catches for 66 yards on the road. He has been on fire lately, earning 10+ targets in 5 of his last 7 games. He had 121 yards last week & it could’ve easily been 180 if Stroud didn’t underthrow him on a deep ball. The Texans RB’s Woody Marks & Nick Chubb are banged up so that could also force the Texans to lean more heavily on Collins & the passing game in a crucial game for their playoff hopes. In a vertical offense vs a weak injured defense I think Stroud peppers him again. Even if the Texans take a lead, they’ve still continued to target him in the past. Arizona may even keep it close, they are 5-1 against the spread on the road (2nd) compared to a league worst 1-6 ATS at home. Arizona passes it the 2nd most in the league on 65.33% of their plays, while will lead to more Texans possessions. Houston is projected to run 63.5 plays this week, 3rd most in the NFL. They average 64.5 (7th most). This all benefits Collins. Think he may break 100 this game again.\n\n*More write-up incoming*\n\n__Nico Collins over 73.5 receiving yards__\n\nAppreciate the love!

We're getting this play again at plus money and the odds are too good to skip. Haaland has had a monster start to the season, netting\n15 goals in 15 EPL matches. He has come back to life after a minor downturn (by his standards), netting in 2 of his last 3 in all comps.

We're getting the odds we are here because of Palace's defensive record, but I just dont see them keeping Haaland out. \n\nToday we right the ship and start the next winning streak, BOL!",

      "text": "**Record**: 3-1 (+3.65u)\n\n**Last picks**: Borussia Monchengladbach ML (+100) vs. Wolfsburg 3u ❎\n\nReally unlucky outcome today. As someone who's watched both of these play at least 3 times this season, this was by far the best I've seen Wolfsburg play and by far the worst I've seen Gladbach play. With that being said to all the nice people on this sub I do apologize for the loss here. At the end of the day we're gambling, not generating free money. Not gonna trip over 1 loss. Anyways, to the important stuff...\n\n**Event**: English Premier League: Crystal Palace vs. Manchester City 6:00am PST\n\n**POTD**: Manchester City ML (-118) 2u\n\n**Write up:**\n\nManchester City started off the season pretty rocky but have finally found their form as of late. Coming off a massive 1-2 win over Real Madrid and a nice 3-0 against Sunderland on the weekend, City have been rolling recently. After the result of the Arsenal game today, City and Pep know that tomorrow is a must win game if they want to raise the trophy this year. City haven't been great away from home in the Prem this season, being 3-1-3. With that being said, 2 of the losses came against Villa and Newcastle who are third and fifth in home games this season respectively. City are 4-0-1 in their last 5 premier league games with a goal difference of +7. Palace have given City a lot of trouble the past few years but as someone who's watched all of those games, it was ALWAYS because of Eze. \n\nPalace have been deceivingly good this season, sitting 5th place as of now. With that being said, their only real competition so far this season was Aston Villa (before they got good again). Palace sit 15th in the table at home this season, with a home record of just 2-4-1 and a goal difference of +2. Palace are also missing quite a few key players (Muñoz being the most prominent) and I see Haaland absolutely thrashing that back line without him. Palace have only beat Brentford and Liverpool at home, two pretty poor teams this year. \n\nAssuming City start the same lineup they've gone with the last 2 games, their attacking threat will be too much for a Palace backline missing one of their best players. Assuming Haaland, Doku, Cherki, and Foden all start, I wouldn't be surprised if they score 3 or 4 against this Palace team. In their last 5 games away at Crystal Palace, City are 2-2-1. Again, this Palace team is very very different without Eze and I don't see them performing the same way they have in the past. \n\nBOL!",

      "text": "💎POTD: Buffalo Bills Moneyline\nOdds: -118 on FanDuel\nWager: 2.5 Units\n\nRecord: 4-3\nNet Units: -.17\n\n🏈 NFL, Bills at Patriots, 12/14/25 Sun, 1 pm Eastern Time\n\nExplanation: The Bills can beat the Patriots tomorrow because Buffalo’s offense has been consistently more explosive and efficient than New England’s, and that matters a lot in a game where the market expects scoring. Buffalo is averaging 28.9 points per game (5th in the NFL), while New England is scoring 27.0 points per game.\n\nMore importantly though is that Buffalo is one of the league’s best in efficiency (about +0.13 EPA/play) , and with Josh Allen producing 3,083 yards, 22 TD, and a strong completion rate, plus James Cook over 1,300 rushing yards, that can be a problem for the Patriots. \n\nBuffalo’s offense has been strong against more “normal” competition, and the Patriots have had a soft schedule, so don’t let the 11-2 record fool you. They’re a good team, but don’t let it fool you.",

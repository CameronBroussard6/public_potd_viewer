Maxey dished out ten dimes against the Wizards earlier this season. Maxey has gone over this assists line in 84% of his games this season. Embiid is out tonight so Maxey will continue to be the offensive focal point for the Sixers. As for Quinton Byfield, he has gone without a goal in 84% of his games this season. He is up against the Washington Capitals who allow the second fewest goals in the NHL. Logan Thompson will be in net for the Capitals. Thompson averages 2.08 goals against which puts him in the top five among goalies with 10 or more games played. Byfield has yet to score at home this season, going goalless in 10 out of 10 home games for the LA Kings.\n\n👇\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ocycbcsywu4g1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2095d3f46a2415f4a03a3366c396ec477176697a",

His arm is warmed up and his confidence is high.\n\nMatt Clark: He enters the tournament in this round. He may have trouble finding the boards and adjusting to the spotlight in the early sets. Muramatsu could take advantage of this coolness and take the match early.\n\nWhile Matt Clark (\"The Superman\") is a great legend, he now focuses his game on \"wearing down\" and slowing down. His average generally stays in the 75-80 range. However, Muramatsu possesses one of the cleanest shots in the world technically. His ability to hit a Triple 20 (T20) and his potential for a 180 are much higher than Clark's. If Muramatsu can find his scoring rhythm (Scoring Power), it's mathematically very difficult for Clark to come from behind and catch him. DartsOrakel FDI: Muramatsu 1592 – Clark 1542. As you can see from these scores, Muramatsu is one step ahead. In a close battle, Muramatsu will emerge victorious.",

      "text": "Record: 11-3-1  \nLast POTD: Anaheim Ducks TT over 2.5 Goals (-145) ✅️  \nToday's Pick: Avs TT over 2.5 + Stars TT over 1.5 + Sens/Habs over 4.5 (-120)\n\nFairly sweat free cash on this one as the Ducks score two goals in the opening ten minutes of the game.  Of course, they don't score again til the 3rd but considering the last POTD was won days later on a stat correction, I'll certainly take it.  Will never understand how they were a +130 underdog against St Louis.\n\nNothing really stands out today on the NHL slate so going with a few of my favorite pieces that I'm using for parlays today.  First, Colorado is on an all-time pace while I have no faith in the Canucks so 3 goals shouldn't be too difficult, especially with Nate running away with this season's MVP award and the Canucks tied for last in goals allowed this season.  Second, I can't bet against my Rangers to lose but they just lost their top defenders, Adam Fox, for the next month or two and I don't see them holding Dallas to 1 or less short of an outrageous performance from Shesty in net.  I had parlayed those two for -175 when it opened yesterday but odds have moved overnight so for a third piece adding two fun fast-paced Canadian teams with shaky goaltending in a game I expect to clear 5 goals with ease.  Feel free to mix and match and/or move Avs to 3.5 or Stars to 2.5.  I'm messing around with some round-robins but these are three of my favorite NHL pieces for the day and I expect each of these three juiced lines to hit.\n\nBOL if you tail.",

Playing the Raptors in Toronto tonight. Toronto is 15th in pace this season(middle of the pack), so I expect it to be on the higher side for scoring. Also am a fan of his o14.5 RA +100 but feel confident in him clearing 25. Let’s hope this one goes as well as the last 3!!!!",

      "text": "POTD Record: 2-2\n\nLast POTD: Tyrone Tracy Jr. Over 2.5 Receptions ❌\n\nEvent: Washington Wizards Vs. Philadelphia 76ers\n\nToday's POTD: Tyrese Maxey Over 30.5 Points (Would go up to 31.5)\n\nOdds: -120\n\nWrite Up:\n\nWhy I like Maxey’s points tonight:\n\n1. Elite usage + production\n\nMaxey is averaging 32.3 points per game, which is currently third in the entire NBA in scoring. \nHe’s also at 7.6 assists per game and leads the league in minutes per game at 40.7, so he is literally never off the floor and everything runs through him. \nIn the Sixers’ most recent loss to Atlanta, he dropped 44 points, again showing the ceiling when games stay competitive and he has to carry the offense. \nSo we’ve got: top-3 scorer, league-leading minutes, primary initiator, no true co-alpha scorer active. That’s exactly the profile you want for a points over.\n\n2. Matchup: Wizards = defensive disaster\n\nThe Wizards are basically the perfect matchup for a high-usage guard:\nThey’re 3–16 and own the worst defense in the NBA by points allowed: 127.7 opponent points per game, dead last (30th of 30). \nBasketball-Reference has them at 112.5 PPG scored vs 127.7 allowed, a brutal -15.2 average margin, again worst in the league. \nBasketball Reference\nStatMuse shows opponents averaging 127.6 points on 46.5% from the field and 37.4% from three against Washington – bottom of the league across the board. \nOn top of that, their recent game log is just an endless track meet:\nGave up 140 to the Raptors, 137 to the Pistons, 135 to the Rockets, 129 to the Nets, 132 to the Hawks, 126 to the Bucks… all in the past couple weeks. \nThey’re bad at the point of attack, bad at staying in front of guards, and bad at containing pull-up threes and drives. That’s exactly where Maxey lives: high pick-and-roll, pull-up shooting, and downhill aggression.\n\n3. Scheduling & game environment\nWashington is coming off a 129–126 win over the Bucks last night, where they had to claw back late and leaned heavily on their core guys. \nThat means second night of a back-to-back, on the road vs a better team, with a defense that was already 30th before fatigue.\nThe Sixers are 10–9, very live in the East, and big home favorites. Market numbers:\nSpread: Sixers around -13.5\nTotal: roughly 234–235 points depending on book. \nA high total with a big favorite usually signals fast pace + offensive efficiency. Both teams are scoring in the low- to mid-110s on average (PHI ~118.2, WAS ~112.5), and when Washington loses, it’s often because they give up 130+. \nThat’s a dream setting for a volume scorer like Maxey: lots of possessions, low resistance, and a defense that doesn’t really have a stopper at the point of attack.\n\n4. Role/context: still “Maxey’s team” offensively\nMatchup previews list Joel Embiid as out for this one, with guys like Paul George and Andre Drummond at least on the injury report and Kelly Oubre also sidelined. \nWhat that means in practical terms:\nMaxey is the primary option, not just “a” primary option.\nHis scoring load spikes when Embiid sits – more pick-and-rolls, more self-created shots, more pull-up threes in transition.\nWith Embiid off, the Sixers lean into spread-out, guard-driven offense, which pushes Maxey’s shot volume comfortably into the mid-20s FGA range on his big nights.\nGiven that he’s already at 32.3 PPG on the season, we don’t need a crazy efficiency spike – we mostly just need the usual Maxey volume in a softer-than-normal matchup.\n\n5. Blowout risk and minutes\nBiggest concern in a line this high is always: “What if it’s a blowout and he sits the 4th?”\nCouple reasons I’m still okay with the over:\nThe Wizards (weirdly) have a few explosive scoring nights in them – see the 132 vs Hawks and 129 vs Bucks – so they can at least keep games somewhat close for three quarters. \nMaxey leads the league at 40.7 minutes per game, which tells you Philly is totally fine running him heavy even in non-nail-biters. \nIn blowouts versus Washington historically, the stars still eat – they just do it faster. That’s why you see multiple 140+ outputs by Philly against this team in recent years. \nSo even if Philly pulls away, Maxey can reasonably be at 25–28 points by mid-3rd and just needs a brief 4th-quarter stint to clear typical lines in the low 30s.",

Opened at Missouri -1.5. Public hit Missouri but we’ve seen this flip completely to the other side. Yes Missouri is 8-0 but dig deeper you will find they have had the 2nd easiest schedule in all of division 1 basketball. They have played 7 home games except a lone trip on the road to Howard to open the year (Big deal!) this notre dame team has some real talent and they hung in there with some legit contenders away from home in Vegas and losing by 1 up in Columbus is nothing to scoff about. They’ve been battle tested and although Missouri has been lights out this year I think that is more about the soft schedule they’ve had and I believe they are due for some likely regression here against a much better notre dame defense and Missouri’s first true road test after playing essentially 7 home games against weak competition. Let’s get back on the board. As always, cheers 🍻",

She is the number 1 in this indoor tournament but she struggles with lower ranked players outside/close to the top 100. Earlier this year she played Grabher ranked (94) in round of 64 and it was a 3 setter, in round of 32 she played Martic (211) and dropped the first set. Again a 3 setter. I take the match to go the distance again here. Her opponent Knutson is Ranked 190 and Parks herself is world no 71.",

Queen just isn't a floor spacer YET and I don't even think he will attempt one which he hasnt the last 2 games. Yes I think he will play for around 28 mins but the odds are just too good to pass up here.\n\nAnthony Edwards has hit this line in his last 5 in a row going over 30 in all of em and going over 40 thrice adn I don't see him stopping right here. Pelicans allow the 2nd most pts to shooting guards so honestly i expect a 35 piece from ant here and even if its a blowout, Ant should still hit this.

The fade continues and we win on it once more. Screamer from Villa and game ends 1-0. Second game Brighton nicked their second goal near the end when Forest really looked the more likely to score. Good reads. We move.\n\nEvent: Atletico Madrid at Barcelona (LaLiga) 3:00pm EST\n\nPOTD: o2.5 Goals + BTTS (-150)\n\nRead: Barcelona have been all over the place defensively but are still the highest scoring team in the league and sitting on top of the table. On the other hand, Atletico have only lost one La Liga game all year. Which they lost back on Matchday 1. Personally, I lean Barcelona to win here, but I can’t help but think Simone and Atletico show up to fight in a big game against the league leaders.\n\nWhat I am seeing on the Barcelona side is positive. Seven wins in seven home games in La liga. Starboy Pedri will be likely to start after getting some minutes at the weekend for the first time back since el classico. Raphina will start only his second game since coming back from injury. He got an assist in his first start back on the weekend also. This makes me comfortable trusting the attack from Barca. Which is very important even for a team at this caliber when facing a team like Atletico who love to defend. We also will likely need Barca to score two.\n\nDeigo Simone is the founder of Haram Football. He will not make it easy. Barca will still break through. I imagine scoring multiple goals. At this point I would typically take Barca to win (still probably will) but I just can’t fade this sneaky hot hand. As haram as they can be, Atletico have scored in every game this season apart from away at Arsenal in the UCL. Combine that with Barca’s defensive struggles and I don’t see Barca stopping Atletico from getting at least one. From sheer desire. It just feels like they will not go down without a fight.  \n\nHoping for a shootout. Let’s see it. \n\nBOL.\n\n(Edit: Forgot to add odds)",

Game ends 99-98, and honestly, that was some disgusting basketball from Detroit. The read on Atlanta coming in flat was spot on — but the Pistons answered with turnovers, and shooting bricks, and decision-making I haven’t seen since the WNBA season ended. We take the L and move on.\n\n**Play of the Day**  \nNBA | Spurs vs. Grizzlies  \n**Pick: Keldon Johnson Over 19.5 P+R @ 1.85 (-118) | 1 Unit**\n\nI like Keldon Johnson point and rebounds. The Spurs are without Victor Wembanyama and Stephon Castle — their two biggest usage guys. That’s a huge amount of scoring, rebounding, and on-ball responsibility suddenly up for grabs, and Keldon is one of the first players who steps right into that void.\n\nWhen both Wemby and Castle sit, Johnson has a 100% hit rate on this exact P+R line. Every time he’s been put in this expanded role, he’s delivered. He’s also quietly been rebounding really well off the bench. That gives him two clean paths to the over: volume scoring and effort on the glass. Add in that this matchup with Memphis is usually fast and high-scoring, and the opportunities only increase. He already put up 18 points and 7 rebounds against them earlier this season.\n\nWith the Spurs lineup still thin, and a friendly pace, he should be heavily involved from start to finish,so i think he should get this done.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6h54zdjz5r4g1.png?width=699&format=png&auto=webp&s=609a1d9697e3f5287128aa078d94118612825cd1\n\n,  \nLet’s see if we can bounce back.

      "text": "POTD Record: 2-2 ❌️✅️✅️❌️\n\nOttawa Senators vs Montreal Canadiens (NHL/Hockey) at 7pm EST\n\nCole Caufield over 0.5 points (-190) \n\nWrite up:\nGoing back to Caufield since he's been on fire getting points in 7 games in a row. In these past games he seems to want to prove to Bill Guerin that he belongs on team USA for the Olympics even though his chances are slim (Guerin doesn't like small players). Hence why I believe he's trying even harder nowadays to force his hand.\n\nReason why i'm confident with this pick is because Caufield loves to play against the Senators. He has 14 points in his last 15 games versus them (10 of them came in the last 8 games which is even better for us). Another reason I like this pick is because of the new winger that now plays with him and Nick Suzuki on the first line. Ever since Zach Bolduc replaced Juraj Slafkovsky, that line has now 7 points in 3 games in 5v5. And that's only 5v5! Caufield also can get a point on the powerplay as he is on the first PP unit and usually either scores or makes a great pass to his teammates (8 primary assists out of 12). \n\nSenators this season allow 3.36 goals per game. Canadiens this season score 3.42 goals on average per game (top 4 NHL) so I expect Caufield to contribute to what will probably be a high scoring game.\n\nCanadiens should be well rested as they last played Saturday and they lost 7-2 to the Avalanches(Cup favorites vs up-and-coming team) so they should be fired up for a bounce back game at home vs a division rival!\n\nBOL!",

When seeing that kind of usage Chet has been amazing clearing this line in 7/8 games this season avergaing 21.8 PPG with his only under coming in a game he played just 27 minutes.\n\nWhen seeing 13+ shots Chet is over this line in 25/29 (86.2%) of games dating back to April of last season averaging 20.8 PPG, and  Chet should easily clear 13 FGA in this as he did In both games this season without Hart and is now without Dort and Caruso as well so I could see him shooting the ball 15 or more times here.",

They have won four of their last matches in all competition. They're confident at this moment. Based on those analysis, this match must produce 2-4 goals.\n\n*  Pervious match stats shows that Newcastle likes to concede corners.

You guys will see very quickly a lot of my handicapping style involves diving into teams tempo styles, second chance opportunities (FGA, Rebounding +\\-, FTA/FTM and Assist to Turnover ratio). But of course I also look deeply into recent form and similar matchups against other teams played so far this season. \n\nBoth these teams head into this matchup as Top 30 tempo squads in the country on the offensive end. (W&MU 3rd, Duquesne 26th). If you look these two teams up and down metric wise these are probably two of the most similar teams in the country. It’s actually scary how close these teams are on the offensive end. But here’s the ticker and the difference in the game and why I believe William & Mary +7 is the play. \n\nWilliam & Mary on the defensive side is more disruptive and more effective. William & Mary according to KenPom (one of my favorite tools to use) ranks 65th in effective FG % Defense (Duquesne ranks 134th), 40th in Turnover % (Duquesne ranks 94th, 11th in the country in 3p Defense (Duquesne ranks 39th), the list goes on for defensive advantages pointing towards William & Mary. If William & Mary can keep up the defensive fortitude they have shown this season vs Duquesne and disrupt their rhythm this game slowly starts to become a pick em before our eyes. \n\nWilliam & Mary also makes on average 3 more Free Throws a game, they get 5 more rebounds a game, 2 more assists a game, and 2 more blocks a game than the Duquesne Dukes. All of these stats above = more scoring opportunities. Add in the data showing William & Mary as the better defensive team and I think laying 7 points here is extremely high. \n\nRecent Results\n\nWilliam & Mary (7-2 SU), (6-1 Against the Spread)\nNotable Wins: Norfolk State, Bowling Green, UTEP, Abilene Christian, Old Dominion. \nNotable Losses: Richmond by 4, St. John’s by 33\n\nDuquesne: (5-2 SU), (2-4 Against the Spread)\nNotable Wins: Niagara, Sacred Heart, Queens, Loyola MD.\nNotable Losses: Villanova, Northeastern\n\nDuquesne hasn’t beat anyone noteworthy. \n\nMeanwhile William & Mary beat teams all expected to finish at the top to middle of their respective conferences. Fun Fact Bowling Green just whooped Kansas State into oblivion earlier. \n\nI have this game handicapped at William & Mary +3.5 . I think we are getting 3.5 free points here. Don’t be surprised seeing William & Mary win outright. You’ll also really enjoy their style of ball. \n\nDo well and good luck. \n\nBC",

Here is the breakdown:\n\n1. The \"Angry Rick Barnes\" Spot\nTennessee is coming off a gut-wrenching 81-76 loss to Kansas in Vegas where they blew a double-digit lead. Rick Barnes teams historically bounce back hard after games like that. They aren't just looking to win; they are looking to re-establish their identity. Before that Kansas collapse, they beat #3 Houston physically. They are battle-tested; Syracuse is shell-shocked.\n\n2. Syracuse is Decimated (The Donnie Freeman Factor)\nThis is the biggest edge. Syracuse’s leading scorer and best player, Donnie Freeman (17.8 PPG), is OUT (foot). You cannot replace that production against a top-tier defense. They are also dealing with a banged-up JJ Starling, who has been battling leg issues. Even if Starling plays, he isn't 100%, and without Freeman, the Orange have zero interior presence to handle Tennessee’s physicality.\n\n3. The Defensive Mismatch\nTennessee enters this game with one of the most efficient defenses in the country (KenPom top-15 AdjD). Syracuse just gave up 95 points to Iowa State in their last outing. If Iowa State can hang 95 on them, Tennessee’s offense—which is averaging ~86 PPG—should feast. On the flip side, I don't see how a Freeman-less Syracuse offense scores enough to keep up.\n\n4. The \"Fraudulent\" Record\nSyracuse is 4-3, but look at the losses. When they step up in class, they get smoked.\n• Lost to Iowa State by 31.\n• Lost to Kansas by 11.\n• Lost to Houston (closer game, but Houston controls tempo).\nThey are 0-2 ATS in true road/neutral tough spots recently. Tennessee is a legitimate Final Four contender; Syracuse is struggling to find an identity.\nThe Prediction:\nTennessee suffocates them early. The Vols' physicality on the glass will be too much for a depleted Syracuse frontcourt. \n\n\nThis feels like a 15+ point blowout.\nScore Prediction: Tennessee 84, Syracuse 68.\nTL;DR: Tennessee is angry, Syracuse is injured (No Freeman), and the talent gap is massive. Lay the points",

Meanwhile Campbell shows up to road games like they accidentally got on the wrong bus. They’re 0–4 away from home, and half those losses weren’t even competitive as they were more like “hey, thanks for coming, here’s your participation ribbon.”\n\nPSU’s offense is clicking, the ball is moving, everyone’s smiling, and Kayden Mingo is out here hooping like he’s auditioning for a freshman All-American nod. Campbell? They’ve got one main scorer, D.J. Smith, and after that the offense turns into an improv show nobody asked for.\n\nThe biggest mismatch? Energy and tempo. Penn State runs like they had two espressos and a pep talk. Campbell plays like someone woke them up from a nap. That’s exactly how double-digit spreads get covered ,fast team vs sleepy team.\n\nAnd dEpth? PSU can go to the bench and still score. Campbell goes to the bench and immediately wishes they hadn't. This is how you avoid those nightmare backdoor covers when the starters sit, the lead doesn't die.\n\nIf Penn State starts with a 10–0 burst, don’t be shocked. They’ve got all the tools to stretch this one out until it looks like a CVS receipt.\n\nSo yeah PSUwill win by like 15, maybe 20 if they hit threes. Campbell might put up a fight early, but eventually the wheels come off, the vibes collapse, and PSU goes on that inevitable “welp, this is getting out of hand” run.\n\nTake –12.5, sip your coffee, and enjoy the show.",

Bet 2.5U\n\nWriteup: Going back to college hoops for this one, and we’re taking the Tennessee Volunteers to cover the spread against Syracuse. Tennessee is currently 7-1 and the #13 team in the nation. They recently finished 2-1 in the Players Era tournament with a very impressive win over #3 Houston. Their senior guard Ja’Kobi Gillespie leads the Volunteers with 18.5 PPG along with star freshman Nate Ament having 18 PPG. With their offense averaging 86 PPG, it’s even more impressive that their defense is even better than their offense, conceding only 65.5 PPG.\n\nOn the other side, we have the Syracuse Orange at 4-3 this season, and recently lost all of their games in the Players Era tourney. Their top scorer Donnie Freeman is out for this game due to injury for an offense that was already inconsistent. They have also struggled keeping up pace of play against better opponents, as the Players Era tournament clearly showed. \n\nTo add to this, if you look at KenPom rankings, Tennessee is rated the 12th best team while Syracuse is rated 71st. On Haslametrics, this difference is even larger, with Tennessee being rated 7th while Syracuse is 93rd. This is an extremely significant gap for a 6.5 point spread, especially compared to games with a similar spread. Michigan State is favored by 5.5, but they are ranked 15th while their opponent is ranked 21st. \n\nBoth teams are playing with a chip on their shoulder, but the better team should come out on top and do so in a decisive manner with a least a 7 point victory. \n\nRemember to only bet what you can afford to lose, and BOL!",

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 11-5 (Avg Odds +131)\n\n**Previous Pick:** Enzo Fernandez 1+ SOT (+140) ✅️\n\n**Today's Event:** English Premier League | Fulham vs. Man City (11:30AM PST)\n\n**Pick:** Harry Wilson 1+ SOT (+105) 1 unit to win 1.05 units\n\n**Write Up:** Enzo comes through for us in the 31st minute! Our guy cashed us for the 4th time, all at plus money! Palmer did not start, as expected, and Enzo slotted into the #10 role which was perfect for our play. Gotta love a weekend sweep! \n\nUnfortunately I didn't post my pick for yesterday (Santi Castro 2+ SOT), as I was waiting for Bologna lineups and didn't catch them until 30 minutes before kick off. So we are back to mid-week EPL action after a day off as Fulham host Man City. Fulham play really tough at home, going 4-1-1, having only dropped points to Arsenal and Man U. If City want to make a title run again this year, these away matches against mid-table teams are must win games. I expect a close match here, but really can't read the goals.\n\nAs I was finishing my research here, I actually changed to a different pick than my initial pick of a City player. City seems a bit tired, they are struggling to rotate players for mid-week matches, and are conceding goals/possession more than typical - especially mid-week. \n\nHarry Wilson should get another start at right winger here, after a goal on two shots against Tottenham over the weekend. If you watched that match, you saw why I'm on Wilson - he's a guy who can shoot from anywhere with his left foot. Seriously, go watch his goal if you haven't seen it, I know the keeper was out of position, but it doesn't make the finish any less impressive. Wilson has only had 3 SOTs in his last 5 matches, but he's taken an average of 3 shots per match. This includes 4 against Arsenal at home and, honestly, it was unlucky that none of those hit the target. He also had 2 SOTs in this fixture at the end of last season in May (against a fairly similar City team that I expect to see tomorrow). Wilson also scored 3 goals for Wales during the international break 2 weeks back. The man is in form and I like him to take a few shots today and land at least one on target. \n\nBOL and have a great Tuesday!",

I like the Blackhawks ML also, but the odds are too high for this thread. The Knights are 6-4-4 at home this season and it seems as though Carter Hart will be making his first start of the season after serving his suspension. \n\nChicago got a big win over Anaheim on Sunday and they have a respectable team for the first time in a while. Their season goal differential is actually better than the Knights. Simply put, these teams aren’t that far off from each other, but the betting lines make this seem like a long shot.",

      "text": "**POTD** Record 121-02-97\n\nGLADBACH VS ST PAULI\n\nDate: 02 DECEMBER 2025 at 18:00\n\nBET ON: Match odds- GLADBACH\n\nOdd: 1.81\n\n\n\n\\- Gladbach enter the cup tie with clear upward momentum and a strong sense of purpose, as Polanski has repeatedly stressed that the DFB-Pokal is a priority both for sporting continuity and the significant financial incentive of progressing. Despite missing Neuhaus and several squad players, the team’s 4-2-3-1 structure remains stable, reinforced by the returns of Hack and Kleindienst and the reliability of Tabakovic up front. Polanski warns against relying on the recent 4–0 league win over St. Pauli, calling this a “dangerous match,” but he underlines that his side’s defensive solidity and form give them control over the tie. St. Pauli, meanwhile, approach the match from a position of crisis, with Blessin viewing the cup primarily as a mental reset after a long run of Bundesliga defeats. Their squad is significantly weakened: key striker Hountondji is ruled out with a muscular injury, while multiple defenders remain unavailable, forcing a conservative 5-4-1 setup designed more for survival than proactive play. With limited attacking options, structural defensive problems, and confidence issues, St. Pauli’s priorities lie in stabilizing rather than competing on equal terms — giving Gladbach a clear motivational, tactical, and personnel advantage.",

Other times, that team is the 2025 Syracuse men’s basketball team.\n\nThe Orange (4-3) accepted an invite to last week’s Player’s Era Festival with one thing in mind: an opportunity to pick up a crucial non-conference Quad 1 victory. With matchups lined up against Iowa State (7th in NET ranking), Kansas (17th) and Houston (18th), the opportunity was there for the taking. However, what started with promise—a 78-74 overtime defeat to the Cougars—quickly ended in disaster with 11 and 31-point losses to the Jayhawks and Cyclones respectively. \n\nAnd while No. 13 Tennessee will provide Syracuse with one last chance on Tuesday night, don’t hold your breath.\n\nThe Vols (7-1) enter this matchup on the heels of a disappointing 81-76 loss to Kansas last Wednesday. It’s a defeat that will have the team kicking itself, as Tennessee led by 12 with 14 minutes to go before watching the wheels completely fall off. So while the Orange will be out looking for respect, the Vols will be looking for something to take out their frustrations on. \n\nOffensively, Tennessee comes in ranked 32nd in offensive efficiency (1.186), 50th in shooting (48.8%), 52nd in scoring (85.9 PPG) and 114th in three-point shooting (35.4%). While Syracuse’s defensive numbers might look respectable at first—20th in opponent shooting (37.8%), 27th in scoring defense (65.3 PPGA), 30th in defensive efficiency (0.908) and 99th in opponent three-point shooting (30.7%)—a closer look will reveal a chink in its armor. In three games against top-ranked opponents during last week’s aforementioned tournament, the team saw those numbers drop to 81.3 points per game allowed on 46.4% shooting (39.7% from the perimeter). Look for Maryland-transfer Ja’Kobi Gillespie (18.5 PPG) to take advantage of that.\n\nThe mismatch should continue on the other end of the floor as well. \n\nThrough eight games, the Vols rank 12th in opponent shooting (36.8%), 27th in defensive efficiency (0.903), 29th in scoring defense (65.4 PPGA) and 51st in opponent three-point shooting (28.7%). It all adds up to what should be a very long night for an Orange offense that only ranks 114th in shooting (46.2%), 171st in offensive efficiency (1.041), 177th in scoring (74.9 PPG) and 290th in three-point shooting (29.3%). That includes scoring just 66.0 points per game on 37.9% shooting over their last three showings. And did we mentioned that the team will be without its leading scorer in forward Donnie Freeman (17.8 PPG? Yikes. \n\nA strong advantage on the glass will be another X factor in the matchup. \n\nTennessee comes in ranked 10th in total rebounds (43.6 per game), 10th in offensive rebounds (13.0), 20th in opponent rebounds (30.0) and 199th in opponent offensive rebounds (9.4). Conversely, Syracuse ranks 152nd in total rebounding (36.3), 223rd in offensive rebounds (8.6), 293rd in opponent rebounds (38.7) and 304th in opponent offensive rebounds (10.9). \n\nTrust the Vols to make the Orange their punching bag. \n\nBOL if tailing, and as always, please do so respectively.",

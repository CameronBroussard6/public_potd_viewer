Kostyuk / 12:00 AM EST**\n\n**Today's Pick: Total Games OVER 21.5 @ 1.77 (-130)**\n\nRecap:  Well the match didn't unfold *exactly* as planned, but it did start off competitve like I predicted and Kostyuk fought hard and ended up giving Andreeva more than she could handle.  Fortunately though, she hung in just long enough to get us our win. 💰💲\n___\nBack to the same logic for Kostyuk's next match versus Jess Pegula.  Their last meeting in China last October went 3 sets with Pegula finally pulling away in the 3rd with a 6-1 win, but this is an even more competitive version of Kostyuk that Jess will be facing today. \n\nBoth of these ladies have been shown to be resilient and willing to wiggle into long rallies which usually leads to more games.   Pegula has strong baseline consistency and Kostyuk has the ability to extend points and win breaks.  Although Pegula is slightly favored, I again predict that Kostyuk will steal a set (if not win the match).  However, Pegula is definitely not one to lie down and roll over, and they are both confident enough to keep their emotions in check while they battle.   The close line (Pegula -135) is also a strong indicator that this may be a close match.  I see this one going back and forth quite a bit, so OVER 21.5 total games is once again the bet.  BOL!",

The Rams lost last time after a bunch of turnover from Stafford. I don’t really see that happening tomorrow, but that’s a huge spread for a home playoff team that has already beaten this team. The Rams of course have the ability to put up points, but I think Carolina might surprise some people again here and be able to put up enough to cover 16.5\n\nMoving to the night game, there is going to be a lot of wind tomorrow at Soldier Field. Both of these teams know each other well and would like to get their ground game going. Their last game here at Solider Field needed OT to get to 38. Teasing this up to 52.5 feels like too many points with the conditions and the team’s playstyles.\n\nGood Luck!",

Musetti is a top 10 player who's better on clay. He has a 1HBH and is a great mover, but think he won't match up well against Rublev's power. His results so far have been beating Coleman Wong who's done well to reach the QFs of this tournament, and had a battle against Etcheverry.\n\nI think he'll have a hard time breaking Rublev this match, and will try to invoke unforced errors from Rublev.\n\nThis isn't a lock, but I think its good value at even odds. I'd give Rublev \\~70% chance to win.\n\n \n\nI also am playing Marcos Giron 0.5U at +265 but not for POTD tracking.",

      "text": "Record: 173-139, +9.38 units\n\nLast Pick: Alexander Bublik ML vs Juncheng Shang (-163, 1 unit) ✅\n\nTennis | United Cup | 1:30 AM EST (estimated)\n\nToday's Pick: Taylor Fritz vs Hubert Hurkacz | **Hurkacz +0.5 games at -110 (BET365). 1 unit.**\n\nWrite-up: Easy win for Bublik, although Shang held on a little better in the second set. \n\nInteresting United Cup tie here between the USA and Poland, two of the most successful teams in the history of this event. Both teams have done well to get to this stage, but Team USA has struggled a bit more thanks to inconsistent performances from Taylor Fritz and Coco Gauff. Fritz played more matches than almost anyone on tour in 2025, but he unfortunately didn't get to enjoy a relaxing offseason, as he revealed that he's currently battling some \"pretty serious tendinitis\" in his knee, and his main goal in the offseason was to rehab it. In three matches here at the United Cup, Fritz hasn't looked great, losing to clay-courter Sebastian Baez and a resurgent Stefanos Tsitsipas but scoring a narrow victory over Spanish grinder Jaume Munar. He didn't look terrible in the most recent match against Tsitsipas, but struggled immensely on return, generating just two break points. While Hubert Hurkacz also has some fitness concerns given that this is his first event back from a long injury layoff, he hasn't exactly showed it so far, with the highlight being a massive win over ATP #3 Alexander Zverev in his first match back. Hurkacz always plays well here in Australia, as the lively conditions boost his already incredible serve, and it's tough to see Fritz breaking him much. Hubi also has an aggressive enough baseline game to take over rallies if Fritz falls into a pattern of pushing off the backhand wing. If this match goes long, I trust Hurkacz's fitness more right now, and I feel that he should be a slight favorite here. I chose the +0.5 games handicap because I prefer these odds, but Hurkacz ML at around +100 is also a totally reasonable option. Just note that they aren't exactly the same bet (as +0.5 games could cash even if Hurkacz loses, or the other way around).",

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 8-26-3 *A very rare no sweat cash! As predicted, Ross County turned UP despite their problems and had everything under control for a smooth 2-0 victory. Yeah, I can't believe it either. Only time will tell if it's just a case of a broken clock being right or if I can actually get a winning streak going for real. I have to say I really like today's football schedule and it was really difficult to pick between 3 picks, but I've picked the one I have the most faith in (be on the lookout for the other ones that I'll post in the other thread). That said, it's been ages since I've hit two picks in a row, so faders might be in a good spot today 👀*\n\n*I just want to say a huge shoutout to the three tippers, your contribution means more than you know.*\n\n**Last Five:** ✅❌❌❌✅\n\n**Event:** A-League Men, Melbourne Victory v Sydney Wanderers, starts in 6 hours and 4 minutes\n\n**POTD:** Sydney Wanderers 0.0 Asian Handicap, +175, 1 unit\n\n**Write Up:** Using the same logic here and fading a team that seems to be the strong favourite on paper, yet their ML odds are suspiciously high. Just from my experience, these kind of matchups often have slip-ups, especially in the UK and the Australian leagues, so I'm looking forward to this one.\n\nHear me out. Yes, Melbourne Victory arrive into this match on 4 wins in a row and 6th on the league table. Yes, Sydney are basically the complete opposite with 3 losses in a row (4L 1D in the last 5 league matches) and are dead last. But this is a rivalry and all logic seems to fly out of the window in those, especially in the Australian league that's full of upsets.\n\nThe H2H proves my earlier point. Looking at direct meetings, Western Sydney still match up well historically. In 34 previous league meetings between these two clubs, Victory have 16 wins to Wanderers’ 12, with **six draws**, showing this fixture’s competitive nature. Victory’s average of almost *2 goals per match* *against Western Sydney* is balanced by the fact that **Wanderers have secured draws in over 40% of H2H meetings** and I believe they're capable of even more today. Both teams have been involved in **matches with over 1.5 goals fairly frequently**, but draws and narrow margins remain common in A-League rivalry fixtures. All things considered, I'm taking the 0.0 AH here (also known as DNB, but with better odds on some books), just in case a draw does occur. If Melbourne weren't playing at home, I wouldn't even bother taking the DNB and would go straight to the Sydney Wanderers ML. If you want to take the BTTS and the over 2.5 goals route, I don't mind those either. BOL, let's get an early one out of the way and enjoy the weekend ☘️🫡\n\n☘️ Tip jar: [https://buymeacoffee.com/sigmabale](https://buymeacoffee.com/sigmabale)",

Victory are aggressive going forward at home but often concede chances, while the Wanderers attack with speed and intensity. Neither side is comfortable sitting back, which usually leads to an open game. With both teams capable of scoring multiple goals and defensive mistakes likely, this matchup strongly points toward over 3.5 goals.",

He is averaging 78 yards a game in his last 10 games. The last 7 games that he had 13+ carries he rushed for more than 72 yards in every game, averaging 83.3 yards in those games. He hasn’t had fewer than 12 carries all season & has had 13+ in 7 of his last 10. Including 23 in a meaningful game vs the Seahawks in Week 16, showing McVay trusts him. In Week 17 in a crucial game vs the Falcons which they were neck & neck with & ended up losing, Williams outsnapped Corum 13-6. The Rams have the best run blocking Offensive Line in the NFL. They average 2.0 yards before contact best in the NFL, with just a 13.2% run stuff rate (5th). The allowed the 7th most yards before contact this season at 2.36 & have given up 157.3 rushing yards in their last 3 games, 4th most in the NFL. Opposing RB’s are averaging 29.8 carries a game against the Panthers in their last 5 games (minus the Saints who are pass heavy & just not good). Books have his rush attempts line at 14.5. He’s over in 6/6 games this season with at least 14+ carries. The opposing leading back has cleared their rushing yards line in 9 of the last 10 games against Carolina. Carolina has gotten crushed by RB’s all year:\nIrving 62.5 -> 85, Charbonnet 38.5 -> 110, Irving 63.5 -> 71, Corum 34.5 -> 81, Kyren 64.5 -> 72, McCaffrey 68.5 -> 89, Bijan 74.5 -> 104, Kamara 37.5 -> 83\n\nWilliams has also been one of the best RBs in football on Zone concept runs. He averages 5.19 yard per carry, with a 63.7% success rate which ranks 1st among RBs with 50+ carries. He ranks #1 in rate of man gap run rate in the NFL, accounting for 48% of his rushing attempts. Against man gap runs Carolina is allowing 5.8 yards per carry (30th) & allowing a 1st down/TD on 35% of those carries. Carolina is also allowing 2.9 yards before contact on those runs, 31st in the NFL. Kyren is the #1 RB in the NFL in Run Success rate at 50.1%. The Panthers rank 27th in Rush EPA (-0.025) & have allowed the 6th most rushing TD’s (20). The Rams are #1 in EPA/Play (0.13) & points per drive (2.8), #1 in down conversion rate (78.8%), & #1 yards per play (6.2). Panthers defense allows a 74.9% conversion rate (26th), 2.3 points per drive (25th), & are 20th in defensive EPA (-0.03).\n\nThey played just earlier this season with the Panthers upsetting the Rams at home. Carolina had a pick 6, a deflected INT in their own end zone, & a strip sack with the Rams in game tying FG position. Those 3 plays resulted in a -16.1 EPA for the Rams, the most significant turnover swing for the Panthers in a game this season & the worst for the Rams this season. Those 3 plays were the difference in a 3 point game, and without that win the Panthers wouldn’t have been in the playoffs. Carolina had the ball for 35:16 of the clock, their largest time of possession this season. The Rams averaged 7.4 yards per play in that matchup (their 4th highest of the season).\nThe Rams only faced 5 third downs all game, had only 1 penalty, & scored a TD on 4 of their 5 possessions without a turnover. More importantly they had a 76% rushing success rate, averaging 0.53 EPA per rush, highest amount this year. They averaged 3.05 yards before contact. Kyren injured his ankle & left the game in the 1st half & only ran 13 times all game, & he still had 72 rushing yards.\n\nAlso McVay loves to feed Kyren come playoff time. He has even said publicly he has given Blake Corum the RB2 work this season to keep Kyren healthy for the playoffs. In last year’s playoffs, Kyren averaged 17.5 carries for 91 yards. In their elimination loss to the eventual Super Bowl Champion Eagles, Kyren ran for 106 yards on 19 carries, averaging 5.6 yards per carry. The Eagles last season had the 2nd best EPA run defense in the NFL (-0.194). McVay clearly trusts him.\n\nThere’s a 75% chance of rains with 15 mph winds & gusts up to 40 mph. Having had 3 turnovers last game vs the Panthers McVay is going to want to play it safe & run the ball. The Rams are favored by 10 points. Panthers lost 3 of their last 4 games & 4 of their last 6. The Rams rank #1 in offensive efficiency with the lowest offensive variance in the NFL, while having the #2 toughest schedule. 13 of their 17 games came were against teams with 8+ wins. Against non division playoff teams, Carolina is 2-5 with an avg score of 28-14. They scored 16 points or fewer in all but 1 of those games. All 5 losses came by double digits: 11, 16, 17, 29 & 31 - while averaging just 10.2 points per game. Meanwhile, the Rams already have 8 wins by 14+ points. \n\nThe Rams enter the playoffs as the league's highest scoring offense & have the 2nd highest point differential (+172). Carolina is 23rd in point differential (-69), & the only team in the postseason this year with a negative scoring margin. The only other teams to ever have a worse point differential and make the postseason were the 2004 Rams (-73), 2011 Broncos (-81), and 2010 Seahawks (-97). Carolina hasn’t won a game by more than 3 points since October & hasn’t won by more than 7 since September. The game will be Bryce Young's 1st playoff game & I'm not convinced he'll be able to keep up the Rams' league best offense. The Rams have scored the most points per game (30.5), are 1st in DVOA, & have the 2nd best Super Bowl odds. Since the Panthers upset vs the Rams they have averaged just 16 points in the final 4 games. The Rams averaged 36.8 points per game in their final 5 games. \n\nThe Rams have had the fewest penalties in the league every year since 2020. This year they have just 75, lowest in NFL. But they have benefited from opposing teams getting called 121 penalties, 5th most. That is a net of +46 penalties, most in the NFL. Clete Blakeman has been chosen as the head official for the game. Blakeman’s crew ranks #1 calling 3rd down defensive penalties & awarding automatic 1st downs. The Panthers surrender automatic 1st downs on 40% of 3rd downs. The Rams rank 30th at just 17%. The Rams rank 7th in the league as beneficiaries of automatic 1st downs. Interestingly, in games Blakeman’s crew has officiated, playoff home teams are just 4-9 ATS. The Panthers were penalized a record 12 times by Blakeman in their Super Bowl 50 loss to the Broncos. Carolina is just 1-6 SU / 2-5 ATS with Blakeman since then, including 0-2 SU & ATS as home underdogs. Also under Blakeman, favorites of more than a TD are 28-14 ATS (67%). This season, they are 5-0 ATS (100%).\n\nThe Rams will run it down their throats with a big lead & McVay is going to feed his RB1.\n\n__Kyren Williams o65.5 rushing yards__\n\nAppreciate the love!

Going to avoid player props for these cup games for a bit.\n\nAnother FA cup match today as Premier Lesgue side Chelsea will travel to take on Championship (2nd tier) division Charlton. Charlton are currently 19th place in the Championship, not too far from the relegation zone. Their matches tend to be low scoring as they do not concede a ton of goals. They also dont score many, averaging exactly 1 per game. \n\nChelsea will likely trot out a mostly 2nd team here to start, but they run a very deep sqaud. That 2nd team should be plenty to control this game. Many of their 2nd team have been playing in Champion's League matches, gotten sub time in the EPL, and played in the EFL cup matches late last year. This will also be their first game under their new manager, and many of these players are fighting for 1st team time. I expect them to show out. If all else fails, Chelsea will sub on their big names at halftime to secure the win. \n\nBOL and have a great weekend!",

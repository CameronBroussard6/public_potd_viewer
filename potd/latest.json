He decided to step up in the 4th Q with his scoring but that clearly doesn’t correlate to more dimes. On to the next.\n\nLA Clippers @ ORL Magic | 7PM EST\n\nNext Pick: **Franz Wager Over 23.5 Pts** (-108) Bet 2.5u to Win 2.31u\n\nGoing back to Franz here as the matchup looks favorable for him to bounce back from.  Last game he put up 18 pts on 7/17 shooting but that was against Draymond Green and the Warriors switching defense which really restricted his looks especially from deep. The Clippers don’t have perimeter stoppers with Kawhi and Derrick Jones both sidelined so Wagner’s volume should up tick here.\n\nBanchero (Magics leading scorer) also remains out of this match up. Expecting Franz to bounce back giving the circumstances. \n\nIf tailing, only risk what you can afford to lose. Best of luck family!",

The Bills are coming off an explosive offensive performance in their win over the Buccaneers where they put up 44 points. Josh Allen completely turned it around from his previous outing against the Dolphins and he ran for three touchdowns and threw for three touchdowns as well. When the Bills win, they typically win by at least a touchdown with 6 out of 7 of their wins coming by at least 7 points so I like them to cover this spread of -5.5 as they are playing the Texans who will be without CJ Stroud who is out with a concussion. The Texans are coming off a win against the leagues worst Tennessee Titans where they struggled to find any offensive rhythm and could not establish the run but they squeaked by with a walk off game winning field goal. I dont think this Texans offense led by Davis Mills will be able to keep up with this high powered Josh Allen led offense and the Texans get alot of talk about their strong defense but the Bills actually rank as the leagues highest pass defense only allowing 185 passing yards per game. I think the Bills will be able to establish the run game early with James Cook as they also have the leagues best rated run games as they average over 147 yards on the ground per contest and with Gabe Davis back in the lineup for Bills I think that opens up the pass game more for the Bills.\n\nPrediction: 31-20 Bills\n\nLast pick:🏈Notre Dame ML/Georgia ML💰Dawgs and the Irish dominated, love it.\n\nBest of luck to everyone tailing and remember to bet responsibly! If you have any questions or comments shoot me a DM I usually am able to respond to everyone on here!🍀💜🐉\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r0gkobucbc2g1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e401daf50f6b753554e4c2a038188af4849f358a",

He has really been hammering his role as a dual threat up and coming rookie despite his receptions varying from game to game. He's played 80% of the offensive snaps last week and have been climbing since week 4. Marks averages 19 receiving yards with 1.6 receptions per game.  He averages 12.2 Yards/Reception with 12.1 average YAC and his line sits at 1.5 receptions for this game, at very decent odds (-156) for the over which he's bound to clear. The Bills tend to give half that at 6.0 YAC, which would still allow decent yardage to Marks.\n\n While I'm sure Marks will have his time to shine rushing the ball, he will get his share of receptions. Woody Marks averages 34.8 rushing yards he averages 3.5 yards per carry, (2.3 yards average after contact) which is still low. His line sits as 15.5 rush attempts. Now the Bills come up with the 31st ranked rushing defense in the league giving up an average of 153 rushing yards a game, a glaring hole filled with injuries. It would be a bigger concern if Texans didn't have one of if not the worst O-line in the NFL currently. Last week Marks still only managed 44 yards in 18 carries against a pretty bad Titans defense.\n\n Bills are favored to win with a spread of 6.  The Bills have been looking much healthier recently and showing that they're contenders after some ugly losses to the Dolphins and Falcons. While still going against a tough opponent like the #1 defense Texans, the Bills could still easily get an early lead, causing the Texans to reduce their run game in favor of the passing. If Allen looks anything like he did against the Bucs, this will be cemented. One thing to note is that running backs get around 23% of the total receptions against the Bills this year. With their ranked second passing defense, it's easy to see why.  Bills give up just under 4 receptions on average per game to running backs at 3.89, on an average of 4.9 targets. Chubb has been taking less of a dual threat role with the Texans, leading to Woody getting more targets.\n\nDavis Millis has been averaging just under 39 pass attempts per game not counting the blowout vs Baltimore where he was put in at garbage time. He is expected to pass more when playing in more competitive games which he has been. There will be no difference in competition in this Thursday night game as there has been with the Titans, Jags, and Broncos.\n\nAll it will take is one or two good passes for Marks to hit the mark. I'm expecting another break out game for our Rookie!\n\nBOL Everyone Tailing!",

The Grizz game he had a terrible first half but still got over his points line with a strong second half. His usage is going to be through the roof, and on most possessions he will either be driving or passing to an open man. He is averaging over 6 apg this season, and without Wemby that number is higher. The Hawks also give up a large number of board to PGs, and with Fox being the #1 option I can see him getting to 5+ with some uncontested boards. Put all this together, a fast-paced, close, high-scoring game, with Fox being the clear #1 option, and I expect he’ll get over this line.\n\n \n\n*If you’ve enjoyed these picks, tips are always appreciated:* [Coffee Link](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/TheBrat)",

      "text": "POTD Record: 17-7 (+11.3U)\n\nLast Pick: UConn -5 (-120) (1U) 🙅‍♂️\n\n[UConn write up](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/s/qXC8P0BucI)\n\nNot one to make too many excuses but I’d beg to say that if Tarris Reed (20ppg, 9.8 rebounds per game, 2.7 blocks per game) doesn’t get ruled out 20 minutes before tip off that’s a different game. Nonetheless we have never lost two in a row before and that’s not gonna change!\n\nEvent: New Mexico vs Nebraska (6pm central)\n\nPOTD: Nebraska -7 (-125) (1U)\n\n-everything is bet to win unit amount-\n\nWrite up: \n\nNebraska -7 (-120) is a line that doesn’t capture the full gap between these two teams (yes I bought to -7 sue me yet again) The Huskers are averaging 89 points per game with a +22 scoring margin, while New Mexico sits at 75 points per game and a margin of just +11.5. Nebraska’s offense is built on both efficiency and volume: they rank inside the top 20 nationally in effective field goal percentage (59.4%) compared to New Mexico’s 50.2%, and they generate about three more field goal attempts per game. Add in the fact that Nebraska is shooting threes at a clip roughly 12% higher than the Lobos, and you’ve got a team that stretches defenses and consistently creates separation.\n\nTempo and possessions matter here too. Nebraska averages 74 possessions per game, while New Mexico is closer to 70, meaning the Huskers play faster without sacrificing efficiency. That extra pace, combined with superior shooting, translates into more scoring opportunities. On the glass, Nebraska pulls down 38.8 rebounds per game compared to New Mexico’s 36.0, with a stronger offensive rebounding rate (30.8% vs. 27.6%). Those second‑chance looks are a direct product of Nebraska’s size advantage — they can throw multiple 6’10+ bodies and even a 7‑footer at the rim, while New Mexico’s frontcourt depth doesn’t match that level of length or physicality.\nBall security is another separator. \n\nNebraska’s turnover rate sits at just 10.9%, one of the lowest in the country, while New Mexico turns it over at 14%. That’s the difference between a veteran team and one still finding its footing. Nebraska’s roster is loaded with experience — Rienk Mast (6’10”), Sam Hoiberg, and other upperclassmen who’ve been through Big Ten wars — and it shows in late‑game composure. Their comeback win over Oklahoma (a team that has some real offensive talent) was a perfect example: they stayed poised, turned defense into offense, and closed strong. New Mexico, on the other hand, is under a new coach and starting two freshman guards, which is a tough ask against Nebraska’s length on the perimeter and disciplined defense.\n\nSharing the ball is another area where Nebraska shines. They average 20.8 assists per game, compared to just 12.8 for New Mexico. That’s not just a stat — it reflects how Nebraska’s offense functions. They move the ball, find the open man, and generate high‑quality looks possession after possession. New Mexico’s offense is more stagnant, relying on individual creation, which is harder to sustain against a structured defense with size and veteran savvy.\n\nDefensively, Nebraska is imposing. They’re holding opponents to 41% shooting overall and under 30% from three. Nebraska’s size and length let them contest shots at the rim and close out on shooters, while their rebounding edge ensures opponents rarely get second chances. Combine that with their turnover discipline, and you get a team that controls both ends of the floor.\n\nWhen you put it all together — efficiency, pace, rebounding, turnovers, assists, veteran presence, defensive reliability, and a clear size advantage — Nebraska is simply the more polished and complete team. The market hanging -7 feels short when my power ratings make this closer to -9 Nebraska’s statistical profile screams separation, and against a youthful Lobos squad still adjusting under a new coach, the Huskers should cover comfortably. Let’s get back on track, as always, cheers 🍻\n\nUpdate: this line has moved from 6.5 from when I wrote it originally to now 8.5. If yall can get in at -8 I still like it as I believe Nebraska wins by 10+ or wait til possible buy back but just wanted to let yall know what was good",

PSG have looked horrible in the Champions League this season losing all 3 matches so far. They have been against good opponents but that’s what you expect in the Champions League. Bayern on the other hand, have looked really good in the Champions League after their first defeat to Barcelona. They are also coming off a really good 3-2 win against reigning champions Arsenal. Not much of a doubt in my mind that Bayern will find the back of the net at least once in this match.\n\nBarcelona have looked spectacular this season in domestic play and International. They sit top of the table in Spain with a near perfect 10W-0D-1L. They have scored 51 goals in those games and given up only 2! In the Champions League, Barca will go 2 points ahead of league leaders Lyon with a win tomorrow and are the only Champions League team without a loss or draw yet. Chelsea have been decent in the Champions League this season beating Paris FC and St. Polten, but showed signs of weakness in their 1-1 draw against FC Twente. Also, these teams met in the semi-final of this competition last year and Barcelona won both legs 4-1 for an aggregate scoreline of 8-2. I think this game will go similarly and Barcelona will take the 3 points and become league leaders in the Champions League.\n\nI think Barcelona is the best team in the Champions League and I think they will show why tomorrow. I really like adding the Bayern pick on as well, just for that boosted payout as long as they bag at least 1 goal. If Bayern score tomorrow, you’re essentially getting the Barcelona moneyline pick at -135 and I’ll take that for sure.\n\nI use Bovada for my picks, if you’re using something like Draftkings or Fanduel, you will definitely get worse odds on the Bayern pick but that’s why I like the pick so much for my book.\n\n\n\nBOL and God bless.",

      "text": "POTD Record: 8-1\n\nLast Pick: Denmark vs Scotland BTTS (-125) ✅\n\nFixture: Petersborough United vs Stockport County | England League One | 12:00pm PST Time\n\nPick: Stockport County vs Petersborough BTTS (-163)\n\nReasoning: League leaders Stockport County make their way to bottom of the table Peterborough United. As Peterborough is bottom of the table, a turn around for the better came around when new manager Luke Williams took charge. Since this, Petersborough has won 3 out of 3 matches under new management. The home side won their last fixture 5-0 against Wimbledon  & a 2-1 victory against Cardiff in the EFL Trophy.\n\n\nOn the other hand, Stockport has four wins in their last five matches netting a total of 8 goals. On their last league one match they suffered a 3-0 home defeat to Luton Town. The visitors are without a clean sheet in their last six matches, a run going back to 2008. On the bright side, Stockport has the best away record in League One. With this being said, I can see a huge bounce back from their recent loss. \n\nConcerningly for Peterborough regardless of their positive run, they have accumulated only seven points this season at home. The second lowest amount of points in the league, only one above Port Vale’s 6 points at home. Additionally, Petersborough only has one clean sheet at home this season. \n\nI can see this match easily resulting in both teams to score. Two teams fighting for two different things, avoiding regulation and promotion. With that being said, Petersboroughs impressive form and Stockports solid form this season will result in a head to head match with a lot of attacking opportunities for both sides.\n\nPs. If you want better odds, add the (+110) odds for Stockport County ML. I myself have a bet on this but wanted my POTD to be the safest option. \n\nCheers 🍻",

He’s been super steady all season nothing crazy, but he lives in that mid-teens range almost every game. The books basically set the line at his “bare minimum” effort. Even on his slower nights he’s still around 12–14, so you’re never really dead.\n\n\nAnd the way he scores is what makes the line look good. He’s not out there chucking threes or relying on tough jumpers. Most of his buckets come from the paint cuts, rolls, putbacks the easy stuff that doesn’t really get taken away no matter who they’re playing. It’s matchup-proof scoring.\n\n\nAs long as he gets his usual 28–32 minutes, he should naturally land somewhere in that 14–18 range. He doesn’t need a heater to get there. It’s one of those props where you don’t have to sweat every single shot.",

There haven't been a lot of bright spots for the Bills offense this season outside of Josh Allen willing his team down the field. Even then, his lack of weapons have even made the 2024 MVP show his fair share of struggles throughout the length of the season. This week will not be any easier for them coming off a short week, on the road and against one of the toughest defensive units in the league. This year the Bills have hit the under in 3/4 games and have averaged 24 points in those matchups.\n\nThe Texans are also a majorly struggling offense and nothing is expected to change against Buffalo. With CJ Stroud already ruled out for the game, Houston will be relying on the backup once again Davis Mills for their offensive production. The biggest weakness the Bills defense exposes to their opponents is their ability to stop the run but Houston hasn't been able to run the ball well all season and ranks bottom 10 in every major category. This season the Texans are 3-6-1 vs. the under and have hit the over in only 1/5 of their home games this season. The Texans defense only averages a total of 16 points per game and have a total combined average of 38 points this season. \n\nMy prediction for this game is Bills 20 Texans 16.\n\nTail or fade BOL to everyone and cheers! 🍻",

Since the usual world of football (soccer) and rugby is quiet, I thought I’d look again at the evil beast that is cricket. At the end of the day, good value is good value. \n\nThis one stands out more than people might expect. On paper, this looks like a tight matchup, but digging into form and bowler to batter matchups, the edge leans clearly toward the Sixers.\n\nFirst off, the Sixers have been the stronger side in recent meetings, taking the majority of the last several head-to-heads. Add to that the influence of big-game players who has been consistently impactful with both bat and ball, and you’ve got a team that shows up when it matters. Bowling-wise, the Sixers also hold the advantage and their bowling attack generally trend more reliable than what the Stars have produced so far. Case and point being their ability to bowl out the thunder in the last match for only 118 runs.\n\nMeanwhile, the Stars are heavily reliant on their star player Meg Lanning and her having a standout performance. And history shows that when a side needs one player to go big just to stay competitive, it’s always a red flag in a T20 matchup.\n\nThis is a spot where the Sixers should simply do the job. Better balance, more firepower, better recent form, home advantage and a stronger profile across the field. Confident backing them here and staking 2 units. \n\nIf you appreciate the picks, any tip for the time, and research is always appreciated:\nhttps://paypal.me/PaymePlease9937\n\nBOL to those tailing — see you on the other side and remember to gamble responsibly!\n\n🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡",

      "text": "__POTD Record:__ 54-27-1 (+57.35u)\n\n__Previous Pick:__ [❌ Illinois -3.5 (-110), 2.2u](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/s/Rn0NFBsnRy)\n\n__Event:__ NFL: Bills @ Texans 8:15pm EST\n\n__POTD:__ Nico Collins o5.5 receptions (-120), 3.6u to win 3u\n\n__Write Up:__ The Buffalo Bills (7-3) are traveling to Houston to take on the Houston Texans (5-5) in an AFC showdown on Thursday Night Football. Fresh off a 44 point performance in a home win vs the Bucs last week, the Bills are looking to catch up to the Patriots in the AFC East as they are 1.5 games back. The Texans are coming into this game having won 3 of their last 4 games, after starting the season 2-4. Texans starting QB CJ Stroud will now miss his 3rd straight game with a concussion. Backup QB Davis Mills has filled in for Stroud, & he’s surprisingly done really well. \n\nMills stepped in for Stroud & led the Texans to 2 straight wins vs inter divisional opponents. In the past Mills has been the typical game-managing backup QB, but Texans Offensive Coordinator & Playcaller Nick Caley is letting Mills air it out. __Mills has thrown the ball 41+ times & had 274+ yards & 1+ passing TD in both of his starts.__ Caley is in his first year with the Texans, having coached on offense in the past for both Bill Belichick & Sean McVay. He uses a lot of schemes from both coaches, with a blend of power running mixed with play-action, RPO’s, & quick passes. But the biggest strategy he has brought to this offense has been playing to the strengths of their personnel, just like he did with Sean McVay on the Rams. McVay’s offense created superstar WR’s over the years, with Cooper Kupp & Puka Nacua getting pretty much 75 targets a game. The Texans coaches said a few weeks ago that they want to get Collins the ball more. They designed a game plan to make Collins the heart of the offense. Then when backup QB Mills came in, they told him to just get the ball to Nico, & he did. In the 3 games Mills has played, he has targeted star WR Nico Collins an insane amount. __Nico has seen an increase of almost 10% 1st read share with Mills at QB. Collins has an incredible 36 targets over the last 3 games. He’s seen a target share of 28.2%. He’s had 7+ receptions in each of the past 3 weeks. Collins has had 10+ targets in 4 straight games. His targets over those games: 10, 15, 11, & 10. Without CJ Stroud this year Collins has 3 straight games of 75+ receiving yards (75, 136, 92). With CJ Stroud he's only had 2 games over with 75+ yards.__ Collins has been used a ton more in the slot lately, leading to a higher volume of targets & much better production. __In the last 2 games, he's been targeted 7 times from the slot, that’s more than he had in his first 7 games combined.__ In the past 2 weeks with Mills, Nico has been his go to target in critical situations. He’s found a way to sling the ball in Nico’s direction pretty much every time. Nico has also been a red zone target monster this season. __Collins is 6th in the NFL in red zone targets this year (14).__ Now he’ll face a Bills team that has been particularly weak to opposing offense’s WR1’s. __Buffalo has allowed an average of 6 receptions (4th most in NFL) & 86.9 yards per game (most in NFL) to WR1’s this season.__ To keep up with this high powered Bills offense, the Texans are going to have to find ways to get it into their best playmakers hands. Mills is going to continue to target him a ton.\n\nOn the other side we have one of the best offenses in the NFL. Led by reigning NFL MVP Josh Allen, the Bills come into this one averaging 29.2 points per game (4th in the NFL). They average 6.2 yards per play (2nd in the NFL). With the Bills favored by 6 points, the Texans are going to have to air it out to keep up. Mills has thrown it 41+ times in both starts & that was in games he won. In a game that they are expected to trail, he’s going to sling it. And the beneficiary of that is Nico. Nico is going to put up numbers, but I feel more comfortable with the reception line than yards.\n\n__Nico Collins o5.5 receptions__\n\nAppreciate the love!

Now after watching her match vs Vergara Rivera, I feel confident to back her at this price vs Jeanjean.\n\nWe really got to see a glimpse of 2021 Pigossi in her 6-1/6-1 domination of AVR. She was *blasting* her forehand and painting lines I could swear I watched 20+ winners. Only landing a rusty 42% of first serves but they were solid serves winning 83%. Probably the craziest stat of the match is AVR was able to land a *very* high 74% of first serves… the only problem for her was Locked In Laura on the other side of the net sending back *72%* of those FS’s as her own point. It was a returning masterclass as she also won 73% of second serves on return. I think Pigossi is really gonna try to make a run here in the Colina altitude.\n\nPigossi and Jeanjean have actually met 4 times already. JJ won all 3 of the hard court encounters while Pigossi was able to beat her on clay (same surface as today’s meeting) @ Buenos Aires 3 years ago.\n\nJeanjean is *not* impressive. Shes at best a top 75 player but at 30 years old she’s likely to plateau at the T100 mark. One things for sure tomorrow, she should *not* be a -185 favourite in this spot tomorrow. I’m not convinced she’s back. She was playing consistent tournaments until the USO (Aug,25 R1 loss to Hon {semi-lol}) and then two weeks later São Paulo (another R1 loss to Tjen{valid}). Then two weeks later shes all the way in China losing *yet another* round one. This time to Lepchenko {big lol}. She demotes herself to entering a challenger while she’s in China to only get one win (vs Inglis who was a lucky loser LOL) and then bounced in R2. She tries one more in China and it’s a big one; Guanzhou. *Take a guess what happened*… yup, ANOTHER R1 loss to Seidel (valid).\nTo summarize Jeanjean across the last 3 months: \n6 tournaments \n2 Wins 4 losses\n*all played on hard court*\nNow she’s made a successful first match transition to clay in Colina beating Riera who’s been decent recently. \nStill, ALL things considered, nothing warrants Leolia Jeanjean being a -185 favourite over Pigossi in this spot. \nPigossi is playable all the way up until +110.\nTell me who you know confidently put a 8 win streak and 9-1 overall record on the line with a +142 ML? Thats why they NVS🌟 I’ll see you all at the cashier in 16 hours. \n\nIf I made you money this wild run and want to tip since I can’t promo my socials🍀: [BMAC☕️](https://buymeacoffee.com/nvsbets) | [BTC](https://pastebin.com/0Lf0mHqu) | [ETH](https://pastebin.com/D2QRi3Bx)",

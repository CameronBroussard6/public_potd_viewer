EDG blew them out 2-0 and it wasn’t close. \n\nToday: China | LPL | 4am & 6am Eastern | Ninjas in Pyjamas vs Thundertalk Gaming + JD Gaming vs TOP Esports | NIP -1.5 + JD Gaming ML 3U @ +114\n\nTonight NIP plays possibly the worst team in the LPL. I don’t see this series being close, with NIP closing these games out rather easily. \n\nJDG I believe are a top 3 team and TES are no pushovers, but JDG has already beaten them once this year and I see them doing it again. I don’t trust them to take the series 2-0 but I don’t see them losing overall. \n\n\n\nBOL if tailing ",

Skating on their home ice in Milan they are going to be coming out hot. They face a South Korean team who was dominated by Sweden the day before, so I expect Italy win decisively. ",

While Erzurumspor are doing great in their league, they got beat pretty hard (1-3) by Kocaelispor in this exact cup, showing they still struggle with the top tier sides. Although Fenerbahce can choose to rotate some here, they still have good depth that should be enough for some goals in this one.",

Atalanta beat Parma 4-0 last home game, but also in the last five, they drew against Pisa who are in the relegation zone, lost both Champions League games that they were also favourites in and were massively lucky to get away with a 0-0 draw against Como on Sunday. \n\nJuventus has much the same story as Atalanta, as they also have gotten a whole lot better after sacking their manager. I will say that they are somewhat reliant on Kenan Yildiz to score and create chances, he is pretty clearly their best player at the moment and there is maybe some concern that he will not play this game. \n\nI don’t expect fireworks from this game, but for my money I believe Juventus has enough about them to see this game through in normal time with a 1-0 win.  ",

Bet 2u\n\nWriteup: First thing to note here is the price of the bet has been moving like crazy since Monday. I got this originally at +125, and has since moved anywhere from +105 to -130. Do a little shopping around to try to get the best value.\n\nI’ll also note that Kim has anywhere from the 3rd-5th best odds to win this entire event, and yet he is still listed as a plus money play in some books just to make top 20. Let’s capitalize on this.\n\nThe Waste Management Open is known for its fairly easier greens, making tee-to-green and strokes gained metrics very important if you want to come out on top in this tournament. Kim is currently 5th overall in tee-to-green metrics over the last 5 events this season, and is 4th in strokes gained. He is also leading in strokes gained specifically in his approach shots. Recently, Kim came tied for 2nd at the Farmers Insurance Open and tied for 6th at the American Express. In this tournament specially, he placed tied for 21st in 2025 and tied for 12th in 2024. I expect the winning score to be around -18, and with Kim having a Greens In Regulation of 75%, along with his fantastic ball striking with his iron play, I expect him to have a lot of birdie opportunities to keep climbing up the leaderboards. Kim has been a bit varied in his putting, but has recently earned 1.2 strokes gained from his putting over the last 5 events. \n\nI will be willing to say Kim will have some of the most birdie opportunities this entire tournament, the question will be if he can convert. Even if he is average in his conversion rate, his iron game and metrics in this area have been so good that he should be able to finish in the top 20 by the end of Sunday. A plus money play makes it even better.\n\nRemember to only bet what you can afford to lose, and BOL!",

They want to drag games out, farm up Ame, and stall until they hit their timings. The problem is that Tundra doesn't let you do that. Tundra plays a suffocating, objective based style that chokes out the map early. They don't just kill you, they take away your map so you can't drag out the game.\n\nTundra also defeated XG back in the last BLAST slam using this exact same style. XG might be able to drag games out against other teams, but Tundra is too disciplined to let them get comfortable. XG is good, but Tundra is just a bad matchup for them play style wise. \n\n[Other picks.](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/s/kxxwxldBZ1)\n\n​BOL.\n\nhttps://buymeacoffee.com/222benz",

Over 4 in both first quarters.**\n\n**---**\n\nThe Saudi Pro League hasn't failed us so far considering we've only touched the 2 best teams being Al Hilal and AL Nassr. The title race between these sides just brews heavy sided stats that fall in our favour.\n\nAl Nassr have closed the gap over these past weeks, With Hilal now drawing 3 straight games anything less than 3 points tomorrow is confirmed capitulation. Al Hilal dominate the ball and give their opponents little to feed off out of possession. Considering Goal difference has been overlapped, 1 goal wont dwindle corner chances tmr.\n\n**---**\n\n* **Al Hilal** Average 6.7 Corners per game in the SPL\n* In Al Hilal's last 8 away games they've covered this line 7/8 with an average of 8.25 Corners Per Away game.\n* In Al Hilal's last 10 games they've covered this line 7/10.\n\n**---**\n\n* **Al Okhdood** are joint second for most corners conceded in the SPL at 6.2 Per game.\n* Al Okhdood are coming off 3 straight games conceding over 7 corners ( 7, 12, 10 corners) \n* Al Okhdood have played 7 games against the top 6 this season and this line has covered in 5/7 with an average of 7.7 Corners conceded PG\n* Again, they have conceded Over 6.5 corners in both matchups against Al Hilal this season\n\n**---**\n\n**BOL!**",

He is playing against Fils who have not played a lot this year and have been out for some months. The match is being played on indoor hardcourt and should support a close match. In fact Fils has only played 1 match against Royer, which was a close 3 set match and the latest match before that was back in October.\n\nI believe Ugo's great shape and matches indoors support him and Fils is in my opinion favored too big in this match up. Fils is the better player overall but as his current form is questionable, we need to play Ugo with +4,5 games.\n\nI see a good value in this bet and good luck!\n\n\\_\n\nIf you follow my bets, I would appreciate a little tip - I spend a lot of time analyzing the bets day to day.

After comfortably hitting the Racing pick yesterday, we’re staying in the Reserve League (Proyección) because the books still haven't adjusted to the massive gap between these squads.\n\n* **River Plate (Home):** \"La Maquinita\" is a powerhouse. Their academy is world-class, and at home, they play with a level of intensity and technical superiority that mid-table teams just can't handle. They are coming in with great rhythm.\n\n* **The Fade (Talleres):** Talleres’ reserve side is in a complete freefall. They’ve managed to win only 1 of their last 10 matches, losing 6 of them. But here is the kicker: **they haven’t won an away game in 7 months.** * **The Play:** I’m bumping this up to 3 units. River is superior in every single department, and Talleres’ psychological barrier when playing away from home is too big to ignore. 1.62 is a gift for a mismatch of this caliber.\n\n\nBOL!!!\n---\n\n\n*Tips are never expected but always appreciated if we keep the green coming!* ☕\n\n[buymeacoffee.com/Francocarde123](http://buymeacoffee.com/Francocarde123)",

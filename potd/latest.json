I will be at this game as Kennesaw St is my Alma Mater & I live closeby, although I’ve been a lifelong Georgia Tech fan. This is the last week we get Tuesday & Wednesday football action so I figured I’d fire up a post. Tuesday we have UTEP (2-5, 1-2 CUSA) traveling to Kennesaw to take on the Owls (5-2, 3-0 CUSA). __KSU is coming off a 45-26 road win over FIU, extending their 5 game win streak.__ They are 1st in the conference right now & are coming in hot. Let’s take a look at their last 5 games including each teams Sagarin rating (my most trusted analytical CFB & CBB rankings I’ve used for years). Starting with the most recent game: \n\nKSU Sag rating #107:\n\nW21 @ FIU - #149\n\nW28 vs LA Tech - #103\n\nW8 vs MTSU - #171\n\nW7 vs Ark St - #108\n\nW14 vs Merrimack - #225\n\nKSU had dominant 20+ point wins in their last 2 games. LA Tech is a good team who is Sag ranked 45 spots better than UTEP at #103. FIU is ranked #149 which is right next to UTEP who is ranked #148. __Let’s take a look at UTEP’s schedule, who has lost 4 of their last 5 games:__\n\nUTEP: #148\n\nW18 @ Sam Houston - #207\n\nL11 vs Liberty - #120\n\nL19 vs LA Tech - #103\n\nL6 LA Monroe - #160 \n\nL17 Texas - #9\n\nUTEP’s only win came against an 0-7 Sam Houston. __But the biggest takeaway is UTEP lost by 19 to LA Tech. Kennesaw State beat that same LA Tech team by 28 the very next week. Sagarin’s analytical predictions has KSU winning this one 33-16.__ Having said all that, rankings aren’t everything. I just wanted to give background on these 2 basically unknown teams. Let’s get into it.\n\n*More writeup incoming*\n\n__Kennesaw State -9.5__\n\nAppreciate the love!

      "text": "Record: 14-7\n\nLast Five Predictions (Old - New): ✅❌✅✅❌\n\nNet Units: +19.88\n\nYesterday's Pick: Moreirense v Porto. Porto (-1.0 &-1.5) Asian Handicap. 3u @ $1.54 ❌ /✅ \n\nLost half the initial stake as the first bet (-1) pushed, and the other (-1.5) lost. Unsure exactly how to write that on the ledger, but counting it as a loss because I walked away with less money than I put in. \n\nPorto dominated possession but didn't create that many chances from it. Moreirense scored within 20 minutes, which wasn't ideal. Porto equalised just before halftime. \n\nIn the second half, Porto dominated again, but didn't get the winner until the 88th minute. From there, it was unlikely they'd push the issue for a third. \n\nToday's Pick: Thun v Winterthur. Thun (-1.0 &-1.5) Asian Handicap. 3u @ $1.87\n\nPick: Going with the Asian Hanidap again on Thun. \n\nNewly promoted, but currently in first place, Thun hosts last-place Winterthur in the Swiss Super League. \n\nThe Swiss Super League has started tight, with every team losing at least two of their opening ten games. Thun's two losses so far have been to Young Boys and Basel, who are two of the best teams in the league. \n\nThun's two goals a game is the second-best in the league, and their 1.3 goals against are the third-best in the league. \n\nWhile I don't expect them to win the league in their first season back in the top flight, they've looked good so far. \n\nMeanwhile, Winterthur are 0-1-4 in their five away games in the league, copping seventeen goals in those games. In fact, in Winterthur's ten league games, they've conceded 30 goals, which is the worst in the league by 11 goals.\n\nI like Thun at home in this match. ",

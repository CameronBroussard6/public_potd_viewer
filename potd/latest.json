CST\n\nWas debating on posting this for tomorrow  but they scheduled Sinner in they early matches for today so here we are.\n\nIf it aint broke don't fix it. I tried changing the title of the pick here a little, but this is no different than my pick for rounds 1 and 2 of the Aussie Open. Taking Sinner to easily handle Spizzirri here in the third round. Sinner has barely broken a sweat here heading into R3 and similar to last write up, will be putting pressure on every single one of his opponents service games. There is no pressure on the American in this match so we will likely see him throw everything he has at Sinner, but time after time, this is no match for Jannik Sinner and I don't expect anything different here.\n\n[PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/micahpugh?locale.x=en_US)\n\n[Venmo](https://venmo.com/u/Micah-Pugh)",

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 0-1 | Net Units: -2\n\n*Bit of a let down with the Chelsea -2.5 pick, they absolutely could have got it done but just couldn’t get goals in despite having over 20 goals shot at goal, into the next pick*\n\n**Sport:** Soccer | League: France - Ligue 1 \n\n**Event Time:** 6 hours from post.\n\n**Match:** Auxerre VS PSG\n\n**Pick:** PSG to Win to Nil @ $2.15 (1 Unit)\n\n**Write Up:** \n\nAlright legends, let’s get stuck into this one. PSG is coming off a bit of a nightmare in Portugal after losing to Sporting in the Champions League, and usually, when the Parisians get their ego bruised, someone in Ligue 1 is about to have a very bad Friday night. They’re heading to Auxerre, and while the PSG medical room is currently busier than a pub on a Friday afternoon with Hakimi, Mendes, and Neves all sidelined the depth they have is still lightyears ahead of what Auxerre is working with.\n\nI’m looking at the \"Win to Nil\" here because Auxerre’s attack has been about as threatening as a wet paper towel lately. They’ve managed a measly 14 goals across 18 matches this season, and their finishing has been statistically rated as \"Very Weak\" by basically everyone watching. Even with a slightly rotated backline, PSG still has guys like Zabarnyi and Marquinhos to hold the fort, and with Vitinha sitting in the middle hogging the ball like it’s his personal property, Auxerre is going to struggle to even get a sniff of the goal.\n\nLuis Enrique doesn't exactly do relaxed after a loss, so I expect him to have them drilled to keep a clean sheet and just suffocate this game from the jump. PSG won the reverse fixture 2-0 without breaking a sweat, and Auxerre is currently stuck in a three-match losing skid where they can barely find the back of the net. Getting $2.15 for a professional shut out against a team that couldn't hit the side of a barn is the kind of value that makes the early morning kickoff worth it. Let’s get it.",

Today we have the Capitals coming to Calgary to play the Flames. The Flames have Devin Cooley in net who is having a great season after a pretty bad one with the Sharks in his rookie year. He is also playing particularly even better than his season stats in these past few games. This season, Devin Cooley has a save percentage of .922 which is just amazing, and he also has just a 2.18 goals against average. For the Capitals, Vézina contender Logan Thompson is having another great season with pretty much identical stats to last season. Logan Thompson has a .913 save percentage and a 2.43 goals against average this season. Although the Capitals are trending over recently, they are still a pretty average scoring team, ranking 13th in goals this season, and have to face Devin Cooley who is playing out of his mind. On the other side the Flames are just terrible at scoring, they’ve traded some good players away as they are sort of building towards a rebuild/retool now, they’ve traded rank 31st in goals this season. With ranking so low in goals it’ll be hard for them to score against an experienced Logan Thompson who has been consistently good a couple years in a row.\n\nTake The Under 6.5 Goals!",

The main pick hit along with the side bets of O2.5, BTTS, Midtjylland/Draw BTTS and Midtjylland/Draw O2.5. Only lost the Midtjylland straight win because of a penalty at min 90+10.\n\nNow for today..\n\nPick: Inter vs Pisa - Inter O 0.5 cards and Pisa O1.5 corners @ 1.96 odds\n\nWrite Up: Another bet based on the notepad stats guy.\n\nInter has gotten a card in their last 19 out of 20 matches and the ref averages 5.12 cards per game and Inter averages 1.6 cards per match.\n\nPisa has gotten O1.5 corners in their last 18 out of 20 matches and averages 4 corners per game. Recent Pisa corner stats against good teams: 10 corners against Atalanta, 2 against Juventus, 4 against Inter, 2 against Milan, 3 against Napoli, 1 against Roma.\n\nOf course this might be a game where Inter just cleanly wins without getting a card or conceding a corner, but the stats suggest otherwise and Seria A is chaotic.\n\nI’m obviously also adding Inter win for 2.4 but POTD only allows two picks in a parlay.\n\nBOL",

Neither side has been able to fully control games, often mixing solid periods with costly defensive mistakes. Their recent head-to-head meetings have usually been tight, and this looks set to follow the same pattern. Elche are pushing to keep their slim European hopes alive, sitting eighth in La Liga, eight points behind sixth-placed Real Betis. Levante, meanwhile, are under real pressure near the bottom, placed 19th and six points adrift of safety. With both teams fighting for different reasons, this should be a closely contested game.\n\nLevante head into this game after a 2-0 defeat away to Real Madrid, part of a tough run against strong opposition. Before that, they showed some resilience with a 1-1 home draw against Espanyol, a result that reflects their season so far. At home, Levante have struggled badly to turn good moments into results. They are winless in their last four league matches at their own stadium, including draws with Espanyol and Real Sociedad. In fact, Levante have the worst home record in La Liga this season, picking up just three points from eight matches and conceding 18 goals.\n\nElche come into this match after a 2-2 draw with Sevilla, a result that showed both their competitiveness and their defensive issues. That followed another draw away at Valencia, meaning they’ve picked up back-to-back stalemates against strong opponents. Across their last five matches, Elche have scored in four, but they’ve also conceded in four, often struggling to hold leads or see games out comfortably.\n\nAway from home, their form remains a concern with four losses and a draw, although the Valencia result hinted at better organisation. The win over Rayo Vallecano before Christmas looks more like a one-off than a true shift in form, leaving Elche as a side that can score but remains vulnerable defensively.\n\nLevante have scored in 4 of their last 6 home matches, with BTTS landing in 4 of those games as well. Looking at a wider sample, BTTS has occurred in 6 of their last 10 home fixtures. Elche show a similar trend away from home. They’ve found the net in 5 of their last 6 away matches, with BTTS hitting in 4 of those. Zooming out, 7 of their last 10 away games have also seen both teams score.\n\nBoth teams have enough quality to score in this match. Levante and Elche have shown they can be fairly reliable in front of goal, but both are also vulnerable defensively. Levante have conceded in four of their last five league games, while Elche have scored in four of their last five overall. Neither side has shown the consistency needed to keep clean sheets for a full ninety minutes.\n\nElche are having the stronger season overall, but they are still searching for their first away win in the league. Levante, meanwhile, have one of the weakest home records this term. With both sides struggling to turn performances into wins, this matchup looks well set for a draw, with goals at both ends.\n\n**NOTE: Please only stake what you can afford to lose; know that no picks are 100% guaranteed to hit. Stake Responsibly.**",

Fukuoka likes to push in transition, Nara can score in bursts, and neither has a lockdown defense, so even with averages being modest, this game has blowout potential and scoring runs that could push it past 153.5. Plus, the sharp money moving the line up hints that some bettors see the scoring going higher than expected. **P.S note --> I also always recommend to take a better line live ( like let's say the game starts slow and you catch the line at over 148,5 or smth)**\n\n**EDIT : game ended with 150 points. we sadly didn't make it, but i haven't lost anything since i picked the live over 143,5 (and i recommend you whenever you can to wait the live game if you dont feel it)**",

I expect Brisbane to win quite handily if they play their main team.

I went with the game spread as opposed to the ML as Rublev has a bigger serve than Cerundolo and it gives us a small margin to still cover if Cerundolo wins the match. \n\nThat being said I love Rublev here. Rublev is 1-3 against Cerundolo but this match will be a best of 5 and will be at a major. Rublev is known for his tendency to lose against superior players in quarterfinals, but he has been very consistent in beating lesser opponents earlier in majors. \nRublev has started off 2026 well and looked fantastic in his 1st round match. I think Rublev is back to his old self after a rough 2025.",

Lakers vs Celtics, Yankees vs Red Sox, El Classico in La Liga. For Korean League of Legends, they have the Telecom War, aka KT Rolster vs T1.\n\nThe Telecom War came to its greatest and most important matchup during last year's Worlds Final, concluding in an epic five game series with the championship decided on the last game. These were the two best performing teams of 2025 during its biggest international event and they both put on a show.\n\nComing into 2026, KT have not had the best start. After a tough 2-1 victory in their first match, they then fell 0-2 in the next series to end Week 1 with 1-1 in matches. Their offseason acquisitions have not been the greatest either, but one can argue that they are now a bit more stable without the tremendous ups and downs the team is known for historically.\n\nT1 on the other hand bring in a rising star in Peyz. He is young, has an insanely high ceiling for improvement and is battle-tested on the biggest stage. Their roster is marginally improved by this, but their teamwork has suffered after losing one of the team's cornerstones in Gumayusi. They are 2-0 in matches but have played all six possible games, having lost a game in every match they've played thus far. They are still working out things, but they will be scarier in the latter half of the year.\n\nBoth teams have slow paced tendencies. T1's average game duration is 31:08 whilst KT's is 30:58. This is especially true for Game 1 as T1 average 33:05 and KT 31:20 during the season so far. Aside from the stats, the key matchup here will be the botlane. If T1 can get their botlane ahead, they can snowball hard. But the strength of KT has been their Mid+JG duo, providing assistance across the map and deterring early aggression.\n\nKT will neutralise the game and keep it close. They play through Bdd in the midlane to create priority for early game objectives. T1 are a methodical team, they play for objective timers and won't force unless they are eons ahead. I predict the first game will come down to the later stages of the game, which helps prolong the map duration. Finally, KT will have pick priority during Map 1. They can dictate the draft and play their strong champions, much like what FearX did yesterday.\n\nTelecom Wars are always competitive, the diehard fans of both sides spur the players and they'll deliver when they need to. Both teams will take it slow, not allow the game to run away quick and decide the game during neutral objective teamfights.\n\n**Map 1 - Over or Exactly 30:30 Map Duration 2-Way (1.83) 2u to win 1.66u**",

DO NOT PLACE THIS BET if you do not like the fact that you might lose money if you cash it out or you can wait tomorrow and take it when Cades confirmed**\n\nI usually hate doing things like cashing out but this one is for a good reason. Currently the Rockets are slaving Kevin Durant and working him to the bone. He is averaging around 37 minutes a game which is insane to me considering how old this man is. \n\nSo looking at his schedule starting his home game stretch was Bulls 28 points and 40 minutes, then OKC number 1 defence 37 minutes and 19 points, back to back Minnesota Wolves 40 minutes and 39 points, Pelicans 36 minutes and 18 points, Spurs 39 minutes and 18 points. \n\nFatigue is clearly affecting this man at 37 years of age. These are intense minutes, players such as Steph, Leonard, Harden all have special rotations to ensure that they will not be too tired. Kevin Durant has also looked tired against certain teams like the Pelicans missing normal mid range shots and missing an alley opp uncontested. \n\nThis Rockets squad has also been very very off unsure if its because Sengun is injured and coming back due to how poorly they have been performing but the offence has been extremely isolation based and wasting shot clock time, furthermore the three point shooting is very bad obviously Tari Eason could help, as well as Jabari Smith Jr ending his three point drought, but this pistons squad is number 2 on defence. \n\nI'm backing Pistons because to be honest they are a very good defensive team, and I love this team because they are dogs imo and hustle. A beaten up and currently confused Rockets squad should be easy work for the Pistons. A legacy game from either Reed or KD is my concern but I'm unsure how likely that will be with how sloppy they are right now against the 76ers and a back to back doesn't help them.\n\nOh a concern to help judge whether you want to risk this is Cade Cunningham has been horrible in his last three games back from injury.\n\nOh also this is now a back to back for the Rockets with a overtime to the 76ers now lmfao if Cade Cunningham plays as long as he does well to assist should be light work.",

Typically bottom table matches don't scream goals, but plus money for over 2.5 goals was too juicy to pass up for two horribly defenses. Both of these teams will want (and expect) a win here, and while neither team typically scores a lot I see this being an open match where both teams try for goals against equally bad defenses. Really a classic match where a stoppage force meets a moveable object, and we're backing the stoppable force. \n\nI like this for a few reasons. The first being team form. St Pauli has scored in 6 of their last 7 matches, including against some tough defenses, and scored 2 goals in 3 of those 6. Hamburg have also scored in 5 of their last 6. Additionally, the reverse fixture ended 2-0 to St Pauli, which was one of their 3 wins this season. They'll want to show out and take this match as well at home, so I'm expecting a high press and attacking style match. \n\nBOL and happy Friday!",

The highlight of his young career was certainly last year's US Open, where he qualified without dropping a set and made it to the Round of 16 in the main draw before finally running into a wall in Alex De Minaur. However, he's also been performing decently to start 2026, as he won a round against Choinski in AO qualifying and has looked good through two matches here in Oeiras. I will say that Piros has also performed quite well in his opening two matches, as he has actually earned slightly higher performance ratings than Riedi. However, the recent market pricing of these two players makes me think that they're not quite on the same level. Riedi was a bigger favorite than this against Henrique Rocha, a home player who I see on a similar level to Piros, while Piros's odds against Yevseyev put him in the same tier as Liam Broady. Of course, Broady has plenty of experience in these conditions, but he's another player without the recent form or weaponry of Riedi. I expect Riedi's serve and forehand to be the best shots on the court here, which is always something I'm looking for. In addition, concerns about his health are mitigated by the indoor conditions, which tend to be lower-impact on the body, and I'm not too worried about his ability to go 3 sets here. I know odds have already moved on some books, but I would take this up to around -160.",

That was posted over in the soccer thread. But the streak is sadly over nevertheless.\n\nTime to start a new winstreak and I have the perfect play for it. Buckle up, this is a good one.\n\n**Write Up:**\n\nMidweek matches are over. It is time for the weekend and that means league football. When I noticed this one I loved it right away!\n\nAuxerre are 9-0 if you take +1.5 in their home matches.

Their defensive block is solid.\n\nPSG away with the +1.5 line taken into account have a 2-7 record in away games. Close away games with some draws and losses and a 5-2-2 record. Their 18-11 goal record in 9 games seems decent but 1 game had 6 goals. 8 games with a 12-8 goalscoring record is not as impressive anymore.\n\nNow look at this insane H2H record.\n\n**If you give Auxerre the +1.5 they win 18-0 H2H in home games since 1999.**\n\nThis makes me extremely confident.\n\nThe only blip is the earlier game this year which ended 2-0 for PSG.

Let’s start streaking again tonight 🤝\n\nSaint Thomas is one of the most efficient offenses in the entire country. They’re shooting 50% from the field (16th Nationally) and an INSANE 63% from 2-point range (2nd Nationally) They’re also averaging 81 PPG! \n\nWhile their offense is ELITE, the tradeoff is on defense, allowing 75 PPG and opponents to shoot 46% from the field (240th Nationally) While they have ability to score at will, they also give up clean looks consistently. \n\nSD State is also more than capable, averaging 76 PPG and shooting 44% from the field. They all leak defensively, allowing 73.8 PPG. While their opponent FG % is slightly better, allowing 43.4% it still feeds into an environment where efficient offenses can score without much resistance! \n\nOne of the strongest indicators is the Conference trend. Through a combined 10 Summit League games between these 2 teams this season, both are 4-1 ATS to the over against the total! They’re not grinding down games or winning with defense lol. They both score well, allow points AND consistently play into high scoring outcomes. \n\nWith insane scoring from St Thomas, reliable shooting from SD State, and 2 struggling defenses, this game should be a back and forth. Everything to me points to the over tonight! \n\nBOL TO ALL TAILING 🍀",

PerfecT is averaging 1.6 kills per map so far this split in 5 maps played. He is tied with Casting for the least kills of any top lane in the league but has a higher winrate. Casting has a 0/5 hit rate on this line so far this split.\n* Last split, PerfecT averaged the least kills of any top layer in Summer with 2 kills per game on average\n* T1 are -400 favorites at open, expecting them to take this series as the much better/stronger team. Perfect has struggled against T1 in 2025 throughout the year, with a 15/18 under hit rate against T1 h2h across the entire year. The three games he hit were all map wins. PerfecT is averaging only 2 kills per map against Doran in the head to head matchup\n* In 56 map losses last year, Perfect only went O 3.5 kills in 4/56 map losses for a 7% cover rate with most of them coming in early 2025. Perfect has missed this line in his last 26 map losses last going over on August 1st. Perfect had a 0/12 hit rate against T1 in map losses in 2025\n* Despite this writeup mostly going off a T1 win, this pick still has major. equity in a map win. In 72 map wins last split, PerfecT only went over in 28/72 maps won last split or \\~39% of map wins meaning even in map wins there is plenty of chance this line misses. Especially with the decrease in top lane KP% and kills on top lane being way down this split so far\n\n**Leave>Ryan3 Map 1 Kills (-250)**\n\n* I don't like to be hyperbolic, but Ryan3 might actually be the worst ADC player I have ever seen in my many years of watching League of Legends. ThunderTalk as a whole just look awful as a team, they have been completely unproductive, they sit around and let teams do whatever they want against them and they almost always lose out because of the lack of talent on their roster\n* We watched this exact same matchup yesterday (less then 24 hours ago). EDG won 2-0 in a very one sided series, Leave covered in both series and was dominant in both lanes with little trouble and was completely comfortable in both games.\n* So far in LPL, Leave is averaging 2.9 kills in 6 maps played so far, he is due for a lot of positive regression on this number as his kills have been getting stolen like crazy in map wins and still early in the split. Looking at Demacia Cup numbers, Leave played 14 maps overall, he averaged 5.57 kills per map at Demacia Cup with a 31.2% kill share for his team\n* Ryan3 is averaging the least kills of any ADC in the LPL at 1.8 kills per game. He also has the lowest DMG% of any ADC at 21.8% which is insanely low for an ADC and over 2% lower from the next worst ADC. He also has the least gold share %, and lowest damage per minute.\n* Leave is averaging +767 gold at 15 minutes despite a negative win rate right now in LPL. Ryan3 is averaging a -751 gold at 15 minutes in LPL. We just watched this play out twice yesterday, see no reason why today's result will be any different",

For me, the line is way too wide for this match which is why I’m happy to take it even though I’m expecting a straight set victory for Carlos. Moutet has gone from being a universally hated clown to somewhat of a fan favourite thanks to his playing style despite his antics (though are less recurring nowadays). I personally find that the magician has the best touch on tour. There, I said it fight me for it. He’s become a lot more consistent as well since last year, climbing up to his current rank of No. 37. He claimed his first top ten wins last year over Rune and Fritz and in general is a nuisance to play no matter the opponent. The boy covers the court like his life depends on it, will throw all sorts of different patterns of play and has every shot in his locker to make sure the opponent has to hit one more ball in the court. Moutet loves the big stage and won’t go down without a fight which is why I like how large the spread is. He is pretty underpowered on the serve and backhand which may complicate holds a bit but I expect his other tricks to make up for this. Despite a small fitness concern in round 1 he easily beat Schoolkate in straights and really stepped up in his match against Zheng after going a set down, who retired in the fourth set.\n\nAlcaraz meanwhile is the No. 1 but has never made it past the quarters here in Australia. He sacked his coach Ferrero just before the season started and the verdict is still out on whether it was a good decision we’ll have to wait and see. He took care of his business in his first round victories over Walton and Hanfmann with straight set victories but he didn’t seem at his dominant best and they both covered the spread. Moutet is going to be a stronger opponent than them and if he doesn’t reduce the errors I could see the frenchman test him in this match, especially with how much he can force the errors. Also, playing against such an unorthodox opponent for the very first time can take a little bit of an adjustment period and one close set would be crucial for us. I feel like the diceyness of Corentin’s game may put Alcaraz in his head at times as he can often lose concentration plus the lefty aspect could increase the unpredictability to force more errors out of the spaniard. Generally you can instantly tell when Carlos is going to be in terminator mode for a tournament from his very first match (e.g. US Open ‘25) but I didn’t get that feeling from his first two so I predict he’ll complicate his life just a bit to make it a lot closer than the books anticipate. I also feel like his creative play will be matched for once which may reduce his chances at free points plus a lot of Moutet’s game from the baseline is about redirecting power which Alcaraz has an abundance of and may have to resort to (and increase the UE’s) to make the match competitive. Let’s just hope for some great tennis, eh. BOL !",

He serves big enough to hold without playing great, and when his forehand is clicking he can shorten points and run away with a set quickly. One strong service set or a tiebreak is all it takes.\n\nDe Minaur’s game is built on consistency, pressure, and attrition. That usually wins matches, but it doesn’t always produce clean 3–0s, especially against someone with Tiafoe’s power and ability to spike for 20–30 minutes. Over five sets, it’s hard to completely suppress that kind of shot-making.\n\nI’m not calling the upset. I’m calling a 3–1 or 3–2 type match, which is exactly what this bet is asking for.\n\nPlay: Tiafoe wins a set 🎾💰",

      "text": "**Previous Pick:** **Buffalo Sabres @ Montreal Canadiens OVER 6.5 (-120 on BET365 at time of posting), 1U for 1.83U LOSS 🪝**\n\n**Record: 2-3**  \n**Net Units: -2.63**  \n**ROI: -43.8%**\n\n**Ice Hockey** | **NHL** | **9PM EST**\n\n**Pick: Philadelphia Flyers @ Colorado Avalanche -1.5 (-120 on BET365 at time of posting), 1U for 1.83U)**\n\n**Previous pick recap:** As expected, a hard-fought match, and 1 of the goalies followed the script, but Luukkonen making 32 saves on 34 shots makes it a hook!\n\n**Write Up:** Ok y’all, time to go hard. I’m not just picking Colorado to beat Philadelphia tomorrow, I expect them beat the spread! Here’s why:\n\n**1. COL Home record:** Colorado have been struggling lately, esp.  at home where they are 1-1-2 in their last 4. ***However, they’re a whopping 20-1-4 at home this season, and all 20 wins coming in regulation.*** They are a combined 110 GF and 52 GA, good for 4.4 GF/GP and 2.08 GA/GP. If you remove the 3-7 shellacking against the lowly Preds last week, their GA/GP at home drops to 1.8. At home, they outshoot their opponents 36-25.5. In their last 10 at home, they’ve outscored opponents 39-21, and outchanced them 34.8 S/GP to 35.4 SA/GP. After dropping 3 of their last 4 and losing to Anaheim in OT their last time out (Dostal stood on his head to get the win for the Ducks), Colorado will be hungry to get back in the win column and not keep it close. \n\n**2. Offense, Defence, & Special Teams:** COL rank 1st in the NHL in scoring at 3.96 GF/GP, goals allowed at 2.27 GA/GP, PK% at 85% and shots/game at 34.9. In those same categories, PHI is 22nd in scoring at 2.9 GF/GP, 20th in goals allowed at 3.1 GA/GP, 23rd in PK% at 77.7% and 26th in shots/game at 26.0.  Now, you may think the power-play is where it turns, since the Avs are only 26th in the NHL with a 16.5 PP%, but the Flyers are 30th at 15.5%. The Flyers (4th) rank only slightly ahead of the Avs (8th) in SA/GP, 25.4 to 26.8. This won’t be enough to overcome the rest of the Avs strengths.\n\n**3. Goalies:** Philadelphia had better hope that starter Dan Vladar is ready to come off IR, as amongst qualifying goalies his .905 SV% (22 of 61) and 2.46 GAA (11 of 61) are WAY ahead of backup Samuel Ersson’s .858 SV% (61 of 61) and 3.38 GAA (53 of 61). Colorado’s still missing one half of lights-out goalie tandem Scott Wedgwood. If they go with presumptive starter Mackenzie Blackwood, his .917 SV% (4 of 61) and 2.26 GAA (5 of 61) are both top 5 for qualifying goalies. If they go with 2nd-year Trent Miner, he’s got 4 of his 6 lifetime games this season, putting up a .933 SV% and 2.03 GAA which belies his 1-0-2 record, as he came off the bench once, saving all 20 shots he face while already down 4-1 (Avs in a shootout) and his only win was a 4-0 29-save shutout of the Blue Jackets on Jan 10. \n\n**4. Goalie H2H:** Dan Vladar is 2-4-0 lifetime vs. Colorado, with a 3.88 GAA and .887 SV%. Ersson is 0-2-0 H2H with a 2.74 GAA and .913 SV% (he came off the bench once, making 8 saves on 9 shots after starter Carter Hart was shelled for 5 goals on 15 shots). On the flip side, Blackwood is 11-2-2 vs. Philly with a 2.24 GAA and .927 SV%. Trent Miner has never played against Philadelphia. \n\nAs this is an inter-conference games, these teams only face each other twice/year. That said, Avs won 3-2 in Philly in December this year, are on a 4-game win streak in this matchup and 7-2-0 in the past 5 seasons.\n\nLook to the Avs to right the ship and put up lopsided numbers here. If you're shy about the spread, the 3-way moneyline is currently at -190, it's just not juicy enough money in my opinion for this juggernaut.\n\n**BoL and play responsibly. Comment if you tail or fade if that's your thing, or don't, I'm not your mom.**",

Let’s go bet on them!\n\nAfter winning 12 of their first 15 games, the Hoosiers (12-7) welcomed then-No. 10 Nebraska into town on Jan. 10. Up 16 points with a little over 16 minutes to go, a statement-making victory appeared to be on the horizon. Instead, the team coughed up separate runs of 13-0 and 16-0 on its way to dropping a gut puncher, 83-77. The Hoosiers haven’t recovered since, losing each of their next three games by 14+ points. Not surprisingly, the team’s performance on both ends of the floor has suffered over those three games, scoring just 63.0 points on 40.5% shooting while conceding 80.3 points on 50.7% shooting. Yeeeeesh. \n\nAnd *this* is how we plan to get over a disgusting, disgusting beat from Wednesday night?\n\nBut before you scroll away, hear me out. Yes, the recent run of form has been putrid. Sure, the thought of dropping any amount of coin on this squad is downright terrifying. Yet upon closer examination, this is a game the Hoosiers should not only win, but win convincingly.\n\nSix of the team’s seven losses have come against teams ranked in the Top 100 in NET ranking—at No. 1 Michigan, No. 8 Nebraska, at No. 11 Michigan State, No. 15 Louisville, No. 21 Iowa and at No. 30 Kentucky—with the other coming on the road at No. 83 Minnesota. Regardless of some of the scores in those contests, nobody could fault Indiana for losing to any of those opponents. \n\nNow, take a look at how the team has performed in nine games against opponents ranked outside of the Top 100 in NET rankings:\n\n\n* Penn State (114): W 113-72 \n* Marquette (142): W 100-77 \n* Maryland (149): W 84-66 \n* Siena (189): W 81-60 \n* Milwaukee (230): W 101-70 \n* Lindenwood (231): W 73-53 \n* Bethune-Cookman (270): W 100-56 \n* Alabama A&M (307): W 98-51 \n* Chicago State (352): W 78-58 \n\n\nNot only are the Hoosiers 9-0 in those games, but they’ve won each game by 18+ points and by an average margin of 28.3 points. Furthermore, the team averaged 92 points on 51.6% shooting while conceding just 62.6 points and holding opponents to a meager 36.7% shooting from the floor. \n\nThat’s alarming news for Indiana’s opponent Friday night: NET No. 154 Rutgers. \n\nThe Scarlet Knights (9-10) enter on a bit of a slump themselves, after dropping two straight and three of their last four. But what stands out is how the team has struggled against teams ranked in the Top 50 in NET ranking:\n\n\n* Michigan (1): L 101-60\n* Purdue (5): L 81-65\n* Illinois (9): L 81-55 \n* Iowa (21): L 68-62 \n* Tennessee (25): L 85-60\n* Ohio State (35): L 80-73 \n* Wisconsin (39): L 96-87 \n* Seton Hall (45): L 81-59\n\n\nNot only is Rutgers winless in eight tries, all but two of those loses came by nine or more points.\n\nThrough 19 games, the Scarlet Knights offense has been anything but efficient. The unit ranks 249th in three-point shooting (32.1%), 251st in offensive efficiency (1.012), 272nd in scoring (70.3 PPG) and 325th in field-goal percentage (40.9%). That could present numerous challenges against the Hoosiers—No. 36 NET ranking—who rank 43rd in opponent field-goal percentage (41.2%), 58th in opponent three-point shooting (30.8%), 59th in defensive efficiency (0.993) and 69th in scoring defense (69.9 PPGA). In those nine aforementioned games against opponents outside of the Top 100 in NET rankings, those numbers fall to just 62.6 points conceded on a porous 36.7% shooting from the field. \n\nThings don’t get much better on the opposite end of the floor.\n\nOn the year, Indiana ranks 44th in offensive efficiency (1.151), 67th in field-goal percentage (47.2%), 69th in scoring (81.1 PPG) and 94th in three-point shooting (35.4%). Those numbers improve to 92.0 points on a blistering 51.6% shooting from the field in those nine contests against opponents outside of the Top 100 in NET ranking. Furthermore, against the nation’s No. 2-ranked defense (Michigan) last time out, the Hoosiers finished with 1.027 points per possession—the fourth-highest mark for a Wolverines opponent this season. Saying Friday could be a long night for an underwhelming Rutgers defense—153rd in scoring defense (74.1 PPGA), 174th in opponent field-goal percentage (44.5%), 216th in defensive efficiency (1.067) and 318th in opponent three-point shooting (36.7%)—would be an understatement. \n\nLook for Indiana to take out its frustration Friday night and win this one by double-digits.\n\nBOL if tailing, and as always, please do so responsibly. One bet should not have you crashing out all over Reddit.",

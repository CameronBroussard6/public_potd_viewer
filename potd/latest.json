Dude has been on a tear. The losing streak grows to 5, making me the Temu u/sigmabale. \n\n**Event:**  NHL: COL Avalanche @ CAR Hurricanes (5:00 PM MST)\n\n**POTD**: Avalanche ML (-137) Betting 2.74U to win 2U\n\n**Write Up:** The Avs are looking to win their 10th straight game today. They have been the most dominant team in hockey for the whole season and they are well rested going into this game, having last played on NYE. The Hurricanes have also been good, currently leading their division but they have not been about as good at home (13-7-1) as they have away (11-6-2) so I don't think home ice advantage will factor in much. I haven't seen an Avalanche ML with this good of odds in a while so I figure take it while it is there. \n\nBOL to anyone that tails!",

SMU is led in scoring by Boopie Miller, but Seth Trimble is one of, if not THE premier perimeter defender in the country. SMU is yet to see a team with the length and athleticism at the 4/5 positions that Henri Veesar and Caleb Wilson boast. UNC will be able to neutralize the SMU offense and force them into tough shots. UNC is the longer, more talented team and that will be more than enough to overwhelm SMU today and cover the -1.5 line.",

Just a couple weeks ago he threw one against Carolina and in the last 7 games, he's throw at least one interception in 6 of them. Baker seems to throw a lot of dangerous passes so im taking him to throw at least one pick in this matchup. \n\nBOL!",

Today, he's up against the Sabres who are 8th worst in the league in shots allowed at 29.18. The two teams played each other on October 28th where they combined for 77 shots on goal, and Marchencko had 6 of those himself. So, I'm betting that something similar will repeat itself today.",

Thankfully his teammates clutched up by the end. We move\n\nEmbiid is probable for this game which usually means he should play here against the Knicks. Has done a great job dishing the ball lately with 8 & 6 assists in his L2 avg 12 potentials, minutes are looking like they’re back to normal playing 35 & 38 minutes in those games.\n\nWith Maxey in & 31+ minutes he’s over in 3/4 games this season.\n\nSame reasoning here I think Knicks will continue to clog the paint which is perfect for Embiid kick outs, also saw the Mavs double up Joel in the post last game and I wouldn’t be surprised if the Knicks does the same. Expecting alot of P&R action with Maxey where he should get more potentials off of handoffs (gets a lot of potentials from handoffs which isn’t counted at NBA.com).\n\nDon’t mind this as a ladder play could definitely see him getting more, but settling with 3.5 for now.",

The Blues rank last in the league in goals scored compared to the 3rd ranked Canadiens. The Blues also concede the 29th most in the league while the Canadiens are 23rd. Montreal also clear St. Louis in power play %. The Canadiens come into this game on a two game win streak and a record of 22-12-6 while the St. Louis Blues sit at 16-18-8. St. Louis is on a back to back and Montreal have played great on the road this season (12-3-5). Montreal have the edge in goaltending as St. Louis goalie Jordan Binnington cannot be trusted in net. Line movement has gone in favor of Montreal as well. All in all, Montreal is one of the best road teams in the NHL and matchup well against St. Louis who are no days rest. Let’s expect the team with the fresher legs, better talent, and better form to come away with the W\n\n👇\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m0ajt6quk5bg1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e6655c37635718dab4bd31e019b90cc7fdd68330",

Grabbing the habs on the moneyline is strictly a play on the \"schedule loss\" for  st louis( team, not the coach). the notes just grinded out a heavy 4:3 win against vegas yesterday afternoon and now have to turn around less than 24 hours later to face a montreal squad thats been resting since new years day. The blues are already sitting with a -41 goal differential, and thye are gonna try to defend fresh suzuki and caufield on zero rest.\n\nThe metrics show the habs top line is going to feast on the blues tired defense. Caufield has been lighting the lamp with 20 goals in 40 games, and that one timer is lethal on the man advantage, which is recently been  clicking at a massive 25.0% peercentage. Blues has a bottom tier penalty kill hovering around 77.5%, and with fatigue leading to lazy stick infractions, you can bet the habs will get their looks. No golies have been confirmed yet but binner should get the nod for the blues cuz of the B2B. he is posting an.869 save percentage , which isnt going to steal a game against a montreal offense averaging 4.0 goals over their last ten. and montreal just put up 7goals in the last game against the defensive canes team.\n\nmoving to the second leg and taking the wings and pens to go over 4.5 goals is arguably the safest play on the board. these two squads just met on thursday and put seven biscuits in the basket in a 4:3 OT game. Pens offense is buzzing right now, averaging a ridiculous 4.6 goals per game in their last five outings. even with gibby playing well for detroit ( been hot for the wings with a.925 save percentage recently ), the defensive structures on both sides are loose enough to guarantee at least five goals. Neither team is interested in playing a trap game. wings PP is fourth in the league at over 25%, and pens bllue line is thin without healthy bodies. The volume of shots gibson iss going to face from a desperate pens team chasing a wildcard spot means a couple are leaking through. 3:2 game clears this hurdle and these teams have combined for 6+ goals in their recent meetings. Wings have cleared over 4.5 goals in 4 of the last 5 games, and pens have cleared over 4.5 in 5 of the 5 last games. the pens allow 30 shots a game  and detroit loves to shoot, especially at home. raymond is dishing apples left and right and kane is finding his groove with that second line. Skinner should be in net for the pens and his.888 save percentage is looking like swiss cheese. hes spilling rebounds everywhere, and with guys like  the cat and larkin buzzing around the crease, that biscuit is finding the back of the net. THe last game skinner played, he got the W for the pens (1st one in tthe season, btw) and let in 1 goal against canes, but even then, pens scored 5 to clear the o4.5. \n\nHabs with the rest advantage and special teams edge facing a gassed blues team, paired with an over that hits in nearly 80% of these teams combined games this season. Lock it in and lets cash this ticket.\n\nBet responsibly and good luck to yall today! 🍀🍻",

Who played in the other you ask?\n\nIt was just last year, Week 18, Vikings vs Lions, also featuring Sam Darnold, won by the Lions with ease, but the result isn’t the focus as much as the performance. **In that game Darnold went 18-41 with a season low 166 yards**. *Might he want some personal redemption?* Sure, but I trust the other guy more.\n\n(The other guy) Brock Purdy has already played in the biggest games: **At home he is 11-3 in December or later, & 5-0 in January or later. Purdy & the Niners are also 7-1 in their last 8 against Seattle.**\n\nSan Francisco also have their weapons hitting stride: **Jauan Jennings has a TD in 5 straight games, Christian McCaffrey also now has a TD in 6 straight games, & it appears George Kittle is “absolutely” reported to play despite his own injury.**\n\nAdd all this to the fact that ***if San Francisco win this game, their home field advantage carries all the way to Super Bowl LX which will be hosted by the Bay Area.***\n\nI have to take the team with experience tonight.\n\nLast play review:\n\nCristiano Ronaldo Goal (-125) 1u ❌\n\n(Struck by Penaldo, what a game - but quite possibly his worst of the season - invisible in large portions, and basically played out by the opposition’s structure, should have listened to my own concerns - but I trusted the old fella.

Espanyol have quietly been one of the **most structured defensive teams in La Liga**, especially at home. In **9 home matches**, they hold a **6-1-2 record**, conceding just **10 total goals**, with a season **xGA of 19.52** and **7 clean sheets**, confirming that these results are backed by underlying performance rather than luck.\n\nA key factor here is **game control**. Espanyol operates with **low possession (42.8%)** by design, preferring a compact defensive block that limits space centrally and forces opponents into slower build-up play. This style has consistently kept matches tight, particularly against stronger teams, and significantly reduces the chance of high-scoring outcomes.\n\nWhile Barcelonaleads the league in goals scored, their **away profile tells a different story**. **7 of Barcelona’s 9 away matches** this season have finished **under 3.5 goals**, with most wins settling into controlled scorelines once they establish a lead. Additionally, Barcelona enters this match with **key defensive absences (Araújo, Christensen, Gavi)**, which historically results in a more cautious, possession-focused approach rather than an open, end-to-end game—especially in a derby setting.\n\nThe **derby context** further strengthens the under. These matches are typically **more physical, more tactical, and more disciplined**, with higher foul counts and fewer transition opportunities. Espanyol are comfortable slowing the pace, breaking rhythm, and playing without the ball—exactly the conditions that suppress total goals.\n\nWhen combining:\n\n* Espanyol’s **home defensive consistency**\n* Barcelona’s **controlled away scoring distribution**\n* Tactical matchup and derby intensity\n\nThe projected scoring range consistently falls between **2 and 3 total goals**. The **Under 3.5** comfortably covers the most likely outcomes (**2-0, 2-1, 3-0**) while protecting against late-game variance.\n\nAt **-130**, this line provides a **strong margin for error**, aligns with the highest-probability scenario, and represents the **best value position on the board** for this matchup.\n\n🍺 **If this one cashes, a beer is always appreciated:** [buymeacoffee.com/willjack](http://buymeacoffee.com/willjack)\n\n**BOL!!

Both teams are in great form going into today's game and due to injuries, suspensions and players lost to AFCON on both sides, I'm backing both teams to find the net tonight.\n\nThe hosts tonight Lille, sit in a nice **4th place** in Ligue 1, chasing European football as they are level on points with 3rd place Marseille. They ended 2025 with **4 consecutive league victories** and have **won 5 of their last 6** only losing 1 to **7th place Strasbourg**. At home they have been **4th best** this season, recording **6 wins** from their **8 games** whilst **scoring 16 goals** and **conceding** an impressive **6**. On average Lille score **2.06 goals per game** this season which lowers ever so slightly to 2.00 when they play at home. They have been defensively sound conceding **1.25 goals per game** which drops to an **impressive 0.75 when playing at their home ground**. The important part of today's pick comes from the team news of both sides. Lille come into this game missing centre backs Mandi and Mbemba who are away on international duty as well as defensive midfielder Mukau who is also away at AFCON. On top of this, left back Perraud and centre back Ngoy both received red cards in their previous game so will also be missing from the lineup today. As a result, I expect their impressive defensive numbers to take somewhat of a hit as their manager is forced to rotate, enough at least to allow the visitors to find the back of the net once.\n\nAs for today's visitors they sit in a similarly promising position in **7th place**, 5 points away from their opponents today and also chasing the European finish. Rennes have also been in great form coming into the new year, having **won 5 of their last 6 league outings** only losing to **2nd place PSG**. Across these games they have **scored 13 goals** whilst **conceding 8**, so scoring themselves hasn't been hard to come by of late. On average this season they are scoring **1.69 goals per game** which does drop to **1.13** when playing away from home but as mentioned previously, I'm hoping this number gets a bit of a boost against a makeshift Lille defense today. Defensively speaking the visitors **concede 1.5 goals** per game which rises to **2 per game** when playing away from home. In terms of their away performances this season they are **6th best**, but have only picked up **2 wins from their 8 away games**, drawing 4 of them. Once again we return to the team sheet for some important context in today's game. Rennes come into this game without centre back Boudlal and left back Nagida who are away at AFCON, both of which have been used as important rotation options this season. Finally they lose veteran midfielder Seko Fofana also to AFCON.\n\nFor today's pick we are essentially banking on the fact Lille **will** score and are betting on the fact Rennes can also find the net due to Lille essentially having an entirely makeshift defense which will almost certainly include some youngsters who will be under pressure to perform. On top of this, **Rennes have scored in 9 of their last 10 league games** only failing to score **away at PSG** which is hardly an easy game.\n\nBoth teams want to finish in the European spots come the end of the season, and both teams are in impressive form which is why I see this one finishing around the 2-2 mark or maybe a 2-1 win to Lille.\n\nLet me know your thoughts and suggestions below and comment if you are tailing. BOL for all of your bets today and enjoy the vast amount of games that are on!",

They are far too open and weak on set pieces, giving their opponents far too many chances to score. That isn't to mention the fact that the atmosphere around the club is poor with fans unhappy at the board, managerial choice and underperforming players. It's coming to a bit of a boiling point. While Rangers are on the upswing since sacking Russell Martin. There is much more optimism that they're on the right path forward than at Celtic and an early goal for Rangers (Celtic have conceded 5 goals during the opening 15 in Nancy's 7 in charge) could well and truly set the tone for a bad night for The Bhoys and possibly spend the end for Nancy's time in charge. This game is being priced as if this is a typical Celtic vs Rangers. It's not and bettors should look to take advantage.\n\nAdditional Thoughts: I wasn't going to start doing this yet but I've decided to say fuck it, why wait? I've gotten my last few bets correct and I'm feeling in form. And this bet I feel could be particularly good value I'm afraid to say as someone who does not have any appreciation for Rangers Football Club.",

That style consistently drives corner numbers. Even in matches where Villa do not score early, they continue to apply pressure through wide overloads, cutbacks and recycled possession, forcing defenders into blocks and clearances rather than clean exits. This repeated pressure is exactly the type of game state that produces steady corners across both halves.\n\nForest also play a key role in supporting the corner line. While they are less efficient going forward, they actually generate a healthy volume of shots and attacking moves, particularly in transition. Those attacks often end in deflections, saves or blocked efforts rather than clean finishes, which adds to their own corner output. Defensively, Forest tend to concede territory and invite pressure, especially against top half sides, leading to sustained waves of opposition attacks and corner concessions.\n\nWith Villa expected to dominate possession and Forest still capable of contributing corners of their own, the over 8.5 line is well supported by both teams tendencies. The double chance on Villa adds protection against match variance while aligning with their strong form and control at home, making this a well balanced bet builder built on game flow rather than a single outcome.\n\nBest of luck.",

As predicted, Nets shoot 20% from three and the Wizards cruise to a 20pt win. No sweat.\n\nToday’s Pick: Ivica Zubac Under 9.5 Rebounds (-105) 1 Unit\n\n1/3/2026 7:30pm PST / NBA / Boston Celtics @ Los Angeles Clippers\n\nNarrative: Dec. 20, 15 days ago, Zubac was diagnosed with a Grade 2 ankle sprain and expected to be out 4-6 weeks. In today’s NBA, rarely do you see early returns from injury which makes this odd… Especially for a 7 footer pushing 250lb. I’m glad he’s healthy, as I am a big fan of his, and he is a rebounding machine, but I’m banking on the fact here that he’s not cracking the 20min mark in this game and for that reason alone will stay under. Clippers are on a 7 game win streak with Zubac out, after a rough start to the season, and shouldn’t be motivated to rush him back. Along with that, BOS is not a big team, their starting center averages 24min a night, also influencing less minutes needed of Zubac as they opt for a smaller line up. Zubac on the season is averaging 32min played and 11.1reb, which equates to 0.346 rebounds per minute. I don’t see Zubac surpassing 25min played here, which 25min would yield 8.67reb, which keeps us under the 9.5. I expect sub 20min played here for Zubac which is why I like this wager. Tempted to hammer this, but keeping it at one unit in case for whatever reason he plays his 32min.",

Giannis clears the line on a walk-off lob dunk with four seconds to go. Milwaukee trailed by as many as 16, but the Greek Freak made the most of his 29 minutes -- oh, and how about 8-for-8 from the charity stripe!*\n\nIf you don't like low mid-major college basketball, you don't like degenerate sports betting! UNC Asheville has won nine straight against Charleston Southern. During that stretch, UNCA's winning margin is 12.2 points per game. In fact, the last Chuck South win was a 1-point upset in the first round of the Big South Conference tournament in 2022. So why am I taking a team that hasn't won on the road this season (0-5) against a team that hasn't lost at home (3-0)? Easy. Strength of schedule. Throw out the records. UNCA's Pomeroy strength of schedule is 151. CSU's is 338. The Bulldogs (6-9) also have Big South Preseason Player of the Year in fifth-year senior Toyaz Solomon, and were picked to finish second in the league. When it comes to these one-bid leagues, the conference slate is everything. That's why I raised an eyebrow when I saw CSU (10-6) needed a 55-point second half to erase a 12-point halftime deficit against a 2-14 Gardner-Webb squad that was picked to finish below them. For context, Pomeroy has just six teams ranked lower than Gardner-Webb in all of Division 1. *That's* Charleston Southern's lead-in to UNCA?\n\nFun fact: CSU's Buccaneer Fieldhouse is one of the smallest arenas in Division I with an 881 capacity, but students don't return to classes until January 12. I'm not saying it won't still feel like playing in a raucous bandbox, and it *is* a unique atmosphere. But the Bulldogs are battle-tested, and they have the better coach. Eighth-year coach Mike Morrell comes from the Shaka Smart tree, and CSU's Saah Nimley is navigating his second year at the helm after going 10-22 last season.\n\nThe danger for UNCA will be the deep ball. CSU ranks second in the NCAA with 13.2 made threes per game. Their style is run and gun. But if the Bulldogs - and Solomon - can avoid foul trouble, dictate the pace, and limit 3s, I'll gladly take 5.5 points in a matchup that has been entirely one-sided in recent years.\n\nGood luck and godspeed!",

I believe similar to the Miami game, a lot of checkdowns thrown to Cade to push him above this line. Carolina are a middle of the pack team in yards allowed to tight ends, sitting at 14th place. This line seems rather low and Cade has cleared it in all but three weeks this season. I think the books are over valuing the return of Evans, Godwin, and McMillan, and Cade should clear this.

Tampa has been looking disastrous lately and panthers, well they've been the panthers. The Bucs are favored and I don't understand why, they've lost the last 4, with all the losses being to mid to bad tiered teams. I understand its a divisional match up for basically a playoff spot but I don't think Irving will have his time to shine here, as I feel panthers will easily cover the spread, and likely take the lead forcing more passing\n\nIrving has been doing good since he came back in late november from injury but not putting up amazing numbers akin to other rbs. He is only averaging 2 receptions with 14.3 receiving yards in his last 5 games (since he came back from injury), and he's been averaging 15.2 carries for 53.2 yards.  Bucky didnt get a single target in the last game against them. While only being a single yards off twice (against Cardinals and New Orleans), he hasn't hit this once in his last 5 games. TB also has Rachaad white who gets limited carries yet seems to get more consistent targets compared to Irving\n\nAnother thing to think about Panthers give up a low number of yardage to RB, being the 9th best in the league in that area\n\nBoL everyone tailing, hope those incentives for other players don't screw anyone over this week!",

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 6-21-3 *I stay winless in the new year. In the usual fashion, I managed to identify another freak match that saw a very early red card for the team I backed, and that pretty much sealed their fate. They also nearly conceded from the halfway line. We move though, and today we head over to an equally as exciting matchup that's bound to throw some fun our way (but most importantly, a win). I've been eyeing this match since before the new year and I truly believe I'm ending my winless streak today*\n\n**Last Five:** ❌❌❌❌❌\n\n**Event:** LaLiga, RCD Espanyol v FC Barcelona, 3:00 pm EST\n\n**POTD:** RCD Espanyol +1.0, +1.5 Asian Handicap -115, 2 units\n\n**Write Up:** It's safe to say Espanyol have been one of the surprise packages in the Spanish league, perhaps the whole of Europe. After finishing 14th last year in their regular midtable languishing season, they've made significant strides, collecting 10 wins, three draws and just four defeats from 17 matches. Their recent form has been outstanding, with **five consecutive league victories** over Sevilla, Celta Vigo, Rayo Vallecano, Getafe and Athletic Bilbao (all very respectable sides). Perhaps even more impressive are their **home performances** as Espanyol have taken **19 points from the possible 27** at their ground.\n\nNow take into consideration this is a Catalan derby and Espanyol REALLY don't like Barcelona. They're always ready to turn up and despite the fact their *recent H2H has been disappointing,* they **don't usually get blown out by the paper favourites**, notching up a respectable amount of draws. While it’s easy to see Barcelona as the favourite based on table position and firepower, there’s value in backing Espanyol to avoid a heavier defeat. First off, Espanyol enter this match with confidence and momentum. As I said, they’ve won **five LaLiga matches in a row**, a run that highlights how well Manolo Gonzalez’s side are playing, especially considering none of the teams they beat in that stretch are pushovers. At home, Espanyol’s record looks even stronger. They’ve taken points in **five of their last six matches at RCDE Stadium** and kept multiple clean sheets there this season. That defensive resilience matters when taking an Asian Handicap, where even a narrow defeat still yields a winning bet and I think that's a smart play to take today. **Espanyol are good at grinding out results** when needed, so that also gives me confidence heading into this.\n\nMeanwhile, Barcelona’s away form isn’t as bulletproof as the headlines suggest. Though they’re top of LaLiga and score plenty of goals, their away matches often involve **multiple goals conceded,** with **Barcelona averaging nearly 2 goals conceded per away game** this season thanks to their **ridiculously high, dysfunctional defensive line.** This goal conceded number is far higher than the elite visitors normally allow and it's why I truly believe Espanyol can stay in the game longer than the odds imply.\n\nFinally, the rivalry cannot be underestimated. Espanyol historically rise to big occasions in front of their diehard fans, and with the +1.0, +1.5 line, I'm essentially backing them to stay competitive even if Barcelona edge it. Besides (and that's a small consideration that hasn't really influenced my decision behind this bet by a great deal, but still made me even more sure of it), this is **the first LaLiga match after the holidays** and players like **Lamine Yamal** are for sure going to be feeling the effects of all the partying. On the other side, the Espanyol players probably felt like they could have an edge if they just stayed disciplined during the holidays - I'm sure the management would've made that known. The underdog is always going to try to take such things into consideration to level the playing field in one way, because let's face it, technique wise, they're not touching the Blaugrana.\n\nI also like the BTTS Yes angle, as well as an Under 2.5 goals line *(feeling like Espanyol are going to keep Barcelona relatively quiet),* but we're just going to focus on the match result. All in all, fading Barcelona when I really need a sure win perhaps sounds counterintuitive, but if I win, I want to do it in style (and I do believe in the pick I've made, that goes without saying). We've waited far too long for my win, just to achieve it by betting on some heavyweights to score more than 0.5 goals and have more than 4 corners against a relegation threatened side or something. BOL whether you tail or fade, let's enjoy this heated derby, which is for sure going to be even crazier now that I've placed a bet on it ☘️🫡",

Keep in mind it’s first to 7 sets to win, compared to first to 6 sets yesterday.\n\nIf we compare it with the finals of the previous years, we see:\n\n2025: 10 sets, 25 180s (Littler vs van Gerwen)\n\n2024: 11 sets, 36 180s (Littler vs Humphries)\n\n2023: 11 sets, 37 180s (Smith vs van Gerwen)\n\n2022: 12 sets, 41 180s (Smith vs Wright)\n\n2021: 10 sets, 23 180s (Anderson vs Price, covid year)\n\nI can keep it going but in 2020 it didn’t hit either. \n\nWe can conclude that this bet only went over the total of 37.5 once in the past years. With the recent stats of the semi-finals and the previous finals, I’m confident in taking the under 37.5 180s @ 1.81\n\nBOL!",

You’ll always take that whenever you can get it. \n\nPanthers have been hot yes, but Carolina’s offense has been one of the league’s least efficient at turning plays into points. By 2025 efficiency metrics, Carolina sits near the bottom in EPA per play (about -0.05). I argue that matters in a divisional game where the spread is tight and you’re basically asking who can produce two or three scoring drives without self harming themselves.\n\nIf Baker Mayfield can stay protected in the pocket, he’s dangerous. And we already know he’s dangerous on the run. He’s not Lamar, but he’s so hard to knock down.",

I’m a storyteller with my POTDs and it will stay like that. I find entertainment in writing these and love to throw some amusement towards y’all. But don’t worry, this write up will be short and sweet. Shoutout KevDog, the only man to verbally support me, you’re a King my friend. The pick today is Arkansas to win outright against the Volunteers. Oh man, I love me some John Calipari. He puts his players in the right position to succeed and stand out for the NBA scouts. And I’m sure his players are fired up after he stood up against the weird NCAA/NBA transfer situation going on. These are the types of games John has to win to keep his recruiting alive, I believe in him fully. \n\nArkansas comes into this with a 8-0 record at home this season with two wins against ranked opponents (Texas Tech and Louisville). They have also played stiff competition all year with quality losses to Duke, Houston and Michigan State. They will be more prepared and mentally tougher than Tennessee in this matchup. I’ve been watching a lot of Arkansas basketball and they have two absolute studs on their team. Brazile and Acuff Jr have been a deadly duo heading into conference play and the leadership they provide will only intensify as the season progresses. Not much stats on this one as these two teams matchup pretty evenly. I just believe Arkansas is the better coached and more mature team coming into this coin flip game. And I always side with the home momentum in these types of matchups. BOL",

Al Ittihad's numbers are pumped by 2 friendly games versus bad teams. They did play a 1-0 vs Nasaf Qarshi but that was an AFC Champion's League game and they shot 19 times while Nasaf shot 16 times so there was plenty of attacking even though the shots were not converted.  \nAl Taawoun achieved these defensive numbers vs mostly mid/lower table teams but they did score vs Qadsiah and NEOM who are both good teams and they are on a pretty good run. If we take a look at their whole season in the Saudi League, Al Ittihad have 22-16 goal difference while Al Taawoun have 27-13 in 11 games. This paints a completely different picture.\n\nI think the odds overvalue the defensive aspect of the teams' recent games, especially for Al Ittihad. They are good defensively but I expect both teams to push and score goals. Al Ittihad want to climb back up the table where they feel they belong and I expect them to score first but Al Taawon is fighting to keep their 3rd place. I think both teams' offensive power can overwhelm the defenses.\n\nThis is a higher risk pick anyway, so take that into account.\n\nKeep in my mind I'm a random nobody from reddit, so tail with caution.

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 18-16-5 (Avg Odds +128)\n\n**Previous Pick:** Milan ML + Pulisic 1+ SoT (+100) ✅️\n\n**Today's Event:** English Premier League (Soccer) | Wolves vs West Ham (7:00 AM PST)\n\n**Pick:** Jarrod Bowen 1+ SOT and West Ham DC (+124) 1 unit to win 1.24 units\n\n**Write Up:** The Milan game played out about as expected, low scoring but ultimately with Milan coming through. Despite Pulisic not starting, he came through with a SOT anyway after he subbed on around the 78' mark. Great plus money cash to start the weekend!\n\nEPL is back today and we've got the game of the week here as 20th (last) place Wolves host 18th place West Ham. Let's be honest and get out there that both of these teams stink. Wolves are historically bad, as they may be looking at the fewest points ever by an EPL team. West Ham have been spotty, but I think they are a better team than their record states and have shown signs of life. \n\nBowen is the best attacking player for West Ham, the game goes through him. He has 6 of the club's 20 goals this season (30%) and has been in great form lately, scoring in 3 of his last 5 matches. He also has 8 SOTs in his last 6 matches, only failing to land an SOT in one of these games against Man City. I love the odds we're getting for Bowen here. \n\nLets talk about Wolves. They are winless this season, going 0-3-16 so far. They lost at home to Burnley (19th place team), at home to Forest (17th place team) and at home to Leeds (16th place team) just to name a few notable results. They are on track to earn 6 total points this season at the halfway point, which would be firmly the worst EPL season ever, with the current honor of that award is held by Derby County with 11 points. Their stats back up their record, attacking wise they have the fewest SOTs (53) fewest goals scored (10 - the 2nd fewest is 18), fewest shots, fewest goals/shot, we could go on. Defensively, they've conceded the 2nd most goals (36) and 3rd most SOTs (90).\n\nWest Ham are not a great team and do not have the best defensive record themselves, but they really need a win here to start to work out of the relegation zone. This is a team they need to beat, and I suspect Bowen will take it on himself to make that happen. This pick is more about fading the Wolves than anything, but I do think West Ham are a much better team. \n\nBOL and happy Saturday!",

When talking about home form Villa are one of the best with a 7-1-1 record. Away from home Forest are 2-2-5 and coming into this game they are on a streak of 2 losses away from home and 3 losses overall. Villa on the other hand have won their last 5 home games but just came from a defeat against Arsenal.\n\nLet me say it one more time again, fuck Sean Dyche. I hated how he played at Burnley and I will never rate him as manager. And it shows, Emery is 6-1-1 in managerial H2H while Villa are also 6-2-2 in the club H2H.

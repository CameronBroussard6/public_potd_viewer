      "text": "POTD Record: 196-143\n\nUnits Won: +117.41u\n\nLast Pick: Kyousuke O 8.5 Headshots Map 2 (-118) ✅\n\nToday's Pick: **Yuurih>TeSes Map 1 Kills + JiJieHao ML (vs. AaB) (-125)** 5u\n\n\\-If anyone needs help finding the picks/bet or a place to find esports can always reach out!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3cocx8otri1g1.png?width=218&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0820d4e5a1604cad24f5fb7a20967371ce8696c\n\n**JiJieHao ML (-455) vs. Aab**\n\n* Starting with the easier one, JiJieHao ever since adjusting to sinnopsyy joining the roster have been heavily over performing my expectations. I thought this team was dead in the water but they have been playing so much better recently. In the last week they are 8-3 in matches, went on a nice playoff run in Nodwin, and only lost to Nuclear TigeRES who have been on a rampage, twice, and Oramond in a close 2-1. They have wins against ECLOT/Nexus/RUBY/Nemiga/GenOne/AMKAL/GUN5 all in the last week\n* Aab have been complete opposite, this roster has struggled in every way, they are 2-9 in the last two weeks of matches they have played including losing to multiple teams JiJieHao have beaten including Nexus/AMKAL/GUN5 they also have a very uninspiring roster to me on paper \n* Projected Veto/map pool: Aab ban Train, JiJieHao ban Overpass, Aab pick Inferno, JiJieHao pick Dust 2, Aab ban Mirage or Nuke, JiJiehao ban Ancient  Mirage/Nuke Decider?\n* JiJiehao have a big advantage here as their two strongest maps by far are Dust 2 and Mirage, Aab has been awful on both maps with a 33% winrate on 12 maps of Dust 2, and a 25% winrate on 12 maps of Mirage. I am expecting JiJieHao to win a clean map on their map pick, we have seen Aab get blown out multiple times on opponents picks in recent matches including a recent 13-2 loss on Dust 2. While Inferno has been a struggle for JiJieHao win rate wise, they have quietly improved heavily since adding sinnopsyy, 3 map win streak beating strong tier two teams in Metizport, ECLOT and AMKAL. Expecting a 2-0 but comfortable in 3 if it goes there\n\n**Yuurih>TeSeS Map 1 Kills (-208)**\n\n* A bit more theory on this one, since we don't know who picks first in the grand final, we can narrow it down to what each team will first pick and go from there. FURIA perma ban Ancient, also Falcons best map, Falcons perma ban Overpass, also FURIA's best map, no reason for these to change. FURIA will pick Inferno, Falcons weakest map by far and one FURIA smoked Falcons on a week ago. Falcons likely pick Nuke but a chance that we could see Mirage again (they picked it in the match a week ago and lost close 13-11).\n* Maps aside this pick is solid value on its own as TeSeS has been struggling HEAVILY since his swap to being an anchor. TeSeS is averaging a .57 KPR in the L3 months and a .55 KPR in the last month.\n* Yuurih is averaging a .65 KPR L3 months and a .67 KPR in the last month\n* On projected maps (Nuke/Inferno) TeSes has been awful on both maps but especially Inferno. TeSeS is averaging a .53 KPR L3 months on Inferno/Nuke and a .46 KPR in the last month on the two maps\n* Yuurih is much better on the projected maps especially Inferno but he is also above average on Nuke as well averaging a .69 KPR on the two maps combined both in the L3 months and in 2025 as a whole. \n* Odds are relatively even, getting an over +.10 KPR difference and am expecting FURIA to show up strong in this series and likely take the grand final. Love the value of this parlay, think both lines are fanatstic",

      "text": "POTD Record: 14-6 (+9U)\n\nLast Pick: Oklahoma @ Alabama under 47 (-120) (1U) ✅\n\n[Under write up](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/s/J90Djm973v)\n\nA little flukiness in the beginning of the game with the pick 6 and explosive touchdowns, but we regressed back down to where we should be! Another sweat but who gaf, I love a good sweat that ends in a win! That’s all the fun\n\nEvent:  chargers @ Jaguars (12pm central) Ravens @ Browns (3:25pm central)\n\nPOTD: Standard two leg 6.5 point teaser (Ravens -1/Chargers vs jags over 37) (-120) (1.5U)\n\n-everything is bet to win unit amount-\n\nWrite up: \n\n\nRavens -1 vs. Browns\n\nThe original line had Baltimore laying 7.5 to 8 points on the road. That’s a lot in a divisional matchup, especially with weather concerns. But by teasing it down to -1, we’ve turned this into almost a straight-up win bet. That’s a massive edge because the Ravens have been dominant ATS in Cleveland, going 13-4 ATS in their last 17 trips. Historically, John Harbaugh’s teams thrive in these spots, and sharp bettors are already backing Baltimore even at -8. Professional money saw value at that number, so at nearly pick’em, we’re sitting on gold. Baltimore’s defense has been suffocating, allowing just 14.5 points per game over their last four contests. \n\nMeanwhile, Cleveland’s offense is a disaster, ranking dead last in yards per play (4.1) and the Browns managed just 20 points against the Jets’ suspect defense, with rookie Dillon Gabriel averaging a pathetic 3.9 yards per attempt. The Ravens’ red zone defense is top-10, while Cleveland converts just 47% of their red zone trips into touchdowns. That mismatch alone makes it hard to see how the Browns keep pace. With Lamar Jackson healthy, completing over 70% of his passes and sporting a 15:1 TD-to-INT ratio, Baltimore has the firepower to control this game. At -1, it’s hard to imagine them not walking away with the win. Factor in Cleveland’s home field being essentially worthless (they’re 1-11 straight up in their last 12 games versus AFC opponents), and Baltimore’s 8-4 ATS record in their last 12 games against Cleveland and Harbaugh is 11-4 ATS when his team is coming off three straight wins as road favorites. He gets his guys ready to compete in “let down spots”. we’re taking care of business. Plus, if the weather is piss poor which it might be, this supports the more disciplined team with a legit run game against a lackluster offense in which Gabriel has not faced situations like this yet in the league.\n\n\nChargers vs. Jaguars Over 37\n\nThe second leg of our teaser is just as strong. The original total sat at 44 points, but teasing it down to 37 gives us a huge cushion. The Chargers have been on fire offensively, averaging 28.4 points per game over their last five contests. Justin Herbert is second in the NFL in passing yards, and he’s facing a Jaguars defense that has been one of the worst against the pass, allowing 252.9 passing yards per game (fifth-worst in the league). Backup QBs like Davis Mills and Geno Smith have shredded this secondary, so Herbert should have no problem lighting them up.\n\n\nJacksonville’s defense has been consistently poor. They’ve allowed 24.4 points per game (20th in the NFL) and rank near the bottom in yards allowed per play (27th at 5.8). They’ve also struggled to generate pressure, recording just 6 sacks in their last six games. That means Herbert will have time to carve them up, and with LA scoring 89 points in their last three games, the over looks extremely attainable. Even if the Jaguars chip in modestly, the Chargers alone could push this game past 37. And honestly, I expect the jaguars to come out angry after a disappointing loss to the Texans last week. Not to mention LA has traveled the most miles out of any team this year and they may be a little tired defensively having made 4 trips to the east coast! \n\nThis teaser combines Baltimore’s absolute war path toward the playoffs with LA’s offensive explosion against a weak defense, giving us two angles where the teased lines provide significant value: Ravens to pretty much win outright and Chargers/Jags to clear a modest total.",

All bets are 1 unit.\n\nLast POTD 11/13/25: TreVeyon Henderson 60+ rushing yards & Breece Hall 2+ receptions (-119 FanDuel) ✅\n\nThis one ended up being a major sweat, and it ended up hitting on Henderson’s final rush of the game to get the first down to lead into the QB kneel to end the game.\n\nToday's POTD 11/16/25: J.J. McCarthy 1+ Interceptions (-130 Bet365)\n\nEvent: Bears @ Vikings 11:00 AM MST\n\nWrite up: This line feels surprisingly low, considering the matchup J.J. will be facing this week against the ball-hawking Chicago defense. Although there haven’t been a lot of shining spots, the Bears' defense is the league leader in interceptions through 10 weeks of NFL action and has taken the ball away through the air in 6/9 games this season. \n\nSo far in McCarthy’s short time as the starter, he has thrown a pick in all four games. His current interception rate ranks 2nd in the league at 6%, and the Bears have already picked him off in week 1 of this season. Since then, McCarthy’s pass attempts have increased each week from 20, 21, 25, and then an astounding 42 attempts last week against Baltimore. Although I expect the Vikings to make their best effort to impose the run against Chicago, I don’t see it being sustainable through all 4 quarters, and I’m predicting the weekly improving Caleb Williams and Bears offense to keep it tight and competitive. This gives J.J. McCarthy more opportunities to air the ball out and put it in harm's way and into the hands of the Bears defenders.\n\nTail of fade BOL to everyone and cheers! 🍻",

Kincaid's been hogging much of the spotlight in the TE spot, averaging 3.6 receptions on 4.5 targets, meanwhile Knox has been averaging 1.3 receptions on 2 targets, with him gone these numbers should rise. \n\nBuccaneers with their 24th ranked passing defense have been decent against tight ends this season yet still have holes, having an average of 7 targets with 5.11 receptions split among opposing tight ends. The Bills third string TE Jackson Hawes has been mainly used for blocking, which should let Knox funnel these numbers up for himself. Bucs also play zone over 70% of the time which tight ends can feast on. They've also been pretty weak in the middle of the field, where Knox should be able to take advantage of.\n\nNow the lines are these games are at -5.5, but the Bills have been looking rustier than they should, losing to the Dolphins in brutal fashion. This game will be close, and have plenty of passes. Our boy Knox will shine this game, \n\nBOL to anyone tailing!",

However a straight red card to the keeper early in the second half killed this completely. \n\nToday's Pick: England to win and no for BTTS vs Albania. 3u @ 2.10\n\nWas considering Naestved in Denmark today (I have bets there) but can't go beyond England to win and keep a clean sheet here. Last chance to get on them in qualifiers.\n\nEngland are on track to become the first ever international team to not concede a goal in group phase of more than 4 teams. \n\nThey've been perfect. 7 games, 7 wins, and no goals conceded. \n\nThe English team are one of the deepest in the world. They've got plenty of players who are getting chances throughout qualifying and these guys will want to make the most of their opportunity. \n\nAnd it's not like these guys suck. Guys like Bowen (randomly picked a player who doesn't play often for England) would start for everyone else in the world besides 3 or 4 sides.\n\nAlbania are second in the group and can't drop to third. However they've only scored 7 in 7 (conceding 3), so going the u2.5 also looks good and is similar value... Only thing I don't like about that is I can see an England 3-0 being more likely than a draw or Albania win.",

That was a tough one to root for, with Spain running circles around Georgia. Luckily our guy came through with a SOT in the 75th minute and then nearly had a goal in the 90th with a shot that went just wide of the post. \n\nToday we head to Portugal as our hosts, who sit first place in the qualifying group, welcome last place Armenia. A win here secures Portugal their guaranteed spot in the World Cup, whereas a loss or draw requires some help. Portugal will want to win here with conviction in front of their home crowd to avoid the playoff matches. \n\nRonaldo will be out for this match after receiving a red card in the last match, so Portugal will need to get creative to find their goals. Bruno will captain the team today and will likely be the team's penalty taker in Ronaldo's absence. I expect Bruno to have a lot of time on the ball and work his way into dangerous positions to take a lot of shots today. \n\nArmenia doesn't have much to play for in this one. After their 5-0 thrashing at home in the reverse fixture in September and an overall disappointing performance in the qualifiers, all they have left to play for is pride. Therefore, I don't expect them to park the bus and sit back. This could wind up being an end to end game and I don't expect Armenia to hesitate to send players forward on attacks. I like Bruno (who hates defending) to also try to exploit counterattacks in these situations as well. \n\nI tend to try to keep my picks closer to plus money, but I really like this one today and still think there's value here. \n\nBOL and happy Sunday!",

      "text": "Record: 8-1\n\nNet Units: +6.55\n\nLast Pick: Nico Collins over 21.5 longest reception (-110) 1U ✅\n\nNFL | Seahawks @ Rams 4:05 ET\n\nPick: Terrance Ferguson over 12.5 longest reception (-110) 1U\n\nWrite-Up: Ever since week 5, the Rams have revolutionized their offense as well as creating notice in the analytics community with their high percentage of 2 and 3 TE sets. Since week 5, they’ve had the highest 2 and 3 TE personnel usage in the league and with this has come the emergence of rookie TE Terrance Ferguson. With so many plays using multiple TEs, Fergusons usage has increased. In the last 3 weeks, he’s run 12, 10, and 13 routes with 3, 3, and 4 targets in those games. In all the games before that he had 14 routes run and 1 target combined. \n\nThis means that he has seen a nice increase in usage and this is accompanied by Coach McVay’s positive coach speak about him. He recently said “how dumb am I to not figure out ways to get this guy involved?” He has done just that as he’s had multiple designed plays for Ferguson downfield, including on the opening play of last week’s game, which just indicates their love and trust in him.\n\nWhat I like about the longest reception prior to is that he has had plenty of downfield targets. In the last 3 weeks, he’s had 85, 56, and 88 air yards, which is insane for a 12.5 longest reception prop. He has cleared the line of 12.5 in 4/5 last weeks with catches of 21, 31, 36, and 32 yards. So we have had plenty of wiggle room as of late. The Rams are also playing the Seahawks who have been prone to giving up big plays to opposing TEs. Just last week they allowed McBride a reception of 24 yards and backup TE Elijah Higgins a catch of 12 yards. They have allowed 8 catches of 20 or more yards to TEs this year, which again is a lot of wiggle room for this line. They have also given up the 2nd most receptions and receiving yards to TEs this year, so they are just a defense overall that leaks production to the TE position.",

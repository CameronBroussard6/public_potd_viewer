His minutes played per game are stable (32 minutes per game on average over last 10 games and 32 minutes+ for 7/10 of them). This is my first POTD.\n\nBest of luck to all!",

Hoffenheim ML\n\nToday’s Pick: Man City ML and Under 4.5 Match Goals v Galatasaray\n\nCompetition: Champions League \n\nSport: Football\n\nOdds: 11/10\n\nReasoning: Manchester City are 11th on 13 points in the new UCL league format, so this is a must-win to secure a top-8 place and avoid the playoff round, which pushes City toward control-first game management rather than an end-to-end shootout. They’ve conceded 9 goals in 7 UCL games, and their wins in this phase typically land in the 2–0 / 2–1 / 3–1 range, keeping totals under 4.5. Galatasaray sit 17th with a neutral 9:9 goal difference, are unlikely to dominate possession away from home, and generally need City errors rather than open chaos to score, which suits a City win without the game blowing out. Add Erling Haaland rested at the weekend, and the most likely script is City winning efficiently rather than chasing a high scoreline.\n\nUnits: 2\n\n[Buy me a beer or coffee ☕️ 🍺](https://www.paypal.com/ncp/payment/833MDWKA7GUVA)",

Bet 1.1u\n\nWriteup: Hey it ain’t broke don’t fix it. Let’s go for another alt spread parlay to hit +40u! I have more than a 1.1u confidence in this, so feel free to throw a couple more units on top if you wish.\n\nLet’s start with Sam Houston vs Missouri State. I have a separate bet taking them at the ML as a + money play, and frankly, I do not understand why they are the underdog beyond being the away team. I would give the slightest advantage to Missouri State with offensive rebounding, and they will likely have more free throw opportunities, but that’s really it. Sam Houston has a more quality record given their opponents, are more consistent,  have a better offense and defense, I could keep going. The pace of play between these teams are also drastically different, just like our Providence bet last night. Sam Houston has a top 30 pace of play in the league, whereas Missouri State is below 300th. If you want to play slow, you need to be efficient. Unfortunately for Missouri State, both their offense and defense ranks just inside the top 200. Sam Houston plays up tempo with an offense nearly top 100 and a defense in the top 80. If you don’t believe me, Sam Houston is 80 teams higher than Missouri State in Ken Pom rankings. Sam Houston being underdogs is crazy to me, so crazy that it makes me wonder Vegas knows something. To be safe, let’s give ourselves a +6.5 point cushion.\n\nNow for Wisconsin vs Minnesota. Here we have yet another example of teams with opposite paces of play. Both teams play rather inconsistently but are both playing well recently. The big edge for me in this one is Wisconsin’s gameplay at home vs Minnesota’s gameplay away. Minnesota is the 362nd best team away…yeah. On top of that, Minnesota may be without Cade Tyson. Wisconsin is the faster paced team in this one, and yet I expect them to not turn the ball over much against this Minnesota team as Wisconsin does a great job of limiting unforced errors. Wisconsin is comfortably the better team in this one, but given both teams can have some inconsistencies to their game, we’ll bring their spread down to -2.5.\n\nRemember to only bet what you can afford to lose, and BOL!",

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 9-5\n\n**Last:** Toumani Camara o19.5 pra (-132) DraftKings 2u ✅\n\n**Event:** NBA: Warriors @ Jazz 9:10 pm EST\n\n**Today’s POTD:** Lauri Markkanen o31.5 pra (-120) FanDuel 2.5u\n\n**Write-up:** To start, when Markkanen plays at least 30 minutes without Kessler, he is 19 out of 26 for the season. Keyonte George is supposed to play today after having a rest day yesterday. Nurkic is doubtful due to an illness, but he covers well with or without him. The Warriors are defending the power forward position pretty well, ranking 11th. Markkanen has covered in 9 out of 14 games versus teams that defend power forwards 15th or better. The Warriors are struggling without Butler. Their defense has fallen off a cliff. In their last five, they rank:\n\n* 23rd in assists allowed\n* 30th in rebounds allowed\n* 24th in free throws allowed\n* 23rd in threes\n* 6th inside the paint\n\nMark has the highest usage on the team, plus against the Warriors, he totes a team high 32% usage rate. Mark takes advantage of teams that cannot defend the three, where he takes 30% of his shots, averaging 8 3PA a game. Mark is also able to score at will inside the restricted area, regardless of how well a team defends it, which is also true with the paint. Mark loves running a lot of off-screen plays, where he gets the majority of his points. The Warriors struggle defending off-ball screens, ranking 18th. When teams rank 12th or worse, Mark has covered in 13 out of 14 games. \n\nVersus teams that allow a ton of assists, Mark is destroying his PRA line, grabbing 36 or more consistently versus teams that rank 16th or worse. Doesn't matter if it's all season or last 5/10/15 games, he covers at 80%+. Same with the rebounds, which sit around 72%. Warriors are also running a moderately high pace, which Mark covers 85% in high-paced games. Mark's line is way too low, disrespectful, really. He has covered in 13 of his last 15, not counting last night's, since he got benched with 9 minutes to play. Mark has also covered every home back-to-back this season, going 40, 37, and 44.\n\nGood luck today! Let's keep it rolling.",

He averages right around double-digit points in the first quarter and the Knicks clearly make it a priority to get him going from the jump. His usage is high immediately and he’s usually taking most of the shots in the first 6 to 8 minutes.\n\nI also like this spot on a back-to-back. He’s historically solid in these situations and doesn’t really come out passive. If anything, New York leans on him more to stabilize the offense early.\n\nWe already cashed this yesterday at worse odds, and now we’re getting plus money on the same number. Nothing crazy or flashy here, just a spot where the stats and role line up well with the line.\n\nTaking 8.5 at +110 all day.",

Anyways we will be looking to start a new streak. The New York Rangers are Playing the New York Islanders in a rivalry game. In net for the Islanders is David Rittich, he has a save percentage of .902 and a 2.57 goals against average this season. On the other side, the Rangers have Spencer Martin in net, who has a save percentage of .865 and a 3.00 goals against average but that is on a very small sample size this season and he has shown better stats before. Both teams played on Monday so neither team has more than 2 days rest and it is a rivalry game which always tend to be close and low scoring with less risk taking. Offensively both teams are not good, the Islanders rank 25th in goals on the season and only rank 18th in shots on goal. The Rangers are slightly worse, ranking 26th in goals and also rank 26th in shots on goal. With it being a rivalry game, and this matchup specifically, we will likely see another low scoring matchup between 2 alright goalies and some low powered offences.\n\nTake The Under 6.5 Goals!",

Also, they've lost their last 2 games in La Liga with their next game being against Osasuna **in three days**. My prediction is they rest key players and try to get through the game without conceding too many goals so that they can perform well at Osasuna.\n\nFor Bayer Leverkusen, they also have a game in 3 days against Eintracht Frankfurt however, I believe they'll risk player fitness to win this UCL game since it guarantees them a playoff spot.\n\n  \nGood luck if you tail!🍀",

After the frustrating 3-2 loss to Manchester United over the weekend, Mikel Arteta is going to demand a clinical response to ensure they finish the league phase with a perfect eight-from-eight record. Martinelli was on the bench for a good chunk of that United game, meaning he should be the freshest person on the pitch and absolutely desperate to prove he belongs in the starting XI for the knockout rounds.\nThere is also the psychological factor of the \"UCL Buff\" that seems to follow certain players.\n\nFor whatever reason, Martinelli has found his clinical edge in this competition, scoring against heavyweights like Bayern and Atletico earlier in his run. If he can do it against the big dicks of Europe, a home game against a Kazakhstan side struggling at the bottom of the table should offer him plenty of sights at goal. Expect him to be drifting inside and making those trademark back post runs that Saka loves to find, especially as Kairat’s legs start to slow a bit in the second half. BoL",

Truthfully tho id really advise against 10.5 feel like its a bit much even if it is doable.\n\nAlright currently Devin is under a minutes restriction of around 20-27 minutes a game. Meaning that Julian should see minutes enough to put up 8.5 points. He has hit this line im using at 13/14 games with one game being at 7 meaning he was one bucket short. Julian Champagnie played the Rockets twice this year and had 27 and 22 points. \n\nI think this could be risky tbh due to the fact that they are most likely going to adjust for him however I think Julian and Harrison being the main shooters present a lot of opportunities due to the way this roster is designed. Fox, Castle and Harper are all guards essentially and they open a lot of space which is even more annoying when you have an alien in the paint forcing a lot of attention to anchor the paint due to guards penetrating and then Wemby trying to rebound as well, leaving shooters open. Truthfully his shooting volume has been decent enough to achieve 8.5 and with 30 minutes it should hopefully be enough for him but tbh I like this play due to the pricing error so.",

He looked dejected and the body language was quite off. 3 hours later,  it happened. The absolute destruction of his bowlers. 150 target chased in a mere 10 overs. If you think this is brutal, it is worth noting that something greater happened 5 days ago. Newzealand batted first and scored an impressive total of 210. Chasing that, India were 6/2, thier best batter dismissed for a duck. You'd think New Zealand might have a chance. But in reality, that target was chased in 15 overs. Surya Kumar Yadav, the most out of form batter in the Indian team, brought back to his best. \n\nYou'd think this is a one time thing that happened in a T20 match. But this is the way the Indian T20 cricket team has played for the last 1-2 years. Abhishek Sharma as an opener is a cheat code. He doesn't just hit you for a few boundaries, but he does that to you from ball 1. No blocking around the first few balls to see how that ball behaves. Apart from Sanju Samson , everyone looked in quite a nice form. The above mentioned totals were chased without involving Hardik Pandya , Rinku Singh and Shivam Dube. Now that's the batting depth a team would dream of.\n\nComing to our 6 overs aka Powerplay bet here , the last 3 matches of Indian powerplay fetched : 68,75 and 94(!)\n\nThis approach of destroying bowlers morale right from the ball one is a bold approach as it could go wrong but what makes this team even more dangerous is that the next batsman carries the same approach. The series is already sealed( 3-0 India). Only 2 matches remain before the home World Cup kicks off next month. Now it's about consolidating their position as the best T20 team in the world and sending a message to the rest of the field. Sanju Samson is short of runs and is under  extreme pressure of being replaced by Ishan Kishan . Abhishek, Ishan Kishan, Surya Kumar are in splendid form. \n\nI truly feel the line is a bit too low for this dangerous top 3-4. This isn't to disrespect the New Zealand bowling as they have some quality seamers and Mitchell Santner in a quality spinner. It will be interesting to see how they come up against the Indian side. \n\nIn no way this is to say is a 100% sure bet. But I'd like to believe I'd win this bet more often than not , with the context being the same. Granted I haven't won much these days and my record is negative now, but a good win is around the corner and hopefully it could be today. \n\nGood luck if you're tailing or fading 🏏",

Unfortunately for him, however, Sinner is in a different stratosphere.\n\nSinner has won 8 straight matches against Shelton, all within the last 2.5 years. What's even more impressive is that Sinner hasn't dropped a single set, meaning he has won 19 straight sets vs Shelton. They played in the semis of AO last year, and Sinner won with ease 76(2) 62 62. His dominance continued throughout 2025, winning another 3 against Shelton in straight sets, including a major at Wimbeldon.  \n\nTwo players come to mind when I think of Sinner's dominance: ADM and Shelton. Despite ADM and Shelton having wildly different play styles, Sinner just has their numbers. Shelton is known for his serve and power. He's the opposite of a pusher, he's always going for winners. Unfortunately, while Sinner is a jack of all trades, master of all, his serve return and baseline play are the best in the game. His ability to rally with incredible pace and placement are unparalleled. I've noticed that Shelton gets frustrated by these types of players, leading him to go for more winners in bad positions and make more unforced errors.\n\nI see this match going the same way the last 8 have. 4 units instead of my usual 2\n\n*Tail or fade, BOL!*",

However, I don’t know who will guard LeBron on the Cavs. Garland and Mobley are out. Hunter and Merrill are day to day, and both may be out tomorrow. Even if they are not, neither matches well again LeBron. \n\nJaylon Tyson and Dean Wade are average defenders but will likely require help defense when LeBron drives as he is likely to beat them off the ball or on a post up. This should increase his assist opportunity, as well as no Mobley for the Cavs. As for the +8.5, I thought the Lakers would be favored, so give me the points. The Cavs are hurt and hurt bad (no Mobley or Garland and potentially no Merrill or Hunter). The Cavs have not played well the more they have to piece meal their line up. You have a fully healthy Lakers team, in what might be LeBron’s last time in Cleveland. I expect a show from him.

It's one thing to narrowly lose with a line this tight. But this was total, complete, and absolute annihilation. Are we sure Creighton used five players on the court? It was that bad. The Bluejays shot 2-for-17 from 3 in the first half, turned the ball over eight times, and let Marquette run them out of the gym en route to a 52-23 halftime lead. I'm stunned by how bad Creighton looked. If all you did was count Marquette's points in the paint in the first half, they still would've gone to the break up 11. Insanely bad basketball. If I'm Coach McDermott, I'm making the guys find their own way back to Omaha. These Bluejays are third in the Big East standings, but they looked like they wouldn't win the SWAC. \"Fun\" stat: This was the largest halftime deficit for Creighton in 33 years. Oh, and their first possession coming out of the break? An airball. Somewhere out there, a Marquette super fan cashed a 50,000:1 ticket. ...Creighton is now perma-banned.*\n\nTrends. That's my play for this one. East Carolina (6-14) plays host to Rice (8-12) in a battle of who could care less in the American Athletic Conference. But there will be a basketball game played and a winner announced nonetheless. My thesis is simple. ECU doesn't tend to cover, and Rice is a negligibly better team according to KenPom. Quick aside: I'm putting a half unit on Rice moneyline at +105.\n\nEast Carolina is 7-12 ATS this season - 4-7 ATS at home, 2-5 ATS in conference, and 3-7 ATS over their last 10 games.\n\nRice is only 10-8 ATS this season, but 5-3 ATS on the road, 5-2 ATS in conference, and 7-3 ATS over their last ten games. Rice is also 4-2 ATS in its last six games against ECU.\n\nRice has the perimeter advantage. The Owls are making 36.6 percent from 3, and rank second in the AAC in that area. On the other hand, ECU is beyond terrible. The Pirates are hitting 26.8 percent (364th in NCAA). Rice is also more reliable at the free-throw line. If this game comes down to the charity stripe, the Owls are 4 percent better. They also have a significantly higher offensive rating (198 to 324), according to KenPom. I like Rice to shoot the 3 and keep their covering ways. Full disclosure: the majority of the money is on ECU, and I *did* go with Marquette yesterday so.... \n\nGood luck and Godspeed!\n\nIf I've made you a few bucks through fades, it's just gonna ask you a few questions: [https://buymeacoffee.com/seventh\\_\\_place](https://buymeacoffee.com/seventh__place)",

You can't make this stuff up. \n\nOff to the final day of Champion's League lewgue play and we have a doozy here. PSG host Newcastle in a march to secure a berth in the top 8. Winner takes a top 8 spot and loser will likely fall out of the top 8. If they draw, they likely both miss out on top 8. So expecting attacking focus here for both teams. Top 8 means an automatic place in the knockout stage, below that teams have to play a 2 leg playoff to make it to the top 16 knockout. Basically the loser has to play 2 more games, which is huge this point in the season.\n\nYou guys know Big Nick/The Lanky German/Woltemade is one of my favorite players to back. Checks all the boxes I look for - chases everything, loves to shoot, great in the air. He has fallen out of favor as Wissa has come back from injury, but I'm banking on him getting a start here and Newcastle stretching the pitch (maybe even starting 2 up front?). He is well rested and makes sense here. The other reason I love this is that PSG's tallest defender is 6'2, their other starting center back is 6' even. Woltemade is 6'6\" tall, he is going to tower over the PSG defenders and cause a lot of problems in the air. Love him in this spot, hopefully coach Howe sees it the same way and starts our guy up front. As always for these SOT plays, feel free to wait for lineups if your book doesn't void for players not starting. I like this play even if he comes off the bench though. \n\nBOL and happy Wednesday!",

First tournament for Zweih since leaving Spirit and he showed out in a big way\n* This line is strictly set looking at L3 month KPR which both players have similar numbers with Zweih at .60 and Susp at .61, however Zweih only joined PARIVISION a month ago and is playing completely different spots then from when he was on Spirit so this data can basically be thrown out. Zweih is averaging a .75 KPR in the last month since joining PARIVISION and has been their highest rated and best player so far.\n* Susp on the other hand has been HEROIC's lowest rated player amongst starters since the roster change as mentioned above at a .61 KPR. On top if this already massive KPR gap, PARIVISION are the favorites in this series at -250 odds making this a huge KPR gap and strong favorites as well making it a fantastic spot to target.\n* PARIVISION are picking their map 2nd, see no other map they would pick here besides Dust 2. It is HEROIC's second lowest winrate map as a roster, a map 2/3 of their players heavily struggle on, and PARIVISION are 100% win rate on the map in the L3 months as a roster\n* Susp has always struggled on Dust 2 averaging a .47 KPR since joining HEROIC and a .53 KPR in 2025. He typically plays B anchor and has struggled heavily on the map for that reason as B anchor is one of the worst spots for kills in the entire game on any map\n* Zweih has been fantastic on Dust 2 since joining PARIVISION while only a small sample, he has averaged a .95 KPR, a +.20 KPR increase overall, while his T sides specifically have been insanely good with a 1.04 KPR on T side (offense) where he would start on the map",

Arsenal lost to Man U not Liverpool.  Odds of 1.91 as of posting yesterday and it is the usual 3 units.  I was in a bit of a hurry so boob boos were made.",

Not quite bad enough to make me want to take a big break (after all, Negritu threw away the first set and won a higher % of service points), but I am planning to start being more selective and taking more days off, as I did yesterday.\n\nToday, I'm jumping into the two-leg game for the first time. This is not something I expected to do, but I've realized that it just opens up so many more options. This is especially true for Challenger matches, where many markets aren't open  until shortly before the match, and there's no great way to play matches involving big favorites within odds restrictions. \n\nThe first leg, Korda 2-0, is definitely the \"safe\" leg in this parlay, but I'm not only taking it as an odds booster. Korda has had disappointing results in his last two tournaments, losing to Kokkinakis in Adelaide and Zheng at the Australian Open, but he still comes into this Challenger 100 as the clear title favorite. Even if Korda has some unresolved issues in his game, I do believe his raw ballstriking should be enough to take care of business against Milavsky, who mostly plays ITFs and tends to rely a lot on his serve. \n\nPatrick Kypson comes into this tournament after a four-set loss to Comesaña at the Australian Open, but I don't feel like that's any kind of embarrasing result, given how much Fran tends to raise his level at Slams (he even took a set over Tiafoe in the next round). Kypson was one of the more consistent players on the US Challenger circuit last season, winning Little Rock and Sioux Falls along with SFs in Tyler and Cary. In fact, he actually faced Zink in Little Rock, and was able to score a pretty comfortable 6-4, 6-4 win. Zink's form has really dipped to start the year, and given his long odds against Piros and Kozlov, I have to think that Kypson should be an even bigger favorite here. Zink has a consistent game with a strong backhand, but he tends to look outclassed when he plays high-end CH players, and Kypson's serve and forehand should be deciding factors here.",

Olympiacos fit that profile well — they usually score in European matches and aren’t shy about pushing numbers forward when opportunities arise.\nRecent form supports goals from both sides, and neither team has been reliable at keeping clean sheets in continental play. With Ajax’s tempo and Olympiacos’ ability to capitalize on defensive gaps, it’s hard to see this staying low-scoring.

First up are the bottom two teams in their respective groups, HANJIN BRION and DRX.\n\nHANJIN BRION (0-4) have been a punching bag ever since their entry into the league. They're consistently a bottom 4 team and seldom make the playoffs in any of the splits throughout the year. They are a fan favourite though, because they have the very annoying tendency to upset the best teams in the league. They've not had the best start to the season but they've been competitive, taking a game away in 3 of 4 matches they've played.\n\nDRX (1-3) are looking pretty good, the match record doesn't really reflect it, but like BRION, they've taken games away in 2 of 3 series they lost and won a series 2-1. Both teams today were the underdog on almost every series they've played.\n\nBRION average 4.27 total dragons/game, DRX average 4.36, which is quite high considering they are almost always behind and cant contest dragons. On Map 1, BRION average 4.5 total dragons, DRX average 4.25 total. In Week 2, BRION hit the over on the same line on 4 of 6 games, DRX hit the over on 3 of 6. Despite being severe underdogs, both teams are managing to contest dragons to clear the line.\n\nThis is probably the most even matchup for both so far and evenly matched teams tend to go long. Longer games = more chances to take dragons and up the count. A win today would massively increase the likelihood of either team being in contention for the playoffs, so there's extra emphasis to perform. As with every Map 1 bet, these games tend to be slower, teams don't want to jump the gun only to fall flat and go down 0-1 in the series. Since both teams are not quite as skilled, they'll rely on neutral objectives to help finish the game. It is crucial for them to contest and not allow one or the other to snowball the dragon count for this same reason. I expect a close fight to open this Best of 5 and allow the dragon count to rack up and clear the line. BOL!\n\n**Map 1 - Over 4.5 Total Dragons (1.72) 2u to win 1.44u**",

If Arsenal score quickly, the match could open up completely, leading to a one-sided goal fest with five or more goals.",

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 11-35-5 *Barcelona looked completely out of it in the first half, but then they remembered they have a sigmabale pick to kill and started spamming goals. Oviedo kindly gifted them two and then Yamal scored a crazy bicycle kick from the edge of the box (because of course he did) to slam another L on the board. I took a couple days off because I didn't like the look of any games out there, but the Champions League is back, and so am I*\n\n**Last Five:** ❌❌✅❌❌\n\n**Event:** Champions League, FC Barcelona v FC Copenhagen, 3:00 pm EST\n\n**POTD:** FC Copenhagen +2.0, +2.5 Asian Handicap, +110, 4 units\n\n**Write Up:** This bet does ring a bell, but we lost the last one because of some 1/100 type goals and I doubt Barcelona are pulling off more black magic this time. Copenhagen are a very respectable team and they have everything to play for as they chase a qualification spot. Barcelona need a win, preferrably by at least 2 goals to stand a chance of finishing in the top 8 spots and securing an automatic pass to the round of 16. I don't back them to win by a big margin though. They're going to be vulnerable on the counters and they've already proven **their defence in the Champions league is more than shakey.** They **conceded twice to a team from the Czech Republic that hadn't played a competitive match in over a month** and let's not even bring up what happened when they **visited the Stamford Bridge.**\n\nMake no mistake, *Barcelona are clearly the favorites for this clash,* but it's not going to be straightforward. **Copenhagen are in some pretty good form** themselves, remaining **undefeated in the last three CL games,** with two wins and a draw, and they're **undefeated in the last five games in all competitions,** which is nothing to scoff at.\n\n**Barcelona also miss many key players,** for example, their whole midfield is out. Yes, **Pedri, de Jong, and Gavi** are all set to miss today's fixture, and the team always plays worse without them. Meanwhile, **Raphinha still doesn't seem to be at 100% fitness.** His intensity and pressing are crucial for Barcelona's gameplay and he might not be able to provide that to the usual full extent.\n\nOverall, I have a faint suspicion Barcelona are taking the three points today, but it's going to be a narrow one and I could even see them being stunned by the talented Copenhagen team. All in all, Barcelona are definitely there for the taking, so I'm going in with 4 whole units for this one. BOL and let's enjoy another Flick masterclass ☘️🫡",

      "text": "2026 record: 10-9 (+4.0 units)\n\n2025 record: 55-41 (+26.5 units)\n\nLast 10 (most recent on right):  ❌✅✅❌✅❌✅❌✅✅\n\nLast Pick: Carlos Alcaraz 🇪🇸 3-0 vs Alex De Minaur 🇦🇺 ✅\n\nEvent: Australian Open QF 🎾\n\nPick of the Day: Jannik Sinner 🇮🇹 3-0 vs Ben Shelton 🇺🇸 5 units to win 4.2U @1.83 (Bet365)\n\nThe fact I’m going with back to back straight set victories in grand slam quarters tells you all about the dynamics of tennis. It’s quite literally Sincaraz vs the field at the moment. Out of the up-and-comers the only two players I could see challenge them and potentially win even just one slam in the next few years would be Draper and Fils (+ Djokovic on a good day currently). Surprising selections to some maybe but despite their fitness issues are the only players that imo can consistently take the game to their opponents. \n\nAnyways this is proving to be a very difficult match-up for Shelton having lost his last 19 sets against the Italian (8 consecutive straight set losses, 3 in slams). Ben can count himself lucky to have won their first encounter in 2023 as I would fear a De Minaur-Sinner lopsided H2H remake between these two. Jannik has shown some weakness at a tournament for once to prove he’s in fact human when he was very close to retiring down a break in the third set against wild card Spizzirri in round 3. That was down to cramps though as a result of the insane heat in Melbourne and there won’t be such issues for this match. Other than that it’s pretty much been business as usual having benefitted of Gaston’s retirement in round 1, a beatdown of Duckworth in round 2 and a comfortable victory over Darderi last round, who despite playing out of his mind towards the end of the third set still lost in straight sets. \n\nShelton meanwhile has been playing very well having only dropped a set thus far against Ruud in the fourth round. He’s one of the best servers in the world and has a very explosive forehand. Unfortunately that’s just not enough to truly trouble Sinner which is kind of nuts. Ben’s return game is simply not good enough to be competitive on Sinner’s service game and Jannik’s return game (being the best on tour) is too good to make the American’s serve a deadly weapon. The problem with that is that Shelton therefore can’t get enough free points from his biggest strength to hold comfortably (unless serving first serves at an unsustainable rate which is his only chance) and causes rallies to take place, more so as the match goes on. At that point Sinner largely has the upper hand being the perfect blend of power and consistency from the baseline we have ever seen. On the other side you have a Shelton whose rally tolerance is miles worse than Sinner’s and you have a recipe for the No. 2 coming on top of the majority points if the serve is returned. A really bad match-up for Shelton, whose lefty game catches Sinner’s incredible backhand, and was broken 6 times in their match-up last year in their semi final match in Australia. I would say fair odds should be closer to 1.66 as Shelton’s serve could catch fire for a set and scam a tiebreak but even then has easily lost his last 7 TB’s against the Italian and I strongly suspect we will see another routine win for Sinner.

Those numbers only get more impressive against Top 10 visitors, as the team has won six of the last nine. That includes then-No. 2 Houston in a 68-67 thriller back in 2024. In fact, the Horned Frogs (13-7) have won four of the last five meetings at home against the Cougars (17-2). And although Houston has not lost back-to-back games since the 2023-24 season, the last time the team did so was against Iowa State and…yep, you guessed it… at TCU. \n\nI can hear you all now: Sooooo why exactly are we waging our hard-earned coin on this?\n\nThere certainly is some cause for alarm, but hear me out. Following a lackluster defensive effort against Arizona State, the Cougars defense was almost non-existent in a 90-86 loss at No. 12 Texas Tech on Saturday. And with the 90 points allowed being the most conceded by Houston since February of 2018, you can bet head coach Kelvin Sampson will have his squad locked in for this one—especially given the recent history at TCU. Not to mention, since the start of the 2024 season, his team is 8-1 straight up following a loss, including seven double-digit victories while only allowing opponents to average 55.6 points. \n\nIf the Cougars expect to right the ship, they will need to rely on its elite defense to return to form. \n\nThrough 19 games, the unit ranks 1st in scoring defense (61.6 PPGA), 4th in defensive efficiency (0.904), 17th in opponent field-goal percentage (39.4%) and 66th in opponent three-point shooting (31.2%). That should lead to tough sledding for a Horned Frogs offense that finds itself among the middle of the pack, ranking 85th in scoring (80.0 PPG), 102nd in field-goal percentage (46.2%), 105th in offensive efficiency (1.096) and 165th in three-point shooting (34.2%). It’s a unit that thrives in transition, ranking 17th in fast break points (15.8 PPG; 96th percentile). Unfortunately for TCU, Houston just so happens to be stellar in defending just that, ranking 8th in opponent fast break points (5.5 PPG; 98th percentile). \n\nOn the other end of the floor, a resurgent Cougars offense should make a difference. \n\nAlthough the unit has been solid overall—38th in offensive efficiency (1.160), 96th in scoring (79.1 PPG), 148th in field-goal percentage (45.1%) and 152nd in three-point shooting (34.4%)—it has certainly raised its level of play as of late. Over the team’s last three outings, Houston has averaged 88.7 points on 49.7% shooting from the field (38.6% from beyond the arc). In fact, since the turn of the calendar year, the team actually ranks 3rd in adjusted offensive efficiency (129.8), per Torvik. Coming off a stellar 42-point showing on Saturday, look for freshman guard Kingston Flemings (17.0 PPG) to lead the effort to pick apart a stingy TCU defense that enters ranked 31st in defensive efficiency (0.964), 79th in scoring defense (70.4 PPGA), 107th in opponent field-goal percentage (43.0%) and 146th in opponent three-point shooting (33.3%). Second-chance opportunities will go a long way in this one, as the Cougars rank 24th in second-chance points (14.5 PPG; 93rd percentile) while the Horned Frogs rank just 134th in opponent second-chance points (10.6 PPGA; 63rd percentile). \n\nFinally, the turnover battle should be the X factor on Wednesday night. \n\nForcing opponent miscues has been somewhat of staple for this Houston defense, as the unit ranks 5th in turnovers forced per possession (22.4%), 8th in turnovers forced (15.3 per game) and 34th in steals (8.7). But what makes the team even more dangerous is how it converts those opportunities into points, ranking 7th in points off turnovers (20.2 PPG; 98th percentile). That could be an issue for a TCU offense that has been careless as times with the basketball, ranking 95th in turnovers per possession (15.4%), 127th in turnovers (11.3) and 129th in opponent steals (6.3). And while the Horned Frogs do a good job forcing turnovers themselves—33rd in turnovers forced (14.5), 35th in turnovers forced per possession (19.8%) and 87th in steals (7.7)—the Cougars are among the nation’s best in limiting such mistakes, ranking 1st in opponent steals (4.6), 2nd in turnovers (8.5) and 6th in turnovers per possession (12.5%).\n\nLook for Houston to get back in the win column with a convincing effort.\n\nBOL if tailing, and as always, please do so responsibly. One bet should not have you crashing out all over Reddit.",

They just dropped a series to Nemesis and struggled big time against Kukuys. This YB squad has veteran star power like BoBoKa, flyfly, but their coordination has been hit-or-miss. Rekonix, led by inYourdreaM and Fbz, has been a far more cohesive unit. Even with the loss to Vici Gaming who are arguably the tournament favorites, Rekonix plays cleaner, more disciplined Dota, and their overall macro play has been sharper than YB's current brawl-heavy style. I'd rather trust Rekonix's system than flip a coin on YB figuring it out today.\n\nOn the other side, Vici Gaming is the favorite on paper, but they haven't been invincible they dropped a map in their recent 2-1 series against Rekonix. Team Nemesis, on the other hand is coming off a massive confidence boosting 2-0 win over Execration. Their roster is stacked with individual talent, specifically 23savage and Mac, who have the carry potential to take over a game single handedly. Nemesis might not win the series, but they have enough firepower to punish Vici’s drafts and secure at least one game. Taking the +1.5 handicap gives us a safety net in what should be a contested series.\n\n\nBOL.\n\nhttps://buymeacoffee.com/222benz",

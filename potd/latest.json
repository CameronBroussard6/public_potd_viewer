Utah likes to run, but Memphis doesn’t live in that tempo for four quarters. At home they’re much more comfortable in the half court, and that alone can shave a few possessions off what books are expecting here.\n\nMemphis also isn’t efficient enough offensively to support a 240+ total for a full game. They go through scoring droughts and rely heavily on jump shooting, which creates cold stretches. If they land somewhere in the 108–115 range, Utah would need a ceiling shooting night to push this over.\n\nIf Utah leads, Memphis slows it down. If Memphis leads, pace drops naturally. If it’s tight late, you get more half-court possessions and clock burn. Most realistic paths point under this number.\n\nOne of those spots where they’re just going to have to beat me if it flies over.",

Continuing with the system of the 19 year old Macklin Celebrini to score a goal in the semi-final olympic game today. He not sits atop all the Olympic goal scorers and there is no reason to think he will not continue on this path. Canada has a puck line of -2.5. \n\nShould this pick not hit I will continue to make the same pick going forward until it does. I double my units after each loss.

He’s won a set in their last 2 matchups and covered the 4.5 game spread in all but one of their 2 out of 3 set matches.\n\n4.5 games is a lot for Alcaraz to cover in a 2 out of 3 set match, especially against a motivated and confident Rublev.\n\nGood Luck!",

Marner is having himself an excellent Olympics. He has a point in every game so far, 5 total in 4 games. Unconfirmed, but I've read projections that he's getting moved to the 2nd line. With this being the semis, the lines will be shortened and he should get a small boost to playing time. I'd estimate at bare minimum, 16 solid minutes, ideally 18+. With him also on the 2nd PP line, the opportunities will be there.\n\nFinland has one shutdown defenseman in Mikkola and one very good defensive forward in Roope Hintz, but the rest of the squad is average to below average in xGA/60. Canada's team total is set at 3.5, with the over being favored. If Canada scores 4, I like the chances of Marner getting involved.",

Just keeps getting better with each start, and finally got a good run and showed its tremendous talent. Leads and wins again.      \n       \nNow for the actual write up of the main pick. SNS has been great all prep, and now lines up in a 6 horse field devoid of speed and talent. Our outside barrier is offset by the small field, and we claim away from the 62kgs down to 60, which means we aren’t giving away a whole lot of weight to the field.      \n       \nAlways thought this horse would we better over a mile, and after two 1400m runs we now step up to it. The last start 3rd to PARADISE CITY (third fave in the mannerism tomoz) is miles better than anything in this field could hope to accomplish, and as along as we get the initial part of the race right (GO FORWARD) then we should be good.

      "text": "Record: 0-0\nNet Units: NA\nROI: NA\n CS2 / 3AM EST\nPick: Paravision vs Falcons Map 1 Jame o13.5 kills -118 1u\nWrite Up: Out of the 10 maps Paravision has played on de_dust2 this year, Jame has hit this line in 8/10 of them (17.7 avg kills). The only two times he went under were due to blowouts wins (13-1, 13-4). Paravision boasts a 78% win rate across 14 matches of Dust 2, due in part to Jame’s stellar calling and AWPing.  Paravision is just about guaranteed to select this map and I do not see them blowing out a top 5 team with superstar talent such as Falcons. De_dust 2 is Paravision’s playground. A map in which they are capable of defeating any team in the world. Jame is Parvision’s AWPer and captain. De_dust 2 also lends itself to the AWPing role quite well, with it historically being a pop off map for AWPers given the long site lines on each lane of the map. Without a strong AWPing performance, your chances of winning Dust 2 decrease significantly. With Jame being the captain and IGL, he will put himself in positions to succeed with the AWP in order to give his team the best opportunity to win the match.  The only negative factors I am able to locate regarding this wager are the blowout potential (low) and an AWP H2H vs a top 3 player in the world mOnesy (doesnt directly affect Jame’s kill total).

Their opponent for this bronze medal match is Norway who somehow snuck into the playoffs before losing to Canada in the other semi final. Switzerland has been the best team all week while Norway has been one of the worst when looking closer at their stats. The Swiss will have a significant advantage at every position except fourth where they still have a slight heads up on Norway. Switzerland came into the event with a 46-16 season record, including 16-1 against teams outside the world top 25 (such as Norway). Norway came in at 37-26 and 1-6 against top 10 teams. Their most recent match before the Olympics, Switzerland won 7-4 at Worlds last year. In their round robin match at these Olympics, Switzerland won 10-4. Should be an easy cover.",

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 18-43-5 *Sigmabale classics are back y’all. The team we backed, Drita, was down 2-0 by half time, before taking the game under full control and scoring two goals themselves. They were millimetres away from the third, but then Celje hit them on a counter and scored in the literal last second. That was a real bad beat, so bad in fact, it made me switch sports for today. Still more hits than losses in the last 5 so gotta at least look at the positives. Plus, today’s Friday so that’s a positive in itself*\n\n**Last Five:** ✅✅❌✅❌\n\n**Event:** Winter Olympics, Canada v Finland, 10:40 am EST\n\n**POTD:** Finland +2.5 Spread, -137, 1 unit\n\n**Write Up:** *I’ll preface this by saying Canada might be the big favorite,* but we’ve seen far too many underdogs turn up in these Olympics recently. In the light of that, I just can’t help, but think Finland should easily cover the spread. It’s an important game with a lot at stake so neither team is coming out all guns blazing, and I think a blowout is unlikely.\n\nCanada have **struggled big time in the previous round,** requiring a late equalizer to send the game to overtime where they just about overpowered the spirited Czech Republic. Meanwhile, Finland showed grit themselves by completing a **stunning comeback** before dumping Switzerland out of the competition. Finland have troubled the Canadians in the past, so I don’t think this is going to be a straightforward one. *Make no mistake, I think team Canada is winning this,* but not by 3 or more goals. **Jordan Binnington is far too unreliable** in net and they just **can’t find a solid defensive pairing.** Finland can be tricky and should never be counted out, as they showed against Switzerland, as well as in their most recent H2H where the Canadians were already up by 4 goals before Finland scored 3 in quick succession, making the final few moments very nervy for the Northern Americans.\n\nThese Olympics have been absolutely mental and I can see another big struggle incoming. We’re taking some juice here, but a +2.5 handicap feels like a very safe line so I’m dropping a unit on it. Under 5.5 goals also sounds like a viable market, in case y’all want to explore that side of the coin. I also like the odds on Celebrini ATGS, the man’s on fire. BOL and let's enjoy another underdog story ☘️🫡",

Hull actually see out a win against Brisbane, seeing no real stress against this pick either. We are on a nice streak here folks, appreciate all the input in comments and happy to be cashing you out - lets keep it going!\n\nFirst up we go to the Danish top league, where Nordsjaelland (6th) host Vejle (12th/bottom of the league). Nords home record is 6-0-4 W/D/L, Vejle's away record is 0-2-7 W/D/L. Since 2008 when they first faced off their head-to-head record is 12(Nord)-5(draw)-2(Vejle) in their 19 fixtures, going FC Nordsjaelland's home ground this is taken to 7 wins for Nord and 1 draw, with 4 wins for the home team in a row. In their reverse fixture in October it finished 3-0 with Nord winning it away. Current form has Nordsjaelland on a 3 win streak, with 4 wins in the last 5 in this league - Vejle is currently 1-4 in their last 5. I would also like to point out that against similar position opponents FC Fredericia (11th) and Silkeborg (10th) at Nordsjaelland's home ground BOTH finished 5-0. I do see a similar outcome for an away team that have historically struggled against this team, as well as them being in poor recent form, FC Nordsjaelland being in better current form, having the home advantage and them proving them to have the ability to beat these kind of teams at their home ground. I'm going to guess a 3-1 finish for FC Nordsjaelland here - fingers crossed they take away the 3 points today.\n\nYou might remember I accidentally got the dates mixed up the other day, thinking this fixture between Athletic and Elche was on Monday instead of Friday as I misread it - we go to it today as I still like this line. Secondly, we go to the Spanish top flight, where Athletic sit 9th and Elche in 16th. Important stats you should know this fixture has seen LESS than 2.5 goals 6/8 meetings - HOWEVER here's why I am backing BTTS: it historically has a 3/6 hit rate at Athletic. The reverse fixture at the start of the season ended 0-0 at Elche, but current forms are my motivator for this pick. First and foremost, the current records are that BTTS hitting 9/10 for Athletic and 7/8 for Elche. The last 7 fixtures for Athletic have seen BTTS and 6/last 7 for Elche have seen BTTS. At home Athletic have seen BTTS in 4/8, but noticeably their last 3 (since December 22nd) they have seen this clear against weaker opponents in Levante (19th) and similar quality in Real Sociedad (8th). Elche's away record is woeful at 0-4-7, however that has not been for a lack of trying, they have seen goals both ends in 9/11 of their away games. Over 2.5 goals has been seen in 8/10 last Athletic games and 5/6 Elche games. Averages for each team are as follows: Athletic goals for 27(1.13 per game) and goals against 34(1.42 per game) - Elche goals for 31(1.29 per game) and goals against 35(1.46 per game).\n\nThank you for all the input in the comments, I appreciate those who tail! Also I would like to remind people I do this for fun, I am not a professional and therefore sometimes my writeups can be lacklustre I am aware. Anyways have a great day folks!\n\n**BOL and always bet what you can afford to lose!**",

I think we all saw Finland vs Switzerland and how it went in the first period(don't remind me please lol). Anywayyy I was not impressed at all by Finland's performance. Switzerland had 3 good NHL defensemen but come on now. Except for 6 Swiss forwards who are in the NHL, everybody else played in the Swiss league and Switzerland even had played the day before. Meanwhile Finland had fresh legs, a full NHL lineup anddd they were facing a 38 year old goalie starting again on a back-to-back. Until the 3rd period they looked a lot of times lost in their own end making bad plays after bad plays(go watch the highlights the defensive miscues were plenty). The smaller rink might have honestly been more of a factor for NHL players than what I originally thought in these Olympics. Players have less space and this seems to favor the European players who are most used to it than NHLers (Slovakia is in the other semi-final with 7 NHL players). Now tomorrow it will be NHL players vs NHL players so I don't think there will be surprises like what we saw vs Czechia. Tomorrow it will come down to the powerplay and raw talent which Canada is better in both. They are the faster and better team and I expect them to have a much better start than against Czechia. Canada is expected to win this one so it's not my \"hockey expert analysis\" here guys. The game vs Czechia was way too close than what it should have been and they know it too. They have the firepower to do it and I expect them to come out roaring in that first period to make sure the game doesn't go out of hands like the other one. Why are the odds so low then? The big factor here for team Canada to hit this prop lays on Jordan Binnington and how will he play tomorrow. I know Binnington was shaky vs Czechia but I don't expect him to have 2 bad games in a row especially with a finals spot on the line. He did win the gold with Canada at 4Nations so we know that he can be better than what we saw vs Czechia and I expect him to be solid.\n\nAnother factor that for me feels like will help team Canada is the injury of Sidney Crosby. Crosby has been a legend for team Canada for 20 years and he might not be available tomorrow. Team Canada said after their comeback to Czechia that they didn't want that game to be Sidney's last game in the Olympics and if he's out vs Finland you know the young guns on the team who used to idolize him will be extra motivated to win for him and have a good showing. His absence will be missed for team Canada but they have plenty of great players that can help cover and that probably means more minutes for MacKinnon and McDavid/Celebrini which is good for us.\n\nIn other words, for me it comes down to how Binnington will play tomorrow in that first period and how Canada will respond early after their almost embarrassing loss to Czechia (they played against each other a week ago and Canada won 5-0 so I think Canada just thought that game was gonna be a breeze after scoring first and underestimated their opponents). I strongly believe that Canada and Binnington will have a much better start as they are proven winners and also that before this Czechia's game, Canada hit the -0.5 first period prop in **every other games in these Olympics.**\n\nBOL! Please play responsibly?\n\n[Buymeacoffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/lordestros)",

A few people in the comments asked why we didn't just take PARIVISION 2-0 yesterday. We got our answer when they dropped a map to Yandex. That 1-1 draw would have ruined the parlay, which is exactly why we played it as a Double Chance/ML anchor instead. We are staying disciplined with our reads to keep the main record climbing.\n\nHuge thanks to everyone following the heat.\n\nWRITE-UP: NAVI is the primary focus of this parlay. They are currently fighting for their lives in Group B and absolutely must win this series 2-0 to secure a spot in the next stage. They are facing Execration, who have struggled all tournament with a 2-10 record. NAVI has a perfect head-to-head history against them. The motivation gap here and the skill difference are just huge.\n\nPairing them with Team Liquid to bring the odds to a solid 2.20. While Liquid is already safe for the next round,  and even though they are safe for the next stage, they still need the better ranking in this current stage to qualify for RIYADH MASTERS, so there are not going to be any cheese picks to fuck up our parlay. They are facing a paiN Gaming squad that is already eliminated and recently had roster instability after kicking their carry (Parker and his dramas). The skill difference between the current BLAST champs and a demoralized paiN roster is too wide to ignore. This is a high-probability combo to keep the streak alive.\n\nIf you have any trouble finding these lines or need help with your slips, feel free to reach out. I am always happy to help.",

The books love Korda don’t they? This does seem a bit over the top though. Both players came through really tough matches in the last round, Korda had to save 4 SP’s in the second set to Michelsen whilst Ruud battled back from a set down to Giron. Casper recently became a father which explained his absence since AO but really started finding his rhythm against Giron after the second set which is going to be a big positive coming into this match as he was obviously slightly rusty to kick things off, especially against a player he’d struggled against in the past. Korda has been playing a lot of tennis but I don’t think the match fitness edge is going to have too much of an impact since Ruud is simply the better player in my mind. \n\nThe slower and bouncier courts should favour Ruud’s heavy topspin game more than Korda’s flatter strokes. That means that he should be able to reset Korda’s attacks with a deep ball that is difficult to control and will have the upper hand once rallies are dragged out as his rally tolerance is simply better. Can Sebi hit through this? Absolutely as he’s an excellent ball striker but the more he receives, the more he’ll be prone to miss. The topspin on Ruud’s shots also means that the American will have to be in the right strike zone to have a clean hitting point and whilst his anticipation is generally quite good, his lateral movement is poor which might make it difficult to truly attack every shot and being off balance is going to invite Casper to come in and finish the points. I have seen a lot more offensive intent from the Norwegian as well recently to take even more time away from his opponents plus has slightly tweaked the serve, fired 20 aces past Giron last round which is going to be a welcome addition. Korda is going to cause some issues on the serve + 1 and with the shorter points which is why I think the match will be relatively close but I still think Ruud will have more looks on return especially if Korda’s 1st serve percentage falters in a game and therefore can take initiative especially if he can force the game on to his elite forehand. Casper leads the H2H 2-0, both matches being last year including in Stockholm where Korda theoretically had a better chance of winning on a fast court compared to today. Most importantly though is the fact that Christian Ruud (Casper’s father) defeated Petr Korda (Sebi’s father) in 1999 so it’s only logical that the Ruud’s will continue to have the Korda’s number. I would have fairer odds closer to 1.8 adjusting for a very slight concern on Casper’s sharpness. BOL !",

Their second best scorer, Naji Marshall left before the end of the teams last game, and appears to be playing tomorrow but he will struggle to orchestrate the offence due to Gobert's paint presence. The Mavs front office also appears to have deemed this season a wash after selling at the deadline and shutting down Kyrie for the rest of the year. Coming out of the break, the team doesn't have anything to play for except a lottery pick. The timberwolves have won 7 of their last 10, and are itching towards a top 4 seed. At home, their defence is ranked third in defensive efficiency, while Dallas ranks 4th last. Im backing the healthier, deeper, more talented, and more motivated team at home to cover against the tanking Mavs. BOL.\n\n[https://buymeacoffee.com/ch1cken](https://buymeacoffee.com/ch1cken)",

Their most creative player is out with an injury, and their #9 couldn’t score to save his life right now. They are entirely dependent on individual brilliance from Leandro Paredes. They are facing a Racing team that, despite a shaky start, has secured 2 consecutive wins and has a consolidated manager who knows exactly how to play these types of \"Clásicos.\" Racing is the more balanced team here.\n\nRosario Central vs Talleres: Not much more to say about Rosario Central—we’ve backed them several times and they are a powerhouse at home. I’m taking the double chance (1X) to secure the parlay. They are playing against a weak Talleres side that has only won against lower-division teams in the Cup recently and has looked very poor at the start of this tournament. Central has a high-quality squad and often gets the \"benefit of the doubt\" from the referees when playing at home.\n\nAs always, manage your bankroll and BOL!!",

Even if Utah’s form is shaky, a slower-paced Celtics team coming off a home dud vs HOU makes a big number harder to clear.",

After yesterday where I flat out predicted the wrong team to control the game, i’m hoping to get back in a big way tonight. Arizonas pass defense all and all has been a step of from what it had been years prior. However the volume they give up is laughable considering the offense they are going up against tonight. Prescott’s season average is 258.6 yards, but he’s gone OVER 260 in 5/7 home games and faces an ARI defense allowing the 10th most pass attempts this season (34.6 Opp Passes/Game). While allowing 199.9 pass yards a game and playing offenses worth noting (colts, packers) closely and under 250 yards passing. With that being said, they haven’t played a passing attack like the cowboys. But with the Cowboys at home, and them coming off a rough game in Denver, I see a big comeback week for them. \n\nAs for Williams, it’s not to be overthought. He has scored in all but 2 games (8 rushing td this season). The Cardinals defense has also allowed a rushing touchdown in nearly every outing this season, I think Williams should be an easy lock to power into the end zone tonight.\n\nTail or fade, BOL!!!",

Now averaging 10.6 minutes in 1st quarters with 2/4 of those being full 12 minutes since Edwards got injured. I still feel 8.5 minutes is his minimum, likely to get 9. His attempts and make stats have been good in 1st quarters prior to last match. While he was averaging 37 MPG prior to last game, he did foul out with 32 minutes so may even be a bit more rested and have more energy in his legs to shoot - potentially? Might be a bit square but rather less total minutes than more from a last game. \n\nThe main reason I like this still - the Nets suck. Only the Wizards concede more PPG. The Nets concede on average 36.5 points per first quarter - the 2nd worst is Detroit with 33.3 (for context, this gap of 3.2 is the same as Detroit to Memphis ranked 15th). So McDaniels should get at least 1-2 extra opportunities to score. Miller, Bridges, Johnson & Oubre have all scored well v Brooklyn as similar SF positions to McDaniels. \n\nAs with the last few days, 1st quarter bets are streaky and he showed this last game shooting season low attempts despite good minutes. Don’t think that will be a trend though, just an outlier - but if tailing, choose unit size responsibly.",

Let’s keep stacking.\n\n\n\nEvent: 🇩🇰 Superliga — Midtjylland vs AGF Aarhus\n\nPOTD: Over 2.5 Goals @ 1.53 — 3u\n\nMidtjylland have been one of the most reliable “overs” teams in the Danish Superliga recently. At home, 10 of their last 11 matches have gone over 2.5 goals, and 6 of their last 7 overall also cleared the number. They play fast, direct football, create a ton of attacks, and don’t mind trading chances.\n\nAGF fit the script too. All of their last 6 away matches finished with 3+ goals, and when they play on the road they average over 3 total goals per game. They open up much more away from home and get into high-tempo matches.\n\nHead-to-head history backs it up — meetings between these two tend to be open and attacking. Both sides come in with pace, energy, and enough defensive gaps to expect chances at both ends.\n\nEverything points toward a back-and-forth game with plenty of attacks and shots. Perfect spot for goals.\n\n\nLet's keep this run going 💪",

Quite the bummer as this prevented a flawless weekend for my picks. With 7/8 correct bets in 4 parlays it was still a good weekend in my opinion! Let's keep going.\n\n**Today's Pick:** ***Mjallby to win(1.53) + Hammarby or Draw(1.40) @ 2.14 -- 2 units***\n\n**Write up:**\n\nA Swedish double on this Monday with the top two clubs in the country included. Back to 2 units on the Monday as always. This parlay is a bit risky because of the fact that both the teams that we are backing are cemented in 1st and 2nd. Hence why we are taking it a bit more safe on Hammarby.\n\n**Varnamo v Mjallby**\n\nMjallby are already champions of Sweden, which is exactly where the odds come from. I reckon the players want to end this record season with 2 more wins from both remaining games. Varnamo is bottom of the league and also cemented in its place. They are relegated and simply not good enough for this league. I can let loose loads of stats here but Mjallby's entire season has been outstanding, with only a single loss in 28 games. Thats about the only stat you need.\n\n**Degerfors v Hammarby**\n\nNow this game is more tricky in my opinion and in this case the odds for the favorite winning are high(2.20) because their opponent is still fighting to get out of a relegation spot. Whereas Hammarby are safely second. Now Hammarby is having a very good season but because of this fact I've put them on a double chance pick which is a little bit more safe. Still a good odd here in my opinion(1.40).\n\n**Best of luck if tailing!** 🍀\n\n**PS:** If you want you can check my record and units won on [https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/OliveCritical5134-qXXxJZ](https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/OliveCritical5134-qXXxJZ)",

      "text": "Record: 0-0\n\nPOTD: CeeDee Lamb o70 rec yd, Dak Prescott o225 pa yd v ARI\n\nBet: 2.5u on -134 odds (FanDuel)\n\nWriteup: Coming in with my first POTD, let’s start off on a good note.\n\nCeeDee Lamb has been on an absolute tear when healthy this year, clearing 100 yards in 3 of 4 games. He’ll always eat in a Cowboys offense that is first in passing yards per game, and I expect no different here. Arizona’s defense has been mediocre at best, giving up the ninth most passing yards per game and ranking 20th in EPA per pass play. Arizona’s Will Johnson is questionable for the game, which weakens Arizona’s secondary even more. Lamb is explosive and Arizona has given up some big plays to opposing WR1s (36 to JSN, 40 to McMillan, 47 to Ridley, which makes Lamb over on 25.5 longest reception an interesting play too). Lamb has gotten 8+ targets in every game, so combining that volume and YAC potential, Lamb is a good bet to clear 70 yards. I also like Dak to clear 225 passing yards here. He’s cleared this line in all but 2 games (loss to PHI and DEN). Dak will have plenty of time to throw, as Dallas has the 2nd lowest sack rate against Arizona’s defense that is 27th in sack rate. The gamescript should be fine for passing, with Arizona’s offense led by Jacoby Brissett yielding decent results against the Colts and Packers and the spread set around 3 - I wouldn’t worry too much about blowout potential, and even so, a blowout would likely be due to Dak torching Arizona through the air (Dak still cleared 225 handily in DAL blowout wins over NYJ and WAS). Arizona guards the run fairly well, at ninth best in EPA per play against the run. There’s a lot of passing/receiving props that I could opt for here, but I think this one is the safest and best value for money. BOL and only bet what you can afford to lose.",

While the Cowboys have one of the best offenses in the league, they also have one of the worst defenses which has led to shoutouts. I obviously think this only tees this bet even more, especially given his recent connection with Jacoby Brissett. Since Brissett took over at quarterback, Jones has seen a noticeable uptick in production. Over the last three games, he’s posted 25 yards against San Francisco on 2 catches, 79 yards versus Indianapolis on 5 catches, and 67 yards against Green Bay on 2 catches. He’s averaging 15.3 yards per catch on the season. With 12 catches for 183 yards through seven games, Jones has cleared the 1.5 receptions in all four of the last four outings. Not to mention, all of these teams have been defenses than the cowboys. \n\nDallas has struggled defensively in recent weeks, particularly in the secondary. Injuries to key players like Trevon Diggs and Donovan Wilson have opened up passing lanes, and the Cowboys have allowed multiple receivers to post chunk gains in each of their last three games. They rank in the bottom third of the league in yards per completion allowed and have given up explosive plays to slot and boundary receivers alike. Not to forget, Zay holds the NCAA D1 receptions records from his senior season at East Carolina University proving his ability. I expect Arizona to trail for the full game, which should lead to more passing volume.

That’s 4 wins in a row let’s go for 5 in JerryWorld.\n\nPick Ceedee Lamb over 64.5 yds receiving(-260)+ George Pickens(-300) over 49.5 yds receiving for -120 odds  3 units $300 to win $550.\n\nMonday night football in Jerry World with a very questionable defense for the Cowboys. One thing nobody is doubting is that best duo in football may just be Lamb and Pickens. I went back and forth but finally just said why not both. Even in Denver when Dak had one of his lowest passing games with a 188 yds, these two still covered the lines were working with. Lambs last 4 games(injured for 1 game) he has gone over a 100 yds receiving in everyone except for last week in Denver where he finished with 74 yds 7 receptions out of the 10 targets. Pickens last 5 games he has gone over 50 yds in every game with his highest yds at 168 and his lowest against the jets for 57 yds.\n\nIt appears that both receivers get a slight boost of playing better at home with Pickens having 134 and 82 yds at home, and Lamb having 112 and 100 yd games at home.\n\nDak also seems to pass better at home throwing for 319 vs packers defense at home and 264 against commanders.\n\nAll in all there should be plenty of receiving yds for Pickens and lamb to have big days and both cover the combined 115 yds needed. Bol everybody and let’s make it win #5 in a row!!",

The Cowboys come into this one 3-4-1 with wins over the Giants, Jets and Commanders with a tie against the Packers and losses to the Eagles, Bears, Panthers and Broncos. The Cardinals roll into this one with a 2-5 record with wins over the Saints and Panthers and losses to the 49ers, Seahawks, Colts, Packers and they somehow lost to the Titans giving them their sole win and probably only win of the year. Injuries have hurt this Cardinals team as they are expected to start backup quarterback Jacoby Brissett and have lost runningbacks James Conner and Trey Benson so their run game has struggled in the past couple weeks without those guys. My key factor in this one is that the Cowboys have the best rated pass offense in the league averaging 271 passing yards per game and they face off against a Cardinals pass defense that ranks 21st in the league so I think Dak Prescott will be able to carve up this Cardinals secondary which will open up opportunities for Javonte Williams in the run game.\n\nPrediction: 33-27 Cowboys\n\nLast pick:🏈Chargers -9💩Titans cover without a single touchdown on offense.\n\nBest of luck to everyone tailing and remember to bet responsibly!

      "text": "**POTD Record 39-35-1**\n\nEasy easy winner. Should have expressed in my post that this was my biggest bet of the year so far. I just did not understand how Philly was on -5.5. This game was over at half time.\n\nAs much as I want to run it back attacking BKN, I see another game that is almost identical to my last play. Targeting another team that I think really stinks.\n\n**Bucks -5.5**\n\nI am not going to lie, I think I have been looking for a game to target the bucks after making them my play against GSW a few games back, where Giannis got ruled out (after post made), and RYAN ROLLINS went the fuck off. I liked this bucks team going into the season, and trust me I did not factor this guy into the equation at all, however now I for sure am.\n\nThis Buck’s team has a shot to win the East this season, and I truly think Giannis is motived to play meaningful basketball late into the season. Games like this are key to run up the score, rest the guys in the 4^(th). If you have not noticed already, one of my main angles in betting NBA is targeting bad teams in bad spots and in bad matchups. Not always the case, however this game just sticks out to me. Indy, is IMO one of the bottom 2-3 teams in the league this season\n\nLook, I love what they did against GSW the other night, and a big fan of the underdog energy. I respect teams that are taped together at the guard spots and still fighting. I get it. Indiana is in full “nobody believes in us” mode right now, and usually a team I am pulling for, but not one I am putting my money on. Let’s be serious, Indy’s missing so many players…. They’re basically running an NBA game without an NBA backcourt. Siakam is balling out, but outside of him, nothing impresses me especially with Mathurin out.\n\nMeanwhile Giannis is dominating, averaging 34/13/7. Probable to play tomorrow, which I hope doesn’t happen (made bucks POTD the other night prior to Giannis being ruled out. Still won bcz my new favorite player ROLLINS). The Bucks are putting up 123+ a night. Top five in the league in scoring and top five in made threes (15.5 per). The Pacers are scoring 112 a night, and that’s with Pascal Siakam doing everything, including bringing the ball up and pretending to be a point guard. That 11-point per-game gap from avg ppg, and we are getting this at -5.5.\n\nCan Indiana hang on the glass? Yeah. They rebound like crazy, and Milwaukee’s actually been soft on the boards to start the year and are losing the rebounding battle so far this season (avg 40rbs & give up 44rbs). That’s the only thing that scares me, the ugly, grindy, foul-heavy version of this where we’re sitting at Bucks +4 with two minutes left and sweating free throws.\n\nBut if this game even halfway opens up? If pace gets normal? Milwaukee is just way more talented, way healthier where it matters, and way more organized offensively. Indiana doesn’t have the guards to actually trade buckets in the halfcourt with a team that’s throwing Giannis (AND ROLLINS) at you plus hitting 15+ threes a night. Would take this up to like fucking -10. \n\nOkay, Lets get a streak going after 2 easy winners the last two plays.\n\nPS: Wolves -8.5 vs BKN. Like I mentioned at the top, this game is begging me to bet it. BKN on a B2B. Enough said.",

I expect him to be more aggressive on the glass, and this contest is expected to be a high pace, high scoring and relatively close game. All of these work in favor of the Bucks big man getting over this modest total. The Pacers give us the 4^(th) highest rebounds to Centers, and in all their games so far, the big men have exceeded their respective rebound lines, which is not a surprise since the tallest Pacer is 6'9 (Myles is 6'11 for comparison).",

He ended up playing a great match to win in straight-sets and move one step closer to qualifying. I wanted to back him again against Jan-Lennard Struff, but the odds honestly seemed pretty fair (he ended up losing but narrowly covering the spread). \n\nAntoine Ghibaudo comes into the Knoxville Challenger, which is held at the University of Tennessee's indoor venue, ready to make an impact. Ghibaudo plays his best tennis on fast courts. In July of this year at the grass-court Hall of Fame Open, he made an amazing run from qualifying to the quarterfinals, where he put in an admirable effort against one of the most experienced grass-courters out there in Adrian Mannarino. More recently, he performed quite well at the indoor challengers in Lincoln and Sioux Falls, making the semis of the latter event with a win over Martin Damm. In contrast, Purtseladze is in extremely rough form this year. He's only had one good event all year, a Challenger title in his home country, and has struggled to find wins since. He had some injury issues starting in September, as he skipped most of the month and then was forced to withdraw from two different events in October. He did manage to score a win over Max Wiskandt last week in Charlottesville before getting absolutely crushed by Rafa Jodar, but that win (9/9 BPs saved, 6.79 performance rating) wasn't overly convincing. Saba was also priced at 3.50 in that match, and I don't see why his odds should be so much lower here - Wiskandt isn't a bad player, but he hasn't exactly been lighting it up this year. \n\nOverall, I feel that Ghibaudo has the more dynamic and aggressive game right now. Purtseladze does possess a big, heavy serve, but he's been looking a bit flat-footed recently, and has a bit of a weakness of the backhand wing. Ghibaudo's backhand is actually one of his stronger attributes, and so I feel that he can capitalize on that. I will say that I wouldn't take this past around -190, as these odds aren't quite as good as they were at opening (where this would have been a 2-unit play). Nevertheless, I believe that there is still enough value left to play this. \n\nNote: The [POTD Capper Tracker](https://potd.lol), which you may remember from its Google Sheet days, is finally back in a cleaner, more robust website format!

My best sport by far, and what better way than to have my second 2U pick since being on POTD (first one was rockets -15 last week and they won by 30). I love love love a good spot against the defending national champ in college basketball. I mean the public is gonna be all over Florida on the short spread of 3.5 (yes I bought to 4.5, sue me motherfucker). Look, this Florida team is going to have growing pains to begin, this is a completely new roster and they’re going to be traveling way out west to a place that’s very familiar to the wildcats, Las Vegas. Arizona fans are known for traveling well and the environment in T-Mobile Arena will be a home court feeling for UA in what is expected to be a sold out crowd. Arizona will be fully loaded again with four key returners in Jaden Badley, Tobe Awaka, Anthony Dell’Orso and Motiejus Krivas. Plus, Lloyd and his staff signed the No. 2 recruiting class according to 24/7 Sports. This is an early season game and guard play matters a lot, and veteran guard Jaden Bradley should be able to do enough to help will this team to a possible win. I truly do think this spread is a bit large even at 3.5, but I’m smashing a two unit spot so I wanted to give myself another leg with 4.5. Its been a very fun first week on POTD, I’m not gonna sit here and complain about a 5-2 record at all (although 6-1 would’ve been fucking sweet) and once again I’m blessed to be able to write another one for yall again… this is going to cash, and let’s get back on track fellas, cheers 🍻",

They copped an early goal last matchday and fought back to win 2-1. Plenty of teams would just half-ass that game... And tbh, not many would blame them. \n\nMjallby have been great away from home with a 11-2-1 record on the road. Well.... They've got the highest points total in league history, they've obviously been good.\n\nHowever, in those 14 games away from home only three of them have gone over the 3.5 goal line, and the last of those was early August. The other two were within their first 4 away games. \n\nEven in their home games, only two of those have cleared 3.5 goals. \n\nSo most of their wins haven't been complete goal-fests... Even against the bottom teams.  \n\nThis game they travel to last place Varnamo who have been dire this season. \n\nFor a team who are dead last, only having a -9 goal difference at home is somewhat tight. They've had a lot of draws at home which helps with this. \n\nOnly about 50% of Varnamo gone games have gone over the 3.5 goal t\n\nI think Mjallby win this, and I cant see them piling on the score. \n\nAgain, if you're after that extra safety, there's probably safer options in this match like just going the win.

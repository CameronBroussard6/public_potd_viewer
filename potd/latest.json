They should probably win by 2 or more, but going a little safe here. \nFor the 2nd leg, both teams have seen atleast 3 goals in their last 5 games, with colchester having one of the worst defense in the league.

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 7-4, Net Units +3.31\n\n**Previous Pick:** NBA - Milwaukee Bucks @ San Antonio Spurs - Stephon Castle Over 17.5 Points = CASHHH\n\n**Reaction:** Bro had 14 in the first half, glad to see us get this one after two buzzer beater losses\n\n**Event:** NCAAB - Toledo @ Kent St./Ohio @ Ball St.\n\n**POTD:**  Kent St. + Ohio ML\n\n**Write Up:** \n\n**Kent State vs. Toledo:** \n\nKent State (13–4) enters this game with a significant home-court advantage at the Memorial Athletic and Convocation Center, where they are currently **9–1 this season**. Historically, the Golden Flashes have dominated this matchup in Kent, including a massive 40-point blowout (105–65) over Toledo last February.\n\nThe X-factor for Kent State is forward **Delrecco Gillespie**, who is currently leading the team with a double-double average of **19.3 points and 12.6 rebounds per game**. Toledo’s defense has been inconsistent, allowing nearly 82 points per game, which plays right into the hands of a Kent State offense that is averaging over 90 points at home. If Gillespie controls the glass as expected, Kent State’s win probability remains high (currently projected at 65%)\n\n**Ohio vs. Ball State:**\n\nWhile Ohio (10–8) is coming off a tough road loss to Toledo, they are heavily favored to bounce back against a struggling Ball State (4–13) team that is **0–5 in conference play**. The Bobcats have one of the most efficient offenses in the MAC, averaging 78.4 points per game compared to Ball State’s league-low 68.0 points.\n\nOhio’s success will likely hinge on **Jackson Paveletzke**, who leads the team with 17.1 points and nearly 5 assists per game. Ball State has struggled to contain perimeter scoring, and with Ohio ranking in the top tier of the conference for three-point shooting, the Bobcats should be able to stretch the floor. Furthermore, Ohio’s defense forces more turnovers and blocks more shots than the Cardinals, likely stifling any Ball State momentum before it starts.\n\nI love me a little MACtion action baby\n\nBOL if tailing, feel free to send a little love my way <3\n\n[buymeacoffee.com/nextapplication](http://buymeacoffee.com/nextapplication)",

Were going with a two legger between the DePaul Blue Demons (10-7) over the Marquette Golden Eagles (6-12) and the Kansas Jayhawks (12-5) over the Baylor Bears (11-5). I really like the defense this DePaul Blue Demons team is playing as they are only allowing 68 points per game and they are up against a very lackluster Marquette defense that is ranked 280th in division one as they are letting up 78 points per game and this DePaul squad has the upperhand in field goal percentage as well as this Marquette squad only has a 40% field goal percentage as they rank 340th in division one ranking bottom 15 out of 365 division one squads. This DePaul squad also has an upperhand in free throw percentage and three point percentage and they have the home court advantage in this one against the Golden Eagles and they are 8-3 at home while Marquette is 0-5 and has not won a road game all season. I also like going with Kansas in this one against Baylor as they are coming into this one riding a huge win over #2 Iowa State and they come into this one allowing much less points than Baylor, a better free throw percentage, better three point defense, defensive rebounds, blocks per game, and they limit less turnovers per game than the Bears. The Jayhawks have home court advantage and they have been great at Allen Fieldhouse this year with a 7-1 home record so I think home court advantage is a big plus in this one. I think both of these teams should be able to handle business on their home courts in this one.\n\nPrediction: 80-71 Kansas, 74-68 DePaul\n\nLast pick:🏀Georgia Southern ML/Liberty ML💰Man that Georgia Southern game got sweaty at the end but they got the job done at the end of the day!\n\nBest of luck to everyone tailing and remember to bet responsibly!

They haven’t scored a single goal in 3 matches, losing 3-0, drawing 0-0, and losing 4-0. They are DUE for a goal at home here. And, coming to town is Eintracht Frankfurt who play fast and loose. Bremen had a couple opportunities against Dortmund but were unable to convert. I think they will feel the need to net in this one at home, and will begin to open up more in an attempt to get on the score sheet. Eintracht Frankfurt has given up 36 goals through 17 matches, but have been able to put in 35 goals in that span. \n\nFeels like a great opportunity for these teams to get lots of shots in and hopefully, put in a couple goals each.",

Both teams are well organised defensively, and recent meetings between them suggest this won’t be a wide-open contest. At home, Melbourne City have played with patience and discipline. Three of their last five league matches have seen them score one goal or fewer, including a narrow 1–0 win over Brisbane Roar and a 0–0 draw with Sydney FC. They may not create a lot going forward, but their solid structure has kept games close and competitive.\n\nDefensively, Melbourne City are usually reliable at home. In their last five matches, they’ve conceded more than one goal just once, in a 3–1 loss to Perth Glory. Even when results go against them, the margins tend to be small, like the narrow 1–0 defeat to Newcastle Jets. This reflects a pattern of low-scoring games shaped by patience rather than constant pressure. That approach has also led to five draws in thirteen league matches. When games are level, City often slow the tempo and focus on control instead of taking risks.\n\nAuckland FC come into this match with confidence built on strong away performances. They kept clean sheets in wins at Brisbane Roar and Western Sydney Wanderers, while a 2–1 victory at Central Coast Mariners showed they can see games out without losing their shape late on.\n\nTheir only real defensive slip in the last five matches was a 3–1 home loss to Newcastle Jets. On the road, however, Auckland have been much more compact, conceding just one goal across their last three away games. That balance between attacking when needed and staying disciplined defensively has played a big role in their league position. While the previous meeting in Melbourne ended 2–2, Auckland responded with a convincing 3–0 win in the return fixture at home.\n\nOn paper, this looks like a slower, more controlled match, and that’s likely how it will play out. It’s not so much a lack of faith in Melbourne City’s defence, but rather confidence in Auckland’s ability to find a goal. City have conceded in four of their last six home games, while Auckland have scored in five of their last six away matches, hitting more than one goal in four of those. Looking more broadly, Auckland have found the net in 11 of their 12 games so far this season. With the quality in their squad, they should have enough to get on the scoresheet again here, which would further strengthen their position in the table.\n\n**NOTE: Please only stake what you can afford to lose; know that no picks are 100% guaranteed to hit. Stake Responsibly.**",

The match was end to end as expected, but luck was not on our side. Racing had 2 goals ruled out for offside, Barca missed chance after chance and wound up with 2 goals on 17 shots. Sometimes soccer is like that.\n\nRight back to an over goals play today as Werder Bremen host Eintracht Frankfurt. I play this type of play a lot unofficially with Frankfurt, as they go through stretches of high scoring games. Frankfurt are the second highest scoring team in Bundesliga, averaging over 2 goals scored per game. They are also the 3rd worst defensive team, conceding over 3 goals per game. Combine that with the fact that Werder are also bottom 5 defensively in the league, I see this being a high scoring match. \n\nThis could be a 4-0 Frankfurt route, or we could see a 2-2, 3-2 close game. Tough to call as Frankfurt are volatile. Their last two matches ended 3-2 and 3-3 respectively, so we're banking on their good offense and bad defense continuing their latest trend. \n\nBOL and happy Friday!",

      "text": "**Record 3-0**\n\n**POTD:** Kings -5.5 **(If your a safe person only take if Sabonis plays and bilal is out).**\n\nOkay, this is very interesting if you're a gambling kinda guy. So Sabonis is questionable but he played full practice minutes and I think the Wizards would be a nice spot to come back and dominate. Dennis Scrhoder will also be coming back from his three game suspension. I like this because I think something is clicking: beating the Rockets, Lakers, Knicks and now they play the Wizards. I think the Kings are a nice counter to the Wizards as they have a lot of unique firepower.  \n\nIf you play pace then you have Malik, Dennis and Russ. If the three ball is not clicking then you have the paint to attack which is where Demar, Sabanis, Precious, Maxine and Westbrook thrive. On the other hand the Wizards recently gave CJ McCollum up which is very detrimental as he was the guy opening up space and being the guy that was hounded. I think as of late these rookies can't really make shots or space but that's to be expected as they're probably being pushed to experiment and to tank. Currently the Wizards are 4-16 on the road as well.\n\nI think the Kings could struggle but they have played three games at home now and are probably all very motivated due to the trade dead line to lmfao and now is probably a good time to show up. ",

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 9-30-4 *The Barcelona curse is real y'all and once again my pick lost with the literal last kick of the ball. Racing Santander turned up and did us proud, leaving only scraps to Barcelona's attackers (their first shot on target came near the end of the first half) while showing glimpses of real quality themselves. Despite conceding in the second half, things looked promising as the score remained 1-0 deep into the added time and to make everything even better, the Santander player then went one on one with the goalkeeper - and had his effort spectacularly saved. That could've sealed the deal then and there, but instead Barcelona hit them with a random long ball and scored in the literal final second. How do I always manage to pick these bizarre classics is beyond me, but oh well, I'll be there for the next hatewatch.

Their gameplay has looked rather uninspiring and it almost seems as if they're not taking half the matches seriously. As a result, they find themselves **second in the French league, are already out of the French league cup,** as well as with just one win in the last three Champions League matches *(still in the top 8, but nothing is secured yet).* Even a lot of their wins were very scrappy, for example, they needed penalties to overcome Marseille in the French Supercup, narrowly beat Metz, as well as a 10-men Lyon, thanks to a 95th minute winner, didn't look convincing at all in their 1-0 win over Nice, as they once again needed a 95th minute goal etc. They also **lost against a 10-men Monaco** recently, showing that they often fail to make things going for them even when the game's events seem to want to go their way. \n\nOn the other hand, we have Lille, who are having a pretty solid season, they're sitting in 4th place in the league with **4 wins in the last 5 games** (same form as PSG), so I think a +1.5 Asian Handicap should absolutely see them through today's fixture. Feeling really good about this pick so I'm going with 2 units.

For the Kansas men’s basketball team, it’s also where the dominance is at. \n\nOver the years, Allen Fieldhouse has been a tough place to play for visitors. Under former head coach Roy Williams (1994-2003), the Jayhawks (12-5) went 201-17 in front of the home fans. Not to be outdone, his successor, current head coach Bill Self, has put together an impressive mark of his own (335-21), including setting a program record with 69-straight home victories from February 2007 to January 2011. Just Tuesday night, No. 2 Iowa State found out just how difficult of a road trip it is, falling 84-63 while shooting just 37% from the field. \n\nThat home cooking becomes evident especially on the defensive end of the floor. \n\nThrough 17 games, Kansas ranks 4th in opponent field-goal percentage (38.3%), 8th in opponent three-point shooting (28.2%), 33rd in scoring defense (67.8 PPGA) and 34th in defensive efficiency (0.958). At home, those numbers become even more impressive, falling to a minuscule 61.0 points per game allowed on just 35.4% shooting while registering a defensive efficiency of 0.857 (13th in the nation). On paper, Baylor will pose a formidable test for the unit, as the team comes in ranking 23rd in offensive efficiency (1.185), 27th in scoring (86.3 PPG), 46th in three-point shooting (36.7%) and 47th in field-goal percentage (47.9%). However, the Bears (11-5) have found offense hard to come by as of late, averaging just 68.1 points on 41.2% shooting over their last four games. \n\nFurthermore, just take a look at how the team has struggled in six contests against opponents who rank in the Top 100 in defensive efficiency: \n\n* Houston (1st): 55 points on 37% shooting (37% from beyond the arc)\n* Iowa State (5th): 60 points on 31% shooting (19% from beyond the arc)\n* TCU (25th): 63 points on 37% shooting (24% from beyond the arc)\n* St. John’s (32nd): 81 points on 37% shooting (32% from beyond the arc)\n* San Diego State (53rd): 91 points on 53% shooting (39% from beyond the arc)\n* Memphis (70th): 71 points on 34% shooting (36% from beyond the arc)\n\nNot only did Baylor go 1-5 in those six outings, but the team also failed to top 37% shooting in all but one of those games and eclipsed 71 points just twice. Not the kind of resume you want to bring into a road matchup with a defense that ranks 34th in defensive efficiency.\n\nAs for the Jayhawks, although their numbers won’t jump out as overly impressive—59th in three-point shooting (36.2%), 76th in field-goal percentage (46.9%), 77th in scoring (77.9 PPG) and 101st in offensive efficiency (1.100)—the offense kicks it into another gear in front of the home fans. \n\nIn nine home contests, Kansas has averaged 81.8 points on a blistering 50.4% shooting (37.6% from deep). In fact, the team has really started to find its groove as of late, averaging 87.7 points on 48.6% shooting (39.4% from beyond the arc) over its last three outings. That could pose problems for an underwhelming Bears defense that ranks 94th in opponent field-goal percentage (42.8%), 150th in defensive efficiency (1.037), 153rd in opponent three-point shooting (33.3%) and 193rd in scoring defense (75.5 PPGA). Further complicating matters, the unit concedes 79.5 points per game on 46.1% shooting (39.1% from the perimeter) away from home. \n\nTurnovers could prove to be the X factor on Friday night. \n\nOn the season, Baylor has fared decently in limiting mistakes with the ball, ranking 125th in turnovers per possession (15.8%), 138th in turnovers (11.5 per game) and 163rd in opponent steals (6.7). However, the team has been a little more careless over its last three contests, with those numbers ballooning to 20.6%, 14.0 and 7.3 respectively. Meanwhile, although Kansas has appeared allergic to creating turnovers—287th in steals (5.6), 334th in turnovers forced per possession (13.8%) and 335th in turnovers forced (9.8)—the team has done a little better over its last three games, increasing those numbers to 7.7 steals, 16.6% and 12.3 respectively.\n\nTrust the Jayhawks to get the job done and record their sixth-straight home victory in dominating fashion.\n\nBOL if tailing, and as always, please do so responsibly. One bet should not have you crashing out all over Reddit.",

MISS MARANDA $1.90                     \n**Write Up:** Bit disappointing that we didn’t get the full win yesterday, just encountered a bit of traffic in the straight that halted our momentum for a bit. Hopefully a few of you got on the other tips!    \n    \nFor today’s tip we venture out to Pakenham and find MISS MARANDA here 4th up. Has just been steadily building this prep, with its first 2 runs being at distances well short of its best, but showed a high level of talent with its last start 2nd to MISSAPPREHEND (a horse going places). On that occasion she settled midfield behind the winner, and had to wait for the winner to take a gap before commencing her run, resulting in a very fast finishing 2nd.    \n    \nToday’s run we go up another 200 metres (huge plus +), and swap the inside barrier for barrier 6. I’m hoping to land in the one-one (behind the leader on the outside), and with clear air in the straight, we should hopefully go sailing past.    \n    \nThis is by far the weakest race that we contested, and I really can’t see any dangers on exposed form. All the other horses are lightly raced, so some level of improvement can be expected, however I can’t forecast enough progression from any of them to worry MISS MARANDA.    \n    \nBet is for the horse to come 1st. For every $10 you put on, should be receiving $19 ($9 profit). If you’re getting significantly less, you’ve placed the wrong bet.    \n    \nOther tips will be up in the other thread later. Any questions lemme know. GL.    \n    \nTips appreciated, big thanks to anyone who has already :)    \n    \n[buymeacoffee.com/Bstilled_](https://buymeacoffee.com/Bstilled_)",

After the World Championships, it’s always a surprise who’ll show up and who won’t. Last year, Bunting won this tournament after all. \n\nI’m simply looking at yesterdays results and of course the history and background of both players. Luke Humphries is generally the better player. Threw 103.66 average and won his first game 6-0. Aspinall had more trouble winning his match and won 6-4 with an average of 90.61. Consider that the opponents are legit dogshit and should have no chance against the top pros.\n\nHumphries ranked 2nd today in overall performance compared to Aspinall ranking 5th.\n\nFor this match, it’s first to 6 legs instead of the sets we saw during the World Championship.\n\nThe bet is a win if Humphries wins with atleast 6-4.\n\nOnce again, my pick is Luke Humphries -1.5 legs @ 1.73\n\nBOL!",

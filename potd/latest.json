A divisional game where two teams with good defenses have to win to get control of the bloodbath that is the NFC West and to keep 1 seed hopes alive. \n\n**Writeup:** Lets start with the obvious. Jason Myers has been one of if not the best kicking performers this season. He's averaging 10.9 kicking points a game and is on route to break the regular season points scoring record, being just 33 points behind LaDainian Tomlinson's 186 point record. Now the forecast is looking like it will be a very windy game, but they're looking to be Headwinds/Tailwinds, the former of which would help Myers. He will be utilized this game.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, this is a divisional game between two teams with solid defenses, and pretty stellar offenses. While being good, the Seahawks haven't always been consistent in the red zone, not helped by the fact that Rams have one of the best red zone defenses in the league. Their third down conversion rate is sitting pretty low at just under 38%\n\n The lines for this game are very slim with the Seahawks being favored at -1.5. From what it's looking like, Field Goals will be the difference. No doubt these teams will take every opportunity they can to get points. Two field goals and two extra points (which Seahawks are expected to score twice as their game line is at 2.5 touchdowns). \n\nBless a good Thursday night game and Best of Luck to everyone tailing!",

      "text": "Record 4-3 (+1.29U)\n\nPrevious Pick: Lions at Rams NFL 16:25pm (EST) **Stafford + Goff over 525 yards passing (-137) 5U** ✅\n\nEasy cash as Stafford and Goff combine for over 700+ yards through the air. For anyone who, as suggested, laddered (550/575/600/625/650/675/700)– you did very very well.\n\n**POTD:** NFL Rams at Seahawks TNF 8:15pm (EST) **Puka + JSN over 175 receiving (-156) 3U**\n\nPuka and JSN are by far and away the two most dominant WR in the NFL. They lead the league in receiving yards/game (JSN: 110, Puka: 105). The next closest is London at 90. That combines for 215+ yards/game receiving.\n\nThey lead all WR in Big Plays – receptions of 20+ (JSN: 25, Puka:23). Again the next highest is J. Williams at 19. They own the lion’s share of targets and air yards on the rams and seahawks and Devante Adams is in all likelihood gonna miss this one. SEA allow the third fewest RB rush yards (73/game) while RAMS allow 6^(th) fewest (77/game). Last time these two teams met this line hit: Puka went 7/75 (despite Stafford throwing for only 130 yards) while JSN went 9/105 (despite 4 interceptions from Darnold). Last two weeks, Puka hit (181) and nearly hit (167 yards) this line all by himself. Latest forecast (though its Seattle so things can change) shows rain ending by 3pm.  \n\nIts gonna be a fierce game with huge playoff implications. Rams squeaked by 21-19 largely due to Darnold INT’s. Expecting a close game again. My bet is whoever is trailing in late third/early fourth will tilt toward pass, pushing either JSN or Puka over 100-110+ if they’re not already there. Then, all the other guy needs for this to hit is 65-75 yards. In Draftkings, you can find this bet under Receiving --> Combined Receiving Yards --> **Puka Nacua + Jaxon Smith-Njigba 175+ Yards**. If you want better odds you can go O 189.5 (-112) or ladder to 200+ (+114)\n\nBOL if Tailing!",

With a chance of rain and heavy winds up to 20MPH, my pick has shifted from JSN receiving yards to Kyren Williams rushing for the over.\n\nDuring their week 11 matchup against Seattle, Williams rushed 12 times for 91 yards and proved to be a very effective piece in the offense in that game. Over their last 3 games, Los Angeles has ranked 3rd in the league for rushing yards with 186.7, while ranking 4th on the season in away games with 142.7.\n\nKyren Williams has hit this rushing number in 11/14 games this season and has 70+ yards in 3 straight. Even though his snap share with Blake Corum has almost been cut to an even 50/50, Williams has continued to perform well during his opportunities and his numbers have not reflected on the snap count.\n\nAlthough Seattle has shown to be one of the best run defending teams in the league, I trust Sean McVay will effectively scheme his offense to be successful on the ground when passing will be somewhat limited with Davante Adams banged up and the weather being what it is.\n\nTail or fade BOL to everyone and cheers! 🍻",

      "text": "__POTD Record:__ 65-31-1 (+74.53u)\n\n__Previous Pick:__ [✅ Jacksonville St ML (+120), 2u](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/s/lr2SYJx1bV)\n\n__Event:__ NFL: Rams @ Seahawks 8:15pm EST\n\n__POTD:__ Rashid Shaheed o34.5 receiving yards (-110), 3.3u to win 3u\n\n__Write Up:__ I can confidently say one has watched Rashid Shaheed since he joined the NFL more than I have. I’m the Commish of a 14 year fantasy football league that gives points for kick/punt return yards (shoutout FDS). As one of the best returners in the league, I have heavily followed & studied Rashid Shaheed since he came into the league in 2022. He’s been on my roster every year & has been one of the most valuable players in the league. Despite him starting my fantasy lineup in the playoffs this week, this is isn’t a biased play. I actually preferred Colby Parkinson ATTD (+230) as my POTD but POTD rules won’t allow plays over +200 odds. A tear is brought to my eye that after these years, 97 POTD writeups, Shaheed finally has made his way here, the beautiful butterfly can finally spread his wings for the world to see. Great player, great recent results, great game script. Shaheed was traded from the Saints to the Seahawks last month, & boy do they have a big game vs the Rams this week.\n\nThe (11-3) Seattle Seahawks host the (11-3) LA Rams at Lumen Field on Thursday Night Football in a huge intra-divisional matchup. These 2 teams are currently tied & battling for the top spot in the NFC West. Both teams enter this game 8-1 straight up & 7-2 against the spread over their last 9 games. This is their 2 matchup in a little over a month, with the Rams winning at home 21-19. But that final score doesn’t show how dominant Seattle was driving the ball downfield. The Seahawks out-gained the Rams by 165 yards & had a 26-12 first down differential. The issue was Seahawks QB Sam Darnold threw 4 interceptions & their was horrible playcalling the red zone as Seattle only scored a TD on 1 trip of their 4 chances. That was the Seahawks only loss in their last 9 games. __As for the Rams they have been rocking & rolling since then, with 40+ points & 500+ yards in back to back games. They have been on fire at the end of the regular season the past few years with an elite December record going 17-3 ATS, including 2-0 ATS this year. The Rams are also dominating on the road, having gone 11-2 ATS in their last 13 games & 17-5 ATS overall since December 1, 2024.__ The reason I’m adding this to a Seattle WR’s prop write-up, is opposing offenses have to sling it in order to keep up with the Rams high powered offense. But Seattle has been great lately as well. __Seattle has won its last 4 home games by an average margin of 14.5 points per game.__ We have 2 QB’s that are playing at a high level & sling it. This has resulted in both of their leading WR’s pending the league in receiving yards, with Seahawks Jaxon Smith-Njigba & Rams Puka Nacua ranking 1st & 2nd in the NFL this season. The last December or later matchup between the NFL’s top 2 WR’s was Week 16, 2021, when Rams Cooper Kupp (now on Seahawks) defeated Justin Jefferson’s Vikings. JSN has been an elite weapon for Darnold, but the addition of Shaheed has open up even more opportunities for him.\n\nSeahawks QB Sam Darnold has been airing it out all season long. He is also averaging 245.2 pass yards per game (6th) & he’s top 5 in passer rating (102). He’s got one of the biggest set of balls in the NFL & will sling it deep (as evident of his 4 INT’s vs Rams last month). __Darnold has average 8.8 yards per pass attempt (most in the NFL), ranks 1st in Pass Success % (among QB’s with 300+ snaps), he ranks 1st in both passes 50+ yards (7) & 40+ yards (11), 4th in passes 20+ yards (50), & 5th in passes 30+ yards (19).__\nMost of those yards came to JSN, with the Seahawks lacking a #2 WR. That changed on November 4th when the Seahawks traded a 4th & 5th draft pick for vertical weapon Rashid Shaheed. Shaheed was quiet after the trade. He didn’t crack a 10% target share in any of his first 4 games. While the Seahawks were easing him into a new offense & playbook, Shaheed having limited action was also because the Seahawks didn’t need to throw the ball. In his first 4 games, the Seahawks saw 3 easy wins against the Cardinals, Titans, & Vikings. Darnold completed just 10, 16, & 14 passes in those games. But then he emerged two weeks ago & Shaheed has finally established himself in this offense. __He’s seen 5+ targets & 65+ receiving yards in back to back weeks. His numbers from Week 10-13 compared to 14-15: Target Share: 8.3% -> 18.2%. Targets Per Route: 0.12 -> 0.23. Yards Per Game: 9.3 -> 70.5. Yards Per Route: 0.47 -> 2.71. Last week he had a 23.8% first read rate (10 total targets).__ He’s become an important part of this offense. Darnold went to him multiple times on the game-winning drive, giving Shaheed a 21% target share. Shaheed had the 3rd highest PFF offensive rating (74.8). His snap count rose to 68% & he ran a route on 86.5% of the Seahawks' dropbacks. Now he faces a Rams defense that has been a funnel to outside receivers. __The Rams allow 4th most receiving yards per game on the 9th highest yards per route run to outside WR’s. Shaheed has ran 74% of his routes out wide.__ The Rams CB duo of Emmanuel Forbes & Cobie Durant ranks outside the top 50 in yards per coverage snap. They just gave up 20 rec 298 yards Jamo Williams & Amon-Ra St. Brown. The week before they gave up 16 rec 200 yards on 16 rec to Michael Wilson & Trey McBride. The Rams also have been dominant vs the run this season. __The Rams are allowing 3.8 YPC to RB’s (3rd). They’ve allowed a league low 3 rushes for 20+ yards this season, a league low rushing 5 TD’s, & the longest rush they have allowed this season is just 29 yards, the only team under 30 yards.__  They just held the best RB tandem in the league on the Lions to 70 yards on 20 carries, forcing Goff to air it out for 338 yards. They game before that they held the Seahawks RB’s to 29 yards on 10 carries. Seahawks will have to move the ball through the air as well.\n\nThe forecast is showing rain & some wind which normally would be scary for a receiving prop. This will be Sam Darnold's 4th rain game as a QB in Seattle. In his 3 rain games at Lumen he has went 50-77 (65% completion), 606 yards, 6 TD, 0 INT, 115.7 Passer Rating. 2 of those were blowouts where they ran the ball the entire 2nd halves. Still expect him to sling it this game. __The Seahawks are first in the NFL in differential of 20+ yard plays vs their opponents (+21). They are Seahawks average 28.9 points per game (5th). While the Rams are allowing opposing offenses to run 64.5 plays per game, (3rd most) & passing on 56.8% of plays (7th most). Opponents pass 61.38% vs Seahawks (3rd most).__ All signs point to a ton of opportunities for Shaheed. He’s a big play machine & has hit this line in 30/42 games in his career where he was healthy & had a catch.\n\nRashid Shaheats this game.\n\n__Rashid Shaheed o34.5 receiving yards__\n\nAppreciate the love!

A 51-yard TD to seal the deal. We were looking for that one big play and they did not disappoint. That makes 5-in-a-row, let's keep this train rolling!\n\nEvent:  **NCAAF - Georgia @ Georgia Tech, 3:30PM ET**\n\nPOTD:  **Georgia -13.5 (-120) 1.2U**\n\nWrite-Up:\n\nI know that the initial reaction to this line is that the Yellow Jackets should be able to cover 14 points, they are ranked as the 23rd best team in college football. However, they have not had to play a team quite like Georgia yet. \n\nThe Yellow Jackets just had a home game in Georgia against a Pittsburgh team and quickly showed up that when it matters most and the CFP is on the line, they are not up to the challenge. They ended up **losing that game by 14 to a Pitt team** that just got smacked by Notre Dame. Now they go up against this Georgia team that has finally hit their full stride with a **35-3 win over Charlotte** and an impressive **35-10 win over #10 Texas** at the time.\n\nI expect this Georgia team, who might as well have home field advantage in the state of Georgia, to lay 21+ point win against the Yellow Jackets. \n\nLet's continue this streak, huh!\n\n*As always, BOL!*",

      "text": "Record 16-10 on yt \n\nFirst post on this thread\n\nGame: Lakers - Mavericks 🏀\n\nPick: Max christie Over 10.5 points (-132 fanduel)\n\nReasoning: He’s facing his former team, which ranks 28th in the league at defending spot-up shooters, exactly where Max Christie gets most of his scoring opportunities. He also performs significantly better on the road, averaging 15 points away from home if you exclude the Minnesota game, where he struggled in limited minutes. \n\nLast season, he scored 10 and 11 points in his two matchups against the Lakers, so if you prefer a safer option, you can take his line at 10+ points for a smaller payout.\n\nTo sum it up: he has scored at least 9 points in every game this season except one, he’s in a strong matchup, he tends to play better on the road, and he’s going up against his former team. To me, this looks like an easy over, the books are simply undervaluing Max Christie.",

I was thinking about taking Jazz ml, but I like this pick more due to the fact that Lauri never lets me down. He’s been a little cold as of late which I like because he’s due for a good game, the Kings are also very small in size at the moment, Sabonis is injured and the Jazz have a big lineup compared to them. I expect Lauri to dominate no matter who’s guarding him. I’ve had the hot hand since starting my POTD journey and I don’t expect it to stop here. \nBOL!",

The only question is will the first one come on State's first drive.  I'm betting that it will, especially if Ole Miss gets the ball first and puts up a TD on their opening drive.",

Elche dominate more possession, which forces Getafe into repeated defensive actions, so the most likely outcome is Getafe finishing with more cards.\n\nOdds: 11/10\n\nUnits: 1-2",

      "text": "Record: 25-15 (+26.71u)\n\nLast 10:💰✖️💰💰✖️💰✖️✖️💰✖️\n\nLast POTD: 🏈 Chiefs vs Cowboys under 52.5 (-110). ✖️\n\nWriteup: 3rd quarter of the game is what I was expecting for around 3/4 of it, unfortunately too much offense in the first half to try to make this plausible.\n\nToday’s POTD: 🏈 Eagles team total under 26.5 (-113).\n\nGame starts at 3pm EST. Bet 3U\n\nWriteup: For the Black Friday game, we have the Philadelphia Eagles hosting the Chicago Bears. In all honestly, I’m all in on the Bears on this one. I think they have a real shot to win this game. I love Bears +7 in this spot, but we are going to deviate slightly with the same thought process as the market is pretty split on the spread, but there is massive support on the total under. \n\nThe Bears offense looks as good as it has all season. They are firing on all cylinders and looks like the have a legitimate game plan and vision, both with the run and the pass. With that being said, the Eagles defense also looks as good as it has all season. This is going to be a huge battle, strength on strength.\n\nThe big difference will be the Eagles offense against the Bears defense. The Eagles offense has no vision, no cohesion, no identity. The fact that Saquon Barkley has shown such little explosion this season is insane. With this, the Eagles WRs, who have a top 3 1-2 punch at the position in the league, have been wildly inconsistent to the point that Devonta Smith is taking over as the WR1 in recent weeks. To top it off, Jalen Hurts has not been playing good football. Put all that together and add on the fact that the Bears are getting back their top defender in Jaylon Johnson, and this spells trouble. \n\nGame script is going to be huge in this one. The Eagles are going to need to find a way to play while having the lead and start running out the clock in the 4th in order to feel even somewhat comfortable. If they start playing from behind, it may start to spiral out of control. In either scenario, I think the Bears defense, who has been top 10 all season, keeps the Eagles in check throughout the game and limit them under 26.5 points. \n\nRemember to only bet what you can afford to lose, and BOL!",

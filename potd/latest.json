Garry and Belal are both notoriously boring fighters with both having a majority of their fights in the UFC going to decision. Garry has also come off two short notice fights vs two absolute killers in Shavkat and Prates which both went to decision, so if they cant knock him out in 3-5 rounds I just can't see Belal doing it.\n\nNow I know theres a case for Belal since he's a former world champ but I just don't see him winning vs Garry's skillset. If Garry can keep this fight on the feet I don't see Belal winning in a kickboxing match and Garry can definitely prevent some takedowns and even manage his own on the ground. The line has also been moving upwards for Garry so I'm riding with him today. BOL and bet responsibly.",

Sweet deal! On to pick #3:\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\n**NBA | Orlando Magic vs. New York Knicks | 5:00pm EDT**\n\n**Pick:**  Desmond Bane & Jalen Suggs each to make 2+ Three Pointers (+100), 5 units\n\n**Write Up:** This slate kind of sucks lol. Going with the closest game we have today with the highest projected total for this prop. The Knicks are still missing Anunoby and are still letting up the second most threes to their opponents in the NBA. The other teams that let up Threes at that scale are the jazz, clippers, pelicans, and wizards. What a group to be a part of...\n\nI know that there will be a lot of threes in this one, but couldn't choose between these two guys. Given the recent streakiness on FG% from Suggs, and it being a coin toss if Bane will hit 2 or 3, I didn't feel comfortable taking either of their individual lines here--BUT Bane has hit at least 2 over his last 6 games, and Suggs hit 5 over 9 attempts in his last game. so we are going with both of them to hit 2+ threes at even odds.\n\nMagic crushed the Knicks last time they met in NY, and they play even better at home, while the Knicks are 1-4 on the road.\n\n**Take Bane & Suggs both to make 2+ Threes**\n\n*Please tail at your own risk and only ever wager what you can afford to lose.

Unfortunate loss is an understatement at this point. That’s twice this week Anthony Edwards has cost me money. How unlucky was that loss yesterday you ask??? Well take a look at the picture I posted below. 🤦‍♂️ Moving on from the past and coming back to the present, here’s a little context on why I’m going with that under for the Pistons vs Bucks game. The Pistons are elite defensively. They have a 111.1 defensive rating which ranks 2nd best in the NBA. The Bucks are without Giannis Antetokounmpo which significantly hurt the Bucks offense. The Bucks are decent defensively as well with the 11th best defensive rating (117.6). The Bucks offense should have trouble scoring vs a top defense especially without Giannis. The Pistons have a good offense however they aren’t an elite offense. They rank 12th in the league in offensive rating (118.2). Another important factor to take into consideration is the pace of play. Both the Pistons and Bucks play at an average pace. The Pistons rank 14th in the league in pace and the Bucks are tied for 16th. The total on this game has also seen reverse line movement with majority of the public on the over however majority of money on the under and line movement moving in favor of the under. With these factors, let’s take the under 226.5 points in this game\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hsa0a666iu2g1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7fd6e2d7a4997dbae810cc95ad5545681e0fd5bb",

Versatility is offered as well, with a 4-2-2 split (forwards-backs-hybrids), meaning that the bench is flexible in what it offers depending on how the game is unfolding.\nFurthermore, vibes in the Springbok camp will be high after having won comfortably against both France and Italy with only 14 men in both games. Barring a red card for the third successive game, the Springboks will be at full strength for this fixture in a want-to-win game.",

If you would’ve told me they’d have the same record as the Hornets 15 games in, i’d be surprised by how well the Hornets must be playing. \n\nAnyway, LA is coming off a 3-game losing including a terrible performance against the Magic the other night. Still without Kawhi, this team looks awful. Now they’re heading into Charlotte facing a team full of rising stars. Melo, Miles, and Kon have been electric despite posting a losing record so far.  I expect this to be a shootout game, and with that said, give me the core of younger guys that will be able to keep up the pace down the stretch.\n\nWith that mentioning of a shootout, i don’t hate the look on the over as well. Both of these teams have something to prove, and I’m expecting a high-scoring affair as Harden and Melo duke it from 3.\n\n*BOL and let’s get this first POTD win!*",

With starting RB J.K. Dobbins out, Harvey easily carried the 9+ rush attempts & also grabbed 3 receptions on just 3 targets, however Denver's offensive line, or should I say the lack of any cohesive one, not only stymied two rushing attempts from Harvey behind the line of scrimmage while Denver was inside K.C.'s 10yd yard, but they also managed to hit Nix & block a pass which appeared to be intended for a wide-open Harvey sitting 2yds deep in the end zone. Alas, we'll never know, regardless we move on \n\nTODAY'S P.O.T.D. - (1PM EST) Wash. St.@James Madison University (NCAAF) -TAKING JAMES MADISON UNIVERSITY -13.5 (-130)\n\nWAGER AMOUNT: 2.6u (to win 2u)\n\nReasoning/Projected Analysis: Last week, the College Football Playoff Committee released their playoff selections & there were a few small surprises, however NONE OF THEM were anywhere near as big as their total snub of James Madison University, as the Dukes were left out despite owning a 9-1 record & being by far the best \"Group of 5\" team in the country, thus far. Instead, the committee opted to select a better known team from a slightly bigger conference, the 8-2 Tulane Green Wave, a team with two losses & both of which came in absolute blowouts. One is/was rather understandable having occured while playing against top-ranked Mississippi St., but the other loss.. well, let's just say for that one not nearly so much where in a game vs the UTSA Roadrunners (4-4 at the time & who now still hold a mediocre record of 5-5)  who went on to slaughter Tulane by almost 3 TD's. In comparison, JMU's sole defeat occurred against the undefeated Louisville Cardinals (2-0 at the time, currently 7-3 & technically still competing for an outside shot at the ACC title). Not to mention the game itself took place in Louisville, a notoriously tough place to play. To say that the Dukes are upset even since the release of the committee's projected playoff bracket would be the UNDERSTATEMENT OF THE YEAR!! That being said, let's move on to today's game specifically....\n      This week the Duke's are at home playing Washington State, a team that's 5-5, as well as one who was (until this year) a perennial \"major conference\" school & a member of the highly respected Pac 10. Besides, all of the stats & analytics being in the Dukes favor, as well as the cross-country trip Washington St. had to take before playing today's game at (what is normally) 10AM their time on the Pacific Coast, the Dukes have also had two weeks to prepare for this game, coming off of a bye from last week. Lastly, with just two games left in the season & JMU's next (& final) game being vs Coastal Carolina (a team in which a victory of any margin certainly will not garner them much more respect in the eyes of the committee), one thing that has become very clear to JMU is that THE TIME IS NOW!!! To be totally frank, James Madison is a two touchdown favorite for good reason, primarily because they are the better team, and significantly better than Washington St. However, one thing that you can be ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN of for this weekend is that James Madison WILL NOT take their foot off the gas regardless of what that scoreboard may be (& the coaches have already acknowledged this), as this is their one & final chance to not just impress the BCS playoff committee, but also for a victory against a former member of a major conference & thus, by doing so, they will also earn themselves a ranking somewhere inside of the AP & Coaches' \"Top 25\" polls making it much harder for them to be overlooked, especially when you consider that they're already currently sit as the first team just outside of those polls as it is. Mark my words, JMU makes history..TODAY!!\n\nBEST OF LUCK! Now, let's cash this shyte out!!!",

Gosport are in the 6th position and tied in points with the 5th which leads to the playoffs. They have the third best attack with 34 goals in 16 games and have been in a great shape compared to their last campaign. On the other hand, their opponents Tiverton are dead last and have the worst attacking and defending stats in the league. Their form is abysmal and right now they would have been the underdog against anyone. Gosport should easily win\n\nWalton & Hersham have the best record and form in the league (13-1-1). Their only draw and loss came in the first three games in August so they have since won 12 games in a row. They continue their campaign just like last year where they missed out on promotion in the playoffs. Their opponents Hungerford have yet to win a game since September and are in a pretty bad shape, which isn’t really represented in the standings since they starting off pretty well by winning against the weaker teams of the league. Again I would be surprised if W&H don’t take an easy win\n\n\nThank you for anyone taking their time to read my post! BOL",

In the Premier League, these are two teams you can trust when it comes to generating attacking chances and shots on target.\n\nLiverpool at home have been very reliable this season, averaging 5.2 shots on target per Premier League home match. They’re facing a Nottingham Forest side that typically spends long stretches defending deep, especially away from home. With Liverpool’s attack at Anfield and the pressure they usually apply, I expect them to create enough chances to get to 5.\n\nManchester City have also been strong in this area, averaging 5.18 shots on target per Premier League match this season. They’ve been in good form lately too, beating Liverpool 3-0 in their last match. Even in tougher matchups, City usually find ways to generate attempts just through sheer possession and chance creation. Newcastle at home tend to play more open, which actually benefits City in terms of shot volume. City is the better side and I think they will show it and create at least 5 shots on target.\n\nBoth teams sit right around the number we need on season averages alone. 5 shots on target is very achievable given the offensive output from two of the most consistent attacking sides in the league. Getting this at +114 feels like great value considering how these games are expected to go.\n\n\n\nBOL and God bless.",

Clippers have not been great at rebounding, ranked 22th, while Charlotte has been one of the top teams. \n\nClippers, the oldest team in the NBA playing in the morning on a multi-game road trip, vs Hornets, one of the youngest teams in the NBA, is a recipe for boards.\n\nFull Stats if you'd like to do additional research: [https://www.statpick.ai/33833588/kon-knueppel-rebounds](https://www.statpick.ai/33833588/kon-knueppel-rebounds)\n\nBOL!",

      "text": "POTD Record: 19-7 (+13.3U)\n\nLast Pick: Butler -1.5 (-110) (1U) ✅\n\n[Butler write up](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/s/Z4PiyzksvF)\n\nButler straight up out muscled those cocks! Controlled the pace the entirety of the game and absolutely dominated the boards… Thad matta brought some real physicality this year w them dawgs! I appreciate all the support! Means a lot guys.\n\nEvent: Missouri @ Oklahoma (11am central)\n\nPOTD: Standard 6.5 two team teaser (Oklahoma +1/ Under 49) (NCAAFB) (-120) (1U)\n\n-everything is bet to win unit amount-\n\nWrite up: \n\nOklahoma +1:\n\nThis game sets up perfectly for Oklahoma. Missouri’s identity is built on pounding the rock, but the Sooners’ front is one of the best in the nation against the run, allowing just 2.5 yards per carry. That forces Missouri into passing downs with a quarterback who’s still green. Sam Zollers already struggled badly against Texas A&M’s relentless pass rush (he was strip sacked twice and looked lost out there) — and if A&M is ranked first nationally in sack percentage, guess who’s number two? Oklahoma. That pressure, combined with a secondary that allows only 182 passing yards per game at 6.0 yards per attempt, is a recipe for stalled drives and mistakes.\n\nOklahoma’s defense is elite across the board: 14.1 points allowed per game, 264 total yards surrendered, and just 4.2 yards per play given up. Their offense is middle-of-the-pack at 374 yards per game and 5.5 yards per play, but Venables knows this team’s formula is defense-first. Coming off the Alabama upset, the Sooners cannot afford a slip-up with two losses already on the books. Motivation is sky-high, and Venables has proven he gets his team locked in after emotional wins.\n\nFrom a betting perspective, Oklahoma has been reliable at home. They’re 5-1 ATS in Norman this season, and Venables’ teams have consistently covered when favored by less than a touchdown. Missouri, meanwhile, has struggled against top-tier defenses, going 1-3 ATS against ranked opponents this year. Teasing Oklahoma down to +1 essentially asks them to win outright, and with their defense dictating the pace, that’s the sharp side of this teaser.\n\n Under 49:\n\nThe under is the natural complement here. Oklahoma’s offense moves the ball but doesn’t finish drives with consistency. While their overall red-zone scoring percentage is technically perfect (they’ve converted every trip into points), the issue is touchdowns versus field goals. the Sooners stall in the red zone, often settling for three instead of seven. That inefficiency is why they average just 28.3 points per game (64th nationally) despite being a playoff contender. Against Alabama, they managed only 23 points, and their season-long profile shows a lack of explosive scoring.\n\nMissouri’s defense is strong in its own right, allowing 16.1 points per game and 4.1 yards per play. Their run-heavy style naturally shortens games, but against Oklahoma’s front, those runs will be bottled up. That means long possessions that end in punts or field goals. Zollers isn’t equipped to bail them out with chunk plays through the air, and both teams average around 6.6 yards per pass attempt, which is pedestrian.\n\nThe ATS trends back the under: Oklahoma games have gone 8-2 to the under this season, and Missouri’s grind-it-out style reinforces that. With two elite defenses on the field, a quarterback under siege, and an Oklahoma offense that settles for field goals, this game profiles as a grind. Teasing the total up to 49 gives us a wide cushion, and the matchup screams low scoring. Not to mention the public is all on the over in this one and the line has stayed stagnant around 42 where it is now at 42.5 most books! As always, cheers 🍻\n\nUpdate: I’m sorry I wrote this write up earlier but I have since seen pribula is starting. This is still the play we are rocking with and nothing shall change there. Pribula also  doesn’t fare the best under pressure. He was sacked 3 times for a Loss of 17 yards in a double ot win over Auburn and threw 2 picks that game. Missouris offensive line is also shaky against top tier defensive lines such as Oklahoma. Plus this is his first game back off an ankle injury. Let’s roll",

To start of I really like Vanderbilt (8-2) at home in this one over Kentucky (5-5) as Vanderbilt has not dropped a game at home so far this year and they are coming off a weeks rest coming off the bye week. Vanderbilts two losses this year have came against ranked teams on the road in Alabama and Texas. This Vanderbilt offense ranks 9th in the nation in scoring averaging over 38 points per game with a balanced rushing and passing attack. Kentucky has struggled on the road this year with only one road win and they have failed to score over 14 points on the road this year. Kentucky also does not play well against good competition as they are 0-4 against ranked opponents and 0-5 against power 5 opponents at .500 or better. I think this Vandy defense matches up well against this Kentucky offense as the Wildcats lean into their run game and the Vandy defense is a good rush defense ranking 24th out of 136 so I think they will be able to minimize yards on first down runs and force the Wildcats into predictable passing situations. I also like Texas (7-3) over Arkansas (2-8) as I think the Longhorns bounce back at home after a tough road loss against Georgia. Texas also has not lost on their home field this year and this Arkansas team they face off against has not won a road game or have beaten a single power 5 opponent this year. Arkansas has the worst defense in the SEC this year ranking in the 100s in passing yards allowed, rush yards allowed and points allowed so I dont think the Longhorns will have a problem moving the ball in this one. But on the flip side this Texas defense is a very good one as they excel in stopping the run as they are 6th in the nation in rushing defense only allowing 80 rush yards per game and 18 points per game. Arkansas has also struggled in the pass game recently failing to record 200 passing yards in their past 2 games and throwing for 5 interceptions in the past 3 games. With all of this being said I think Vandy and Texas both cruise to home wins this Saturday afternoon.\n\nPrediction: 34-27 Vandy, 30-23 Texas\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vge8wy1olq2g1.jpeg?width=1099&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=96cc4e5de7a81bd0a2f2fc1053fadeb1d1ac7d3f",

Draymond got a steal not even 2 minutes into the start of the game, and then cashed us out halfway through the 2nd quarter. Let’s hopefully go on a win streak.\n\nEvent: Detroit Pistons Vs. Milwaukee Bucks 8:00 PM EST\n\nToday's POTD: Jalen Duren Over 11.5 Rebounds\n\nOdds: -120\n\nWrite Up: Again, I consider mostly if not everything, and they will be listed in categories so it will be easier for you guys.\n\nMatchup:\nThe Detroit Pistons visit the Milwaukee Bucks—a game that projects a fast pace and lots of shot volume. Milwaukee takes the second-most threes per game in the NBA, creating long rebound chances for opposing bigs. They’re also top-10 in possessions per game, which means a higher total rebounding opportunity.\n\nPlayer/Position Analysis:\nJalen Duren is Detroit’s foundation at center, averaging 12.3 rebounds per game. He commands over 35% of all available rebounds while on the floor and ranks among the league leaders in both offensive and defensive rebounding rate.\n\nMilwaukee is allowing the third-most rebounds per game to centers, a weakness rooted in their “let-threes-fly, clear-out-the-paint” scheme. Brook Lopez spends time on the perimeter defensively, leaving the glass to opponents’ centers.\n\nDuren has hit 12+ boards in 5 of his last 6 starts—including games against teams with similar spacing (Indy, Atlanta, Denver).\n\nFull minutes are guaranteed; without a quality backup and no foul-prone matchup (Lopez and Giannis don’t draw many fouls from opposing bigs), Duren’s 32–35 minutes are secure barring something unforeseen.\n\nStatistical Profile:\nAdvanced models (RotoWire, DK) project Duren to 13.7–15.1 rebounds Saturday.\n\nBucks are fourth-worst in offensive board rate allowed to centers, and Duren specializes here (leads all centers in putback attempts per 100 possessions).\n\nIn 2 games vs. Milwaukee over the last calendar year, Duren posted 13 and 15 rebounds (outperformed league average by 18%).\n\nGame Script:\nVegas spread sits at Bucks -5.5: projects a competitive, likely full-fourth-quarter contest.\n\nBoth teams need every win—no load management or early bench risk.\n\nDetroit is highly unlikely to go small—even down double digits, Duren stays on the floor (he played 37 min in a 15-point loss last week).\n\nInjuries & Rotations:\nDetroit’s big rotation is thin: no Bagley, no Wiseman, and recent interview clips show the coaching staff specifically praising Duren’s rebounding focus.\n\nMilwaukee at full firepower means Duren’s size is necessary all game.\n\nHistorical Context:\nDuren averages 14.2 RPG in games with 30 minutes or more.\n\nMilwaukee gives up career-best rebounding nights to true centers; other bigs (Gobert, Capela, Allen) have shattered this line.\n\nSo why this pick? Milwaukee is an elite pace-up, three-point volume opponent with chronic struggle boxing out true centers. Duren is in elite recent form, projected for 13.7–15.1 boards by every respected simulation, faces a thin backup rotation (guaranteed full minutes), and has zero risk indicators (no foul issues, no blowout concern, no injuries). This is the top “insane value” rebound prop for Saturday. \n\nBOL!",

Today, I am tipping Wanderers to break their slump and get their first win of the season. Having lost a bunch of attacking threat over the offseason, they have been slow to get going with only two goals scored, but have been reasonably solid at the back despite conceding in each game. They are broadly conceding to low quality chances and not conceding many good ones, and the Mariners have struggled to create much of note most weeks - scoring only against Newcastle (worst defence in the league), Perth (second worst defence in the league, and Wellington (equal fourth worst). I think they will struggle to break Wanderers down here, while the hosts will at least grab one or two. Not gonna be a thrashing, but think it will be comfortable for Wanderers.",

Recife went 1-0 up early which set up a big shock and went 1-0 up in corners before a first red card was shown to the underdogs. Obviously at that point Flamengo piled pressure and equalised but nevertheless the count was 3-0 which 90% of the time would lead to the play winning. But ANOTHER red card was handed to Recife which made it mission impossible for this play to win despite them leading corners 4-3 at the half. I can’t explain how rare (and suspicious) a double red is in a first half and no surprises that Flamengo then took control of the game, winning 5-1 and 15 to 4 corners with 90% 2H possession. Can’t fault the maths despite the losing streak but I’ll make sure to avoid leagues with severe accusations of corruption which is my bad for tipping.\n\nI’ve been very impressed by Brentford this season - whom I’d expected to be in a relegation battle before the season started. They finished 10th last year but having sold their best players in Mbeumo, Wissa, Nørgaard, losing manager Tom Frank and not really replacing them I, just like many, was expecting a huge fall-off. I’ve got to commend set-piece coach Keith Andrews for his work at the Bees who may be 12th but have picked up some huge wins against Newcastle, Liverpool, United, Villa amongst other great results. Brighton have similarly had some really solid results currently sitting a spot above Brentford with wins over Newcastle, Chelsea and City. Hürzeler has done a really good job with the Seagulls since taking over last season, playing some nice direct football and I do expect them to be fighting for the European spots this season.\n\nBrighton has averaged 3.9 corners won and 4.6 conceded over their last 20 at the Amex whilst Brentford has won 4.9 and conceded 6.2 on the road in the same time period. Also using more recent stats to reflect the current forms of the teams I get an expected 4.6 corners for the Seagulls and 4.9 for the Bees. That gives this play a 72% chance of winning. I must warn though that this play lost by a corner in last year’s fixture but am not fussed about it considering it was 11 months ago. Brentford have covered the line in 12/15 away (+ L5) and Brighton’s opponents in 12/15 at home (+ L7) so I love this spot. BOL !\n\nI’m raising money for Movember, ALL proceeds will be going to a good cause. Donations aren’t expected but very much appreciated so if you have profited from my picks please do consider donating, a little goes a long way.

They have dominated Newcastle recently, winning 4-0 in the last meeting, but Newcastle are fighting to avoid relegation so they will play hard at home, making the draw protection valuable just in case it ends 1-1 or 2-2. Last 11 games of Newcastle had over 1.5 goals while last 22 of 24 games there's been over 1.5 goals in City matches. With City's quality and Erling Haaland leading the line, they should score at least once or twice, and even if they don't win comfortably, a 1-1 draw or 2-1 win both cover this bet perfectly, making it a safer option than just backing City to win outright.\n\nIf you found these picks helpful, tips or donations are greatly appreciated as they support the time and effort I put into creating them: [buy me a beer🍻](https://buymeacoffee.com/hercules.son.of.zeus)",

This is a great spot for the Hawkeyes playing their final home game of the season at Kinnick in what will turn into a night game on senior night. \n\nIowa is 8-1 this season ATTS against Division 1 opponents. They keep games extremely tight against top level competition, and blow the doors off of lesser opponents. This is the first time all season that they’ve been favored by double digits against a P4 opponent, and with an average win margin of 28 against non ranked opponents, this game will follow the same story against Michigan State.\n\nIowa has finally unlocked a bit of a passing game from Mark Gronowski, and their OC Tim Lester does an extremely good job horizontally attacking the field. This team has gotten better and better in every facet week by week. \n\nThe only way to beat Iowa is to be truly elite. USC has Lemon and Lane, and were just chucking up 50/50 balls to them, in which they went 8/10. Both receivers are likely to be first round picks in this years NFL draft, and they used them to barely squeak out a win against Iowa. Oregon used their #1 nationally rushing offense and elite heisman caliber QB to squeak out of Iowa City with a win. Indiana used their Heisman front runner QB to barely squeak out of Iowa City with a win. Iowa State threw the ball to their 6’8 tight ends and got a few really good bounces to win in a rivalry game.\n\nRutgers lost by 10 points to Iowa but was able to keep the game competitive by throwing to their elite WR’s who will be 1st or 2nd round draft picks.\n\nIn games where teams don’t truly have a nationally elite threat, Iowa steps on their neck like they did against Minnesota, winning 41-3, against Wisconsin winning 37-0. \n\nMichigan State’s offense ranks 65th in the country per PFF, and their defense ranks 115th in the country. Michigan State is They’re banged up at the QB position, potentially having to turn to their third string freshman QB if Chiles or Milijovic aren’t ready to go. The last place I want to be when making my first collegiate start is Iowa City in November against a Phil Parker defense. Michigan State is 0-7 in conference play, having gotten spanked by every team in the Big 10 by a minimum of 10 points, with the exception being Minnesota, where they only lost by 3.\n\nMichigan State has one of the most abysmal O-lines in the country, ranking 121st at pass blocking. Iowa has one of the best pass rushes in the country, ranking 9th. If Iowa can get them behind the sticks with a sack, there’s very little chance of Michigan State getting anything going to advance the drive.\n\nIowa has gone through a gauntlet of top ranked opponents in the past 3 weeks, and will look to enforce their will against a dog shit Michigan State team on senior night. This is one of the only times I’ve felt Iowa will come into a game explicitly looking to run up the score and excite the fans. Good luck!",

Their recent match pattern is consistently high-scoring, and both their tactical pragmatism—dropping deeper to exploit transition speed—and their well-staffed attack with Hansen, Helenius, John and Ross point toward another open game. Kolding, meanwhile, have regressed defensively after major player sales, conceding 19 in 16 matches and suffering repeated back-line and goalkeeper errors, yet their more possession-oriented setup under Rudé and the emergence of Morozov also keep them dangerous going forward. With Kolding urgently needing points to re-enter the top six, and their away matches averaging 2.5 goals with a 10:10 scoreline, both the motivation and tactical profiles suggest a stretched matchup. Given AaB’s recent run of over-the-line games and Kolding’s unstable defense, over 2.5 goals is well supported by form, setup and motivation.",

McGinn had two great chances, one shot bent literally inches over and outside the post and the 2nd was a rocket into the crowd that took an unlucky block by a defender. At least it was a super fun game to watch as expected. We move on. \n\nPremier League is back after the international break, and we've got a great slate this weekend! Today we're naturally back in England as 17th place Burnley hosts 3rd place Chelsea in the early early window. And we are running back our very first POTD and backing Enzo Fernandez for 1+ shot on target. Chelsea will want and expect a decisive win here to collect all 3 points and continue their promising start to the season, whereas Burnley are fighting to stay above the relegation zone. \n\nI was honestly shocked to see this line so high. Enzo has hit at least one SOT in his last 5/5 EPL matches and now 7 of 8 in all comps since Palmer has been out. Palmer is training again, but still out for this match per coach. Enzo did pick up an injury before the international break, but is fully recovered and available according to coach Maresca. There is a non-zero chance he does not start, but I still like thisnif he comes on as a sub. **You may want to wait for lineups an hour before gametime if you are worried about this.** I'll be asleep until kickoff, so I'm taking it now. \n\nThe same data still applies from my last post - Enzo is the team captain, the likely penalty taker, and loves to shoot (free kicks, outside the box, headers in the box, etc). Burnley hold more possession than you'd expect a bottom 5 team to, but they also give up a lot of shots - 15 (7 SOT) to Wolves, 12 (8) to Arsenal, and 15 (6) to West Ham over their last 3. \n\nWe cashed this at -110 a few weeks ago, hoping we can run it back for even money. BOL and have a great weekend!",

They completely shut down the Bills offense and allowed only 3 points in the second half. This one came down to the wire and I loved watching this game!\n\nToday's POTD 11/22/25: Total match points U42.5 (-105 Bet365)\n\nEvent: Missouri @ Oklahoma 10:00MST\n\nWrite up: This week Missouri will be visiting Oklahoma in what I predict to be a close and low scoring affair between a lackluster Sooners offense and a run first Tiger's team. Missouri has been living and dying on the run this year and ranks top 15 in every major rushing category this season. However, they will be going up against a very tough and stingy Oklahoma rush defense. The Sooners defense has allowed only 82 yards per game and a very strict 2.5 yards per carry this season and I believe they will prove to be a very difficult obstacle for Missouri's fairly one dimensional offensive attack. Although Missouri has done very well vs. the under, out of their two away games this year, they both have hit the under. There's not much to be said about the Sooners on the other side of the ball. The offense has been a very lackluster part of the team and Mateer hasn't been playing well since his injuring his hand against Auburn earlier this season. Not to mention, Missouri's defense hasn't been great by any stretch of the word but they have been very competent against the run and pass and they tackle incredibly well with a 90% tackle success rate that's good enough to be ranked 4th in the nation. I don't trust Oklahoma to be able to keep the scoring consistent as they have hit the under in 4 of their last 5 games and I don't forsee much of a turn around moving into this game.\n\nTail or fade BOL to everyone and cheers! 🍻",

Over the last 3 years he’s putting up 22 PPG in 4 matchups, and if you zoom in even more, his last 5 vs LAC are at 21.2 PPG with some strong all-around numbers. So he’s already shown he can score on this team consistently.\n\n\nBridges is also that guy for Charlotte right now. When the offense stalls, the ball naturally finds him. He gets the volume, he gets the freedom, and when he’s aggressive early, he usually stays hot.\n\n\nAnd the matchup helps. The Clippers defense against wings hasn’t been great ,their D-rating vs SF is 116.5, which basically means they bleed points to that position. They guard PFs better, but SFs who can shoot, slash, and play from the perimeter give them problems… which is literally Bridges’ whole game.\n\n\nIf this turns into a faster-paced game or if Charlotte ends up leaning on Bridges for offense (which they usually do), he should have plenty of chances to get to 20+. This line feels very hittable.",

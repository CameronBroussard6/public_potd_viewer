I have a good following on X @bc3putts because of my handicapping record/history)\n\nNet Units: 0.00\n\nROI: 0%\n\nSport: NCAAM Basketball\nEvent: Iona @ Delaware \nTime: Monday December 1st 7pm\nTime Zone: EST \n\nPick: Iona -1.5 -115 (DraftKings)\n\nWrite Up: This game is very intriguing to me. It’s a\ncomplete contrast of the tempos. Iona ranks 18th in adjusted tempo compared to a Delaware team that ranks 258th in the country. I also like the average offensive possession length differential between the two. Iona ranks 52nd and Delaware ranks 356th in the country. Iona likes to run, Delaware likes to slow it down. Iona won’t be slowed down. Delaware will be playing catch up all game long and have to cave to Iona’s style of play. \n\nIona scores 85ppg\nDelaware only scores 69ppg\nIona averages 8 more shot attempts a game than Delaware.\nIona averages 5 more made free throws a games and 5 more rebounds a game than Delaware. These are all more scoring opportunities in Iona’s favor. \n\nIona (5-2) has beaten a lot of good teams including Hofstra, Fordham, Princeton, and Oregon State. With losses to a stout Akron team and a gritty Green Bay squad. \n\nDelaware on the other end comes into this matchup 2-4 on the year including a loss to a non D1 opponent. Their best win is vs a 1-7 UNC Greensboro team and that was their last game. \n\nThis spread of -1.5 doesn’t make much sense to me. I have this game handicapped this at Iona -5.5. I simply don’t think Delaware has the offensive fire power to keep up with this high octane Iona team. \n\nMy prediction for the game is Iona 82 Delaware 73\n\nLet’s rock",

The Giants are allowing a league-high 6.2 yards per carry to running backs. They are also allowing a league high 2.23 yards before contact per run. They have given up the most explosive runs this season allowing a 15+ yard run on 9.6% of runs & have given up the most 20+ yard runs in the NFL (15) and 40+ (6). The Giants are last in defensive EPA against the run (-50.5). Last week Jahmyr Gibbs went off for 219 rushing yards on just 15 carries, averaging 14.6 yards per carry. TreVeyon is averaging 5.4 yards per carry in his 5 starts & Vegas has his rush total at 14.5 carries, which would equate to around 75 rushing yards. Henderson the last 3 weeks: 330 total yards, 252 yards after contact, 10 rushes for 1st down, 12 missed tackles forced. He has had 20+ Touches in consecutive games. Had a 72.4% backfield share last week, even after Stevenson returned. Stevenson had just 6 rushes for 5 yards. This is Henderson’s backfield. \n\nPats favored by -7.5 at home. They have trailed at halftime just once this season, fewest in the NFL. The Pats will play with the lead & feed TreVeyon.\n\n__TreVeyon Henderson o63.5 rushing yards__\n\n*Official write-up coming in the morning*\n\nAppreciate the love!

      "text": "Record 0-0\n\nPOTD: TreVeyon Henderson (New England Patriots)\n\nProp: Over 60.5 Rushing Yards (BET365)\n\nOdds: ~ -115 (Implied 53.5%)\n\nTrue Probability: ~75%\n\nInvestment Strategy:\nThis prop should be the foundational piece of any Week 13 portfolio. The margin for error is significant; Henderson could perform well below his recent averages and still clear this number simply due to the Giants' defensive efficiency (or lack thereof).\n\nIf Lawrence is ruled out or limited, the confidence in this prop moves from 95% to near-certainty, as the interior of the Giants line would collapse entirely. Bettors should monitor the inactives list 90 minutes before kickoff, but the recommendation stands regardless of Lawrence's status due to the perimeter weakness caused by Thibodeaux's absence.",

Something to watch for 👀 \n\n￼Today’s pick:\n\nNFL Football 🏈 \n\nNew York Giants @ New England Patriots | 8:15PM EST / GMT -5 (24 hours from time of comment)\n\n2-leg parlay \n\nPatriots -6.5 alt line + TreVeon Henderson OVER 50 rush yards alt line\n\n(+116 DK) 2 units\n\n￼Write Up: The Giants are terrible, and the Pats should have no problem beating them soundly. Although they haven’t been especially sharp in the last couple games, the Giants lack any cohesive strategy, have a QB returning from injury and have a couple new coaches. They are utterly rudderless and probably have no motivation to dig deep in ice cold windy conditions at Foxboro. I think the one touchdown differential is pretty safe here.\n\nThe weather and game script will call for plenty of ground and pound with emergent RB TreVeon Henderson. Due to the timeshare with Rhamondre Stevenson I’m opting for his alt line of 50+ rush yards. Should be easy as the Giants rush defense is currently Swiss cheese.\n\nBOL!",

Pittsburgh’s history of competitive games vs. Philadelphia, their recent record in close games, and relatively even recent scoring/defense rates..betting on them staying within 1.5 goals is a statistically defensible expectation. Pittsburgh still has Sydney Crosby who is always a threat. The flyers are not good enough to keep this one clean. Plain and simple.",

According to recent previews, several of Fenerbahçe’s summer signings are settled in and ready — giving their coach the flexibility and depth to field a competitive, balanced XI. Meanwhile, Galatasaray face significant injury and suspension issues: their star striker Victor Osimhen is sidelined with a thigh muscle problem and won’t be available; key defender Wilfried Singo is also out with a serious hamstring injury; and due to red-card suspension, winger Roland Sallai will miss the derby. Additional doubts linger over others: defenders like Kaan Ayhan, midfielders such as Berkan Kutlu, and attackers like Yunus Akgün or Ismail Jakobs reportedly could be unavailable or not match-fit. \n\n\\- Tactically, this works heavily in Fenerbahçe’s favor. With Galatasaray missing so many defenders and offensive weapons, their usual structure will likely be disrupted — making them vulnerable at the back and less dangerous up front. Meanwhile, Fenerbahçe’s relative squad unity, fully fit attacking options, and stable back-line (despite some absentees) give them both balance and creativity. With the derby played in Fenerbahçe’s favor and their motivation high — chasing supremacy in Istanbul and eager to capitalize on their rival’s fragility — the conditions are ideal for a confident, dominant performance.\n\n\\- Given the contrast in fitness, depth and tactical readiness, Fenerbahçe appear significantly better placed to control the match and secure a victory.",

Once again I feel like Vegas is overvaluing a favorite here. I anticipate the commanders to pick apart this broncos defense and keep it close in the end. Loving that we're getting 6 points with the commies on the spread and I wouldn't be shocked to see them win outright here. Once again, will be doing 5 units on the spread and 0.4 units on the moneyline at +240.\n\n\nJust to reiterate, in conjunction with my model, I use the eye test as well as my gut feeling to play what I believe is the most-valuable pick on the slate.

Game script ended up being exactly what we expected and more, great pick for us.\n\nToday’s POTD: 🏈 Giants +7.5 (-115).\n\nGame starts at 8:15pm EST. Bet 2U\n\nWriteup: For Monday Night Football, we have the New England Patriots hosting the New York Giants. I don’t have a ton of statistics in this one as this is more of a play using the eye test and game scenario, but I like the Giants to cover the spread. \n\nThe Giants have covered the spread in each of their last 3 games and are now going up a Patriots team that barely squeaked by against the Bengals last week, who have one of the worst statistical defenses in the history of the NFL. The Giants are getting their starting QB back in Jaxson Dart, who despite not winning many games, has been well above an average QB according to many statistical measures.\n\nOn top of this, it was expected that this offense would completely fall off the rails after their star WR Malik Nabers was out for the remainder of the season with an injury. Surprisingly, many of the Giants’s offensive weapons have stepped up in a big way in Nabers’s absence. On the other side of the ball, the Giants have a very underrated defensive front thanks to players like Brian Burns and Kayvon Thibodeaux. I expect them to get lots of pressure on the Patriots QB Drake Maye, as the Patriots starting left tackle is out with an injury.\n\nI expect the Patriots to win this one, but I also expect it to be an ugly win. Giants will keep this one within a touchdown.\n\nRemember to only bet what you can afford to lose, and BOL!",

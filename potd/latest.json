Garza's minutes have been trending up again and with the Nuggets playing at a fast pace and without their two best centers, I like garza to get up a decent amount of shots. Hes been pretty efficient the past few games so if he gets 6+ shots, I think he hits this number. BOL",

      "text": "Record 5-0-3\nForm: ✅✅✅✅❌❌✅❌<-\n\nLast POTD: **Aston Villa v Forest: Villa DC & o8.5 corners @1.85❌**\n\nTodays POTD: **Barcelona v Bilbao: Barca -1 Asian Handicap @1.75**\n\nPrevious POTD: Missed this by one corner, had Forest not conceded the third, there would have definitely been about 3-4 more.  And having a troll of a goalkeeper like Emi Martinez, the guy just likes to waste time.  We were already at 8 corners by the 75th minute, but I knew after that third goal they were cooked.  \n\nBarcelona arrive in outstanding form, riding a **5-game winning streak** and performing well above league averages on both ends of the pitch. Over their last five matches they are scoring **2.0 goals per game** (rising to **2.5 gpg over the last 10**) while conceding just **0.2 gpg** recently (**0.9 gpg over 10**), numbers that clearly point to dominance rather than narrow wins. Their underlying metrics back this up, generating around **2.1 xG** per match and controlling territory for long stretches.\n\nAthletic Club, on the other hand, continue to struggle in attack, managing only **0.6 goals per game** across both recent windows, while conceding **1.0–1.2 gpg**. That combination of limited attacking output and a leaky defence is a bad recipe against a Barcelona side that scores first in roughly **80% of matches** and averages **1.8 second-half goals**, making it more likely they extend leads rather than protect slim ones.\n\nWith a **69.8% modelled home win probability**, high goal expectancy (Over **2.5 goals ~66%**), low BTTS likelihood (~**51%**), and Athletic’s tendency to concede under sustained pressure, the data supports a comfortable Barcelona win more often than a narrow one. This isn’t a blowout chase — it’s a controlled margin play with protection built in.\n\nBest of luck.",

This pick was looking good in the first quarter and just like the rest of the starters, Paolo disappeared and didn't play a minute of the 4th quarter. Well onto the next one. \n\n**Write up:** Back to the NHL where I seem to have success, I like this line where the Stars are coming off of a back to back, Capitals should punish this and put up goals to get us over this line. Stars are no slouches at scoring either, they put up 3.4 goals a game and allow 2.7. Capitals score 3.3 goals a game and allow 2.8. I expect this to go over the 5.5 line.\n\nBOL and only bet what you can afford to lose",

Komdo Dragon resumes from a spell of almost 1.5 years at a distance well short of its best, a set up that is disgusting and you couldn’t possibly back first up. Sister Daae is also first up from an 18 week spell, again at a distance well short of its best. Fitness should be limited with these two, whilst we are peaking fitness wise 3rd up",

      "text": "**POTD Record**: 3-1 (+2.95u)\n\n**Event**: English Premier League - Bournemouth vs Tottenham Hotspur - 20:00 GMT+0\n\n**Pick**: Bournemouth to win @2.2\n\n**Write Up**: Bournemouth are winless in 11, it's not really a reflection of their quality as a team as most football fans will know what this team can do and how good of a manager Andoni Iraola is, but it is an unfortunate reality. But all things come to and end, good and bad. And I think the Cherries are going to get their win here today. Spurs are in poor form and have picked up just one win in their last five, a smash and grab away to a Palace side look to have run out of energy. The Thomas Frank experiment doesn't seem to have worked, he has quality players in every position but they look like strangers on the pitch, they have 3 strikers they've paid £50m for and none of them are scoring. The fans are on his back and it seems like his fate is sort of inevitable at this point. Bournemouth, depsite their misfortune so far are ever positive. Taking on teams, playing positive football, working for each other while keeping fan support in a couple bad months. They feel like total opposites at the moment. Bournemouth sit 15th currently while Tottenham are 13th, 4 point separate them. But on the xPTS table, Tottenham are 12th showing that they are almost exactly where they deserve to be, while Bournemouth are 7th, showing they are underperforming their metrics. This Bournemouth side has always had a problem with seeing out results.\n\nOther smaller things to note are Tottenham's history of giving teams on bad runs points. So much so over the past couple years the 'Dr Tottenham will see you now' meme has emerged. It shows frailties in Tottenhams ability to beating the teaems they 'should' be beating given quality discrepancies. And it is also Antoine Semenyo's last game for Bournemouth. He will be joining Manchester City after this game so his performance could really effect the result in whether he wants to 'leave it all out there' or be conservative to avoid hurting himself and jeapordising his big move.\n\n**Additional Thoughts**: Big Result from Forest to take us to 3-1. Bit lucky with a late penalty but I feel I deserve the luck after that City/Chelsea game. I'm getting a bit cocky with my betting right now. I've doubled my bankroll in the past week and I'm buzzing so watch out for me losing my head! But no, seriously, I'm confident on this one. Bournemouth are due, they won the earlier fixture away from home and Spurs are just going through the motions.",

They are playing with growing confidence, especially in attack, scoring 10 goals in their last four league games. This includes an impressive 4–1 win at home against Bournemouth and a lively 4–2 away victory over Everton. Even in tougher matches, Brentford have looked solid and organised, as shown by their controlled 0–0 draw with Tottenham. Sunderland, on the other hand, arrive with resilience rather than rhythm. They have gone through a long run of draws, showing they are hard to beat but sometimes lack fluency going forward.\n\nAt home, Brentford tend to start fast and put teams under pressure early, as seen in their win over Bournemouth where attacks came one after another. While they have still shown some defensive weaknesses, conceding goals in three of their last five matches, they usually respond quickly. With a place in the top five within reach with a win in this upcoming game, Brentford will be confident going into the game, backed by a strong home record of four wins and two draws from their last six matches, and just one home defeat so far in the 2025–26 season.\n\nSunderland come into this match with a very different style. Four draws in their last five games show how hard they are to beat, but also highlight their lack of attacking threat. They have scored only three goals in that run, with several low-scoring results like 0–0 and 1–1 reflecting their cautious approach. Away from home, Sunderland focus on staying compact and waiting for counter-attacking chances. This was clear in their draws against Brighton and Tottenham. While this makes them competitive, it leaves little room for mistakes, especially against a team like Brentford that can apply pressure for long periods.\n\nBrentford’s recent attacking form stands out when compared to Sunderland’s struggles in front of goal, and playing at home only strengthens their case. Brentford have shown they can control games and turn that control into goals, while Sunderland’s run of draws could be exposed by a team that presses consistently. Brentford’s strong home record suggests they will be tough to beat.\n\nSunderland arrive unbeaten in five matches, but their lack of attacking threat could be an issue against a confident Brentford side. This looks like a close game, but with home advantage and better recent form, Brentford seem to have the edge. Sunderland are a solid team, yet they can look flat away from home. With Igor Thiago in good form, Brentford should have enough to edge a narrow win.\n\n**NOTE: Please only stake what you can afford to lose; know that no picks are 100% guaranteed to hit. Stake Responsibly.**",

But Neco came through for us and had a fantastic game. Nothing more needs saying, it feels great when a good read works out as expected! \n\nGuys I know I play Enzo a lot but listen, he's at plus money again and I can't help myself. We've cashed him 5 times now and I'm going to keep riding it. After the thrilling ending and cash a few days ago, we're backing Enzo again. For all the same reasons and a few more. \n\nThe 2nd half under their new interim coach last week was night and day to the first. The tactic changed and Enzo was back to his box crashing self. I expect Chelsea to start the game this way against Fulham, as they're not a team you park the bus against. The second reason is that their new manager, Liam Rosenior, will be in the stands watching. The players will want to impress their new coach, so I see Chelsea coming out strong. \n\n**Please wait for lineups if your book does not void for players who don't start.** I warn this a lot, and while I fully expect Enzo to start, we've been burned by stranger coaching subs. These guys are playing a game every 3 days, and so eventually coaches will rotate players. With FA Cup over the weekend and a likely break for many starters, I expect Chelsea to go all out to win this one.\n\nBOL if tailing and happy Wednesday!",

Inter’s youth side plays aggressive, high-tempo football and creates plenty of chances, especially at home. Sampdoria U19 may struggle defensively but usually contributes going forward, leaving space at the back. Youth matches are often open and unpredictable, and with both teams preferring attack over control, goals should come early and continue throughout the game. It seems that over 3.5 goals is not available for this match so i just added inter or draw. ",

I said that I was slightly worried about Liaoning’s form heading into this one and they ended up losing 25-12, 25-19, 25-12 to miss by 6 points. Regardless I still find the line was way too low so I can’t beat myself up for it and it did in fact end up moving to 126.5.\n\nYou know what my New Year’s resolution is? To go 365-0 on this thread. Well actually 358-0 because I’ve been testing my models. Today is day one of that. To recap the year it was alright with some ups (getting 10 wins in a row) and downs (towards the end was abysmal, sorry tailers). I do want to highlight I did win a pick that u/sigmabale tailed on 12/17/25 which is by far my biggest achievement in life. Really stop-start recently, the trends analyses weren’t working unfortunately. Variance? Maybe, but I’ll be focusing on my double faults plays now that the tennis season is back that brought me so much success + maybe the occasional prop I like. Tried something new in the off-season and it didn’t pay off, so be it that’s what betting is all about.\n\nI missed the thread being posted (sorry) but there’s about 2 hours to tail this so I’ll make it very quick. Sakkari has averaged a 5.3% double fault rate over the past year on hard courts. Using both players’ serving/returning stats + ELO differences I get an estimated 3.9 double faults for Maria across 21 games, anchoring it to the market line. That gives this play an estimated 72% chance of winning. She’s covered the line in 6/8 HC matches against the American though I will say that she didn’t DF the last time both played which I’m not worried about considering she’d committed 6 the week before that against Gauff last year. I actually think it’ll be a longer match than that which is good for the play because the Greek has looked very good in her opening two United Cup matches over strong opposition whilst Gauff was terrible against JBM.

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 7-24-3 *I once again go back to default settings real fast. I'll be the first one to admit, that simply wasn't a good pick on my part. I was still under the impression of all the Monday underdog stunts, but yesterday wasn't that kind of day and all the big Serie A teams got it over the line without any struggles. We move, and we move to a match that I'm super excited for*\n\n**Last Five:** ❌❌❌✅❌\n\n**Event:** Spanish Super Cup, FC Barcelona v Athletic Bilbao, 2:00 pm EST\n\n**POTD:** Athletic Bilbao +1.0 Asian Handicap +105, 3 units\n\n**Write Up:** Yes, I am once again fading Barcelona, but I truly believe today is going to be the day they slip up. Their high line has been getting away with too much, but in a match of this caliber, everything is going to look different and Athletic Bilbao aren't letting their mistakes go unpunished. Hear me out.\n\nBarcelona’s current *eight game winning streak and domestic superiority* sure sound impressive, but most of those victories have been **anything but smooth sailing.** Even in their latest game (against Espanyol) they were under heavy fire for the majority of the match and only a generational performance by Joan Garcia saved them from a potential embarrassment. We've seen this time and time again, and I just don't think Barcelona can survive playing like this for much longer. On the other side we have Athletic, on a very mixed run of form, but a team that is **more than solid in cup competitions.** They have **more Copa del Rey titles than Real Madrid,** for example, and have **won the Super Cup three times,** with the most recent win coming in 2021 (against Barca as well), but they've also reached the final the following year. In fact, they've **beaten Barcelona 3 times in the last 8** matches, suggesting that making life harder for the Catalan giant isn't a one-off occurence and that the play absolutely holds value at these scrumptious odds of +105.\n\nAthletic Bilbao are set up for a season of mediocrity, being somewhat disappointing in LaLiga and the Copa del Rey *(getting a narrow win against Ourense)* so far, as well as having an abysmal time in the Champions League, and that's why they're going to put **all their focus towards this competition** as it's realistically the only way they could collect some silverware come the end of the season.\n\nI also like the fact **Raphinha seemed completely ineffective** in the most recent game, showing that he hasn't quite shaken off his knock, while **Rashford seems to be on a crazy downtrend,** looking more and more of a ghost with each passing game *(bro thinks he's secured that contract).* **Yamal is also operating at about 80%,** trying to adapt to a new playing style. Meanwhile, in the midfield, **Frenkie de Jong often fails to control the game's tempo,** needlessly holding on to the ball and always making the most uncreative decision. **Pedri is also questionable because of the recent injury** (and ONLY because of that, as he's otherwise absolutely brilliant; without a doubt one of the best midfielders in the world). I don't think their **defence** needs much of an introduction, they're **all shakey** and only have Joan Garcia to thank for keeping the scorelines respectable. The team as a whole **keeps relying on Lewandowski's magic** off the bench, as well as **random moments of brilliance** from Yamal, Ferran Torres, Fermin and Olmo, but that's just not going to reliably happen. Joan was extra hyped up to deliver a cracking performance against Espanyol as that was his former club that now hates him for switching to their rivals, I can't see him have a performance at the same level again.\n\nOverall, everything is setting itself up nicely for a game, which Athletic Bilbao can definitely get something out of. They're a solid team that can always cause troubles to even the most elite clubs, as they're **hard to break down** and have the amazingly talented **Nico Williams** always ready to blow past the opposing defenders. *They do have a few absences of their own, but I don't think they matter as much in the grand scheme of things.*\n\nBear in mind, this is a knockout where tactics tend to be more cautious and even **small mistakes are punished,** that's why I can absolutely see Athletic Bilbao nab a cheeky win *(feeling a 2-1 here honestly)* or a draw *(which still wouldn't be disastrous all things considered).* I love the look of this matchup, been excited for it since the start of the year, so I'm going in with 3 whole units. If Flick fields Ferran in the starting XI, I'm loving these odds even more. I also like the BTTS Yes and the Under 3.5 goals angle, if you want to take those instead. Either way, BOL y'all and let's enjoy some Spanish Super Cup madness, the Espanyol match certainly did not disappoint and this one has all the signs of a classic ☘️🫡",

Struff wasn't able to get the break back in the first set from 15-40, and ended up losing the match in three sets. While that pick wasn't the best, I'm still happy with my overall form (17-3 L20), and am looking forward to today's play. \n\nRafa Jodar has seen an incredible rise over the past few years, to the point where he has now viewed as the top young prospect in a highly talented Spanish crop. He recently chose to forgo his remaining three years of college tennis eligibility, which wasn't a huge surprise after he earned a spot in Australian Open qualifying and defeated ATP #26 Learner Tien at the Next Gen Finals in Jeddah. This should allow him to focus his energy on breaking onto the main tour in 2026, and this isn't the first time a player has used the Canberra Challenger as a starting point. Last year, we saw Brazilian sensation Joao Fonseca capture the title; the year before, Jakub Mensik made a run to the final to start an excellent 2024 campaign. Jodar has already won two qualifying matches (including one on center court, where he'll be playing today), and one main draw match (defeated big server Nicolas Jarry 3 & 4). Last year, Jodar played primarily on hard courts, which allowed him to develop an aggressive game that perfectly suits the surface.\n\nThere's no doubt that Jaime Faria is a nice talent in his own right. Faria rose to prominence at last year's Australian Open, where he took a set off Djokovic, but injuries ended up significantly disrupting his 2025 campaign. He was able to defeat Elmer Moller easily in the first round, but Moller is pretty much a clay specialist right now, and Faria was only priced at even money. This should be a much bigger test of whether he's back to his old form, and I don't see him on the same level as Jodar regardless. Faria does have a big serve and forehand, but Jodar isn't a serve-dominant player, and I don't expect this to turn into a servebotting fest. These are some really nice odds for this play, but I would take this up to around -150.",

Anyway, the new manager bounce effect is real even with the current one just being an interim.\n\nThis could also not have been against a better suiting side since Burnley are currently on the worst run in the prem with an 11 game winless streak which they have drawn just 2 of. In my books United have improved A LOT and Amorim fixed a lot of things like the xG and discipline of the squad, they have been way more cohesive since his appointment. The interim manager who is the manager of United U18s have managed that youth team to a 2nd place this season, let’s see if he can carry his tactics to the men’s team.\n\nOn the H2H side United are 7-2-1 in their last 10 recent meetings with Burnley and when playing at Burnley they are an overall 6-2-1 against them where they are on a streak of 8 games unbeaten at Burnley. Of course lots of things have changed and this United squad is very different, but it is still worth mentioning.",

Villa are absolutely flying right now with 12 wins in their last 13 games. Confidence is sky high and they look comfortable controlling games regardless of venue.\n\nCrystal Palace are going the opposite direction. They’re on a seven-game winless streak and have lost four of their last five league matches. Performances look flat and momentum is clearly missing.\n\nThere’s also a lot of uncertainty around Palace at the moment. Their coach is being linked with the Manchester United job after Amorim was sacked this week, and situations like that rarely help a struggling squad. It’s a big contrast to this Villa side that looks settled, confident, and fully focused.\n\nAt +125, I’m happy to side with the team in form against one that’s struggling.\n\nAston Villa to win\n2.5 units\n\nLet’s keep it rolling.",

There have been some comments under my last pick that I didn't post Sakkari pick which I answered to, but can only be seen from my profile. Then I figured it's the same with Sakkari pick itself. I'll post couple of links (images) from my profile to prove I did send it. Think it's the issue with this profile being new. I checked this sub for a while, but decided to post from New Year and made a new profile for that. Hope this and all the following picks get published on time.*\n\n[*https://ibb.co/nsjfHf3T*](https://ibb.co/nsjfHf3T)\n\n[*https://ibb.co/TqLs3ymz*](https://ibb.co/TqLs3ymz)\n\n\n\n\n\nOdds opened at evens for Iatcenko and are going up. The reason I guess is her left quadriceps/thigh was heavily taped in yesterday match against Aiava. She asked for a MTO at 6-7 2-1 for leg problems, but it didn't seem to bother her too much later as she went on to turn the match around and win 6-7 6-3 6-3. It was her R1 match after two impressive wins in Q against Wei and Shibahara. She is a young Russian with a complete game who had a breakthrough 2025. and will try to establish herself on Tour in 2026. I really like her in a matchup against Garland who is one of my favorite fades in WTA. Classic brainless ballbasher who reaches highest highs and lowest lows in same match. Iatcenko has a pretty consistent gamestyle, placing heavy balls deep into court, moving opponents and will make Garland hit on the run. It's a gamble since Iatcenko condition is not fully known, but given I consider her a favorite here I just can't miss her at these odds. H2H is 1-0 for Garland, 6-2 6-1 in 2024., but a lot changed since.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Any donations would be greatly appreciated:*\n\n[https://buymeacoffee.com/kumpir](https://buymeacoffee.com/kumpir)",

      "text": "RECORD 4-5 STREAK: LOST 1\n\nLast P.O.T.D. - NBA: Orlando at Indiana - ANTHONY BLACK to score o19.5pts + o2.5 asts + o2.5rebs - LOSS\n\nRecap: Real quickly, after cashing out five times on this or a similar bet & twice in the past week, Black was finally ridden by me till he just died out. He netted 6 assists & 5 rebounds, however came up short inthe points dept finishing with only 15 due to what seems like a low number of overall taken shots and going 0 for 3 from three point land. I still back this bet as a good read & will likely return to playing it again later on down the road if the same situation arises where he is again seeing 31+ mins. of playing time in games. I move on...\n\nTODAY'S P.O.T.D: 12 NOON EST CFB PLAYOFF: (ORANGE BOWL): OREGON vs TEXAS TECH - TEXAS TECH o23.5 TEAM TOTAL POINTS -110\n\nRISK/WAGER AMOUNT: 4.4u to win 4u\n\nREASONING/PROJ. ANALYSIS: I'm just say this STRAIGHT UP.....from top to bottom this entire situation disgusts me, as I've  just spent the past two days rewatching the entire football season of both Oregon and Texas Tech, & I cannot believe that Oregon is favored, Texas Tech is or ever was the underdog &/or even more so that the public seems to think that assessment is correct because the line has since moved even further towards Oregon winning by the public. I won't mince words, to me, THIS IS THE MOST OBVIOUS BET OF THE YEAR &. I can only attribute what I'm seeing to just the inherent bias historically of Texas Tech having been a smaller school & less known for its football program especially compared to Oregon in recent years, but this is not recent years this is this year and no team has played better than Texas Tech from start to finish and I'm including Indiana in that who doesn't impress me either other than being maybe the second or third best team in the nation depending on Georgia. We saw the flop that is Ohio State get torched yesterday and it's going to happen again and again as I think the entire Big 10 is a boring bunch of losses waiting to happen. Oregon had a problem with Penn State who was utterly horrible this year, got the stuffing kicked out of them by Iowa at home until miraculous last quarter comeback & was smoked by a shitty Ohio State. Meanwhile, at the same time, Texas Tech pull up something this year that only two teams in all of college football history have done and those being legendary squads such as the Florida State Seminoles from 2013 and one of Alabama's best Nick Saban squads that won the title and that is that EVERY GAME THEY'VE won was by double digits & they have scored 40 points in nearly every contest with the only exception to both of those being the loss in which their starting quarterback did not play. Well, my friends, today he is playing and so is there a number one run defense which is going to shut down Oregon's run offense, as well as their top defense which is going to get an interception as they do almost every game if not more and recover a fumble and continue to lead the nation in scoring as a defense. On the other side, Conception and others are going to blow through that leaky Oregon defense for score after score after score and not only will Texas tech win this but it will not be close. I would put five units on this game if I had or was in the position to do so but I have unfortunately blowing a ton of money on Christmas gifts and have not recovered yet so this will be a one unit play although I'm thinking of dropping the rent on this bet because I like it that much and it seems to be that obvious to me that the wrong team is not only favored but how shafted Texas tech is getting by the public and the press and the linesman in Vegas. To add to the stats, let's also talk about the way I've set this bet up. I know we typically don't do boosts or parlays on this feed but this is my pick of the day and if you look at the three picks they are basically the almost the same thing but just linked as other than a 1 point discretion, nearly all three of those things would have to happen together. Last but not least, I'm going to say that I am a long time South Florida resident who operates cigar lounges and nightclubs and I happen to run into the Texas tech team today or at least the coaching staff in nearby to Miami city Deerfield Beach, which is about 25 minutes north and man do they all seem ready to play & confident in themselves but not cocky. So, with all this being said and for a team that scores on average over 40 points every game and wins every game by double digits so far this year generating over 24.5 points should be a no-brainer and I believe it will be. Finally, to note another most glaring & often unmentioned fact that figures into all of  this. Do you know who Texas Tech's alumni are? Those are names like Jerry Jones, Ross Perot, Jay Paul Getty & virtually every other major Texas oil Baron pretty much went to that school since it pretty much leads the nation in oil refinement and other gas and oil industry related fields,  which is another reason why that despite it being as small as it is, it also happens to be the college with one of the richest alumni out of all of them (minus Notre Dame) & their alumni aren't just rich but they love their football programs & they've been dying for a winning team & a Championship title for years & now that colleges & certain groups can essentially pay the players, the Texas Tech alumni & boosters have spent over 100 million to redo all of the facilities on campus that the football team uses you catch them up with the best programs in the nation if not even put them ahead and with some of the pro teams in the NFL. Additionally, they also spent a record $82 additional million to acquire the best players from the best teams through the transfer portal & work on recruiting the best skill players in the nation for next year & beyond (which is how they snagged the #2 rated high school QB recruit in the nation out of nowhere & away from schools like USC, Ohio State, FSU, etc.  Those are crazy achievements for a historically small division team who has only recently been mentioned as a player in the recent college football landscape. However like the Yankees or even the Florida Marlins for 2 years in '97 and 04, if you put the money out there and there's no luxury tax cap you can buy a team and they sure as hell have. There is no doubt or arguments about that and I'm telling you now you're going to see an up and up ass kicking because that team is loaded with so many ball Hawks and ball hogs and straight up studs that this bet is my favorite bet of the year so run, do 't walk & jump at the chance to get on the right side of this football game!!\n\nLet's go cash this SHYTE out!!!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9v2g4thcurag1.jpeg?width=1003&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0a30b2115342457386cb03201db18e9733eaaef9",

Carolinas defensive lapses and volume over efficiency shooting style.  Jakub Dobes can keep the puck out of the net.  If Montreal can get an early lead and slow down the pace of the game.

Been tailing others in here for a while, time to give back!  I have been hot right now on Anytime TD scorers in the CFB Playoffs so far so I thought I would share the love!\n\nDickey doesn’t need a perfect script to score. If Tech moves the ball at all today, he’s one of the most reliable options to punch it in.\n\nDickey checks all the boxes you want for an anytime scorer. He consistently gets the ball in the most important situations, especially in short-yardage and red-zone sets. Texas Tech trusts him to finish drives, and a large percentage of his touches come inside the 10, where his physical running style really shows.\n\n\nBest of Luck! Happy New Year to everyone!",

All my picks will likely be on tennis because that is where I have found the most success. Be warned I am not a professional better I have just used it to pay for my life as I get my university degree. I have made mistakes in terms of staking in the past and so I am reminding you all please do not ever go all in.\n\nAnyways, the model suggests Chang should be priced in at around 1.05 and Anastasia at around 1.22, with not too much tennis at the moment I thought I would combine the legs to get almost even money play.\n\nSince they are both women’s matches I would not recommend taking 2-0 as I have found they are often less consistent and so just simply combine the money lines.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions below, these are simply the best value plays of today.

I decided I might join the parade.  Playing it safe here with my first pick.  I believe Indiana covers at -7.5, they are the best team in the country, and they proved it at the Big 10 championship.  Cignetti has the boys playing inspired football; they had a week off to prepare for Bama.  Coaching is going to play a huge factor in this one.  Alabama has been in these moments before and knows what to do when the bright lights are on, but that's if Deboar doesn't get in their way, which I believe he will. Indiana will come out fast and want to prove they are the best team in the country; they will have their foot on their throats and won't let off the gas.  Alabama has no business being in the CFB and was lucky to scrape a win against Oklahoma, who had that game in the bag.\n\nWish me luck on my first pick.  Reddit Country let's ride.",

West Ham also had a penalty so it was just a crazy match to be honest but its like that sometimes. Onto the next. **FT: West Ham 2-2 Brighton**\n\n**Event:** EFL Championship (Soccer) - Watford vs Birmingham City (15:00 GMT) - sorry for the late post!\n\n**Today's Pick:** Watford to win @ 2.2 (1 unit)\n\n**Write Up:** Happy new year all I hope everybody had a good night and aren't feeling too rough today... Let's start 2026 with a win shall we?\n\nFor today's pick we are in the Championship at Vicarage Road as **6th place Watford** face **15th place Birmingham City**. Watford are currently the **most in form team in the league** having **won 4 and drawn 2** of their last 6 games as they continue their quest towards the championship playoffs this season. The Hornets have **won 3 straight league games** for the first time since August of 2024 and have **lost just once in their last 12 games**. Importantly for today's game Watford are great at home sitting pretty as the **3rd best Home team** in the league. They've **won 7 of their 12** games at home this season **losing only 1** to **19th place Blackburn** **rovers** back in September. Away from home they've struggled much more picking up only 3 wins on their travels but they are leaning on their Vicarage Road success to carry them into the playoffs this season. At home Watford are scoring **1.67 goals per game** compared to their 1.17 whilst on their travels. They have conceded a nice **1 goal per game** at home with this rising to 1.42 away to showcase the difference in their home and away form once again. A long term positive trend is also on Watford's side today as they have **won each of their last six home games against today's opponents** with an **aggregate score of 12-0** (but personally the past is the past so take it with a pinch of salt). As far as team news goes Watford are doing fine without Doumbia who is away at AFCON and continue to play without forwards Vata and Baah.\n\nAs for Birmingham City they are the **2nd worst in form team** in the league at the moment picking up just **3 points from their last 6** games with **3 of those games ending in defeat** for the Blues. They recently beat Watford 2-1 on December 1st and since then have picked up **3 points from an available 18** as they deal with bad injury and suspension problems. Birmingham's problems this season have been exclusively on the road as they are the **3rd worst Away team** in the league whilst being the **5th best home team**. On their travels the Blues have **won just the 2 games out of 12**, **losing 8**. In these games they have **scored a low** **8 goals** and **conceded a worrying 20**. This translates to **0.67 scored per game and 1.67 conceded**. When you compare this to their home form you see how much of a difference there is. Birmingham score 2 goals per game at home this season and only concede 0.92 which has led to them losing just the one game at home all season. The fact they are away today puts the game massively in Watford's favour. As mentioned before **the Blues are without some key players today** with both Tommy Doyle and Christoph Klarer being unavailable today through suspension. The pair have each featured in nearly all of Birmingham City's game this season. Furthermore, star left winger Demarai Gray is likely to be out today with a calf injury which is once again damaging to the away team as the forward has **9 goal contributions** this season for them.\n\nThis new years day clash is definitely leaning in Watford's favour when you combine their impressive home form and even recent form overall with Birmingham City's woeful away record and recent struggles. Whilst it won't be complete domination from Watford I expect them to start 2026 off strong with a comfortable 1 or 2-0 victory today over their bad travelling visitors.\n\nPlease leave thoughts and suggestions in the comments and let me know if you're tailing! BOL for everybody's New Years bets!\n\n***Edit: Great 3-0 win for Watford and first pick of the year cashes sweat free! 👊💰***",

However, Charlton are in the middle of a deeper crisis. They’ve only won one out of their last nine matches, and also just suffered a heartbreaking 97th minute loss to Portsmouth, which leaves a team mentally drained.\n\nHence, in my humble opinion, Coventry to win at 1.86u odds is a good value play",

They only have one foreign player (Gorjok Gak), who joined on December 27th. This forces younger players to play. Coach Han Shuo says they've only trained with the new foreign center \"once\" and are planning to bring in another younger player. They are currently the worst-performing team in the league, with a 0-8 record and a -214 average.\n\nFujian's defense is based on steals and pressure. They like to force their opponents into errors and score easy points in open court. When turnovers become chronic for Sichuan, the game quickly becomes unpredictable. Fujian's approach of relying on pressure and steals to score runs is easily converted into direct points. Looking at Sichuan's recent losses, double-digit margins have become standard (e.g., 51 points against Beijing, 36 points against Shanghai, 33 points against Ningbo). A -13.5 margin is even below Sichuan's average loss margin this season; meaning that even if Sichuan plays its \"standard poor game,\" this handicap can be easily overcome. Fujian has an elite guard at the helm in Travis Trice, who is both a scoring and assist threat and can organize the team. Sichuan, on the other hand, is forced to rely on its domestic rotation and inconsistent young players. It will be an easy game for Fujian.",

      "text": "Record : 24-19-2\n\nNet units:(+0.68 units)\n\nLast pick: Karl Anthony town under 12.5 rebounds (-120)HR✅\n\nPick of the day : Kevin Durant Over 4.5 Assists (-145)HR\n\nReason • :\nI was overthinking on this game for a under since both team have been defensive lately \nOver and under in team total point seems Like a toss up for me because i can only imagine these playing out \n1. “The  Shootout over game “ Nets fail to stop KD (30+ points again). Shit goes OVER ,Brooklyn plays with high intensity too . Game stays within 4-6 points; late fouling pushes the score over the 225.5 total.  \n\nNumber 2. The \"No-Big\" Scramble  aka Sengun & Adams stay out.  Houston loses its defensive anchor. Nic Claxton dominates the paint for Brooklyn, and Houston relies solely on KD and Reed Sheppard's shooting & playmaking and making amen to shoot the ball. 3.The Defensive Grind | Nets' #1 December defense holds firm. UNDER ( low scoring game ) Brooklyn successfully slows the pace to the bottom 5 in the league. Houston struggles to find rhythm without Sengun's post-playmaking. 4. The \"Blowout\" Cool-down ,Rockets lead by 20 in the 3rd. (UNDER because nets can’t keep up ) KD and the starters sit the 4th quarter. \"Garbage time\" with bench players usually results in poor shooting and a clock-drain, keeping it under the total. And i was doing my research ,expert bettors feels like Brooklyn nets may cover the spread since Nets in 7 of their last 10 game and 13 of their last 20 games.  \n\nI have to go with Kevin Durant for assists because from a defensive perspective you don’t want Kevin Durant shooting the rock \nSo the “Double-Team mindset” will come into play in the nets head cause that’s Kevin Durant \n“Y’all know who he is”. anyway the Nets have been the #1 defense in December. \nTheir primary strategy against elite scorers like KD is to force the ball out of their hands. KD is currently being doubled on 27% of his possessions. Being 6'11\", he easily passes over the trap to open teammates like Reed Sheppard or Alperen Sengun (if active). While everyone expects him to hunt for points (which he will), his veteran experience tells him to play the \"right way\" when the defense collapses. In his last 5 games, he has cleared this 4.5 line in 4 out of 5 instances, averaging 5.2 assists. \nAlperen Sengun is limited or out, the Rockets will use KD even more as a point-forward to facilitate the offense, rather than just a pure finisher. Houston goes Over 66% of the time on the road, and a close game (which the Nets usually provide lately) leads to late-game scoring bursts.  \nScenario solution 1. Brooklyn blitzes him to get the ball out of his hands, KD doesn't force shots ,he passes. With the floor spacers Houston has (Sheppard, Smith Jr.), those passes turn into easy assists. The \"Trap\" actually helps us here. \n\nScenario solution 2. If they don't double him, KD will score at will. However, that gravity still pulls defenders in. KD is a high-IQ player; even in single coverage, he averages about 4-5 assists just by playing within the flow of the offense.\n\nRisk factor If the Rockets are up by 25 in the 3rd quarter, KD might sit the entire 4th. He could get stuck at 3 or 4 assists simply because he didn't play enough minutes. However, even in a blowout, KD usually gets his numbers early.\n\nHAPPY NEW YEARS 🎉🎉 EVERYONE",

A win will place them right in the fight for a top spot.\n\nTheir opponents, Sheffield Wednesday (SW), well, not sure where to start other than to say they are in last place in the league with -7 points (yes, less than 0) which is 28 points below the next team. SW are facing a major financial and ownership crisis that has thrown one of England’s oldest clubs into jeopardy. Let me enumerate the ways in bulletpoint fashion:\n\n* **Financial Mismanagement** \\-The club has struggled to pay players and staff multiple times throughout 2025 due to cash-flow problems. They missed salary deadlines 5 times which is a breach of English Football League regulations.\n* **Sanctions & Points Deductions** \\-Because of financial breaches, SW were placed into administration (a formal insolvency process), which resulted in an automatic 12-point deduction. They were also hit with a further 6-point deduction for ongoing breaches.\n* **Stadium Issues** \\-The North Stand at Hillsborough Stadium was closed after urgent safety work was not carried out, costing the club significant match-day revenue and inconvenience for fans.\n* **Transfer & Registration Embargoes** \\-Due to unpaid wages and tax debts, the club has been placed under transfer embargoes and registration restrictions, meaning they cannot sign new players freely.\n* **Ownership Controversy** \\-Thai owner Dejphon Chansiri’s decade in charge saw heavy criticism for overspending early on, then failing to fund the club properly in recent years. He was eventually banned from being involved with any EFL club for three years, and the club is now run by administrators who are trying to sell it.\n* **Fan Protests and Morale** \\-Fans have been protesting and even boycotting games in frustration over the mismanagement and financial instability under Chansiri’s rule.\n\nNeedless to say that PNE should win this match for so many reasons and SW should lose this match for many more reasons. If PNE wins by just one goal we get a refund.",

These two teams are both in the top 10 for scoring defense. For Oregon, that's not too surprising, as the B10 isn't a high powered offense type league. But for TTU in the B12, that's pretty impressive where everyone scores a lot. I'm liking the under here because both these teams have solid defense. Neither is particularly elite in the red zone on offense either, so I'm expecting some of the long drives to end in field goals. \n\nFull disclosure, both these teams are both also in the top 10 in offense, so this isn't a slam dunk pick. TTU can easily score at will in the no defense league of the B12, so I don't think they'll find scoring as easy against good defenses like Oregon. Oregon has benefited from a somewhat easy schedule, and the few good defensive teams they've played, their offense wasn't as powerful. I think both these offenses will be facing the best defenses (or close to it) either have seen all year, and more than 50 points just seems unlikely to me. \n\nBOL to anyone who tails.

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 6-19-3 *Happy New Year to those who celebrate today!! Turns out I couldn't catch a break even on the final day of 2025, footballing gods just had one more sucker punch in store. The Mariners had a positive result in the bag but once again, I guess I'm just not allowed to win POTDs as they ended up falling short to a last minute goal. No clue how this keeps happening, but if there's anything I'm sure of, is that I'm leaving this horrid trend behind. 2026 is the year of wins, starting today*\n\n**Last Five:** ❌❌❌❌❌\n\n**Event:** EFL Championship, Bristol City v Portsmouth, 10:00 am EST\n\n**POTD:** Portsmouth Win or Draw +110, 4 units\n\n**Write Up:** Bristol City are currently eighth in the Championship with 10 wins, six draws and eight defeats in the opening 24 matches. They enjoyed a strong festive period, claiming a 2-0 home victory over Middlesbrough before following it up with a 2-1 away win at WBA on Boxing Day. However, they were unable to extend that run in their final game of 2025, suffering a 2-1 defeat to Millwall. Langstaff’s late strike condemned them to a fourth loss in their last seven away matches, showing **they're prone to collapsing late** when under pressure. They now return to Ashton Gate, where they have *lost just once in their previous four home games (W2, D1).* Fear not, though. Portsmouth have gained serious **momentum in their survival push** by taking **eight points from their last four matches.** After beating Blackburn Rovers, they drew with Derby County and QPR before **edging Charlton Athletic in dramatic fashion, with Min-hyeok scoring a 97th-minute winner** (the opposite of what Bristol City tend to do). Despite that positivity, *Pompey remain without an away victory in nine attempts and share the league’s worst away record, scoring just seven goals on the road* and **this is why the line is so inflated,** but all that is needlessly reactionary imho.\n\nDespite Bristol City’s strong league position and home advantage, I still think backing **Portsmouth to win or draw** is the only right thing to do. While City sit inside the top half, their recent performances suggest vulnerability rather than dominance. They failed to build momentum after the festive wins and even at home, they've not been ruthless, **winning two and drawing one of their last four at Ashton Gate, but rarely putting opponents away early.**\n\nNow, let's take a look at the teams' profiles. Crucially, **Portsmouth’s defensive organisation and counter-attacking approach match up well against a Bristol City side** that prefers control and patience in possession. With **Bristol City missing several key options through injuries** (Mayulu, Vitek, McNally, Bird, Sykes and Williams), their ability to break down compact opponents may be limited. That opens the door for Portsmouth to frustrate, slow the tempo, and **exploit transitions or set pieces** (areas where they have been increasingly effective).\n\nTaking into account Portsmouth’s improving form, fighting mentality, and Bristol City’s inconsistency against disciplined sides, this one feels far closer than the odds suggest. A gritty away performance could easily yield a point, and if the game opens up late, Portsmouth are capable of seizing it. For that reason, I'm going with a cheeky **Portsmouth win or draw**. Feeling a disruptive type of game, not too high scoring, but not super low either, so sprinkling an Under 3.5 match goals sounds good to me, as does a BTTS Yes, but let's not make this any more complicated than it needs to be. I went in big on the final day of 2025 so it's only appropriate to start the year off with a bang too - dropping 4 units on this banger. BOL and let's watch some hungover Englishmen stumble across the field ☘️",

Liverpool are on a nice run at the moment, they are building momentum and have the talent and firepower to win this game 2-0 or greater and that's what we are betting on.

When Fullerton can’t speed teams up, their offense stalls which leads to long empty possessions and poor late-clock shots.\n\nThis projects as a controlled game where UCSB dictates tempo and consistently wins possessions.

After a day off, we're back with EPL action as 9th place Brentford host 13th place Tottenham. All signs point towards this being a high scoring match, and we're here for it. \n\nRicharlison has come into great form over the last few weeks. With 2 goals and 2 assist in his last 4 games. He also had two goals disallowed over the weekend due to offsides, so he has definitely been finding the back of the net. One of these matches was against Brentford a few weeks ago in the reverse fixture that ended 2-0 Tottenham. Richarlison has Tottenhams most goals on the year with 7, their 2nd place Goalscorer is their center back Van de Ven. Goals for Tottenham almost exclusively go through Richarlison. He has looked sharp and the stat sheet has been showing it. Much like our Calvert-Lewin play, this is a play to back an in form striker with great odds. \n\nBrentford have conceded the 9th most goals this season in the EPL with 24. They've only kept three clean sheets this season, and those were against Wolves, West Ham, and a very early match vs Bournemouth. Put in other words, they've kept one clean sheet in their last 11 matches, and that was against Wolves the worst team in the EPL. I do not expect Brentford to keep Tottenham out, and considering Richarlison's form and the fact that he is the team's leading scorer, I'm backing him to find the back of the net in this one.\n\nAs always, BOL and have a great first day of the year!",

In **9 matches so far**, they have scored in **all but one game**, totaling **16 goals** (an average of **1.78 goals per match**). Their most recent home games include:\n\n* **3-0 win vs West Ham** – 10 shots, 5 on target, 36.8% possession\n* **2-1 win vs Brentford** – 12 shots, 3 on target, 54.4% possession\n* **3-2 win vs Bournemouth** – 12 shots, 6 on target, 42.8% possession\n\nEven in draws (Aston Villa 1-1, Everton 1-1, Arsenal 2-2, Leeds 1-1), Sunderland consistently found the net, showing strong offensive consistency despite conceding goals in 4 out of 9 matches.\n\n**Manchester City's** away stats also support BTTS. They have scored in **8 of their last 9 away matches**, netting **18 goals** (average **2 goals per match**) and maintaining an attacking presence:\n\n* **5-4 win vs Fulham** – 11 shots, 4 on target, 43% possession\n* **3-0 win vs Crystal Palace** – 7 shots, 6 on target, 61.8% possession\n* **2-1 win vs Nottingham Forest** – 16 shots, 5 on target, 65.9% possession\n\nCity has conceded in **5 of their 9 away matches**, showing vulnerability in defense, especially against high-pressing or counter-attacking teams.

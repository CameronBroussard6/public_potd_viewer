      "text": "**POTD Record:** 5-10-3 *People will see a 2-0 Barça win, but they won’t see the two clear cut chances for Villarreal at the start of the game. They won’t see that the teams had almost the same amount of shots despite the fact Villarreal were a man down for the majority of it. Villarreal beat themselves by squandering numerous chances at 0-0, giving away a penalty, and getting a red card, and in the process, they beat me. Just my luck, though I still maintain that my read was valid. Anyway, the new week is a fresh chance to bounce back, and oh boy are we doing just that with today’s full confidence POTD*\n\n**Last Five:** 🅿️❌❌🅿️❌\n  \n**Event:** Football, Panserraikos v Levadiakos; SSC Napoli v Bologna, the first match starts in about 3 hours\n\n**POTD:** Levadiakos ML + Bologna Win or Draw +165, 5 units\n\n**Write Up:** Levadiakos are this season’s Greek league surprise package and they’re coming up against by far **the worst team in the division in Panserraikos that’s currently on an 8 game losing streak,** and they’ve only **not lost in 3 out of the 14 games** in the Greek Super League. **Levadiakos have also won the last 4/5 in their H2H.** Levadiakos boast a **genuinely quality fast-paced, possession based playing style,** which is going to be a nightmare for the leaky Panserriakos to deal with. Everything points towards a comfortable win for the guests and the odds of -185 are a gift. But we’re not done here as we’re also sprinkling a piece of Bologna on this double. **Bologna knocked out Inter** in the previous round and I back them to get it done against this dodgy Napoli side. The underlying data supports this. I’m sending it with 5 whole units. BOL and remember to conserve your bankroll on these less eventful football days ☘️",

Both teams’ defences are very solid, and while Napoli may have some injury concerns, their defence is almost at full strength apart from their goalkeeper. However, Milinković-Savić is a reliable number two. Their last encounter finished 2–0 in favour of Bologna, but Napoli were struggling with injuries at the time. I expect this match to be far more even, and if one side wins in regular time, it will likely be by a single goal.\nSouth Africa vs Angola:\nThis is a system play for the early AFCON games.",

Dont understand why Rivers lines are so low. Sure he had a lower pass completion and 120 yards but the Seahawks defense is legit and it was his first game in 5 years. There might be something to be said about his second game back but we're doubting the haters. If the odds weren't +248 I'd take the 2+ passing tds from Rivers but here we are. Rivers is still a veteran qb and im sure this second game will reflect that.\n\n9ers D-line hasn't been the best, losing Bosa and Fred Warner hit hard and their pressure and sack rates aren't the best. Many people take this as a bad rush defense which is certainly true, but overlook the fact that giving a veteran qb ample time is deadly. Especially in a game script that will likely be having the Colts pass often. Not to mentioned the 9ers defense is ranked 22nd for pass defense, albeit looking better in the last few weeks. 9ers are also out cb Renardo Green who's been putting upndecent stats, another factor to give Colts a passing advantage.\n\n  \nHistorically Rivers has been amazing against the niners boasting a 4-0 record averaging over 300 yards against them. Rivers should be able to easily clear this number assuming that the good Colts O-line can keep pressure rates down from the already bad 9ers D-line, and that Rivers will get a similar pass attempt amount as last game (27), which should happen as they can't rely on JT forever. \n\nBOL everyone tailing",

Then do yourself a favor and never watch these two teams play each other. They combined for over 300 points 😂 But that aside, Bulls do their job and not only cover the spread but win the game outright. Fading the Hawks at home ATS continues to pay off.\n\n[](https://external-preview.redd.it/1NSff0hJtBzZbL0LaLdzs6Se3eHAEH1F4gqidT88-No.gif?auto=webp&s=fdfe60dc33630a9010c7ac3e16d0c21ed9288db8)\n\n**Today's Event:** NBA 🏀 Dallas Mavericks @ New Orleans Pelicans (5:00pm PST)\n\n**Today's Pick:** Anthony Davis o 14.5 Ast + Reb (-136 on DK); 2 units\n\nToday we return to a player prop in AD's combined rebounds and assists.\n\nAD isn't known as a playmaking center per se, but is a good passer out of double-teams or after grabbing an offensive rebound, averaging exactly 3.0 assists on the season. And he remains a strong rebounder, averaging the 5th highest rpg in the league at 11.2 (for a combined 14.2 Ast + Reb). \n\nThe line is ever so slightly above his average, but I think the over is solid given the odds, the matchup, and how he's been playing recently.\n\nAD has gone over this line in 5 of L7. The two misses were against Houston and OKC, elite teams that minimize assists and rebounds to opponents (and he still put up 14 against OKC). Against mid-to-weak opponents, he covered comfortably with 17, 17, 17, 21, and 17 in the 5 hits. \n\nNOP is, by any measure, a mid-to-weak opponent. Relevant to us, they give up the most assists to opposing centers out of any team in the league, and give up 7th most rebounds to opposing centers. \n\nI also see this as a spot for AD to show up against the team that drafted him, in a battle against a rookie center who is not an especially strong rebounder for his size. Queen will also struggle to defend AD in the post by himself, forcing double-teams and leading AD to pass to open shooters for assist chances. \n\nThe point spread being 1.5 also suggests a close game, so he should get full minutes.",

Warren has been quiet the past few weeks but still led the team in targets in Rivers’ first game. Expect a slow, run heavy 1st half with colts looking to get Warren involved over the middle and on some quick reads as the game progresses.

      "text": "**Record**: 7-7 (+0.78u)\n\n**Last Pick**: (NFL) Chargers ML vs. Cowboys (W)\n\n**Event**: (NBA) Utah Jazz vs. Denver Nuggets 9:10pm ET\n\n**Pick**: ***Nikola Jokic OVER 22.5 Rebounds + Assists*** | 2.75u to win 2.5u | -110 on FanDuel\n\n**Reason**: Utah heads to Denver, and these Jazz players have to be exhausted. Their past 3 games have been high scoring games and a lot of running up and down the court. 2 of the last 3 went to overtime which were both deflating losses given they kept up with each team (Orlando and Dallas). Jokic is coming off a slow game against Houston where they lost by 14, but Jokic only played 29 minutes (averaging 34 a game). Denver seems to manage his minutes in certain games, especially if the Nuggets have been playing from behind the whole game like on Saturday.\n\n**Utah currently allows 54.2 rebounds per game**, but over the last 3 they have allowed 60.7 per game (again, two of those went to OT). **Against the center position, Utah ranks in the bottom tier for defensive efficiency. They allow 13.6 rebounds per game to opposing centers (Jokic averages just above 12).** Utah's season averages understate how bad they have been playing. Before Walker Kessler went out for the season, he was a very effective rebounder which has allowed the teams rebounding numbers to surf along the middle of the league averages. Nurkic and Filipowski haven't been playing been playing terrible, but Jokic has been unstoppable against the entire league. Filipowski has also looked slow on rotations on defense which have left the weak side open which will give Jokic more opportunities to clean up missed shots.\n\n**Utah ranks 22nd in FG% averaging 45.8% per game. Even when Jokic doesn't have too many rebounding opportunities compared to other games, he still takes advantage.** Utah also ranks 29th in defensive efficiency, so I would expect around 3-5 offensive rebounds for Jokic who currently averages 2.9 per game. **Utah ranks dead last in the league in opponent assists per game allowing a whopping 29.6 per game. Jokic likes to look for teammates cutting to the rim, and with Utah's weak rim protection and interior defense, he should see more opportunities to thread the needle through a slow defense.**\n\nFinally, Utah struggles in transition defense, ranking bottom 5 in points allowed off turnovers. Jokic is always looking for the outlet or touchdown pass down the court. Though Denver ranks 29th in the NBA in forcing turnovers (12.5 per game), Jokic has had multiple darts down the court right off a rebound or quick transition dimes when he takes the ball up the court. Even against weak interior defenses where Jokic puts up 30 points, he still ends up around the 8 to 12 assist mark.\n\nBOL.",

This pick mainly comes down to the consistency Levadiakos has been showing in league matches. Panserraikos has also ben consistent, but consistently showing bad form. Both teams don't play for another 2 weeks after this which means each squad should be full strength. Levadiakos should dominate, the goal count is the only real question. I line this around -1.5, so when I saw the -1 spread, I had to make the play. \n\nOverall: I am extremely sharp in UFC, and recently over the past few months have been studying soccer, which has ben proving profitable so I figured I would start this up. If you have any questions, feel free to dm me or reply to this and I will be more than willing to chat. \n\nAll plays will be to win a unit, so whatever the unit amount I risk, it will almost always be to win 1u. For people tracking picks, when you consistently bet 5u on a play, you should probably just increase your unit size. Ex: If my units are $1,000 but I am consistently betting 5u ($5,000), you should just increase a unit to $5,000. My unit size may increase, but I will almost always only be tipping a play to win 1u. \n\nBet responsibly.",

      "text": "💎POTD: ⚽️ Napoli ML\nOdds: +105 on FanDuel\nWager: 1.5 Units\n\nRecord: 6-9\nNet Units: -7 Units\n\nExplanation: Napoli can beat Bologna on Monday in the Supercoppa final because over the league season and in this tournament’s semifinal, they’ve shown the more repeatable winning traits: chance control, defensive solidity, and higher-end match winners. \n\nIn Serie A this season, Napoli has been operating at a top-of-the-table level (2nd on 31 points through 14 matches at 10-1-3), while Bologna have been very good but a tier lower overall (6th on 25 points at 7-4-4).   That gap matters in a one-off final because it reflects how often Napoli can impose a typical game script: steady territory, fewer mistakes, and fewer big chances conceded, and then let their attackers decide it, and we just saw that exact pattern in their 2–0 win over AC Milan, where Napoli struck through a high quality transition and a composed finish, then managed the match for the win.",

But I’m riding the trends I’m seeing. Fulham are at home and have been scoring plenty this year. They’ve got a goal in their last 7/8, and have conceded in their last 6/8. BTTS & O2.5 has hit 5 in a row. Nottingham Forest have had quite a season, but they’ve had some impressive performances since Dyche has taken over, including a 3-0 win away at Liverpool. Forrest is a bit more of a wildcard in this bet though. They’ve seen O2.5 in their last 6/8, but BTTS has only happened in 2/8. Head-to-head, Forrest has allowed a goal in the last 7 meetings between the clubs. O2.5 has hit in 4/5. I think Forrest are finding their footing now with their newer manager, coming off a week’s rest after a 3-0 win against Spurs. I don’t think they go all game without a score. \n\nBOL!",

On average in the Prem this season Fulham score 1.44 goals per match and allow 1.62 goals per match. I have no doubt Fulham can score at home as they've done so in 9/10 home matches across all competitions this season, and with the absence of Bassey and Iwobi I can see their backline not looking great. Fulham have allowed the opposition to score in 5/10 games at home WITH these key players. In the 5 games the opposition did not score at Fulham, they played against Bristol City in the EFL cup, Leeds before they found form this season, Cambridge in the EFL cup, Wolves (worst team in every top division in Europe), and Sunderland (a team not known for scoring many goals). Basically meaning the 5 home games this season they kept clean sheets were all against poor teams, excluding Sunderland.\n\nForrest on the other hand are very 50/50 in their matches with BTTS only hitting in 1/5 of their last games across all competitions. With that being said, Forest score on average 1.06 goals per game in the Prem and allow 1.56, so against a weakened Fulham I believe they can nab a goal at some point: especially given they just bagged 3 against Spurs. Forest are a team that really hates to find any kind of form: they lost 0-2 to Brighton, beat Wolves away 0-1, lost to Everton away 3-0, beat Utrecht 1-2 in the Europa League, and beat Spurs 3-0. Although most of their scorelines this season are 2-0/3-0 for them or their opposition, I truly do believe Fulhams absence of players can give Forest some opening at some point.\n\nI'll be completely honest and upfront, this pick comes much more from gut feeling than anything else. The stats don't *really* show that BTTS will hit but given Fulhams superb ability to score at home along with their weakened backline against a Forest team who just bagged 3 against Spurs I can certainly see it happening. While I don't consider previous matches as I am a firm believer that they do not reflect current games, BTTS has hit in 3/5 of these teams last matches against each other. I don't really like most of the games for Monday and can't seem to find superb value anywhere, that is reflected in the 1u bet. If you are a consistent tailer of my picks be warned to only bet the 1u unless you have another reason to believe this is a solid pick.\n\n**BOL!**",

Bet 3.25u\n\nWriteup: For Monday Night Football, we have the Indianapolis Colts hosting the San Francisco 49ers. We’ll be focusing on the tight end for the Niners, who’s been an incredibly consistent focal point for this offense.\n\nKittle has shown remarkable consistency this season, having surpassed the 66.5 receiving yards mark in 5 straight games along with others. As the primary target in the San Francisco offense, he benefits from being utilized in various ways, including short routes, deep passes, and red-zone targets. He’s had a 25% target share in 4 straight games, and I expect a similar number against a Colts defense who’s poor against tight ends. Notably, they have allowed a lot of yards in the middle of the field where Kittle typically operates. With both teams eyeing crucial playoff positioning, the game is expected to be competitive, meaning Kittle may see increased targets as the 49ers seek to establish their offensive rhythm. Kittle has been getting around 75 receiving yards in each game that Purdy has started this season, and I expect a similar number in this one.\n\nWith the stakes high in Week 16, both teams will likely stick to simply exploiting weaknesses of the other team. Kittle’s ability to find soft spots in the Colts’ coverage can lead to big plays, especially if the 49ers utilize play-action effectively. Additionally, injuries in the receiving core could lead to an increase in Kittle's target share, further boosting his yardage potential.\n\nRemember to only bet what you can afford to lose, and BOL!",

Was a bit sweaty as both teams missed chances and gave up possession cheaply, but Villa come through for us either way. \n\nToday we head to London for a bottom table battle as 15th place Fulham host 17th place Nottingham Forest. I actually really like props for both of these teams, despite their underperforming this season as a whole. They both concede a lot of corners and allow a lot of shots. Both of these teams have won 3 and lost 2 of their last 5 and are pretty evenly matched, I could see this match going either way. That said, I'm leaning a bit more on Forest due to recent form.\n\nMilenkovic, aka the Serbinator, is one of Forest's two big center backs. I'd argue their the best duo in the league. The 6'5\" tall Serb will be the tallest (non keeper) on the pitch today. He is Forest's main target for all things set piece and corner kicks, and this seems like a match where Forest will prioritize set pieces if they want to take anything from this tough away match. Keep in mind, **this is one SHOT, not shot on target**. While I like that too, the odds are way higher. All we need for this to cash is for the Serbinator to get his head on one ball aimed in the general direction of goal. \n\nThese plays require patience, as we will only get a handful of chances for our guy to come forward, being a central defender and all. But I love the odds for this, as he has taken 4 shots in his last 4 games and will continue to be the main set piece target with Wood out. BOL and have a great Monday!",

They are the better team here and they should get it done.\n\nIn the 49ers 10 wins this season, 8 of them have a McCaffrey TD in it.

Valverde’s side come into this match highly motivated, knowing a home win keeps them close to the European places before a difficult run of away fixtures, something the coach has stressed in recent press conferences as a “key moment” of the season. With a patched-up defense due to multiple injuries and suspensions (Laporte, Vivian, Berchiche, Prados), Athletic are expected to compensate by pushing higher and controlling territory rather than sitting deep. Their attacking structure naturally generates corners: heavy wing play through Nico and Iñaki Williams, Berenguer, and overlapping full-backs, plus frequent switches of play against compact defenses. Espanyol, despite good form, are pragmatic away and happy to defend low with narrow lines, inviting pressure and crosses. This combination — Bilbao’s urgency, wing-oriented attack, and Espanyol’s low-block approach — strongly points toward sustained home pressure and a steady accumulation of Athletic corners, making over 5.5 a convincing angle.",

Morgan Rogers might just be the sexiest man on the planet, and the ML would have hit too. Great game and some bangers. \n\nPOTD: Mo Salah to have 1.5 SOT v Zimbabwe\n\nOdds: 1.83x (Bet365)\nUnits: 2 units (Remember always follow our units) \n\nWell, we’ve got to a point where we betting on AFCON and I don’t mind it at all. We was originally going to wait to see trends etc on goals. But this is too good to say no to. \n\nI’ll start this by saying I’m a massive Liverpool fan and have watched Mo Salah week in week out for the last 7 years and there is nothing this man loves more than a stat pad against a shit team and he needs it now more than ever, with all the talk going on his motivation will be through the roof. If there’s one thing I will say about Mo it’s that he is one of the finest competitors on the planet, he hates losing and he hates not playing even more, I think he’s going to be going into this Afcon with fire in his belly looking to bring Egypt the Afcon, all that said let’s look at some facts.\n\nMo salah averaged 1.77 SOT in the qualifying for Egypt and he didn’t even play 90 minutes in some of these games. He should definitely play 90 now, after being benched for Liverpool, in his first and only game back against Brighton he came on played 64 minutes and had 3 shots including a SOT. He’s hungry now, and what is better than playing against a RB who plays in the south african league and is definitely going to be on ice skates all game. A literal bum who is equalivant of 3rd division in england. \n\nThis is the juicy part, Mo Salah is going to take every single free kick and penalty’s as usual. He has averaged 0.84 SOT on target in the prem while being shit too, and 1.43 in the champions league. Surely he is going to do this against a team who are ranked 129th in the world.\n \nWe really like this because of the revenge he wants, he’s got a couple of weeks now to be in AFCON and I could see him ball out in this whole tournament. There is a reason his odds are 1.44 for a goal or assist, and it’s because it is Mo Salah. Only negative, there isn’t a lot of stats to back this up from AFCON just because it is out of budget lmao. But Mo salah against a fella called Divine Lunga? If you’ve heard of him, I’ll personally take this reddit post down. (not actually cus we prefer to win money here)  \n1.83x for Salah to have 2 shots on target is mental, and I see this done in 60 or less. Egypt will dominate and most of their play should work through Salah as Egypt don’t have many big players and they usually play around Mo, who thrives when he is the teams star (just look at Liverpool last season). We have only put two units on this based on there is no stats backing this up as of now, but it is a prediction and the odds are high because it is the first game. See this be the same odds next game for Egypt for 3+ SOT. \n\nSalah is well rested and well motivated and should be coming into this tournament with a revenge mindset, as mentioned there’s not many stats surrounding African football so tail with caution but we’re pretty confident this should come flying in. As always BOL!",

When combined with the draw, the double-chance market offers strong protection and positive expected value.\n\nIn terms of goals, both teams average 1.4 total goals per game combined, with neither side showing a tendency for high-scoring matches. Athletic’s low scoring rate and Espanyol’s compact defence significantly reduce the risk of a goal explosion, making under 4.5 goals a very safe ceiling in this matchup.\n\nJust to confirm, this will be Espanyol or draw and under 4.5 total goals in the match.",

The 49ers are coming in hot, having won 4 straight games all by double digits. They stand at 3rd in the NFC West, 1.5 games behind Seattle for the top spot. They currently own the 6th seed in the NFC playoff picture. Despite dealing with an endless amount of injuries, San Fran has a 98% chance to make the playoffs with a clear path to a 1st round bye. After Seattle beat the Rams on Thursday night, the 49ers can take the NFC's #1 seed by winning their last 3 games. The Colts have also dealt with their fair share of injuries, but theirs have been a tad more detrimental. Colts QB Daniel Jones tore his ACL in Week 14 & is out for the season. They were forced to turn to 44 year old Phillip Rivers who came out of retirement last week after coaching high school football & made his first start since 2020. They somehow managed to only lose to the 12-3 Seahawks by 2 points. The Colts have now lost 4 games in a row since their Week 11 bye, going from AFC South front-runners to a team on the playoff bubble. They likely will need to win out just for a shot at the playoffs. That all falls on the shoulders of one of the best runnings backs in the league, Colts RB Jonathan Taylor.\n\nJonathon Taylor is the league leader in rushing yards & TD’s this season, averaging 103 yards per game with 16 TD’s. He’s averaging 5.3 yards per carry, while also leading the NFL in Yards After Contact (1,060). He leads the league in EPA (21.48), resulting in the Colts ranking 1st in EPA as a rushing offense (19.5). JT has faced the toughest Strength of Schedule among RB’s in the past month. __In their last 3 games JT & the Colts have faced 4 of the top 4 NFL run defenses in rushing yards allowed (starting with most recent): Seattle #4 (93.7 ypg), Jacksonville #1 (86.3), & Houston #3 (92.7). Despite the brutal schedule JT averaged 23.6 carries for 82 yards. Only 3 opponents in the bottom 10 of run efficiency (Chargers 23rd, ATL 24th, Cardinals 25th). He averaged 153 rushing yards against those 3 teams. The 49ers rank 26th.__ Last week with 44 year old Rivers in his first start at QB, the Colts game plan was simple, feed Taylor the rock. JT had his second most carries all season with 25, going for 87 yards. He finally gets a breather this week vs a 49ers run defense that hasn’t been able to stop the run lately. San Francisco has suffered some brutal injuries on defense. They lost All Pro Defensive Captains Joey Bosa & Fred Warner, as well as Rookie 1st round defensive lineman Mykel Williams. __With Mykel Williams on the field the 49ers allowed 3.99 yards per carry allowed & a 45.2% success rate. Without Mykel Williams, the 49ers are last in success rate against RB runs (49.4%), allowing 5.0 yards per carry (29th) & a run of 10+ yards on 11.3% of those attempts (23rd). They have allowed a first down or touchdown on 28% of those runs (31st). That’s music to JT’s ears who has a 9.56% explosive rate (3rd amongst RB’s with 200+ carries) & has a 45.59% success (2nd among RB’s 200+ carries). San Francisco has allowed 130 total yards per game to RB’s over their past 5 games, & that includes bad offenses in the Cardinals, Titans, & Browns.__ In the past 2 weeks, they allowed 91 rushing yards to Quinshon Judkins (his 3rd highest this season) & 104 yards on the ground to Tony Pollard last week (his 2nd highest this season). Both of those teams are in the bottom 4 in rushing yards per game. The Colts offensive line has been elite, allowing the Colts to gain 2.51 yards before contact (5th). The 49ers have allowed 2.02 ybc (22nd). 49ers coach is likely to stack the box vs a Colts offense with clear intentions of feeding JT. SF allows 3.61 ypc when stacking box (21st). The Colts average 4.77 ypc vs a stacked box (3rd). Not only do the Colts have an elite run game on offense, they also are elite at stopping the run.\n\nThe Colts have one of the best run defenses in the league, which has forced opponents to pass on them. __Opposing offenses run on just 38.86% of plays facing the Colts, 4th fewest in the NFL. They have allowed a league low 3.7 yards per carry this year, with teams averaging just 95.1 rushing yards per game. However, through the air teams have thrown for the 2nd most passing yards per game against them, averaging 247.6 per game.__ On the year, the 49ers are 4th in the NFL in passing averaging 246.1 yards per game. But they rank just 25th in rushing, with just 101.4 yards per game on the ground. Their focus will be to move the ball through the air this week. 49ers QB Brock Purdy came back from injury a month ago & has had a +70% completion rate in 3 of the 4 games. Purdy had his best performance of the season last week, going 23/30 (76.7%) for 295 yards (9.8 Y/A) with 3 TD’s & no INT’s against the Titans. His first 4 games back he has peppering his favorite pass catcher, Tight End George Kittle. Kittle caught 8 of 9 targets for 88 yards & a TD on Sunday. __Since Week 8, Kittle has secured 41 of 48 (85.4%) targets. Kittle has a target share of 25% or more in 4 straight games, exceeding 67 receiving yards 5 games in a row. In his 4 games with Purdy he is averaging 8 targets & 75 yards per game.__ Now he faces a defense that has had major issues stopping opposing TE’s all season. The Colts have given up 5th most tight end targets (8.64), the 5th most receiving yards to TE’s (66.29), & allow 10.79 yards per catch. They're also ranked #22 in DVOA against TEs this season. 49ers WR Ricky Pearsall is out this week as well. The Colts will stop the run, forcing Purdy to pass. He’s going to find his favorite guy multiple times this week.\n\nJT should have 100+ rushing yards. Kittle should have 80+ receiving yards. I love both of their props separately, but I’ll gladly take them both with a little discount.\n\n__George Kittle 50+ receiving yards & Jonathon Taylor 80+ rushing yards__\n\nAppreciate the love!

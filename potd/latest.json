Sanga had a sensational season last year and nobody really expects them to follow up that 3rd place.\n\nAvispa Fukuoka drew 1-1 against Okayama in the opener, before Cerezo beat them 2-0 at home. I have Avsipa to finish last in this West group, there is just very little about this team that inspires anything. They averaged less than a goal a game last year and over the winter they have lost some key players without replacing them with anybody noteworthy. The manager has also left after last season after being accused of power harassing yet again and the replacement hasn’t done anything special before this to inspire confidence. \n\nIt would be really fuckings frustrating if Kyoto Sanga can’t win this game by just scoring a single goal. The guests here really do look clueless and poorly coached. My guess is another 2-0 defeat for Avispa.\n\n",

      "text": "Event: English Premier League\nTottenham Hotspur v Arsenal, 17:30 CET\nPOTD: Winner: Arsenal, 1.60, 1 unit\n\nWrite up: North London derby - a story in itself.\nProbably one of the biggest point-difference between these two teams if front of this derby in the 21st century. Arsenal are chasing the Premier League title after 22 years, while Tottenham after a great start of the season now  can't find a way to escape the relegation zone.\nArsenal are in front of the first serious test in the title race after drawing against Wolves. If they don't manage to win at Tottenham, after whole 22 matchweeks there is a big chance for them to lose the first place in the near future because of the tougher schedule rather than Man. City.\nAlthough in this kind of derbies statistics don't matter a lot and the mentality in front of the games is the key, Arsenal dominated in their last Premier League meeting and won in the last 3 Premier League games at Tottenham away.\nIn addition, in Sunday Igor Tudor will make a debut as the new manager of Tottenham.",

Onto the next. \n\nToday’s Pick: Iowa vs Wisconsin/ Wisconsin ML (-148) 4u\n\nWrite up: Part of what makes Vegas so profitable is how reactive the average Gambler is. A lot of gamblers would see Iowa fresh off a win against Nebraska and Wisconsin fresh off of a loss and scratch their head here. Let’s present the facts. Iowa is 3-5 on the road. Iowa is 1-5 against teams ranked in the AP Poll. Iowa’s offense has looked horrible to say the least recently. And what made Iowa win last game was how they schemed against the Huskers offense. It’s easy to prey on a team when you’re on your home court. But I just can’t see the Hawkeyes being able to scheme quite as well on the road. Especially with how potent this Badger offense can be. The only way, and I emphasize only, the Hawkeyes can control this game is if Wisconsin is lousy with the basketball. Otherwise I don’t see a sputtering offense marching in on the road and dismantling a Badgers team in need of a win. Wisconsin is currently a tournament team but nothing is guaranteed. A loss here hurts BAD, and we all know winning on the road is extremely hard to do, ESPECIALLY with a struggling offense. Stirtz is phenomenal, but he’s gonna need a lot of help tomorrow. Thanks to those tailing. Only gamble what you can afford to lose, let’s have a good weekend everyone! \n\n\nIf you’d like to buy me a beer: [Venmo](https://venmo.com/u/Jay-Lawton-1) [CashApp](https://cash.app/$jaylaw930)",

Taking a shot at Erling Haaland 3 or more shots on target, Haaland is red hot at the minute, he scored two goals against Bournemouth last time out in the Premier League with four shots on target. Looking back at the Villarreal game and the Monaco game in the Champions League he hit the 3+ line in those two games. Dortmund like to concede goals in the Champions League in their 3 games this season they've played Juventus who they shipped four goals to, they also scored four themselves, Athletic Club got a goal against them then Copenhagen scored two against them in their last time out in the Champions League. Man City are the better team here and Haaland is on fine form I fancy him to keep this form running against Dortmund and get 3+ shots on target.",

Murray is over this line in 4 of 6 games this season, with him ending Monday night with 29 PRA after shooting just 35%. He is over this line in their last 2 games against the Heat, and given the match total is 240 pts, I expect this to be a high pace game with plenty of opportunities for Murray to continue his hot start to the season.",

Finally thought I’d contribute\n\nPICK: Kecmanovic vs Darderi ATP 7:00amEST\nKecmanovic set spread -1.5 @+125 \n\nWright up: I watch way more tennis than I should or would like to admit. I played college tennis so I know a little about the dynamics of tennis. \nKecmanovic is an indoor hard court player. Darderi has been BAD on hard court this whole season especially in the past month and a half. Kecmanovic has a match under his belt and a good one that is in this tournament already. Darderi had a bye and will be coming into this tournament colder than ever. If you want a safer pick the ML is -190 but I’m confident Throwing 2UNITS on this for a bigger payout \n\nAlso, fuk tennis. No one is ever safe in This sport. But damn is Darderi playing bad right now \n\nHoping to start off my POD career hot",

Coventry had 6 corners with 10 mins left including extra time, which included multiple attacks around the goal. SOMEHOW they did not have another corner and actually scored at the end to ice it. Was holding my breath the whole time.\n\nToday’s POTD: 🏀 North Dakota State +3.5 vs UC Davis (-118)\n\nGame starts at 9pm. Bet 2.5u\n\nWriteup: Let's add another sport to the list I barely talk about on here in basketball, specifically college basketball. I cannot get behind the NBA, but NCAA basketball I love. A lot of people may not like the way I do picks for NCAA basketball because they are very to the point and don't give a lot of information, but I've found it to be pretty effective. I keep it very simple - eye test, strength of schedule, and Ken Pom rankings.\n\nBoth teams had their season opener yesterday. NDSU played Oregon State, a team who is clearly better, and they only lost by 2. Not bad for a season opener for a team not in one of the power conferences. On the other side, UC Davis played the Menlo Oaks. Who? Exactly. That sounds like a high school. That game showed me nothing. \n\nIf you don't know about Ken Pom rankings, do yourself a favor and read into it a bit. His rankings are quite possibly some of the most consistently accurate pieces of sports statistics I've seen over a long period of time, especially during March Madness. Don't trust my word, just take a look at his results. Looking at Ken Pom aka the Holy Grail of sports analysis, UC Davis is ranked 261st with their offense ranked outside the top 300. NDSU is ranked 197th with their offense ranked inside the top 175. Ken Pom ranked UC Davis's first game with a -99 in strength of schedule, meaning that game proved nothing about if the team is any good. NDSU received a +5.87, which was top 90 in the country. \n\nYes, it's only been one game and we should probably wait until the first week is over. But waiting is boring. Throw some money on the ML too if you want, they're clearly the better team from the eye test and the analytics. \n\nRemember to only bet what you can afford, and BOL!",

Barcelona is playing at away and the Spanish league is levels above the Belgian league. Barcelona are in good form with convincing wins over Elche and Olympiacos and even though they lost one of their last matches to favorites Real Madrid they will be looking for a win here vs a much inferior opponent. On to the Inter game now Inter Milan should easily win over Kairat as they are the much better team and sit tied for 3rd in the UCL table with a perfect 3 - 0 record with wins over USG, Slavia Prague and Ajax. There is simply no match here for Inter Milan and anything other than an Inter Milan win would be considered a huge surprise. ",

No pressure on the defender in a stock-standard recycle of play. Defender looked up to see where the keeper was, missed him by about 25m and put the ball in his own net. \n\nCity had hardly touched the ball. \n\nFrom there, Machida completely dominated. I know it says Machida had 20 shots to City's 8, but that doesn't do it justice. There were so many dangerous balls across goal that nobody got on the end of etc. \n\nMachida scored after about half an hour and at that point I was very sure we'd get up. Kept pressuring the \n\nCity scored very late into injury time with a goal that needed VAR. Goal was originally ruled as play on and a massive five-minute VAR intervention ended up declaring the ball went across the line.\n\nFirst time an Australian team has beaten a Japanese team in 5 years. \n\nAnd to make it worse, I picked this over Arsenal -1.5, and Birmingham (-0.5 & -1.0) for some stupid reason.... That is on me. \n\nI'm off A-League clubs in potd from now on.\n\nToday's Pick:  Inter (-2.0) vs Kairat Almaty AND Galatasaray (+1.0) vs Ajax. 3u @ 1.91\n\nInter (-2.0) vs Kairat Almaty\n\nKairat might be worth a shout in some home games (travelling to Kazakhstan isn't an easy trip), but away from home the reverse is true... It's about a nine hour flight for Kairat, and while they've had a week without games, I still think that journey is a massive factor. \n\nTheir last away Champions League game was against Sporting who pumped them 4-1.\n\nInter aren't as good as they were last season (imo, but it's early), however they've had some big wins on the road in the champions league already... beating Ajax 2-0 and Union St Gilloise 4-0. \n\nGalatasaray (+1.0) at Ajax \n\nAjax are in pretty bad form this season and sit fifth in the Durch league. They sit fifth and have already dropped points at home to SC Heerenveen,and Az Alkmaar.\n\nTheir underlying numbers have been a little off. They're about mid table for xg conceded in the league, and have only kept two clean sheets. \n\nAlong with that, they are 7th in the league for expected goals, and 9th in the league for total big chances created.\n\nAjax's Champions League form has been dire too, with losses to Inter, Marseille, and Chelsea.\n\nGalatasaray are looking great this season in Turkey and sit top of the league and are 9-2-0 after 11 games. \n\nThey've also got two wins vs Liverpool and Bodo/Glimt in the Champions League. They did lose 5-1 to Frankfurt in their opening game, but honestly.... it was off 11 shots and 1.21 expected goals (.48 of which was for their fifth goal when Gala lost the ball in the box) - it's obviously not ideal, but I can see that as an outlier.",

In their last ten games, every Barcelona match has ended with more than 2.5 goals and their team scores an average of 2.4 goals per game while conceding 1.4, so goals are almost always guaranteed when they play. Brugge can be dangerous at home and are on a three-game winning streak domestically, but they were soundly beaten 4-0 by Bayern Munich and are not at Barcelona’s level in terms of defense or quality. Barcelona have never lost to Brugge in European competition (three wins and one draw in four meetings), and even with few players missing out, they still have lots of attacking options, Lamine Yamal and Marcus Rashford are in great form, and Hansi Flick’s tactics mean they create plenty of chances every match. Also all the UCL matches of both Barca and Brugge this season had over 2.5 goals. \n\nIf you found these picks helpful, tips or donations are greatly appreciated as they support the time and effort I put into creating them: [buy me a beer🍻](https://buymeacoffee.com/hercules.son.of.zeus)",

Qarabağ line up in a compact 4-2-3-1, sitting deep and soaking up pressure before launching wide counterattacks and targeting set-piece situations. This approach invites Chelsea’s full-backs to push high and overlap, leading to repeated sequences of blocked crosses and deflected shots that naturally produce corners. Chelsea, under their current setup, operate in a flexible 4-2-3-1 or 4-3-3, focusing on wide build-up play through aggressive wing-backs and inverted forwards. Their dominance in possession and emphasis on stretching the pitch often pins opponents deep, generating sustained pressure and multiple corner situations. Meanwhile, Qarabağ’s counterattacking transitions and reliance on crosses from advanced wide areas also create chances to win corners of their own. With both teams committed to attacking down the flanks and forcing play into the final third, this match profiles as one with strong corner potential — making Over +8.50 corners a convincing and value-driven bet.",

Sheffield United took the lead early which really wasn’t ideal as Coventry were already on 2 corners and would step up their pressure to salvage a result. Despite throwing attacking as well as they have all season, the Baldes weren’t backing down and the corner count surprisingly ended 6-3 to Sheffield at the half. Piling even more pressure and two goals not long after the break, the Sky Blues wouldn’t step their foot off the gas and we had to hold on for 10 minutes for no more corners as the count was at 6. Thankfully the seventh never came and Coventry ended up scoring a third deep in stoppage time.\n\nMoving from one Sheffield to the other, Wednesday aren’t faring much better than their rivals as they’re on… -5 points. One of the oldest clubs in the world, the situation is quite sad as they’ve entered administration for failing to pay wages. I have to commend the Owls as in spite of the obvious off-field issues and whole bunch of injuries woes the players have shown a lot of heart in their performances. Though they haven’t won since September they haven’t necessarily been playing terrible football - keeping games close in spite of all the issues and Hillsborough remains a tough ground to visit. The players seem fired up for a result and there’s finally some optimism as offers are close to being made to buy the club - a huge attendance is expected tomorrow to make good impression on potential new owners. What better way to bounce back than facing Norwich, who have had none of the issues yet all of the troubles just sitting a spot above Wednesday. That’s now no wins since August and for a team that usually yo-yo’s between the Prem and Championship they could very well end up being in League One next year for the first time since 2009.\n\nAnyways enough of the context, the Owls have averaged 5.9 corners for and 4.6 corners against in their last 20 home matches. The canaries have been averaging 3.7 for and 6.1 conceded in the same period on the road. Even using recent stats is flattering to Wednesday’s corners (both for and against) despite the financial troubles so no concerns on that end. I get an expected 6.3 corners for Sheffield and 3.8 for Norwich using all factors. Just a note though that in this fixture last season Norwich had more corners though was a year ago (exactly) so I’m not necessarily worried. That gives this play an estimated 75% chance of winning. BOL, let’s get to 50 wins !\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ijvhhh9y7czf1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=47815cf530cb8e0b6bffbdcdc874ef4c31aa967f",

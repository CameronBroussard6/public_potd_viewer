Raptors are in a great spot here to get back on track after dropping two straight, after going on a 7 game heater that basically no one saw coming. Heading back to their home arena where they are 7-2 SU. Blazers and racked by injuries, Toronto is deep in role players. Have this modelled at around -9. \n\nBOL!",

Meanwhile Campbell shows up to road games like they accidentally got on the wrong bus. They’re 0–4 away from home, and half those losses weren’t even competitive as they were more like “hey, thanks for coming, here’s your participation ribbon.”\n\nPSU’s offense is clicking, the ball is moving, everyone’s smiling, and Kayden Mingo is out here hooping like he’s auditioning for a freshman All-American nod. Campbell? They’ve got one main scorer, D.J. Smith, and after that the offense turns into an improv show nobody asked for.\n\nThe biggest mismatch? Energy and tempo. Penn State runs like they had two espressos and a pep talk. Campbell plays like someone woke them up from a nap. That’s exactly how double-digit spreads get covered ,fast team vs sleepy team.\n\nAnd dEpth? PSU can go to the bench and still score. Campbell goes to the bench and immediately wishes they hadn't. This is how you avoid those nightmare backdoor covers when the starters sit, the lead doesn't die.\n\nIf Penn State starts with a 10–0 burst, don’t be shocked. They’ve got all the tools to stretch this one out until it looks like a CVS receipt.\n\nSo yeah PSUwill win by like 15, maybe 20 if they hit threes. Campbell might put up a fight early, but eventually the wheels come off, the vibes collapse, and PSU goes on that inevitable “welp, this is getting out of hand” run.\n\nTake –12.5, sip your coffee, and enjoy the show.",

Bet 2.5U\n\nWriteup: Going back to college hoops for this one, and we’re taking the Tennessee Volunteers to cover the spread against Syracuse. Tennessee is currently 7-1 and the #13 team in the nation. They recently finished 2-1 in the Players Era tournament with a very impressive win over #3 Houston. Their senior guard Ja’Kobi Gillespie leads the Volunteers with 18.5 PPG along with star freshman Nate Ament having 18 PPG. With their offense averaging 86 PPG, it’s even more impressive that their defense is even better than their offense, conceding only 65.5 PPG.\n\nOn the other side, we have the Syracuse Orange at 4-3 this season, and recently lost all of their games in the Players Era tourney. Their top scorer Donnie Freeman is out for this game due to injury for an offense that was already inconsistent. They have also struggled keeping up pace of play against better opponents, as the Players Era tournament clearly showed. \n\nBoth teams are playing with a chip on their shoulder, but the better team should come out on top and do so in a decisive manner with a least a 7 point victory. \n\nRemember to only bet what you can afford to lose, and BOL!",

She's a really nice player who had a fantastic 2024 season before dropping her form a bit in 2025. Kasintseva is a decent opponent but still needs to improve a lot of things in her game, and Sonmez has the advantage on this surface. If we look at these players' careers, we can see that most of the tournament success has come on hard courts for Sonmez, while Kasintseva won the majority of her titles on clay. Sonmez also had a great upset win against Eva Lys recently at the Billie Jean King Cup on this surface (Indoor Hard).\n\nI usually don't like to go with handicaps to increase the odds, and the majority of my sports betting plays are focused on extracting value from the ML in tennis.\n\nGood luck! I'll be posting daily when I spot good looks and especially at the start of the next tennis season!",

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 11-5 (Avg Odds +131)\n\n**Previous Pick:** Enzo Fernandez 1+ SOT (+140) ✅️\n\n**Today's Event:** English Premier League | Fulham vs. Man City (11:30AM PST)\n\n**Pick:** Harry Wilson 1+ SOT (+105) 1 unit to win 1.65 units\n\n**Write Up:** Enzo comes through for us in the 31st minute! Our guy cashed us for the 4th time, all at plus money! Palmer did not start, as expected, and Enzo slotted into the #10 role which was perfect for our play. Gotta love a weekend sweep! \n\nUnfortunately I didn't post my pick for yesterday (Santi Castro 2+ SOT), as I was waiting for Bologna lineups and didn't catch them until 30 minutes before kick off. So we are back to mid-week EPL action after a day off as Fulham host Man City. Fulham play really tough at home, going 4-1-1, having only dropped points to Arsenal and Man U. If City want to make a title run again this year, these away matches against mid-table teams are must win games. I expect a close match here, but really can't read the goals.\n\nAs I was finishing my research here, I actually changed to a different pick than my initial pick of a City player. City seems a bit tired, they are struggling to rotate players for mid-week matches, and are conceding goals/possession more than typical - especially mid-week. \n\nHarry Wilson should get another start at right winger here, after a goal on two shots against Tottenham over the weekend. If you watched that match, you saw why I'm on Wilson - he's a guy who can shoot from anywhere with his left foot. Seriously, go watch his goal if you haven't seen it, I know the keeper was out of position, but it doesn't make the finish any less impressive. Wilson has only had 3 SOTs in his last 5 matches, but he's taken an average of 3 shots per match. This includes 4 against Arsenal at home and, honestly, it was unlucky that none of those hit the target. He also had 2 SOTs in this fixture at the end of last season in May (against a fairly similar City team that I expect to see tomorrow). Wilson also scored 3 goals for Wales during the international break 2 weeks back. The man is in form and I like him to take a few shots today and land at least one on target. \n\nBOL and have a great Tuesday!",

I like the Blackhawks ML also, but the odds are too high for this thread. The Knights are 6-4-4 at home this season and it seems as though Carter Hart will be making his first start of the season after serving his suspension. \n\nChicago got a big win over Anaheim on Sunday and they have a respectable team for the first time in a while. Their season goal differential is actually better than the Knights. Simply put, these teams aren’t that far off from each other, but the betting lines make this seem like a long shot.",

      "text": "**POTD** Record 121-02-97\n\nGLADBACH VS ST PAULI\n\nDate: 02 DECEMBER 2025 at 18:00\n\nBET ON: Match odds- GLADBACH\n\nOdd: 1.81\n\n\n\n\\- Gladbach enter the cup tie with clear upward momentum and a strong sense of purpose, as Polanski has repeatedly stressed that the DFB-Pokal is a priority both for sporting continuity and the significant financial incentive of progressing. Despite missing Neuhaus and several squad players, the team’s 4-2-3-1 structure remains stable, reinforced by the returns of Hack and Kleindienst and the reliability of Tabakovic up front. Polanski warns against relying on the recent 4–0 league win over St. Pauli, calling this a “dangerous match,” but he underlines that his side’s defensive solidity and form give them control over the tie. St. Pauli, meanwhile, approach the match from a position of crisis, with Blessin viewing the cup primarily as a mental reset after a long run of Bundesliga defeats. Their squad is significantly weakened: key striker Hountondji is ruled out with a muscular injury, while multiple defenders remain unavailable, forcing a conservative 5-4-1 setup designed more for survival than proactive play. With limited attacking options, structural defensive problems, and confidence issues, St. Pauli’s priorities lie in stabilizing rather than competing on equal terms — giving Gladbach a clear motivational, tactical, and personnel advantage.",

      "text": "**Record:** 30-15-1 (+13.53u) \n\n**Last:** (CBB) Florida -6.5 (1u) - L\n\n**POTD:** No. 13 Tennessee (-6.5) at Syracuse \n\n**Start Time:** 7:00 PM ET\n\n**Odds:** -110 (DraftKings)\n\n**Units:** 1U\n\n**Reasoning:** Sometimes, there’s nothing deadlier than a team playing with its back against the wall. Other times, that team is the 2025 Syracuse men’s basketball team.\n\nThe Orange (4-3) accepted an invite to last week’s Player’s Era Festival with one thing in mind: an opportunity to pick up a crucial non-conference Quad 1 victory. With matchups lined up against Iowa State (7th in NET ranking), Kansas (17th) and Houston (18th), the opportunity was there for the taking. However, what started with promise—a 78-74 overtime defeat to the Cougars—quickly ended in disaster with 11 and 31-point losses to the Jayhawks and Cyclones respectively. \n\nAnd while No. 13 Tennessee will provide Syracuse with one last chance on Tuesday night, don’t hold your breath.\n\nThe Vols (7-1) enter this matchup on the heels of a disappointing 81-76 loss to Kansas last Wednesday. It’s a defeat that will have the team kicking itself, as Tennessee led by 12 with 14 minutes to go before watching the wheels completely fall off. So while the Orange will be out looking for respect, the Vols will be looking for something to take out their frustrations on. \n\nOffensively, Tennessee comes in ranked 32nd in offensive efficiency (1.186), 50th in shooting (48.8%), 52nd in scoring (85.9 PPG) and 114th in three-point shooting (35.4%). While Syracuse’s defensive numbers might look respectable at first—20th in opponent shooting (37.8%), 27th in scoring defense (65.3 PPGA), 30th in defensive efficiency (0.908) and 99th in opponent three-point shooting (30.7%)—a closer look will reveal a chink in its armor. In three games against top-ranked opponents during last week’s aforementioned tournament, the team saw those numbers drop to 81.3 points per game allowed on 46.4% shooting (39.7% from the perimeter). Look for Maryland-transfer Ja’Kobi Gillespie (18.5 PPG) to take advantage of that.\n\nThe mismatch should continue on the other end of the floor as well. \n\nThrough eight games, the Vols rank 12th in opponent shooting (36.8%), 27th in defensive efficiency (0.903), 29th in scoring defense (65.4 PPGA) and 51st in opponent three-point shooting (28.7%). It all adds up to what should be a very long night for an Orange offense that only ranks 114th in shooting (46.2%), 171st in offensive efficiency (1.041), 177th in scoring (74.9 PPG) and 290th in three-point shooting (29.3%). That includes scoring just 66.0 points per game on 37.9% shooting over their last three showings. And did we mentioned that the team will be without its leading scorer in forward Donnie Freeman (17.8 PPG? Yikes. \n\nA strong advantage on the glass will be another X factor in the matchup. \n\nTennessee comes in ranked 10th in total rebounds (43.6 per game), 10th in offensive rebounds (13.0), 20th in opponent rebounds (30.0) and 199th in opponent offensive rebounds (9.4). Conversely, Syracuse ranks 152nd in total rebounding (36.3), 223rd in offensive rebounds (8.6), 293rd in opponent rebounds (38.7) and 304th in opponent offensive rebounds (10.9). \n\nTrust the Vols to make the Orange their punching bag. \n\nBOL if tailing, and as always, please do so respectively.",

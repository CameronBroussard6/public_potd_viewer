I still like the reads. Yesterday our bet went from +155 to around -120 before tip-off, so we were definitely on the right side. \n\nTonight I’m rolling with Kyle. He will be starting and handle the bulk of the minutes between centers. The Jazz have most of their starters out in Keyonte, Nurkic, and JJJ. Without those guys Kyle went 4/5, averaging near 12 boards on 16 chances. Grizzlies literally have everybody on the injury report, and do not have a true center, as Kyle Anderson - a small forward, is filling the role. Against the Grizzlies in the last few games, Clingan grabbed 17 and 19 in back-to-back games, Al Horford grabbed 9, and Joker got 15. In the last two weeks, the Grizzlies rank dead last in rebounds allowed to centers. This should be our get-back spot. GL\n\n[https://venmo.com/u/SezaBC](https://venmo.com/u/SezaBC)",

      "text": "Record: 34-28-2\n\nNet units: (+1.51 units)\n\nROI: 2.36%\n\nLast pick: kevin durant \"O\" 24.5 points (w)\n\nPick of the Day: James Harden \"O\" 8.5 Assists (+105) HR\n\nReasoning:  Harden is currently averaging 8.2 APG on the season and has seen a playmaking bump since joining Cleveland, where he is surrounded by elite finishers like Donovan Mitchell and Evan Mobley. Against Charlotte, he transitions from \"Scorer\" to \"Maestro.\"\n\n🕵️ Detective clues:\n\nEvidence 1: The \"Mitchell\" Factor: Since Harden arrived in Cleveland, he’s cleared 7+ assists in 9 of his last 10 games. He is averaging 8.7 APG as a Cavalier because the team has actual scoring threats that convert his passes at a high rate.\n\nEvidence 2: The B2B Cushion: Cleveland blew out Brooklyn last night, allowing Harden to sit the entire 4th quarter and finish with only 28 minutes. His legs are fresher than a typical back-to-back would suggest.\n\nEvidence 3: Historical Matchup Edge\n In his last 10 games against Charlotte, Harden has averaged 9.9 assists. He has recorded 10+ assists in 6 of those 10 games, including a 10-assist double-double just last month (Jan 12).\n\nScenario Playbook \n\nScenario A (The Ideal):Harden runs the pick-and-roll with Jarrett Allen/Mobley early. Charlotte collapses on the drive, and Harden kicks to Mitchell for three \"easy\" assists. He hits 8 assists by mid-way through the 3rd.\n\nScenario B (The Grind):Harden’s jumper is flat due to travel. He stops shooting and focuses entirely on playmaking to stay impactful. He finishes with a 12-point, 10-assist \"workmanlike\" line.\n\nScenario C (The Outside Influences): Charlotte goes \"Box-and-One\" or doubles Mitchell, forcing the ball into Harden’s hands as the primary decision-maker. This increases his \"Potential Assists\" (passes that lead to a shot).\n\nScenario D (The White Flag 🏳️) Cleveland is winning by 25+ in the 3rd. Harden is pulled early, but his efficiency in the first half (where he usually racks up 5-6 assists) gets him over the hump before he hits the bench.\n\n\nScenario E (Cold Night):The Cavs' shooters (Mitchell/Garland) have an abysmal night. Harden delivers the passes, but the teammates don't finish. (This is the \"Teammate Variance\" risk).\n\nScenario Proof: Harden has a \"floor\" of 7 assists in this matchup. Looking at his Jan 12 game against Charlotte, he had 10 assists in 37 minutes. Even in a 25-point blowout win against Washington on Feb 11, he managed 11 assists in only 28 minutes.",

      "text": "Record: 14-14 (+4.36u)\n\nLast Pick: Jakob Poeltl o6.5 Rebounds (-122)❌\n\nEvent: Cleveland Cavaliers @ Charlotte Hornets 7:00pm EST\n\nSeason NBA Record: 0-1 (-1.00u)\n\nPOTD: Evan Mobley o6.5 Rebounds (-114) 3u\n\nWrite up: Horrible and unlucky look by me there, don’t know when it happened but at some point late afternoon yesterday Poeltl was scratched as a starter and didn’t even see 20 min of play time. We move on and recoup.\n\nStraight back to rebounds tonight with Evan Mobley, a center playing as the team’s PF. Mobley leads the Cavs in rebounds at an average of 8.8/game, which is also the 15th highest avg in the NBA this season. Mobley has hit this line 5/L5 games and in this same matchup a month ago (1/21) recorded 14 boards. CHA just allowed Jabari Smith Jr to grab 7 rebounds (who I had paired with Poeltl last night in a two man funnily enough) and are in general allowing 10.4 rebounds a game to PF over the last 30 days.\n\nMain reason why I also love this look is because the Hornets have shooters on shooters. Over the last 5 games, Brandon Miller is averaging 9.6 3 point attempts, LaMelo is averaging 11.2 3PA, and Kon Knueppel is averaging 8 3PA. They allow more than enough opportunities for Mobley to cash. This is another play I see a lot of value in laddering at 8+ rebounds (+158) 0.75u, and to record a double double (+460) 0.25u. Let me know of any questions or concerns.\n\nBest of luck",

Makazze played very poorly last time against MOUZ and will be looking to bounce back in a big way, he went 1/2 on the over last time dropping 19 kills in 2 maps.\n\n**Projected Veto:**\n\n* NAVI ban Overpass, MOUZ ban Anubis\n* **NAVI pick Ancient**\n\n**Ancient Stats:**\n\n* NAVI are 100% winrate on 5 maps of Ancient in the L3 months, and 10-4 as a roster since adding Makazze. One interesting thing about this map is since December NAVI haven't just been winning this map but dominating top teams on Ancient. They beat PARIVISION 13-6, B8 13-4, FaZe 13-5, PARI 13-5, and G2 13-9\n* MOUZ are 100% winrate on 1 map of Ancient in the L3 months, they are 5-5 in the L6 months, this isn't a bad map for them but one they are clearly much less comfortable on then others in the pool, they've had some big struggles against certain teams, and a lot of their wins are very close regularly giving up 9+ round\n\n**Makazze Stats + Ancient Stats:**\n\n* Makazze is averaging a .68 KPR L3 months for NAVI, a .69 KPR in the last month and at this tournament so far. It would take Makazze a \\~20-21 rounds normally to hit this line with his regular KPR\n* One of the reasons NAVI Ancient became so dominant is because of Makazze, he is a monster on this map, this isn't a new thing, this was always his dominant map back on NAVI junior and even further back, he runs this map on both sides offense and defense and has been putting up massive results.\n* Makazze is averaging a 1.06 KPR in the L3 months on Ancient, a .83 KPR in the L6 months (the time he joined NAVI) making it his highest rated map overall and a .83 KPR in the last year as well. Taking a .83 KPR, it would take \\~17 rounds for him to hit this line on average at this KPR.\n* Makazze has dropped 21/22/21/17/19 in his L5 Ancient games overall\n* Makazze has gone O in 9 straight Ancient games, with an overall hit rate of 14/17, two of his misses were hooks at 13 kills, and one miss at 11 kills, meaning he has never dropped less then 11 kills on this map in tier 1\n* Since joining NAVI Makazze is averaging 18.5 kills per map on Ancient\n\ntoo tired to make full esports post but for my ML only ppl, Ex-RUBY Map 1 ML vs. Alliance is a great shout for tomorrow imo",

Utah likes to run, but Memphis doesn’t live in that tempo for four quarters. At home they’re much more comfortable in the half court, and that alone can shave a few possessions off what books are expecting here.\n\nMemphis also isn’t efficient enough offensively to support a 240+ total for a full game. They go through scoring droughts and rely heavily on jump shooting, which creates cold stretches. If they land somewhere in the 108–115 range, Utah would need a ceiling shooting night to push this over.\n\nIf Utah leads, Memphis slows it down. If Memphis leads, pace drops naturally. If it’s tight late, you get more half-court possessions and clock burn. Most realistic paths point under this number.\n\nOne of those spots where they’re just going to have to beat me if it flies over.",

Marner is having himself an excellent Olympics. He has a point in every game so far, 5 total in 4 games. Unconfirmed, but I've read projections that he's getting moved to the 2nd line. With this being the semis, the lines will be shortened and he should get a small boost to playing time. I'd estimate at bare minimum, 16 solid minutes, ideally 18+. With him also on the 2nd PP line, the opportunities will be there.\n\nFinland has one shutdown defenseman in Mikkola and one very good defensive forward in Roope Hintz, but the rest of the squad is average to below average in xGA/60.

SNS has been great all prep, and now lines up in a 6 horse field devoid of speed and talent. Our outside barrier is offset by the small field, and we claim away from the 62kgs down to 60, which means we aren’t giving away a whole lot of weight to the field.      \n       \nAlways thought this horse would we better over a mile, and after two 1400m runs we now step up to it. The last start 3rd to PARADISE CITY (third fave in the mannerism tomoz) is miles better than anything in this field could hope to accomplish, and as along as we get the initial part of the race right (GO FORWARD) then we should be good.

The only two times he went under were due to blowouts wins (13-1, 13-4). Paravision boasts a 78% win rate across 14 matches of Dust 2, due in part to Jame’s stellar calling and AWPing.  Paravision is just about guaranteed to select this map and I do not see them blowing out a top 5 team with superstar talent such as Falcons. De_dust 2 is Paravision’s playground. A map in which they are capable of defeating any team in the world. Jame is Parvision’s AWPer and captain. De_dust 2 also lends itself to the AWPing role quite well, with it historically being a pop off map for AWPers given the long site lines on each lane of the map. Without a strong AWPing performance, your chances of winning Dust 2 decrease significantly. With Jame being the captain and IGL, he will put himself in positions to succeed with the AWP in order to give his team the best opportunity to win the match.  The only negative factors I am able to locate regarding this wager are the blowout potential (low) and an AWP H2H vs a top 3 player in the world mOnesy (doesnt directly affect Jame’s kill total).

The Swiss will have a significant advantage at every position except fourth where they still have a slight heads up on Norway. Switzerland came into the event with a 46-16 season record, including 16-1 against teams outside the world top 25 (such as Norway). Norway came in at 37-26 and 1-6 against top 10 teams.

The team we backed, Drita, was down 2-0 by half time, before taking the game under full control and scoring two goals themselves. They were millimetres away from the third, but then Celje hit them on a counter and scored in the literal last second. That was a real bad beat, so bad in fact, it made me switch sports for today. Still more hits than losses in the last 5 so gotta at least look at the positives. Plus, today’s Friday so that’s a positive in itself*\n\n**Last Five:** ✅✅❌✅❌\n\n**Event:** Winter Olympics, Canada v Finland, 10:40 am EST\n\n**POTD:** Finland +2.5 Spread, -137, 1 unit\n\n**Write Up:** *I’ll preface this by saying Canada might be the big favorite,* but we’ve seen far too many underdogs turn up in these Olympics recently. In the light of that, I just can’t help, but think Finland should easily cover the spread. It’s an important game with a lot at stake so neither team is coming out all guns blazing, and I think a blowout is unlikely.\n\nCanada have **struggled big time in the previous round,** requiring a late equalizer to send the game to overtime where they just about overpowered the spirited Czech Republic. Meanwhile, Finland showed grit themselves by completing a **stunning comeback** before dumping Switzerland out of the competition. Finland have troubled the Canadians in the past, so I don’t think this is going to be a straightforward one. *Make no mistake, I think team Canada is winning this,* but not by 3 or more goals. **Jordan Binnington is far too unreliable** in net and they just **can’t find a solid defensive pairing.** Finland can be tricky and should never be counted out, as they showed against Switzerland, as well as in their most recent H2H where the Canadians were already up by 4 goals before Finland scored 3 in quick succession, making the final few moments very nervy for the Northern Americans.\n\nThese Olympics have been absolutely mental and I can see another big struggle incoming. We’re taking some juice here, but a +2.5 handicap feels like a very safe line so I’m dropping a unit on it. Under 5.5 goals also sounds like a viable market, in case y’all want to explore that side of the coin. I also like the odds on Celebrini ATGS, the man’s on fire. BOL and let's enjoy another underdog story ☘️🫡",

Hull actually see out a win against Brisbane, seeing no real stress against this pick either. We are on a nice streak here folks, appreciate all the input in comments and happy to be cashing you out - lets keep it going!\n\nFirst up we go to the Danish top league, where Nordsjaelland (6th) host Vejle (12th/bottom of the league). Nords home record is 6-0-4 W/D/L, Vejle's away record is 0-2-7 W/D/L. Since 2008 when they first faced off their head-to-head record is 12(Nord)-5(draw)-2(Vejle) in their 19 fixtures, going FC Nordsjaelland's home ground this is taken to 7 wins for Nord and 1 draw, with 4 wins for the home team in a row. In their reverse fixture in October it finished 3-0 with Nord winning it away. Current form has Nordsjaelland on a 3 win streak, with 4 wins in the last 5 in this league - Vejle is currently 1-4 in their last 5. I would also like to point out that against similar position opponents FC Fredericia (11th) and Silkeborg (10th) at Nordsjaelland's home ground BOTH finished 5-0. I do see a similar outcome for an away team that have historically struggled against this team, as well as them being in poor recent form, FC Nordsjaelland being in better current form, having the home advantage and them proving them to have the ability to beat these kind of teams at their home ground. I'm going to guess a 3-1 finish for FC Nordsjaelland here - fingers crossed they take away the 3 points today.\n\nYou might remember I accidentally got the dates mixed up the other day, thinking this fixture between Athletic and Elche was on Monday instead of Friday as I misread it - we go to it today as I still like this line. Secondly, we go to the Spanish top flight, where Athletic sit 9th and Elche in 16th. Important stats you should know this fixture has seen LESS than 2.5 goals 6/8 meetings - HOWEVER here's why I am backing BTTS: it historically has a 3/6 hit rate at Athletic. The reverse fixture at the start of the season ended 0-0 at Elche, but current forms are my motivator for this pick. First and foremost, the current records are that BTTS hitting 9/10 for Athletic and 7/8 for Elche. The last 7 fixtures for Athletic have seen BTTS and 6/last 7 for Elche have seen BTTS. At home Athletic have seen BTTS in 4/8, but noticeably their last 3 (since December 22nd) they have seen this clear against weaker opponents in Levante (19th) and similar quality in Real Sociedad (8th). Elche's away record is woeful at 0-4-7, however that has not been for a lack of trying, they have seen goals both ends in 9/11 of their away games. Over 2.5 goals has been seen in 8/10 last Athletic games and 5/6 Elche games. Averages for each team are as follows: Athletic goals for 27(1.13 per game) and goals against 34(1.42 per game) - Elche goals for 31(1.29 per game) and goals against 35(1.46 per game).\n\nThank you for all the input in the comments, I appreciate those who tail! Also I would like to remind people I do this for fun, I am not a professional and therefore sometimes my writeups can be lacklustre I am aware. Anyways have a great day folks!\n\n**BOL and always bet what you can afford to lose!**",

I think we all saw Finland vs Switzerland and how it went in the first period(don't remind me please lol). Anywayyy I was not impressed at all by Finland's performance. Switzerland had 3 good NHL defensemen but come on now. Except for 6 Swiss forwards who are in the NHL, everybody else played in the Swiss league and Switzerland even had played the day before. Meanwhile Finland had fresh legs, a full NHL lineup anddd they were facing a 38 year old goalie starting again on a back-to-back. Until the 3rd period they looked a lot of times lost in their own end making bad plays after bad plays(go watch the highlights the defensive miscues were plenty). The smaller rink might have honestly been more of a factor for NHL players than what I originally thought in these Olympics. Players have less space and this seems to favor the European players who are most used to it than NHLers (Slovakia is in the other semi-final with 7 NHL players). Now tomorrow it will be NHL players vs NHL players so I don't think there will be surprises like what we saw vs Czechia. Tomorrow it will come down to the powerplay and raw talent which Canada is better in both. They are the faster and better team and I expect them to have a much better start than against Czechia. Canada is expected to win this one so it's not my \"hockey expert analysis\" here guys. The game vs Czechia was way too close than what it should have been and they know it too. They have the firepower to do it and I expect them to come out roaring in that first period to make sure the game doesn't go out of hands like the other one. Why are the odds so low then? The big factor here for team Canada to hit this prop lays on Jordan Binnington and how will he play tomorrow. I know Binnington was shaky vs Czechia but I don't expect him to have 2 bad games in a row especially with a finals spot on the line. He did win the gold with Canada at 4Nations so we know that he can be better than what we saw vs Czechia and I expect him to be solid.\n\nAnother factor that for me feels like will help team Canada is the injury of Sidney Crosby. Crosby has been a legend for team Canada for 20 years and he might not be available tomorrow. Team Canada said after their comeback to Czechia that they didn't want that game to be Sidney's last game in the Olympics and if he's out vs Finland you know the young guns on the team who used to idolize him will be extra motivated to win for him and have a good showing. His absence will be missed for team Canada but they have plenty of great players that can help cover and that probably means more minutes for MacKinnon and McDavid/Celebrini which is good for us.\n\nIn other words, for me it comes down to how Binnington will play tomorrow in that first period and how Canada will respond early after their almost embarrassing loss to Czechia (they played against each other a week ago and Canada won 5-0 so I think Canada just thought that game was gonna be a breeze after scoring first and underestimated their opponents). I strongly believe that Canada and Binnington will have a much better start as they are proven winners and also that before this Czechia's game, Canada hit the -0.5 first period prop in **every other games in these Olympics.**\n\nBOL! Please play responsibly?\n\n[Buymeacoffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/lordestros)",

A few people in the comments asked why we didn't just take PARIVISION 2-0 yesterday. We got our answer when they dropped a map to Yandex. That 1-1 draw would have ruined the parlay, which is exactly why we played it as a Double Chance/ML anchor instead. We are staying disciplined with our reads to keep the main record climbing.\n\nHuge thanks to everyone following the heat.\n\nWRITE-UP: NAVI is the primary focus of this parlay. They are currently fighting for their lives in Group B and absolutely must win this series 2-0 to secure a spot in the next stage. They are facing Execration, who have struggled all tournament with a 2-10 record. NAVI has a perfect head-to-head history against them. The motivation gap here and the skill difference are just huge.\n\nPairing them with Team Liquid to bring the odds to a solid 2.20. While Liquid is already safe for the next round,  and even though they are safe for the next stage, they still need the better ranking in this current stage to qualify for RIYADH MASTERS, so there are not going to be any cheese picks to fuck up our parlay. They are facing a paiN Gaming squad that is already eliminated and recently had roster instability after kicking their carry (Parker and his dramas). The skill difference between the current BLAST champs and a demoralized paiN roster is too wide to ignore. This is a high-probability combo to keep the streak alive.\n\nIf you have any trouble finding these lines or need help with your slips, feel free to reach out. I am always happy to help.",

The books love Korda don’t they? This does seem a bit over the top though. Both players came through really tough matches in the last round, Korda had to save 4 SP’s in the second set to Michelsen whilst Ruud battled back from a set down to Giron. Casper recently became a father which explained his absence since AO but really started finding his rhythm against Giron after the second set which is going to be a big positive coming into this match as he was obviously slightly rusty to kick things off, especially against a player he’d struggled against in the past. Korda has been playing a lot of tennis but I don’t think the match fitness edge is going to have too much of an impact since Ruud is simply the better player in my mind. \n\nThe slower and bouncier courts should favour Ruud’s heavy topspin game more than Korda’s flatter strokes. That means that he should be able to reset Korda’s attacks with a deep ball that is difficult to control and will have the upper hand once rallies are dragged out as his rally tolerance is simply better. Can Sebi hit through this? Absolutely as he’s an excellent ball striker but the more he receives, the more he’ll be prone to miss. The topspin on Ruud’s shots also means that the American will have to be in the right strike zone to have a clean hitting point and whilst his anticipation is generally quite good, his lateral movement is poor which might make it difficult to truly attack every shot and being off balance is going to invite Casper to come in and finish the points. I have seen a lot more offensive intent from the Norwegian as well recently to take even more time away from his opponents plus has slightly tweaked the serve, fired 20 aces past Giron last round which is going to be a welcome addition. Korda is going to cause some issues on the serve + 1 and with the shorter points which is why I think the match will be relatively close but I still think Ruud will have more looks on return especially if Korda’s 1st serve percentage falters in a game and therefore can take initiative especially if he can force the game on to his elite forehand. Casper leads the H2H 2-0, both matches being last year including in Stockholm where Korda theoretically had a better chance of winning on a fast court compared to today. Most importantly though is the fact that Christian Ruud (Casper’s father) defeated Petr Korda (Sebi’s father) in 1999 so it’s only logical that the Ruud’s will continue to have the Korda’s number. I would have fairer odds closer to 1.8 adjusting for a very slight concern on Casper’s sharpness. BOL !",

The Mavs have now lost 9 straight, only covering the spread in 2 of those games and are now without Cooper Flagg for this matchup. Their second best scorer, Naji Marshall left before the end of the teams last game, and appears to be playing tomorrow but he will struggle to orchestrate the offence due to Gobert's paint presence. The Mavs front office also appears to have deemed this season a wash after selling at the deadline and shutting down Kyrie for the rest of the year. Coming out of the break, the team doesn't have anything to play for except a lottery pick. The timberwolves have won 7 of their last 10, and are itching towards a top 4 seed. At home, their defence is ranked third in defensive efficiency, while Dallas ranks 4th last. Im backing the healthier, deeper, more talented, and more motivated team at home to cover against the tanking Mavs. BOL.\n\n[https://buymeacoffee.com/ch1cken](https://buymeacoffee.com/ch1cken)",

Now we are heading back to my home turf, Argentina, for a high-value Double Chance parlay. Let's keep this streak alive.\n\nBoca Juniors vs Racing Club: Boca has only managed to win 1 of their last 4 matches, and that was against a Newell's side that has won only 1 of their last 10 games. Their most creative player is out with an injury, and their #9 couldn’t score to save his life right now. They are entirely dependent on individual brilliance from Leandro Paredes. They are facing a Racing team that, despite a shaky start, has secured 2 consecutive wins and has a consolidated manager who knows exactly how to play these types of \"Clásicos.\" Racing is the more balanced team here.\n\nRosario Central vs Talleres: Not much more to say about Rosario Central—we’ve backed them several times and they are a powerhouse at home. I’m taking the double chance (1X) to secure the parlay. They are playing against a weak Talleres side that has only won against lower-division teams in the Cup recently and has looked very poor at the start of this tournament. Central has a high-quality squad and often gets the \"benefit of the doubt\" from the referees when playing at home.\n\nAs always, manage your bankroll and BOL!!",

That’s two game spreads in a row, let’s try to make it three! That also brings up 150 POTD wins!\n\n \n\nNext Pick: **Toronto Raptors -9.5 vs Brooklyn Nets @ 1.91**. 3U play.\n\nIt might surprise you to hear that the Nets have lost 4 out of their last 5 games by 16 or more points. They are also 1-9 SU this season and will continue to be without their primary scorer, Cam Thomas. This squad doesn’t really have a playmaker and doesn’t really have a scorer, two things that are kind of important in this sport. The Raptors meanwhile coming off a loss against the 76ers, a team they typically struggle against, but they had 4 wins prior to it, covering their spread in each of those. With Jakob Poeltl returning, the Raptors are at full strength here and I think they’re finally starting to show some promise with their starting 5 getting some minutes together. Let’s go Raptors!",

      "text": "Record 3-0-3 ✅️✅️❌️❌️❌️✅️\n\nPrevious: **Celta Vigo v Barcelona: BTTS @1.45**✅️\n\nTodays POTD: **Stockport County FC v Wigan Athletic EFL Trophy: Stockport County DC & u3.5 goals @1.82**\n\nWith qualification still hanging in the balance in Northern Section Group A, Stockport County host Wigan Athletic at Edgeley Park on Tuesday in what’s effectively a knockout clash for both sides. Stockport sit second with three points — a win guarantees progression, while a draw might be enough depending on results elsewhere. Wigan, meanwhile, are winless and need a two-goal victory plus a Salford win to stay alive.\n\nDave Challinor’s men were humbled 3–0 by Luton at the weekend, missing a penalty and seeing red, but that blip shouldn’t overshadow their recent form. Prior to that, they’d won four straight, conceding just once, and they’ve been solid at home, unbeaten in seven at Edgeley Park. Stockport’s previous EFL Trophy outing was a 3–1 loss to Salford, but their earlier 5–3 win over Wolves U21s shows they can score freely when needed. Expect a more disciplined, controlled performance this time as progression is at stake.\n\nRyan Lowe’s side face a mountain to climb. They’ve lost both Trophy matches 2–0 against Salford and 2–1 to Wolves U21s and have only managed two wins in their last ten overall. Goals have been the issue, as Wigan haven’t scored more than once in any of those ten games. Their away record against Stockport is dire, with no win since 1982, and Stockport have made Edgeley Park a fortress this season.\n\nStockport have more momentum, home advantage, and scoring depth. Wigan’s lack of cutting edge and poor away form make it unlikely they can win by the margin they need. Stockport’s steady defense and Wigan’s goal struggles point to a low-scoring affair. Stockport are likely to secure progression with a draw or narrow win.\n\nBest of luck.",

      "text": "Record: 160-137, -0.89 units\n\nLast Pick: Antoine Ghibaudo ML vs Clement Chidekh (-122, 1 unit): Win\n\nTennis | Montevideo Challenger | 11:30 AM EST\n\nToday's Pick: Roman Andres Burruchaga vs Federico Agustin Gomez | **Burruchaga ML at -200 (BetRivers). 2 units.**\n\nWrite-up: Not sure how to feel about that pick. In terms of CLV, it was one of my worst picks ever, as Ghibaudo was pushed all the way up to +144 by the market before the match. However, it was somewhat redeemed by the result, as Ghibaudo came back from being an early break down to secure a 2-0 win. In general, it obviously wasn't the greatest play, and I think I should have been more careful about analyzing how the player (particularly Chidekh) had recently been priced by the market.\n\nSouth American clay has always been Roman Burruchaga's favorite surface, and he's shown that over the past few months. In 6 SA clay tournaments since the US Open, Burruchaga has captured two titles (with just one set dropped between them), and gone 6/6 in first-round matches. Here in Montevideo, his history is mixed, as he defeated Tirante and Guillen Meza to reach the quarterfinals in 2023, but suffered a tough first-round loss in 2024. Still, Gomez has only played one career match here in 2024, in which he won just two games in the first round against Gustavo Heide. \n\nGomez, a talented player who has consistently battled injuries throughout his career, has had a tough run as of late. Fede has suffered a tough third-set loss in the first round of three consecutive tournaments, despite none of the draws he faced being particularly tough. In general, a lot of Gomez's best results this season of actually come on hard courts, where his aggressive game can shine and his lack of fitness can be masked to some extent. However, that lack of fitness was actually brought to the fore in the first round of the US Open, where he actually gave Jack Draper a run for his money but ended up gassing out in the fourth set.\n\nI considered taking the 2-0 here, but I decided that I preferred the ML odds instead. Still, I think that Burruchaga has the game to dominate this one from the start. The sun will be shining, as temperatures are expected to climb above 28 degrees Celsius, and wind gusts will reach above 20 mph, which should have some impact on Gomez's signature serve and forehand combination. To me, someone like Burruchaga, who plays with heavy topspin and can extend rallies at will, is simply not the type of player Gomez wants to face right now.\n\nFor the odds analysis, we actually have a pretty good comparison match: both players faced off against Juan Pablo Varillas last week in Lima, and while Gomez was priced at around even money (3-set loss, 7.21 performance rating), Burruchaga's ML closed at around -333, which implies that he should be closer to that number in this encounter (he did indeed end up winning 6-3, 6-2, with an 8.27/10). Burruchaga was similarly priced in the next round against Alvaro Guillen Meza, who I believe is in better form than Gomez, although he ended up losing that in 3 (7.12/10). Finally, Teelo's model gives Roman a 70.3% chance of winning this, which is higher than the 67.43% implied by his ML odds. \n\nIf the market ends up hating this pick as much as my last one, I might have to take a break for a bit. However, I can't say I'm expecting that, and the combination of value and risk level makes this a 2-unit play for me.\n\nNote: The [POTD Capper Tracker](https://potd.lol), which you may remember from its Google Sheet days, is finally back in a cleaner, more robust website format!

      "text": "CBB record: 5-1\n\nLast pick: Western Carolina Team Total Under 58.5 ✅ \n\nEvent CBB: Kentucky vs Louisville 8PM Eastern Time\n\nPick: **Ortega Oweh Over 18.5pts** (-118 Fanduel)\n\nBack with another player prop. The UK/Louisville rivalry game is expected to be extremely high scoring. The Over/Under is currently 173 and opened at 169.\n\nOrtega Oweh is the returning top scorer from last years Kentucky team. Oweh cleared this 18.5 line in 7 of his last 11 games last season. Of those 11 games he cleared the line 7/8 games in which he played 26+ minutes. \n\nWith it being a rivalry game and spread being only 3.5 and an O/U of 173 i expect the high scoring and close game and can almost guarantee he will play those 26+mins. More like 32+ imo.\n\nAlso, Louisville just allowed 2 different guards for 276th ranked Jackson St go for 20pts & 22pts on a combined 60% FG. Another guard also went for 18pts in the same game. It seems like Louisville will struggle to guard the perimeter players against Kentucky.\n\nTake Ortega Oweh Over 18.5pts",

The reasons he managed to get 7 shots and to the foul line is because Brisbane's two imports were struggling bad shooting a combined 3/22 from the field, so he had to take over the offense. The poor shooting won't happen again, so we can expect his usage to drop, along with the fact that a new import guard is hoping to be active and should steal some minutes and FGA off him.\n\nBOL",

This season, he has covered this line 75% of the time. When playing alongside AD, this jumps to 83%. The 76ers rank 23rd in rebounds to opposing teams and are **30th** in rebounds to opposing PFs. **P.J. is also ranked 19th in defensive rebounds,** and the 76ers give up the 22nd most defensive rebounds this season. When P.J. plays for 30 minutes, he cashes **89%** of the time, and with this being a close game (spread is -1.5), I see him getting 7 boards EASILY.\n\nBOL",

These two teams are both in the top 10 for scoring defense. For Oregon, that's not too surprising, as the B10 isn't a high powered offense type league. But for TTU in the B12, that's pretty impressive where everyone scores a lot. I'm liking the under here because both these teams have solid defense. Neither is particularly elite in the red zone on offense either, so I'm expecting some of the long drives to end in field goals. \n\nFull disclosure, both these teams are both also in the top 10 in offense, so this isn't a slam dunk pick. TTU can easily score at will in the no defense league of the B12, so I don't think they'll find scoring as easy against good defenses like Oregon. Oregon has benefited from a somewhat easy schedule, and the few good defensive teams they've played, their offense wasn't as powerful. I think both these offenses will be facing the best defenses (or close to it) either have seen all year, and more than 50 points just seems unlikely to me. \n\nBOL to anyone who tails. Worst case is we lose and get to witness a spectacular shoot out! ",

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 6-19-3 *Happy New Year to those who celebrate today!! Turns out I couldn't catch a break even on the final day of 2025, footballing gods just had one more sucker punch in store. The Mariners had a positive result in the bag but once again, I guess I'm just not allowed to win POTDs as they ended up falling short to a last minute goal. No clue how this keeps happening, but if there's anything I'm sure of, is that I'm leaving this horrid trend behind. 2026 is the year of wins, starting today*\n\n**Last Five:** ❌❌❌❌❌\n\n**Event:** EFL Championship, Bristol City v Portsmouth, 10:00 am EST\n\n**POTD:** Portsmouth Win or Draw +110, 4 units\n\n**Write Up:** Bristol City are currently eighth in the Championship with 10 wins, six draws and eight defeats in the opening 24 matches. They enjoyed a strong festive period, claiming a 2-0 home victory over Middlesbrough before following it up with a 2-1 away win at WBA on Boxing Day. However, they were unable to extend that run in their final game of 2025, suffering a 2-1 defeat to Millwall. Langstaff’s late strike condemned them to a fourth loss in their last seven away matches, showing **they're prone to collapsing late** when under pressure. They now return to Ashton Gate, where they have *lost just once in their previous four home games (W2, D1).* Fear not, though. Portsmouth have gained serious **momentum in their survival push** by taking **eight points from their last four matches.** After beating Blackburn Rovers, they drew with Derby County and QPR before **edging Charlton Athletic in dramatic fashion, with Min-hyeok scoring a 97th-minute winner** (the opposite of what Bristol City tend to do). Despite that positivity, *Pompey remain without an away victory in nine attempts and share the league’s worst away record, scoring just seven goals on the road* and **this is why the line is so inflated,** but all that is needlessly reactionary imho.\n\nDespite Bristol City’s strong league position and home advantage, I still think backing **Portsmouth to win or draw** is the only right thing to do. While City sit inside the top half, their recent performances suggest vulnerability rather than dominance. They failed to build momentum after the festive wins and even at home, they've not been ruthless, **winning two and drawing one of their last four at Ashton Gate, but rarely putting opponents away early.**\n\nNow, let's take a look at the teams' profiles. Crucially, **Portsmouth’s defensive organisation and counter-attacking approach match up well against a Bristol City side** that prefers control and patience in possession. With **Bristol City missing several key options through injuries** (Mayulu, Vitek, McNally, Bird, Sykes and Williams), their ability to break down compact opponents may be limited. That opens the door for Portsmouth to frustrate, slow the tempo, and **exploit transitions or set pieces** (areas where they have been increasingly effective).\n\nTaking into account Portsmouth’s improving form, fighting mentality, and Bristol City’s inconsistency against disciplined sides, this one feels far closer than the odds suggest. A gritty away performance could easily yield a point, and if the game opens up late, Portsmouth are capable of seizing it. For that reason, I'm going with a cheeky **Portsmouth win or draw**. Feeling a disruptive type of game, not too high scoring, but not super low either, so sprinkling an Under 3.5 match goals sounds good to me, as does a BTTS Yes, but let's not make this any more complicated than it needs to be. I went in big on the final day of 2025 so it's only appropriate to start the year off with a bang too - dropping 4 units on this banger. BOL and let's watch some hungover Englishmen stumble across the field ☘️",

Liverpool are on a nice run at the moment, they are building momentum and have the talent and firepower to win this game 2-0 or greater and that's what we are betting on.

UCSB has the edge in guard play, ball security, and half-court execution. When Fullerton can’t speed teams up, their offense stalls which leads to long empty possessions and poor late-clock shots.\n\nThis projects as a controlled game where UCSB dictates tempo and consistently wins possessions.

After a day off, we're back with EPL action as 9th place Brentford host 13th place Tottenham. All signs point towards this being a high scoring match, and we're here for it. \n\nRicharlison has come into great form over the last few weeks. With 2 goals and 2 assist in his last 4 games. He also had two goals disallowed over the weekend due to offsides, so he has definitely been finding the back of the net. One of these matches was against Brentford a few weeks ago in the reverse fixture that ended 2-0 Tottenham. Richarlison has Tottenhams most goals on the year with 7, their 2nd place Goalscorer is their center back Van de Ven. Goals for Tottenham almost exclusively go through Richarlison. He has looked sharp and the stat sheet has been showing it. Much like our Calvert-Lewin play, this is a play to back an in form striker with great odds. \n\nBrentford have conceded the 9th most goals this season in the EPL with 24. They've only kept three clean sheets this season, and those were against Wolves, West Ham, and a very early match vs Bournemouth. Put in other words, they've kept one clean sheet in their last 11 matches, and that was against Wolves the worst team in the EPL. I do not expect Brentford to keep Tottenham out, and considering Richarlison's form and the fact that he is the team's leading scorer, I'm backing him to find the back of the net in this one.\n\nAs always, BOL and have a great first day of the year!",

In **9 matches so far**, they have scored in **all but one game**, totaling **16 goals** (an average of **1.78 goals per match**). Their most recent home games include:\n\n* **3-0 win vs West Ham** – 10 shots, 5 on target, 36.8% possession\n* **2-1 win vs Brentford** – 12 shots, 3 on target, 54.4% possession\n* **3-2 win vs Bournemouth** – 12 shots, 6 on target, 42.8% possession\n\nEven in draws (Aston Villa 1-1, Everton 1-1, Arsenal 2-2, Leeds 1-1), Sunderland consistently found the net, showing strong offensive consistency despite conceding goals in 4 out of 9 matches.\n\n**Manchester City's** away stats also support BTTS. They have scored in **8 of their last 9 away matches**, netting **18 goals** (average **2 goals per match**) and maintaining an attacking presence:\n\n* **5-4 win vs Fulham** – 11 shots, 4 on target, 43% possession\n* **3-0 win vs Crystal Palace** – 7 shots, 6 on target, 61.8% possession\n* **2-1 win vs Nottingham Forest** – 16 shots, 5 on target, 65.9% possession\n\nCity has conceded in **5 of their 9 away matches**, showing vulnerability in defense, especially against high-pressing or counter-attacking teams. Sunderland’s attacking consistency, combined with City’s defensive lapses away, increases the likelihood of both teams scoring.\n\n📊 **Key Numbers:**\n\n* Sunderland: 16 goals in 9 matches, scored in 8 of the last 9\n* Manchester City (away): 18 goals in 9 games, scored in 8 of last 9, conceded in 5 of 9\n* Sunderland scored in all draws (4/4), City conceded in 5/9 away games\n\nThis bet combines Sunderland’s home scoring form and Manchester City’s away attacking efficiency with a higher statistical probability of both teams finding the net.\n\n🍺 **If this one cashes, a beer is always appreciated:** [buymeacoffee.com/willjack](http://buymeacoffee.com/willjack)\n\n**BOL!!

Loving the value on this line considering the form Leeds have managed to pick up coupled with the fact they played 3 weeks ago in a match that ended 3-3 with Leeds 5 SOT. Now we're in the reverse fixture and I'm expecting a similar performance. Also, with a terrible Wolves side putting up 4 SOT against Liverpool on the Weekend, I find it hard to believe Leeds won't follow suit.\n\nEver since rumour came out that Daniele Farke's job was under threat, Leeds haven't lost a game. They're unbeaten in 5 games (2 W, 3 D) and put up a great late performance against Mancity in a 3-2 Loss. \n\n**---**\n\n**Leeds' SOT last 10 games: 6, 8, 4, 5, 5, 4, 5, 3, 2, 5**\n\n* Leeds have hit over 2.5 SOT in 9/10 of their last games. \n* Line has hit for 8 games straight.\n* Averaging 4.7 SOT per game (very good considering this includes 3 big 6 teams)\n* Dominic Calvert-Lewin has scored for 6 games straight now (our best friend for this pick)\n\n**---**\n\n**Liverpool SOT faced last 10 games: 4, 4, 1, 5, 6, 0, 7, 6, 3, 8**\n\n* Line has hit in 8/10 of their last games\n* Averaging 4.4 SOT against per game\n* In Liverpool's last 5 Home games, this line has hit 4/5.\n\n**---**\n\n**After the 3-3 game between these sides a couple of weeks ago I see Liverpool looking to set things straight but with key players being unavailable, I see a similar story we've seen at Anfield this season. Dominate a section of play - the crowd gets anxious - the opponent gets a run of play - recycle. Liverpool heavy favourites but Leeds wont go down easy.**\n\n**BOL**",

      "text": "POTD record: 12-14-1\n\nDarts, 2026 World Championship 🎯\n\nPOTD: Ryan Searle ML vs Johnny Clayton @ 1.73\n\nRyan Searle has been playing phenomenal darts and hasn’t lost a set yet during this tournament. That’s 14 sets won, 0 lost. Obviously, he played against worst opponents, but he’s been overclassing all of them so far. Expecting he’ll outclass Clayton again today.\n\nHis opponent Clayton has been feeling a little off during this tournament and could be called lucky to even win against Harrysson in his last match. He hasn’t shown the level, form, or consistency of Searle yet. I’m happy we're getting good odds and confident in taking Searle ML @ 1.73\n\nBOL!",

He was granted a leave of absence starting on Sunday and that’s the last we’ve heard. If he remains on his leave, then it will probably be Leevi Merilainen in goal. He has been abysmal for the Senators. I don’t see a world where the Senators can be favored if he starts.\n\nRegardless of who the Senators goalie is, neither are on the level of Logan Thompson this year and the Capitals are the better team. The Capitals are in a little bit of a slump and they’re on the second half of a back to back, but they are the better team here and I like them at + money, even if we find out Ullmark is back.\n\nGood Luck and Happy New Year",

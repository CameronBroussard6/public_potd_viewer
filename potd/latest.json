      "text": "**POTD Record 39-35-1**\n\nEasy easy winner. Should have expressed in my post that this was my biggest bet of the year so far. I just did not understand how Philly was on -5.5. This game was over at half time.\n\nAs much as I want to run it back attacking BKN, I see another game that is almost identical to my last play. Targeting another team that I think really stinks.\n\n**Bucks -5.5**\n\nI am not going to lie, I think I have been looking for a game to target the bucks after making them my play against GSW a few games back, where Giannis got ruled out (after post made), and RYAN ROLLINS went the fuck off. I liked this bucks team going into the season, and trust me I did not factor this guy into the equation at all, however now I for sure am.\n\nThis Buck’s team has a shot to win the East this season, and I truly think Giannis is motived to play meaningful basketball late into the season. Games like this are key to run up the score, rest the guys in the 4^(th). If you have not noticed already, one of my main angles in betting NBA is targeting bad teams in bad spots and in bad matchups. Not always the case, however this game just sticks out to me. Indy, is IMO one of the bottom 2-3 teams in the league this season\n\nLook, I love what they did against GSW the other night, and a big fan of the underdog energy. I respect teams that are taped together at the guard spots and still fighting. I get it. Indiana is in full “nobody believes in us” mode right now, and usually a team I am pulling for, but not one I am putting my money on. Let’s be serious, Indy’s missing so many players…. They’re basically running an NBA game without an NBA backcourt. Siakam is balling out, but outside of him, nothing impresses me especially with Mathurin out.\n\nMeanwhile Giannis is dominating, averaging 34/13/7. Probable to play tomorrow, which I hope doesn’t happen (made bucks POTD the other night prior to Giannis being ruled out. Still won bcz my new favorite player ROLLINS). The Bucks are putting up 123+ a night. Top five in the league in scoring and top five in made threes (15.5 per). The Pacers are scoring 112 a night, and that’s with Pascal Siakam doing everything, including bringing the ball up and pretending to be a point guard. That 11-point per-game gap from avg ppg, and we are getting this at -5.5.\n\nCan Indiana hang on the glass? Yeah. They rebound like crazy, and Milwaukee’s actually been soft on the boards to start the year and are losing the rebounding battle so far this season (avg 40rbs & give up 44rbs). That’s the only thing that scares me, the ugly, grindy, foul-heavy version of this where we’re sitting at Bucks +4 with two minutes left and sweating free throws.\n\nBut if this game even halfway opens up? If pace gets normal? Milwaukee is just way more talented, way healthier where it matters, and way more organized offensively. Indiana doesn’t have the guards to actually trade buckets in the halfcourt with a team that’s throwing Giannis (AND ROLLINS) at you plus hitting 15+ threes a night. Lets get a streak going after 2 easy winners the last two.\n\nPS: Wolves -8.5 vs BKN. Like I mentioned at the top, this game is begging me to bet it. BKN on a B2B. Enough said.",

He makes up for the loss Friday.\n\n \n\nNext Pick: **Myles Turner (Bucks) O5.5 Rebs @ 1.82**. 3U play.\n\nLike this spot here for Myles playing his former team, the Indiana Pacers. I expect him to be more aggressive on the glass, and this contest is expected to be a high pace, high scoring and relatively close game. All of these work in favor of the Bucks big man getting over this modest total. The Pacers give us the 4^(th) highest rebounds to Centers, and in all their games so far, the big men have exceeded their respective rebound lines, which is not a surprise since the tallest Pacer is 6'9 (Myles is 6'11 for comparison).",

Neither team returning much production in the scoring department. I think Bradley has a big size advantage which should show throughout the game and Bradley wins 80% of games decided by 5 or less points which I see this game being like that.

      "text": "Record: 154-135, -3.51 units\n\nLast Pick: Henry Bernet ML vs Thiago Tirante (+172, 1 unit): Win\n\nTennis | Knoxville Challenger | 2:30 PM EST (estimated)\n\nToday's Pick: Antoine Ghibaudo vs Saba Purtseladze | **Ghibaudo ML at -185. 1 unit.** \n\nWrite-up: Bernet closed at +128, so we got some solid value on that pick. He ended up playing a great match to win in straight-sets and move one step closer to qualifying. I wanted to back him again against Jan-Lennard Struff, but the odds honestly seemed pretty fair (he ended up losing but narrowly covering the spread). \n\nAntoine Ghibaudo comes into the Knoxville Challenger, which is held at the University of Tennessee's indoor venue, ready to make an impact. Ghibaudo plays his best tennis on fast courts. In July of this year at the grass-court Hall of Fame Open, he made an amazing run from qualifying to the quarterfinals, where he put in an admirable effort against one of the most experienced grass-courters out there in Adrian Mannarino. More recently, he performed quite well at the indoor challengers in Lincoln and Sioux Falls, making the semis of the latter event with a win over Martin Damm. In contrast, Purtseladze is in extremely rough form this year. He's only had one good event all year, a Challenger title in his home country, and has struggled to find wins since. He had some injury issues starting in September, as he skipped most of the month and then was forced to withdraw from two different events in October. He did manage to score a win over Max Wiskandt last week in Charlottesville before getting absolutely crushed by Rafa Jodar, but that win (9/9 BPs saved, 6.79 performance rating) wasn't overly convincing. Saba was also priced at 3.50 in that match, and I don't see why his odds should be so much lower here - Wiskandt isn't a bad player, but he hasn't exactly been lighting it up this year. \n\nOverall, I feel that Ghibaudo has the more dynamic and aggressive game right now. Purtseladze does possess a big, heavy serve, but he's been looking a bit flat-footed recently, and has a bit of a weakness of the backhand wing. Ghibaudo's backhand is actually one of his stronger attributes, and so I feel that he can capitalize on that. I will say that I wouldn't take this past around -190, as these odds aren't quite as good as they were at opening (where this would have been a 2-unit play). Nevertheless, I believe that there is still enough value left to play this. \n\nNote: The [POTD Capper Tracker](https://potd.lol), which you may remember from its Google Sheet days, is finally back in a cleaner, more robust website format!

      "text": "POTD Record: 5-2 (+3.7U)\n\nLast Pick: Texans ML (-130) (1U) \n\n[Texans write up here](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/s/TxGYM1wk89)\n\n🤮🤮🤮what a disgusting fucking loss. 6 trips to the red zone, no touchdowns. CJ stroud gets hurt. Led the entire fucking game until the clock hits 0. The public cashed in big time and I couldn’t be more fucking sick. That’s life tho, and you know I ain’t losing two in a row.\n\nA loss like that is the reason your boy needs some damn therapy😂 \n\nEvent: Florida vs Arizona (7pm central)\n\nPOTD: Arizona +4.5 (-130) (2U) \n\n-everything is bet to win unit amount-\n\nWrite up: College basketball starts tomorrow baby! My best sport by far, and what better way than to have my second 2U pick since being on POTD (first one was rockets -15 last week and they won by 30). I love love love a good spot against the defending national champ in college basketball. I mean the public is gonna be all over Florida on the short spread of 3.5 (yes I bought to 4.5, sue me motherfucker). Look, this Florida team is going to have growing pains to begin, this is a completely new roster and they’re going to be traveling way out west to a place that’s very familiar to the wildcats, Las Vegas. Arizona fans are known for traveling well and the environment in T-Mobile Arena will be a home court feeling for UA in what is expected to be a sold out crowd. Arizona will be fully loaded again with four key returners in Jaden Badley, Tobe Awaka, Anthony Dell’Orso and Motiejus Krivas. Plus, Lloyd and his staff signed the No. 2 recruiting class according to 24/7 Sports. This is an early season game and guard play matters a lot, and veteran guard Jaden Bradley should be able to do enough to help will this team to a possible win. I truly do think this spread is a bit large even at 3.5, but I’m smashing a two unit spot so I wanted to give myself another leg with 4.5. Its been a very fun first week on POTD, I’m not gonna sit here and complain about a 5-2 record at all (although 6-1 would’ve been fucking sweet) and once again I’m blessed to be able to write another one for yall again… this is going to cash, and let’s get back on track fellas, cheers 🍻",

      "text": "Record: 18-7\n\nLast Five Predictions (Old - New): ✅❌❌✅✅\n\nNet Units: +25.44\n\nYesterday's Pick:  Naestved to win v FC Helsingor and o1.5 total goals. 3u @ $2 ✅\n\nNaestved scored within three minutes which was great. However there was a fair wait before the second goal which came in the 86th minute. \n\nHelsingor scored late into injury time. \n\n2-1 win. Happy days for us \n\nToday's Pick:  Mjallby to win at Varnamo and Under 3.5 total goals. 3u @ 2.60\n\nPick: I normally wouldn't go this high price-wise (if you want to be safer, you can just back the ML at about 1.50). \n\nMjallby have already won the league, and Varnamo are already relegated. \n\nSo in a way, neither have too much jeopardy in this game. \n\nIn their last game, Mjallby showed that they're not taking the rest of the season off. They copped an early goal last matchday and fought back to win 2-1. Plenty of teams would just half-ass that game... And tbh, not many would blame them. \n\nMjallby have been great away from home with a 11-2-1 record on the road. Well.... They've got the highest points total in league history, they've obviously been good.\n\nHowever, in those 14 games away from home only three of them have gone over the 3.5 goal line, and the last of those was early August. The other two were within their first 4 away games. \n\nEven in their home games, only two of those have cleared 3.5 goals. \n\nSo most of their wins haven't been complete goal-fests... Even against the bottom teams.  \n\nThis game they travel to last place Varnamo who have been dire this season. \n\nFor a team who are dead last, only having a -9 goal difference at home is somewhat tight. They've had a lot of draws at home which helps with this. \n\nOnly about 50% of Varnamo gone games have gone over the 3.5 goal t\n\nI think Mjallby win this, and I cant see them piling on the score. \n\nAgain, if you're after that extra safety, there's probably safer options in this match like just going the win. But for me the juice is worth the squeeze.",

Trey McBride enters this Monday night matchup on an absolute tear, having scored 2 TDs against the Packers and another vs the Colts. Even following Kyler Murray’s injury and Jacoby Brissett taking the reins of the Arizona offense, McBride has remained a focal point. And if the Cardinals want any shot at pulling off this upset, they’ve gotta feed him the ball.\n\nBesides momentum, another factor on our side is the defense McBride will be facing. Dallas LOVES to give up points, and in every game this season their opponents have put up at least 20. I expect the Cowboys to win a close shootout, but look for McBride to find pay dirt.

Hammarby, meanwhile, are in fine form offensively with an average of roughly 2.5 goals in their last six matches and over 2.5 goals seen in five of those. Tactical setups point to a high-intensity game: Degerfors will likely go with a 4-3-3 or 4-4-2 trying to be proactive, while Hammarby favour a pressing 4-3-3 with width and attacking full-backs. With both teams motivated—Degerfors needing points and Hammarby maintaining attacking momentum—the conditions strongly suggest a match with at least three goals.",

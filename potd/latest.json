While a lot will fall on Rivers, running back Jonathan Taylor is a big reason the colts have been able to score this season and I think that he will be able to get into the end zone and create the space for Rivers to move the ball downfield. On the other side of the ball Seahawks offense on the other hand has been a well oiled machine as we saw last game they put up 30 in a half. I expect the Seahawks to put up those numbers again and the Colts will push this game over with one or two scores.",

      "text": "NBA POTD 12-9\n\nLast Pick: Knicks -4.5\n\nFranz out and OG locking up Banchero, Suggs being amazing and injured like usual, the Knicks win by 12.\n\nTodays Pick: **Jalen Johnson over 9.5 Boards.**\n\nTLDR: Ranked 6th in Giving boards to PF, Had 14 Boards against Philly, Hit in the last 5/5 plus hes also a match up merchant like Murray.\n\nWrite Up: A lot of teams are following the formula of having your ball handler grab the rebound so you can run the floor immediately and get in transition which is evident with Atlanta and 76ers having a 142-132 Game score. Now I expect the hawks to chuck up a LOT of threes and to try blow by Joel Embiid, most teams have smashed the first quarter with 30 points in the first quarter, but dropping the ball in the later quarters leading to low scoring games. \n\nNow why is this important to note? THE HAWKS ARE MASSIVE NOW with trae young now out and its a home game. The 76ers have played against a lot of below .500 teams at home, making them look amazing, even then they nearly lose a 20 point lead to the starterless warriors. Now this is important as the Hawks are actually very talented and love to run the ball evident by being top 6 in pace. This will likely force the 76ers in an uncomfortable position to try and play at their speed, meaning a lot of contested or forced jumpers. Furthermore Jalen Johnson averages around 16.5 rebound chances a game, that is insane to put it into perspective he is ranked 18th who has more chances then Mobley, Ayton, Claxton, Davis, Poetl honestly I could go on, but you get the point. Atlanta is also ranked top 10 in limiting threes allowed, but ranked bottom 10 in paints allowed to score in the paint which is exactly where Joel Embiid does damage. Less threes means a better chance to fall into the Forwards/centers. \n\nJalen Johnson is a very winning player and honestly more willinging to get everyone involved then score himself, however the one thing he must do like Jokic, Luka and similar players is they must be involved whether it's getting the board, the assist or scoring.",

The Jaguars are currently playing their best basketball of the season, sitting at 8-2 and riding a 5-game home winning streak at the Mitchell Center. They have turned their home floor into a legitimate fortress, remaining undefeated (2-0) there this season while shooting significantly better in their own gym. The biggest factor in this game is pace and possession management. South Alabama ranks #1 in the entire nation in ball security, averaging just 8.0 turnovers per game. This is an elite metric that allows them to maximize possessions and prevents opponents from getting easy transition buckets. They are facing a North Texas squad that, while 7-3, has looked like a shell of itself away from Denton. The Mean Green are 0-2 on the road this year, where their offensive efficiency plummets and their turnover issues (11.7 per game, 210th nationally) become glaring.  \n  \nThe Jaguars are led by their dynamic scoring guard Adam Olsen, who is averaging 16.4 points per game and has been the catalyst for an offense shooting 46.9% from the field (top 120 nationally). Olsen is complemented by Chaze Harris, a slasher who is averaging 14.2 points and shooting an absurd 48.6% from the floor for a guard. This duo gives South Alabama the shot creation needed to break down a North Texas defense that holds teams to around 65 points per game. The issue for UNT is that they simply cannot score enough to keep up if the game hits the 70s. Their offense ranks in the bottom third of the country in effective field goal percentage on the road, and they rely too heavily on Je'Shawn Stevenson (16.0 PPG) to bail them out late in the shot clock. When you combine North Texas’s road struggles—losing their away games by an average margin of 8 points—with South Alabama’s elite turnover margin and home-court shooting splits, the Jaguars have a clear statistical edge in what should be a tightly contested game.",

Booker ended up not playing and this game wasn’t even close from the get-go. Thinking about ways I can be better with potential players sitting out and waiting closer to game time to lock picks. 3 losses in my last 4 is uncharacteristic and I apologize. Looking forward to starting a new streak after a few days break to regroup!\n\nEvent: New England Patriots vs Buffalo Bills NFL\n\nPOTD: Patriots Moneyline (+106) 5 units\n\nRationale: The pats have had a scorching season after a disastrous 1-2 start. Pairing Drake maye with Josh Mcdaniels and bringing in Vrabel to set the tempo of this locker room has made a world of difference to their attitude and approach toward games. Keep in mind Maye has yet to throw for 300 yards in a game but has been very efficient with the football and is step for step with stafford in the mvp race. They’re a fundamentally sound team reminiscent of the belichik days. With an additional week off with the bye week, I think this will be a hungry motivated team that will continue to set the stage for why they belong among the AFCs best. What’s most impressive about me is how complimentary their offense, defense, and special teams play. I expect Maye to have his first 300 yard game tomorrow, you know Diggs wants the W against his former team, and I think this will be an absolutely electric 60 minutes of football from the Pats.\n\nOther leans I like for tmrw include browns +7.5, chargers +6, cardinals +10, bengals +3, broncos Ml.\n\nJust to reiterate, in conjunction with my model, I use the eye test as well as my gut feeling to play what I believe is the most-valuable pick on the slate. Cheers to a great game, and please remember to gamble responsibly and to only wager what you can afford to lose.\n\nBOL!",

Brentford at home has been an amazing team, scoring in 6 of their 7 games, with the only non scoring game against City. Similarly, Leeds matches are always seeing goals, even against quality opposition (scored in all 5 previous games & 8/10 last games). Both teams will be looking to get points and stay clear from the relegation teams and will likely play attacking football.

The Panthers have all in the world to play for in this game after the Buccaneers loss on the Thursday Night Football and with a win here against the Saints it puts Carolina in first place of the NFC South and they get to face a bottom tier opponent without their starting runningback as the Saints will be without Alvin Kamara in this game. The Panthers are coming off a very solid win against a stout Rams team where they put up 31 points and forced 3 turnovers on defense. The Panthers are also coming off a bye week so they are well rested and have had two weeks to prepare for this road test against the Tyler Shough led offense. This Panthers team has been very productive on the ground this year with just over 125 rushing yards per game which is top 10 in the league while the Saints rush offense is quite the opposite ranking 28th out of 32 teams and also one of the worst scoring offenses in the league only averaging 15 points per game. Carolina is getting some key players back from the injured list as starting center Cade Mays is returning on offense for them and starting safety Trevon Moehrig will be back on defense for them. The Panthers also lead the Saints on the defensive side of things in rush yards per game, points allowed per game and turnovers per game so I like taking the Panthers in this one coming off the bye week as I think an extra week of preparation in a massive game for them will be a big benefit.\n\nPrediction: 23-17 Panthers\n\nLast pick: 🏈Navy ML/Washington ML💰Great second half from Navy and we got a no sweat from Washington!\n\nBest of luck to everyone tailing and remember to bet responsibly!

Regardless of how pitch is going to behave, I expect another high scoring match here with plenty of sixes being hit. India's top order will be under pressure and they will look to score big this time around. Shubman Gill especially will be under serious scrutiny if he fails again as he's the one taking the most underserved spot in the team. Surya would want to regain his form too. Although his spot is not under danger with World Cup coming soon, he knows he has to do better nevertheless.  Abhishek Sharma is yet to bring out the fire he has and this will be a good opportunity to do so and take the lead in the series. India does have plenty of batsmen who can hit big sixes. Hardik, Jitesh, Axar down the order. There isn't a single batsman in the team that is incapable of hitting a six. India can easily clear 10-12 sixes if they bat first if the pitch is decent enough for batting.\n\nAs for South Africa, they can go at it again and put India under pressure. They completely nullified Bumrah in the second match. They took advantage of the dew factor and India's bad bowling. India may not give another such chance here but I still expect South Africa to be aggressive and get a few sixes. De kock is back in form, Brevis can hit some of the biggest hits. Markram, Jansen, Stubbs, Miller, Ferriera. Mind you these are some of the best six hitters in world cricket and play around the franchise cricket all year. Indian pitches tend to be a bit more batting friendly than anywhere in the world, so naturally batsmen fancy themselves to hit big shots and play some nice strokes. \n\n\nThe only way this bet wouldn't work is in an instance where South Africa bat first and Bumrah bowls really well. Otherwise I expect sixes in both innings! Good luck!",

This is why I like betting on the top players on a team in games that should be close. MPJ torched the stat sheet again and dropped 34 points.\n\nToday's Pick: Las Vegas Raiders TT u17.5 v PHI, Puka Nacua o69.5 rec yd v DET, -149 on DK at time of writeup, betting 5u MAX BET\n\nThis is my biggest play yet. I can only play it for 5u here, but I’m playing it for even more than that personally. Let’s start with the Raiders. The Raiders are horrible. They are a completely dysfunctional team. They have no offensive line. 24th in red zone TD rate. 29th in plays per game. 30th in success rate. 29th in EPA per pass. Last in EPA per rush. Last in sack %. 29th in INT %. Last in PPG. This team is not good. To make things worse (better?), they are starting Kenny Pickett instead of Geno Smith. Most of his stats against DEN last week came in garbage time. This team has scored over 17 points one time since week 4, in that weird OT loss to JAX. They are playing PHI, a team also facing offensive struggles. However, their defense is very good. Held DET to 9, GB to 7. Their offense put them in horrible spots in their past 3 losses to DAL, CHI, and LAC. PHI on defense has the 4th best red zone TD rate, 7th best EPA per pass, 10th best success rate, 18th best EPA per run, and 9th best opp PPG. These numbers would be even higher if their offense wasn’t selling against quality opponents, and giving their opponents many extra possessions. This is a must have spot for the PHI offense. This is the game where they need to get something going on offense. They are playing at home for a crowd that is angry with their performance. Their defense is mostly healthy, except for Jalen Carter, who is obviously critical to them. Jalen Carter is not playing in this game. Jalen Carter did not play last week against LAC, who scored 19 points in regulation, despite Jalen Hurts throwing 4 INTs. PHI only allowed 1 TD in that game. I could see LV scoring 0 TDs this week. Even if they get 1, they would need 4 FGs to clear 17.5. If they get 2, they still need 2 more FGs. I don’t see any way that one of, if not the worst offenses in football can put up more than 2 TDs and 1 FGs against one of the best defenses, playing on the road against a motivated squad with a backup QB. Now, how vulnerable are we to bullshit, like a short field from a turnover or a D/ST TD? Well, I’m sure ball security is going to be the #1 sticking point of emphasis in practice this week after 4 INTs last week. LV is a middling team in INT %. LV hasn’t scored a defensive TD this year. LV hasn’t had a kick or punt return TD this year. Even if PHI has a dumb turnover or 2, they are good at stopping red zone TDs, and they should have field position advantage all game. I wouldn’t worry about some non-standard LV offense vs PHI defense ruining this TT under. There will likely be snow, it will feel like 10 degrees, and it will be windy. I feel very confident in this pick.\n\nNow, let’s go to DET v LAR. Puka Nacua is in a good spot to produce. We have a non-100% Davante Adams (who should still play). We have Puka, who has 70+ yards in all but 2 games this year: missing with 64 against SF and that weird 17-3 win over BAL. He was also dealing with an injury, but seems to be back to full form now, with 11 targets and 167 yards last week against ARI. Their safeties Kerby Joseph and Brian Branch are out. We have a very high total at 54.5. A lot of people I follow like DET in this game, both ATS and SU. This should be a close shootout. DET has the 4th best EPA per rush on defense, and 15th best EPA per pass. This points to another game where Stafford will throw the ball a lot. Last week, Lamb and Flournoy on DAL dropped 115+ yards each. Wicks and Watson dropped 80+ yards each the previous game. Wandale dropped 156 the game before that. Puka has 19 receptions of 20+ yards this year. His volume is returning to his pre-injury level. He is a physical player who can run through a DET defense that couldn’t tackle Jameis Winston on a trick play. Big plays, volume, Adams not 100%, bad and injured defense giving up big yardage to WR1s in recent games, high total in a potentially nailbiter shootout. Give me the Puka over 70 yards. \n\nCombine these picks, and we are at -149. I am very confident in these two alt line picks. Give me both together for a max bet. REMEMBER NOTHING IS A LOCK, bet only what you can afford to lose. BOL to all tailing. I'm about to go on vacation, so this will likely be my last bet for a few days.",

These two teams have already played earlier in the year on October 3rd where we saw the Patriots come away with a three point win in a relatively close game. The Patriots are currently 5-2 at home versus the Bills away record being 3-3. Admittedly the Pats only two losses on the season are at home, however this happened at the start of the season and they are currently on a 10 game win streak. This 10 game win streak has been against arguably weak competition, however the bills have had a very similar schedule, playing against mostly struggling teams bar Tampa at the time who turned out to also be struggling. \n\n  \nNew England currently allow the 3rd fewest rushing yards in the league at 89.5 yards a game. This run defense should contain arguably one of the best running backs in the league, James Cook, contained which is a huge part of this bills offense. In their meeting in October, the Bills managed to rush for 118 yards which is above the average allowed by New England. However it is below their average of 157 per a game,. In this game we only saw Cook rush for 49 yards, which is far below his average of 121 yards a game. Josh Allen rushed for a majority of the yards and will remain a threat. On the flip side, New England has had their own struggles running the ball, largely due to a rotating cast of running backs due to injury, however in recent weeks their run game has improved through the breakout of rookie Treyvon Henderson. The Bills currently  allow the 5th most rushing yards per a game at 135.2 yards per a game. I expect with Rhamondre Stevenson back from injury to work in tandem with Henderson, similar to their most recent game against the Giants, to punish the run defense from the Bills and keep them honest.\n\nNow onto the passing part of the game. We see a quarterback battle between MVP Josh Allen vs MVP Hopeful Drake Maye. Maye has had a phenomenal season, finding large success in the air, currently boasting the 2nd most passing yards in the league behind Dak Prescot. While Allen has had a decent year himself sitting in 8th. New England currently sit in the middle of the pack at 206.9 passing yards allowed a game. The Bills however sit in second place at 171.8 passing yards allowed. Maye has found phenomenal form, passing for over 250 yards a game for 10 out of 13 games and hasn't passed below 200 all year. I expect him to keep passing it well, especially with recent news of the Bills best cornerback, Christian Benford, walking around in a boot (as of writing still questionable to play). This should allow either Boutte or Diggs more freedom in catching the ball as well as potentially allow Henry some easy catches should the Bills double team Diggs. On the flip side we see Josh Allen who although is putting up numbers in the air, has seen his fair share of turnovers, seeing 10 interceptions as well as a number of fumbles. He also has been inconsistent, either passing well below 200 yards or passing nearly/over the 300s. \n\n  \nThis game means a lot for both teams. The Bills are currently fighting to stay in playoff contention while the Patriots are in an apparent two way race for a bye week with the Denver Broncos. I expect this to be a close game and there is a significant risk to bet on, however given the playoff implications and the expectation of it being a good game, I cant pass up the opportunity. Given Drake Maye's recent form, the Pats success in recent weeks with the run game, as well as playing at home, I have to give the slight edge to the Patriots to eek out a victory. \n\nBOL, bet only what you can afford to lose",

Cloud 9 has played two matches so far and both showings have been subpar. Their first match vs G2 Minnesota they looked very lost on SND and Overload. They won both Hardpoints but the games were played close. They just played vs Surge and won 3-0. At first glance a 3-0 is very nice, but if you look at Surge's roster and how close the games were this was a very very bad showing. Surge to me is basically just an amateur team. They have Lqgend who just came over from halo and is struggling hard. The overall Surge roster does have pace but their lack of experience shows and will prove tough for them to find wins if any. That being said the little bit of pace that Surge showed was a struggle for Cloud 9 in their series, they kept the HP within 10 points, SND in 2 rounds, and Overload they won by one going into OT. Cloud 9's overall gameplay does not bode well for any team they play that has playoff potential. Looking at Miami Heretics they are off to a bad record being 0-2 but they are showing to have really good potential. This team has the skill to be in top 6 contention and have a superb core. Once Traixx starts getting reps this team will be a true competitor. Heretics are coming off a very close series to Optic who are the current #1 team and a decent series vs KOI. I'll give some leeway for the KOI series since they had very little practice and Traixx is new to their team this year. Although they got demolished in Game 1, they came back in SND keeping it close and were able to show good life on the 2nd hardpoint. Building on that series they went to 5 games vs Optic and showed that their Hardpoint has improved from their series vs KOI. They had a fairly good showing in the SND and showed massive improvement in Overload keeping it close vs Optic only losing 4-3 when last series was 8-0. With them being able to take both hardpoint maps off of Optic and keeping SND/Overload close it bodes really well for their match vs Cloud 9. Overall this team has really good pace and should be able to take this series. Each of their game modes has improved over their past series and with Cloud 9's subpar showing vs the bottom of the league this should be a 3-0 maybe 3-1.

Ravens face against the Bengals for the second time this season and despite being on the road and getting stomped last matchup, they are expected to win this matchup. Andrews originally got on the injury report for some glute problems but has been fully practicing and is expected to fully play this game. \n\nLets give some facts. Mark Andrews leads the Ravens in red zone targets with some estimates saying he gets nearly 1/3rd of them. He's been playing 2/3rds of the offensive snaps this season still taking top spot over Isaiah Likely who has also been out and about. Andrews also averages just under 3 receptions, and his line sits at 3.5 for this game. Plenty of opportunity to take one in\n\nBengals have the one of if not the worst scoring and red zone defenses. Not only that, they have given up the highest amount of touchdowns to tight ends at 15 this season, coming directly off a game where they gave up touchdowns to two different tight ends against the bills. Bengals tend to play zone 2/3rds of the time, an area which Andrews thrives in, though not at all bad against man coverage either.\n\nRavens touchdown total right now is sitting at 3.5. Honestly the stars of the show who are bound to fill those up are Derrick Henry and Mark Andrews, ready to bruise up an all time bad defense. If I had to pick any this game it'd be one of them.\n\nBOL everyone tails",

Forest comes in with more sporadic form going from wins to losses regularly.\n\nI think this line is too low; Tottenham has hit this, and many times easily, in their last 5 games. Forest sit 15th in the league, and while Tottenham sit 11th, we are only 4 pts from top 4. I expect Tottenham to be putting on the pressure and forcing corners and wouldn’t be surprised to see their total corners at 6 or 7+ by end of game.\n\nSince Forest are playing at home, I wouldn’t expect them to sit back as much as if they were playing away, and this should allow for the game to be a little more open which tends to make corners more common.\n\nBOL, and I will try to be around for more soccer picks in the future!",

The Rams run defense has been pretty solid ranking 11th in rush yards allowed per game, which may give Dan Campbell more of a reason to get Gibbs involved in the passing game. I think Campbell does like seeing Gibbs receiving the ball more now that he is the one calling plays. His target share has increased as well the past few games, and for Detroit to win this game, Gibbs is going to have to make some noise. \n\nI also think due to the fact that the Rams rely heavy on the passing game and the Lions pass defense is below average, the tempo of the game will be a lot faster which will increase the odds Gibbs gets targeted. **The Rams also rank 26th in targets allowed to running backs**, and with Gibbs being so elusive, if he gets past the linebackers, he could easily go for 40 in one play. \n\nBOL.",

Faze on the other hand hasn’t won anything all year and this is their first tournament final of the year. It’s really a Cinderella story and I expect Faze to put up a really good fight here so rather than bet on a 3-0 we will take a one-map buffer and if Vitality win 3-1 this bet will still cash.

The forecast for Chicago calls for sunny but temps will be around 12 degrees and gusts up to 25 mph. That’s the kind of cold/wind combo that makes passing efficiency and ball security worse, and it’s not exactly a friendly kicking environment either.  \n\nOn top of that, Cleveland’s offense is walking into this game banged up in key “keep the drive alive” spots. The Browns’ official injury report ruled out Jack Conklin and David Njoku (among others) and also listed Denzel Ward out, with more names on the report overall. It’s hard to love points when an offense is missing protection and reliable chain-movers, especially in those conditions. \n\nChicago also has a profile that can naturally help an under when they’re in control. They’re near the top of the league in time of possession (32:03, 4th), and that matters because fewer plays/drives is your best friend on a low total. \n\nThe “under script” gets even cleaner when you factor in how Chicago’s defense creates short fields the wrong way for the over. The Bears lead the league with 18 defensive interceptions, which tells you they’re opportunistic, and opportunistic defenses often force offenses into more conservative decisions in bad weather. \n\nThe one way this under gets wrecked is the obvious one: non-offensive points (pick-six / scoop-and-score) or a couple of short-field touchdowns that skip the “hard part” of moving the ball in the cold. That’s the risk you’re always taking here, but if this plays like a normal game, the weather + Cleveland injuries + clock-draining Chicago tendency all point the same direction.\n\nThat’s my read: low temps, real wind, and an injury-hit Browns offense make the under the most natural side. If you can shop around and find a better number, even better. Best of luck, only gamble what you can afford to lose. \n\n\\----- Statistics -----  \nMLB: 17-10-1 (2025) +15.38 units\n\nNCAAF: 3-4 (2025) -5.49 units\n\nNFL: 2-1 (2025) +2.17 units",

Osasuna did well to hold out for 70 minutes before the pressure eventually allowed Barcelona to get their breakthrough as they ended up winning 2-0. Had Barça scored earlier it maybe would’ve increased foul opportunities due to how deep Osasuna were but I can’t be mad.\n\nI had quite a few picks to choose from today but I’ve gone with this one as it seems to be the best value to me. Carvalho is predicted to start on the right wing against Estoril but has played left wing and attacking mid. He’s been averaging 1.1 shots on target this season in the league, clearing the line in 10/12 (83%) of those. In away games his average has been of 1.2 - covering a shot on target in all six and in his last 8/8 matches. With Joao being predicted to start on the right, Famalicao have been conceding an average of 1.3 SOT’s from his flank this season at home, conceding one in 6/7 games (yes I know I’ve just opened a can of worms with that). He’s pretty much nailed for 90 minutes as well and overall this price is one that screams value based on all factors even with the price coming down from the 2.50 it opened at.

Blau-Weiß Linz’s coach is under intense pressure to arrest their slide, and his predicted 3-4-2-1 aims to maintain width and offensive outlets despite defensive frailties and long-term absences like Anderson and Goiginger, which have disrupted defensive cohesion and wing play. Their form suggests they often keep games close early but fade after halftime, opening spaces and creating transitional chances for both sides. Rapid Vienna’s interim coach Stefan Kulovits has publicly demanded belief and a fighting mindset, stating that those not committed should “go home,” underlining his motivation to spark an urgent offensive reaction and reinvigorate his squad tactically after a poor run. Rapid also plan to control via a 4-2-3-1, but multiple defensive and attacking absences (including Dahl and uncertainty over Kara) force improvised defensive structures and reliance on creative midfield interplay rather than a settled shape. With both coaches pushing for attacking rectification, weakened defenses likely to be exposed, and recent trends showing space and goals once intensity increases, this match has tactical conditions that strongly favor over 2.50 goals.",

      "text": "POTD Record: 29-13 (+19.2U)\n\nLast Pick: Arkansas ML (+110) (1U) ✅\n\nWhat a great game. Brazille is him.\n\nEvent: Ravens @ Bengals (NFL) (12PM central)\n\nPOTD: Ravens +5.5 (alt line)/ over 44.5 (alt line) 2 leg parlay (-120) (1U)\n\n(Bet to win 1U)\n\n\nWrite up:\n\nRavens +5.5\n\nThis rematch is a perception-versus-reality spot. The public is glued to that recent loss in Baltimore, where the Bengals handled the Ravens at their place, and they’re piling on Cincy because it feels easy. Yet the market is still hanging Baltimore as a short road favorite—despite that home loss to this very opponent—which is a tell that the matchup fundamentals and power ratings lean toward the Ravens. Baltimore’s defense tightens in key spots, their run game controls pace, and Lamar’s legs stress a Bengals front that’s been leaky against sustained drives. Baltimore also profiles as a classic bounce-back team: they win in the margins (field position, penalties, situational calls), and they’re built to travel with a physical identity that holds up outdoors in December. +5.5 gives us protection against early swings and late-game chaos while aligning with the deeper signal the number is sending. The public can have the Bengals; the favorite on the road is there for a reason—even after that home loss. Baltimore still averages 5.6 yards per play to the bengals 6.3 yards per play allowed and the raves have a 37% third down conversion rate to the bengals 47% rate allowed. Derrick Henry and co have also averaged 5.2 yards per carry and the bengals are near the bottom of the league in yards per rush. Let not forget the ravens also turned it over a ridiculous 6 TIMES on Christmas including a fumble in the endzone resulting in a touchback which completely changed the course of that game. And the total still reached 46 despite these stalled drives which brings me to my next point…\n\nover 44.5\n\nThis total sets up as a game-state mover. Both teams have paths to explosives: Baltimore can create chunk plays off play-action and quarterback runs, while Cincinnati forces tempo through its passing game and red-zone aggression. The Bengals’ defense has been vulnerable to breakdowns at the second level and coverage busts when forced to defend extended plays; Baltimore can punish that with designed movement and layered route concepts. On the other side, Cincinnati’s offense isn’t shy about pressing downfield and is capable of quick-strike scoring, which naturally lifts possessions and snaps. In a rematch, you also get built-in adjustments—more scripted answers early, more fourth-down aggression late, and fewer conservative punts (especially with two teams with little to lose)—which tends to add points. Dropping the total to an alternate 44.5 captures the volatility and raises the floor: even if one offense stalls for a quarter, a couple of explosive drives plus short fields can still push this over the number. The bengals have also allowed a ridiculous 26 points per game over their last 3 and 31 per game on the year compared with a league low 61% allowed red zone scoring percentage for touchdowns. And the ravens did allow a ton of yards to the Steelers last game despite holding them to multiple field goals. But I’m not so sure the bengals will be settling for as many in the red zone tomorrow.\n\nThe ravens are favored for a reason tomorrow and I like getting them over 5. And I believe this will go over 44.5 comfortably.\n\nLet’s continue our streak. As always, cheers 🍻",

The last time the Hawks got embarrassed like that against the Wizards, JJ came back with 24 R+A in the following game. \n\nSecond, 76ers give up 3rd most rebounds to the PF position so far this season. Although they don't rank quite as high in assists given to opposing PFs, they do give up 8th most assist to opposing teams overall, many of which should go to JJ as ATL's assist leader. \n\nThird, this should promise to be another close game, so blow-out threat is limited. \n\nI should caution that in their only matchup against PHI this season, JJ did cover the line but only because the game went to OT (had not yet covered by end of regulation). However, now playing at home in a bounce-back spot, I'll back the trend on JJ's R+A line.",

Please, forgive me father, for I have sinned… now that I got that off my chest….\n\nTomorrow, Lukas Wenig feels like a really solid pick here, especially with what he’s put together this year. He’s had a proper breakout stretch in 2025…quarter-final run at the Grand Slam, some strong Euro Tour appearances, and a steady climb up the rankings that shows he’s doing it week in and week out, not just in flashes. His game has been sitting around the low-to-mid 90s, with doubling generally in the high-30% which should be plenty to get past the fist round at Ally Pally. He’s also been comfortable in short formats, which is huge in a best-of-five where you don’t get much time to settle.\n\nWhat really sells Wenig is how he hasn’t been panicking when things done go his way( gets broken, etc.. he scores solidly without needing to go crazy, and tends to take his chances when looks at a double come. On the big stage this season he’s shown he belongs, and that confidence matters a lot under World Championship chaos. If he turns up anywhere near his usual level, keeps the scoring ticking and doesn’t miss sitters, Wenig’s got all the tools to get the job done and book his spot in round two. And at plus odds I like putting 2 units down.\n\nAs always best of luck!

We have 2 teams trending in completely different directions. The Cardinals come into this matchup having lost 5 straight games & sit in last place in the NFC West. The Texans have won 6 of their last 7 games, including 5 straight & are battling for the divisional title in the AFC South, 1 game behind the Jags.\n\nNico has had 75+ yards in 5 of his last 6 games. He is averaging 100.4 yards over his last 5 games. In that span he has had 40% of Texans air yards (11th among WR’s), 27% of Houston’s targets (WR11), & has averaged 2.66 yards per route run (4th among WR’s). Arizona’s defense runs Cover 3 & Cover 4 over 50% of their snaps. Collins has lit up those coverages for 2.6 yards per route run. Arizona secondary is banged up missing some key guys, with outside CB Max Melton not practicing this week, as well as 2 safeties including Jalen Thompson. Arizona’s defense has a 51.5% success rate defending passing plays, 3rd worst in the NFL. Arizona ranks 27th in PFF's defense grade & 23rd in defensive EPA. In their last 5 games Arizona has allowed a 68.5% completion rate (3rd most in the NFL), 8.7 yards per pass (most in NFL), 8.7% TD rate (most), & allowed a 15.2 yards per catch to opposing WR’s (most). They just allowed Puka Nacua to go off for 7 catches for 167 yards last week. Arizona has allowed 2.60 points per drive over their past 7 games, 29th in the NFL. Now they face a Houston offense that is a home favorite with their highest Vegas total of the year (26 ppg), while Arizona allows 26.8 ppg (26th). CJ Stroud averages nearly 40 more passing yards at home vs away the last 2 years, his home/away splits are unbelievable. 2 completely different QB’s. This has naturally led to Nico Collins to performing better at home compared to away. Nico averaged 16.54 yards per catch at home, 3rd most among players with 20+ receptions. He has had 7 catches for 20+ yards at home in 5 games. On the road he averages 2.51 yards less at 14.03. In the CJ Stroud Era, Collins has averaged 5 catches for 84 yards at home compared to 4 catches for 66 yards on the road. He has been on fire lately, earning 10+ targets in 5 of his last 7 games. He had 121 yards last week & it could’ve easily been 180 if Stroud didn’t underthrow him on a deep ball. The Texans RB’s Woody Marks & Nick Chubb are banged up so that could also force the Texans to lean more heavily on Collins & the passing game in a crucial game for their playoff hopes. In a vertical offense vs a weak injured defense I think Stroud peppers him again. Even if the Texans take a lead, they’ve still continued to target him in the past. Arizona may even keep it close, they are 5-1 against the spread on the road (2nd) compared to a league worst 1-6 ATS at home. Arizona passes it the 2nd most in the league on 65.33% of their plays, while will lead to more Texans possessions. Houston is projected to run 63.5 plays this week, 3rd most in the NFL. They average 64.5 (7th most). This all benefits Collins. Think he may break 100 this game again.\n\n__Nico Collins over 73.5 receiving yards__\n\nAppreciate the love!

We're getting this play again at plus money and the odds are too good to skip. Haaland has had a monster start to the season, netting\n15 goals in 15 EPL matches.

With that being said to all the nice people on this sub I do apologize for the loss here. At the end of the day we're gambling, not generating free money. Not gonna trip over 1 loss. Anyways, to the important stuff...\n\n**Event**: English Premier League: Crystal Palace vs. Manchester City 6:00am PST\n\n**POTD**: Manchester City ML (-118) 2u\n\n**Write up:**\n\nManchester City started off the season pretty rocky but have finally found their form as of late. Coming off a massive 1-2 win over Real Madrid and a nice 3-0 against Sunderland on the weekend, City have been rolling recently. After the result of the Arsenal game today, City and Pep know that tomorrow is a must win game if they want to raise the trophy this year. City haven't been great away from home in the Prem this season, being 3-1-3. With that being said, 2 of the losses came against Villa and Newcastle who are third and fifth in home games this season respectively. City are 4-0-1 in their last 5 premier league games with a goal difference of +7. Palace have given City a lot of trouble the past few years but as someone who's watched all of those games, it was ALWAYS because of Eze. \n\nPalace have been deceivingly good this season, sitting 5th place as of now. With that being said, their only real competition so far this season was Aston Villa (before they got good again). Palace sit 15th in the table at home this season, with a home record of just 2-4-1 and a goal difference of +2. Palace are also missing quite a few key players (Muñoz being the most prominent) and I see Haaland absolutely thrashing that back line without him. Palace have only beat Brentford and Liverpool at home, two pretty poor teams this year. \n\nAssuming City start the same lineup they've gone with the last 2 games, their attacking threat will be too much for a Palace backline missing one of their best players. Assuming Haaland, Doku, Cherki, and Foden all start, I wouldn't be surprised if they score 3 or 4 against this Palace team. In their last 5 games away at Crystal Palace, City are 2-2-1. Again, this Palace team is very very different without Eze and I don't see them performing the same way they have in the past. \n\nBOL!",

Units: 1.47\n\nLast Pick: Under 137.5 points ❌️ Vinyl at Breeze || 1u at -115 on DK || 3v3 Unrivaled Basketball\n\nFirst loss of the year and a bad read from me. Vinyl went off scoring 81 points against Breeze with final score 81-66. Vinyl's Dearica Hamby and Rhyne Howard can go off at any point and last night was Howard's turn with 30 points and going 6-11 from distance \n\n**Today's Pick:** Phantom ML || 1.5u at -196 on FD || 3v3 Unrivaled Basketball 8:45 pm ET\n\nHive (1-3) are coming off a huge upset win against Rose (78-75). I saw Rose favored by 9.5 to 11.5 points before tip off. Despite getting their first win, Hive are still a shaky team with -47 point differential and have lost by at least 10 points in all their losses. Hive have allowed 2nd most opponent PPG at 77.25. The team shoots a lot (60.75 FGA per game) but have the worst FG% of 44.86% in Unrivaled. They have 2nd lowest 3PT attempts per game, worst 3PT% at 18.33%, and all this results in Unrivaled lowest 0.94 points per shot attempt.\n\nPhantom (2-2) on the other hand lead Unrivaled with 1.12 PPSA and have the highest FG% at 49.58%. They've limited opponents to 3rd lowest 66.5 PPG with opponents FG% at 44.59%. Phantom should be able to take care of business against this Hive squad and I'm taking the ML play. BOL",

The Patriots really did not impress last week against the Chargers, they were held down and if it weren't for the Chargers offense just completely stalling in the red zone that game would have been much closer. Remember the more experienced playoff QB here is C.J Stroud and I can see Drake Maye making some mistakes against an elite D. When a team enters the divisional or wild card allowing under 17 ppg they are 38-21 SU and 35-24 ATS since 2003. When they are underdogs in this spot they are 14-12 SU and 18-8 ATS. I actually have the Texans winning this one outright by 2 points. Shawn Smith will be the ref for this game, home teams are 55-60 ATS throughout his career. Even without Nico Collins I think the Texans can get the cover.\n\nBOL! Please react if tailing!",

      "text": "**POTD Record:**  107 – 70 - 11\n\n**Previous:**  Bills vs Broncos - Khalil Shakir Over 5.5 receptions – WINNING!\n\n**Recap:**  Shakir did not disappoint, despite the Bills’ heartbreak.  He had 7 receptions and could have gone higher.  What a talent and what a shame we won’t see him until next season. \n\n**New Event:**  NFL – Rams vs Bears & La Liga – Real Sociedad vs Barcelona\n\n**Pick:**  Luther Burden III - Over 2.5 Receptions + Barcelona Draw no Bet @ 2.09 (3 units)\n\nI skipped posting this last night as I did not have time for a proper writeup and the standalone odds were simply not enough to justify a pick.  However, I decided to make a small parlay on the safer side of things to boost the odds.\n\n**Leg 1 – Luther Burden III Over 2.5 Receptions (1.66)**\n\nWeather may be a factor in this game.  Forecast calls for 20 degrees F with wind which will drop temperatures into the single digits and a possibility of snow as well.  This will make things difficult for offenses to sling the ball around especially for the warm weathered Rams. \n\nEven though we have seen Chicago time and again pull off these miraculous comebacks to win games, I believe their luck may just run out today against the best offense in the NFC (Seahawks aside).  Regardless, the market has the Bears as 3 point underdogs and at home in a match where Caleb Williams will be throwing the ball probably more so than the Rams.  Chances are the Bears will be playing from behind at some point.  (Just FYI I was also considering the Rams ML at halftime as the Bears have proven to be a 2^(nd) half team.)\n\nThis is where Burden comes into play.  Instead of taking his yardage, I found some stats that make this a most compelling pick since he is one of Caleb’s favorite targets for short passes.  Caleb will no doubt be under pressure today.  Very similar to my pick yesterday where Shakir saw his fair share of the ball whenever Josh Allen was under pressure, Burden should easily go over 2.5 receptions.\n\nThese stats are just too good to ignore.  In the last 5 games, Burden has averaged 4.8 receptions per game and gone over 2.5 receptions in all 5 games.  In the last 10 games, Burden has averaged 3.8 receptions per game and gone over 2.5 receptions in 9 out of 10 games.  Good enough for me.\n\n**Leg 2 – Barcelona to Draw no Bet vs Real Sociedad (1.26)**\n\nI know these are short odds, but I am just using them to complement those from the first leg. \n\nThe spanish superteam Barcelona will be looking for their 12^(th) straight win across all competitions.  They are just 4 points ahead of their rivals, Real Madrid, in the chase for the league championship and can ill afford to drop points.  They are flying high at the moment and playing at another level.\n\nFor context, since the beginning of 2026 Barcelona has played 4 matches, 3 of which they won in shutouts.  The first against 5^(th) place Espanyol they won 2-0, then in the Supercup Semis they beat 8^(th) place Athletic Club by 5-0, last Sunday in the Supercup Final vs their archrivals Real Madrid they won 3-2, and just 3 days ago they beat Racing Club in the Copa del Rey by 2-0. \n\nReal Sociedad are 13^(th) in the league table and do not pose a major threat to Barcelona in any way.  They have one of the worst home records in the league winning only 3 of their last 9 home matches against lesser teams than Barcelona.  They have lost 4 out of their last 5 head to heads against Barcelona as well.\n\n This bet is for Barcelona to NOT lose vs Real Sociedad.  If they tie, its a push just on this leg.",

Bet 2.6u\n\nWriteup: This is a whacky one but I actually really like it given how both teams play. The Rams are clearly the better team, and yet the Bears always find a way to stay in the game. The Bears have had so many comeback wins this season that it cannot be ignored, even against the Rams. In the 3 game series with the Bears and Packers, the Bears went 2-1. In those 2 games, they had a grand total of 2 offensive plays where they had the lead. That is an absolutely insane stat and we will be using it as the basis for this bet. I think the Rams should have the lead at the half and throughout most of the game, but given the Panthers were able to keep it close with the Rams, I like having the Rams get a 3.5 point cushion at the half, but then have the Bears keep it just within 2 touchdowns for the whole game. Never count out Ben Johnson and his Bears. \n\nRemember to only bet what you can afford to lose, and BOL!",

Secondly, the weather favors New England. This will be CJ Stroud’s first snow game and “dome” teams have historically struggled in snowy outdoor playoff environments. Thirdly, Texans defense held Pittsburgh to 6 points last week however they were facing a non mobile 42 year old QB and that won’t be the case today facing MVP candidate Drake Maye. Yes, defense wins games in the playoffs but let’s not forget the Patriots have an elite defense as well. They just held the Chargers to 3 points. Not to mention Texans best WR Nico Collins will not play due to concussion last week. I can go on but all in all, give me the Pats who have the better quarterback, home field advantage, great on both sides of the ball, accustomed to cold snowy weather and line movement moving in favor of… Patriots ML\n\n👇\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7x2e7yfim4eg1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7bcad317173e490127c779c985d6e1a82a3fdb35",

Senegal have been an incredible side to bet on during AFCON, and I believe I am undefeated on my Senegal bets over the last few months. \n\nThis Senegal team is built for the biggest stage in Africa and they have had a truly stellar tournament thus far. After watching the Morocco match against Nigeria, I didn’t see the attacking power that I believe is necessary to topple this Senegalese squad. This will be a stout match on both sides, but I think that Morocco has earned extra love due to the fact that they are the home nation.\n\nGive me Senegal to bring an end to the home nation’s run in the AFCON, as the Senegalese lift the AFCON trophy!",

Collins, who averaged roughly five catches and eight targets per game during the regular season, was officially ruled out due to a concussion. This leaves C.J. Stroud with a massive volume of vacated targets that must be redistributed among the remaining pass-catchers. While defenses often focus their primary coverage on established veterans like Christian Kirk or Jayden Higgins, rookie Jaylin Noel is positioned to benefit as a high-efficiency tertiary option.\n\nThe line of over 1.5 receptions for Noel is particularly appealing because of his reliable role as a safety valve. Throughout his rookie campaign, he maintained an impressive 74% catch rate, hauling in 26 of his 35 targets. This efficiency suggests that if Stroud looks his way just a few times, Noel is highly likely to secure the catch. He has already shown he can clear this mark comfortably in games where he saw increased involvement, recording five receptions against San Francisco and four against both Seattle and Jacksonville earlier this year.\n\nStrategically, Noel’s usage in the slot makes him a prime target against a disciplined Patriots defense. New England typically prioritizes neutralizing vertical outside threats, which often leaves the underneath routes open for quick-hitting plays. As Stroud deals with the Patriots' pass rush, he will likely rely on Noel for \"hot\" reads and short-yardage conversions. Noel's recent performance also points toward an upward trend in his involvement; he was a key factor in late-season wins, including a three-catch performance against the Chargers that demonstrated the coaching staff's growing trust in him. I also think the Patriots will be leading most of this game. Combine that with a solid rush defense, the Texans and Stroud will have to throw the ball.\n\nBOL if tailing, feel free to send a little love my way <3\n\n[buymeacoffee.com/nextapplication](http://buymeacoffee.com/nextapplication)",

Both games were highly competitive and they only lost with a 1 goal difference. Also on the road they are doing well. In their previous 9 road games they only lost 2, which ended a 7 game unbeaten run on the road (6 wins, 1 draw). Again, those 2 losses came against Al Ahli and Al Ittihad, which were close games.\n\nAC Milan is also in great form. They are undefeated in their previous 19 Serie A games. This means that out of the 20 league games they have played this season they only lost once (the first game of the season). In the other games they won 12 and drawed 7. At home they have 6 wins, 3 draws and 1 loss.\n\nLecce is on a 5 game winless run (1 draw, 4 losses). They are one of the worst road teams in the league. They only won twice on the road so far (2 draws, 5 losses). Moreover they are on a 4 game winless run on the road (3 losses, 1 draw).\n\nMilan also owns the H2H; AC Milan have won 12 of their last 13 home matches against Lecce in all competitions.\n\nAC Milan have scored at least 2 goals in their last 14 home matches against Lecce in all competitions.",

In that game Lyon received a red card in the 7th minute.

Let's dive in a little bit deeper though. \n\nLyon lost at home to PSG due to a 90+5 winner and to Toulouse due to 2 goals in the 87th and 90+6 minutes. These are their only home losses so far this season. \n\nLyon are very strong at home whilst Brest lose away from home more often than not and especially to \"bigger\" teams in Lens (3-1), Toulouse (2-0), Marseille (3-0) and Rennes (3-1) \n\nI expect Lyon to do the same to Brest today and feel confident in another win. \n\nBack to back green days. Love to see it and love to continue it for as long as possible. \n\nFade or tail, BOL!",

Jaylen shot damn near 50% with 30 FGA. He’s only had like four 40-point games all season, and that was one of them. It happens. Let’s bounce back here.\n\n\nI bet on Sharpe last night to go under, and it hit. I’m going back to it tonight as well. One of my favorite plays for this slate. Sharpe has gone under in 32/39 games this season… an insane 82%. 18/20 and 9/10 recently. In his last five H2H with the Kings, he is also 5/5.\n\n\nI don’t know if the bookies are slow to adjust this line, but it has been just a little too high all season. He’s hitting the under so consistently. Tonight he’s on a back-to-back, and he has yet to surpass 25 points during those games. Also, with everybody that is expected to be out or injured, he has gone under 8/8 times. \n\n\nHis matchup is against this Kings… who haven’t been great to say the least. They’ve been horrific, but they finally found something last week. They had some statement games versus reputable opponents in: Rockets, Lakers, Knicks, and (not so much) the Wizards. They won every game by double digits. All of those teams have some elite scorers as well. They were able to keep LeBron and Durant at 22/23 points(SG/SF), while not a single Wizard made it to 20. Last week, Sacramento allowed the 5th fewest points per game coupled with the ability to throw opponents shots off, allowing 45% of shots to be made against them (9th best in the league). Sacramento ranks 6th in defending the SG position. Shaedon Sharpe likes mixing some threes into his shot selection, which is going to be great since the Kings are defending the three incredibly well right now. Kings are only allowing 24.3% of threes to go in. That number is INSANE. They also just got Sabonis back, so that should help the interior defense if he looks to drive.\n\n\nKings should look to build upon their success and make a run here before all star break. Hard to tell if they are trying to make it back into playoff contention. Either way I cannot deny how good they’ve played recently and how their defense has stepped up. Let’s take the under 🥃.\n\n\nHopefully we get back into the win column here! As always, good luck, fellas. 🍀",

A win here pushes them into a playoffs spot.\n\n\\- Dender are mismatched. The worst attack in the league and the worst defense, but the catch here is that the defense isn't irredeemably bad, the belgian league just happens to have low quality gaps and they've only conceded 4 more than Zulte Waregem who are 9th in the league.\n\n\\- Another thing is that Dender are a little more redeemable at home. They're not a good team, but they're not going to get annihilated fully because they're a little reliable. In fact, it's 1.35 for Antwerp win or draw, which is decent odds considering this is efficient playoffs tier team vs. mismatched 2nd division team.\n\n\\- Bookmakers are strongly protecting the u3.5 line. Odds for it are 1.29, and under 4.5 is 1.09. Combine their confidence with this knowledge on why Dender can't win, and you have a very strong combo bet in X2+U3.5g or even the X2+U4.5g at 1.50 (which is high enough odds to be POTD eligible, but personally I'll risk it for the extra .28)\n\n**Antwerp win or draw, and under 3.5 goals**",

Been watching from the shadows for years, decided to start sharing some picks. I’ll be posting limited to Belgian football and cycling.\n\nLet’s get to it. Anything short of the title and promotion to the 2nd division would be considered a failure for Sporting Hasselt.\n\nThey came close last season and responded by strengthening an already very strong squad. Key additions include **Tibe Vanhaeren**, who was one of the most dangerous attackers in the league, and **Tuur Dierckx**, an experienced former Belgian 1st division player. Dierckx may be past his peak, but his experience is a clear upgrade.\n\nThe expectations do match reality. Hasselt sit **1st in the league** with a **+35 goal difference** and lead 2nd place by 3 points with two games in hand.\n\nNow Diegem. They’re newly promoted from the Belgian 4th division, and started the season with 4 straight losses, and while results have stabilized, the overall picture is still poor. Diegem are **second-to-last**, with a **-7 GD**, and **at home they’re the worst team in the league: -8 GD and only 5 points**.\n\nDiegem don’t look ready for this game. After the winter break, Diegem’s own coach admitted that **what he saw in training was alarming, saying that “if the players perform like this on Sunday it will be a disaster”**.\n\nHasselt have every reason and tool to make a statement here, especially in the first game after winter break.\n\nEdit: First time posting so still figuring out layout.\n\nEdit 2: Rewrote in my own words.",

In that game on Thursday, he had 29 PRA. And, during the 23 previous games this season (minus the Knicks game in December when he got injured 7 minutes in), he's covered 26 PRA in 21 of those games. I'm actually not sure if Wagner is a PF or SF, but the Grizzlies defense sucks either way. The opposing team's PF's average 37.72 PRA against them, and the SF's average 36.28 PRA.",

Only reason he did what he did was cause all eyes were on Collins. And I understand what they did to the Steelers offense but let’s be honest, the fire power on this Patriots team along with the coaching, is much greater. The Texans don’t have a strong enough run game to stay in this game for long. The Patriots defense also isn’t anything to brush over. They just came off a full on annihilation against the Chargers and I expect similar here. The Texans defense will make its presence known but it won’t be enough by the end of the game.

He let in 6 goals in his AHL warmup game on 28 shots so I believe a Red Wings team who can put 3.20 goals per game away on a A tier goalie will be able to bury 4-5 tomorrow. As for defending, Gibson has been amazing recently allowing just 1.79 GAA, if the Wings can stay out of the box they can secure an easy 2 points as they push for 1st seed in the Atlantic division while Tampa Bay has to play Dallas to get their points. You can play this without Raymond to get a point but if the Red Wings win I expect him to be a main reason of offense scoring 32 points in 24 home games, as well as their has been some odd OT's happening recently (around 1 of 3 games) per being part of hockeys randomness.   \n\n\nBOL!

I like going with New England in this one because this Patriots offense is extremely more efficient than this Texans defense. These Patriots rank higher in overall yards per game coming in 3rd in the NFL with 380 yards per contest compared to the Texans coming in 18th place with 325 yards per game, their passing game is more efficient ranking 4th in passing yards per game while the Texans rank 14th, their rushing game is much more effective ranking 6th in the league while the Texans rank 22nd in the NFL with a rushing game that can be stagnant at times and an offense that is 2nd in the league in scoring putting up 29 points per game while the Texans come in 13th place with 23 points per contest. In terms of offensive DVOA these Patriots rank 3rd in the NFL while the Texans rank in 19th place and these Patriots have a yard per play differential of +1.11 while Houstons yard per play differential is only +0.47. This Patriots team is also paired with a very solid defense as this Patriots defense ranks top 10 in most defensive metrics and they rank 9th in the league in passing yards allowed per game, 6th in the league in rushing yards allowed per game and 4th in the league points allowed per game only allowing 18 points per game. CJ Stroud did not do a good job taking care of the ball last game as he turned the ball over three times so I can see this Patriots defense forcing more turnovers out of him in this one and he will be without his top receiving target in this game as Nico Collins is out with a concussion as he leads the team in receptions, receiving yards, yards per catch and receiving touchdowns so I see that effecting their passing game in this one. I see the Patriots moving onto the AFC Championship game with a win here at home in front of their fans.\n\nPrediction: 26-17 Patriots\n\nLast pick:🏈49ers +14/Broncos +7💩I cant even believe this 49ers team beat the Eagles last week with how they played.\n\nBest of luck to everyone tailing and remember to bet responsibly!

Here's the catch in overtime, the rockets were leading by 25 and just completely choked in the last quarter. And guess who was responsible for it, Herb Jones and a legacy game from Saddiq Bae. This was also during the 5 game win streak at home, when they were on fire. Now though? Not so much.\n\nRockets on the other hand are a stinky team rn, but that's the best part. What else better for a .500 team who also is 13-3 at home to bounce back from. Also this match up is heaven for the rockets, they suck at threes and score mainly within the paint. Pelicans are one of the worse teams to guard the paint as Derrick Queen is a rookie center who isn't a 7 footer or rim protector and Missi is also not an amazing protector. Amen, Sengun and KD will absolutely eat this team alive and this team has always shut down Zion Williamson. With no defensive goat aka Herb Jones, I think KD and Sengun will be able to single handley win this game. If you really want to be safe you can wait for Tari Easen to be confirmed if hes in or out as well.",

      "text": "Record: 7-3, 3 or 4 game streak going on, either way, let's keep it going! \n\n\nLast pick: Kenneth Walker over 1.5 receptions, cashed in the first half \n\n\nEvent: Texans at Patriots \n\n\nPick: Treveyon Henderson over 8.5 carries (-120), 1 unit (always 1 unit) \n\n\nWrite Up: posted this in the Saturday thread like a moron. \n\n\nMost obvious evidence in favor of this pick is that he's gone over this total in 10 of the last 11 games. Henderson has come on in the 2nd half of the season, and the Patriots are using him more and more. \n\n\nI thought about going over on his 32.5 rushing yards total, but the Houston defense is amazing, and especially so in their last 3 games (only 71 yards allowed per game!), so I'm taking the attempts route. It's also supposed to be snowing all day in Boston tomorrow, and I think that makes for more rushing attempts but lower rushing averages. I may end up regretting it, but attempts seems more likely to hit. \n\n\nNew England ranks #6 in the league in rushing attempts per game with 29. Houston ranks #2 with 23 rushing attempts allowed per game. Part of that is winning a lot of games, which means the other team spends a lot of the game passing to keep up or in NE's case, they're winning and therefore run a lot. Even if they meet in the middle with 25 attempts, I think Henderson can easily get 9 of those. \n\n\nBetween the weather making more rushes likely and TH going over this number 10/11 games, I think it's a safe bet he'll clear. He's averaged 13 rushes per game the last 11, and I just don't see New England falling behind enough to abandon the running game (I think they win). Other than somehow getting blown out, I think TH gets his normal carries or even more from the snowy weather. \n\n\nTreveyon Henderson over 8.5 rushes.\n\n\nEdit for whomever does the tracker. Firstly, thank you! Also, this and all my picks are 1 unit. ",

Now Bryce Cotton has put up 25 plus points against Southeast Melbourne at RAC Arena in the last 10 games, and if he's going to do it, he's going to do it from the three-point line. So I’m backing him with good odds at 3 plus threes for the match. Now, Southeast Melbourne live and die by the threepoint shot. They have taken over 130 more three point attempts and have actually made 45 more three pointers than anyone else in the league. That's huge. But they come up against Adelaide who have the best opposition three point percentage in the league and also have\nthe best three point shooting percentage in the league. So it's why Adelaide have beaten them twice this season. They'll shut down their three point shooting which opens up the door for another prop in Zylan Cheatham. He's had 13 and 15 rebounds in the two games that he's played against Adelaide. He basically just sits underneath the rim and watches them miss their three point shots and cleans up the scraps. So 9 plus rebounds for Cheatum, which is his daily effort these days and shouldn’t be a sweat.\n\nWARNING !\nI HAVE BAD LUCK",

      "text": "Record: 175-140, +10.09 units\n\nLast Pick: Sebastian Korda -4.5 games vs Michael Zheng (-125, 1 unit): TBD\n\nTennis | Australian Open (M) | 9:50 PM EST (estimated)\n\nToday's Pick: Stan Wawrinka vs Laslo Djere | **Djere ML at -102 (FD). 1 unit.**\n\nWrite-up: Korda and Zheng are set to take the court in 5-6 hours, but I already have a new POTD for tomorrow, so I'll update my record when that one finishes.\n\nThere's no doubt that Stan Wawrinka will attract a big crowd at this year's Australian Open. The 40-year-old 3-time Slam champion recently announced that this will be his last year and tour, and he was granted a well-deserved main draw wildcard as a result. Wawrinka started the year well at the United Cup, as he was able to play multiple strong players quite close, but the best-of-5 slam format is a different beast. Different players decline in different ways as their careers wear on - some retain much of their endurance, but start to drop off in terms of agility and explosiveness, whereas some can still come close to their old level for a set or two but then drop off quickly after. To me, Wawrinka falls into the latter category. His last couple years on tour have been mixed, but one constant has been faltering as matches go to three sets and beyond. Since the start of 2024, Wawrinka has only managed a combined 7-21 record in matches that went the distance, several at the Challenger level. He has also gone just 2-6 in the best-of-five format in that span; both of those wins were more than a year ago, and they came against a nearly retired Andy Murray and an inexperienced Charles Broom. While Stan deserves respect as a former champion here in Melbourne, he has also lost in the first round in four consecutive cracks at this event (2025, 2024, 2023, 2021). \n\nOf course, it would only be fair to note that Djere has a 1-8 record in AO main draws, but he does have some more recent wins under his belt (Heide in 2025 qualies, Bergs in 2023 MD). Djere had a somewhat disappointing 2025 that was partly the result of injury disruptions, but he got this campaign to a solid start in Hong Kong, beating Ymer and Nava in qualifying. Sure, he proceeded to get smacked around by a resurgent Giron, but I thought his short price (+120) was a sign that the market has some newfound confidence in him. Djere's slightly enlongated groundstrokes are most effective on clay, but he his strong serve and flat backhand give him a decent floor on hard courts. He also won the most recent meeting between these two players in Belgrade 2024, at a time when Stan was making waves on indoor hard. The market has already pushed him down from a +114 opening priced in this match, and I believe it is for good reason. Djere's form is nothing incredible, and nobody expects him to make a deep run here, but he has the game, and more importantly the legs, to beat a 40-year-old in a grueling best-of-5 match.",

Matt Stafford has always relied on having a 4th option for safety reasons dating back to his Lions days, and in the recent development of the Rams offense, Park has been a piece of that puzzle: **A consistent enough 9.4% target rate - but he’s a very solidly targeted 19.0% in the red zone** - rates that shouldn’t deviate despite the return of Davante Adams.\n\nBears pass D? **25th in the league**.

Overall, a very bland performance by Madrid and I think the read was valid.

I really believe today is going to be the day my Barcelona fade strikes gold. Real Sociedad have really picked up their form, remaining **unbeaten in the last three LaLiga games** (including a draw against a strong Atletico Madrid side) and they'll be looking to cause another upset at home against Barcelona. The recent *H2H really doesn't look too promising with 4 losses in the last 5,* but they did record a 1-0 win in late 2024, while the losses were pretty bearable for the most part. **Barcelona didn't look too good against a second division side** in the cup a couple of days earlier and they're going to be feeling the effects of that game today - in fact, they're probably still a bit **fatigued from the Super Cup madness** and this all aids our case. I feel this match should stay fairly close with both sides finding the back of the net (here's your BTTS angle) and the Asian Handicap of +1.0 gives us some cushion in case Barcelona turn up. I feel a fine game coming from **Mikel Oyarzabal** in attack, as the Spain international has already registered **five goals and three assists** this season. Sociedad at home is always going to be a tough nut to crack so I'm feeling confident about this one and I want to end the week on a high - staking three whole units.

Alavés, on the other hand, struggle badly away from home: in 9 away games, they’ve managed just 1 win, 1 draw, and 7 losses.

Bologna’s coach Vincenzo Italiano has repeatedly spoken about his side needing to regain attacking momentum after a difficult run — they’ve shown signs of rediscovering their aggressive pressing and vertical play, but defensive lapses remain a concern, especially with Lucumí still out and rotation needed to manage fitness. Italian commentators note that Bologna’s lines are pushed high and that the team “has been playing with a short attacking blanket”, meaning they can be vulnerable on the break when possession is lost.\n\n\\- On the Fiorentina side, Paolo Vanoli has been vocal in Italian media about needing courage and collective effort to change their fortunes, emphasising that his players must be fearless (“bisogna tirar fuori il coltello”) and attacking even under pressure, which suggests a willingness to commit numbers forward rather than sit back. His recent comments also underline a psychological rebuild in the squad — trying to shake off fear and improve in both offensive and defensive phases.\n\n\\- Additionally, Vanoli will be suspended and not on the touchline, adding an unusual dynamic that often leads to less rigid in-game defensive organisation from Fiorentina in favour of attacking risk-taking, especially backed by a large contingent of travelling fans eager for goals.\n\n\\- Historically this fixture has produced goals (e.g., a memorable 2-2 draw with late Fiorentina equaliser), and with both coaches openly talking about attacking improvements while defensive issues linger, BTTS is strongly supported by tactical intent, motivation and Italian press commentary.",

      "text": "2026 record: 4-6 (-6.5 units)\n\n2025 record: 55-41 (+26.5 units)\n\nLast 10 (most recent on right):  ❌❌✅❌✅✅❌✅❌❌\n\nLast Pick: Jorge Herrando 1+ fouls committed vs Real Oviedo + Joao Pedro 1+ fouls committed vs Brentford ❌\n\nEvent: Australian Open R1 🎾\n\nPick of the Day: Francisco Comesana 🇦🇷 -2.5 games handicap vs Patrick Kypson 🇺🇸 5 units to win 4.2U @1.83 (Bet365)\n\nWrite-up: With the first grand slam of the season upon us I feel like it’s only right that I go back to my roots.\n\nThese odds would make sense to me if Kypson had come through qualifying and therefore adapted to the conditions here in Australia. However, he’s a wildcard and has had the same amount as preparation as Comesana (No. 68). The American is a decent challenger player (No. 116) with very little experience on the pro tour. He had a great end to 2025 going 20-3 and winning two titles. These are challenger events though (despite facing up against decent opposition just isn’t the same as ATP events) and were indoors. The courts this year, just like most years, are moderately fast but you can’t really compare indoors with outdoors too much. Kypson has the basics pretty nailed with a solid all around game but just misses that killer shot to bring him to the top 100. On the ATP tour, he played just one match last year losing to Landaluce in Cincinnati. He has played little BO5 action as well so physically I feel like it’ll be tough for him considering that grand slams are a different beast, playing just two and losing comfortably in both in the first round. Even including qualifying his GS record is just 2-6 on hard courts. Patrick is also 1-2 this year, losing to Nava and Mmoh in qualies of 250 events so it’s not like he’s been bringing his good fantastic form into the new year onto a stage that is closer to the pro tour. \n\nMeanwhile Comesana is a regular on the tour, having played a pretty full ATP schedule barring two challengers so has a clear experience advantage in a sport where it’s so necessary in terms of conditioning and tactically. Similarly to Kypson he prefers playing on clay with a strong baseline game but with a higher ceiling with his better movement, defence and most importantly experience should mean he takes care of business here. He may only be 5”10 but his serve is sneakily quite good (level with Kypson imo) and is generally just more consistent than his opponent of the day. Obviously not a world beater but a player who has room for improvement and a match-up that I would consider to be favourable to him as he loves dragging out rallies and Patrick isn’t a player who will overpower him to force errors, I expect it to be the other way around as the match goes on as the Argentine’s heavy topspin should weigh on the American’s flatter strokes in the long-term as they’re both more neutral players in their gamestyles. This year he’s opened with a loss to young star Shang, followed by a win over Royer (No. 57) and a competitive loss to Shelton (No. 8) so pretty promising for the play in my opinion. Francisco was “only” 7-10 on hard courts on the tour but picked up some decent wins over the likes of Munar, Opelka, Michelsen, Goffin. The big advantage apart from simply being a stronger player though is clearly his exposure to BO5 tennis, having played nine of these matches. On hard courts Comesana is 3-3 picking up big wins over Humbert (No. 17) and Michelsen (No. 28). His three losses were against Fritz (logical), a brutal 5-setter against Altmaier (No. 101) and a really close match against Norrie (No. 35) at the US open last year. \n\nEven if Kypson starts well I believe that his \nlack of top competition action will cost him especially with Comesana’s ability to make things physical so I strongly trust in him to cover the spread. My prediction is 3-1 to the Argentine. BOL !",

Both the Rams and Bears are here due to closing out games with a late touchdown and then hanging on for the win. The Rams beat the Panthers 34-31, after QB Matthew Stafford threw a TD with 38 seconds left. 5 of the last 7 Rams games have been 1 score games. The Bears also had a comeback after trailing 21-3 at the half & 21-6 going into the 4th qtr. Chicago scored 25 in the 4th with Caleb Williams throwing a 25 yd TD with 1:43 left, ending in a 31-27 over Green Bay. Their 18 point comeback is the largest in playoff franchise history. They have 7 wins when trailing with under 2 mins left in the 4th, most in NFL history. They avg a league high 3.46 points per drive in the 4th this season, compared to 1.96 points per drive in the first 3 qtrs (19th). This season, Williams is averaging 7.5 yards per pass (9th) with 11 TD’s & 2 INT’s in the 4th, ranking 8th in the 4th qtr rating (96.2) & 14th in success rate (42.3%). In the first 3 qtrs Williams is 29th in rating (84.8) & 25th in yards per pass (6.7) with 17 TD’s & 7 INT’s. The Bears rank #1 in 4th qtr points (9.6) averaging 17 in their last 3 games (1st), the next highest team in their last 3 is Houston with 12.7. But the Rams also have done well in the 4th in their last 3, ranking 3rd in points (11.7). The Rams are #1 in the NFL in ppg (30.7). The Bears are 9th at 26.2 ppg. Both rank top 3 in plays per game, averaging 64+. This game features 2 of the most explosive teams in the NFL. The Bears (14.4) & Rams (14.0) are 1st & 2nd in plays per game that gain 10+ yards. The Rams are 2nd in plays gaining 20+ yards (4.8), & the Bears are 4th (4.4). The Bears & Rams both have outstanding offenses. Chicago was 6th in EPA/play (0.07), 9th in EPA/pass (0.08), 4th in EPA/rush (0.06), 9th in success rate (45.24%), & 9th in yards/play (5.7). The Rams were 2nd in EPA/play (0.12), 3rd in EPA/pass (0.22), 11th in EPA/rush (-0.01), 1st in success rate (50.46%), & 1st in yards/play (6.2). However their defenses have been much to be desired. Chicago is 30th in DEF success rate (54.3%). They lead the NFL in takeaway rate per drive (17.2%), but they allow 2.69 points per drive (27th). In the Rams last 7 games, they’ve allowed 2.35 points/drive (23rd), a TD on 28% of possessions (25th), & 5.9 yards/play (30th). Before that, they allowed 1.52 points/drive (3rd), a TD on 14.9% of drives (2nd), & 4.8 yards/play (6th). Thru Week 11 the Rams ranked #1 in scoring defense. Since then they’re 27th, allowing 30+ points in 4 of their last 7. The total for this game opened at 50.5. But dropped down to 48.5 due to the weather. The forecast is predicting 18 degree weather & 20 mph winds. But both of these QB’s have actually done well in cold weather. In Stafford's 6 career games in freezing conditions he's avg 253 yards with 15 TD’s & just 3 INT’s. Last year in playoffs he played in a snowstorm vs an elite Eagles d & threw for 324 yards & 2 TD’s. As for Williams his QBR climbs to 103.7 in temps below 21 degrees. He has played in 3 games since week 15 in cold weather. In Week 15 it was 9 degrees, facing the #1 pass d in the NFL with a -0.088 EPA per drop back allowed, the Browns, who allowed just 165 passing yards per game (1st). He threw for 242 yards, 2 TD’s, avg 14.23 yards per completion, his 2nd most this year & the 2nd most passing yards the Browns allowed. He then went on to throw for 250 yards 2 TD’s in Week 16 & 361 yards 2 TD’s in playoffs vs the Packers in cold games. GB was the 7th best pass d before that game allowing 185 ypg. I’m not concerned about weather, this will be a shootout. \n\nIn his 1st playoff game, Williams threw for 361 yards & 2 TD’s. Williams has thrown multiple TD’s in 6 straight games. Now he gets a Rams d that allows opponents to pass on 59.68% plays, 8th most. Since Dec the Rams have allowed 9.4 yards/target (27th) & 51 open targets (27th) to WR’s. They just gave up 215 yards to McMillan & Coker. Coker is the slot WR. Rams captain Quentin Lake, a hybrid Safety/CB, came back from an elbow injury last game after being out since Week 11. Lake covers the slot, on 92% of snaps. He got TORCHED by Coker. He had 9 rec, 134 yards & a TD with a catch of 52 yards. The Rams d allows the 3rd most targets to the slot. Luther Burden ran 51% of his routes from the slot last week & had 3 rec for 42 yards on 7 targets. He has 3+ rec in 9 straight games. Last week Williams targeted the slot 16 times for 176 yards & 2 TD’s. Burden has been elite this year avg 2.7 yards per route run, 3rd in NFL. He avg 7.1 yards after catch per rec, 3rd. __Burden has 40+ rec yards in 4 of his last 5, avg 6.6 targets with a 29% target rate & a 23% 1st read rate.

TE Loveland is the only pass catcher with more targets, but Rams allow 2nd least yards/target to TE’s. \n\nThe entire world will know Luther Burden’s name after Sunday night.\n\n__Luther Burden o37.5 receiving yards__\n\nAppreciate the love!

Also brings up a 5 game winning streak for us!\n\n \n\nNext Pick: **Toronto Raptors -5.5 vs Indiana Pacers @ 1.93**. 3U play.\n\nWe bet on the Raptors recently against the Nets and will return to them back here. They have won 6 out of 7 games (both SU and ATS), their latest win against the Cavs yesterday. Their starting 5 are fit and have played a few games together now, with different guys stepping up each night. The Pacers are missing so many players through injury, they’re 1-11 for the season and have lost 5 in a row ATS. The difference in quality is just too high, and this game could be a very lopsided affair.  No need to overthink it here, let's just back this Raptors team that is on a solid run!\n\n*This line is available on FD, i'd play it to -7.0. Also, if you've made some money over this run, feel free to leave a tip:* [buymeacoffee.com/TheBrat](http://buymeacoffee.com/TheBrat)",

      "text": "Record: 50-30 (+39.6 units)\n\nLast 10 (most recent on right):  ✅✅✅✅❌✅✅✅❌❌\n\nLast Pick: England vs Serbia O3.5 total cards ❌\n\nEvent: Brazil Serie A ⚽️\n\nPick of the Day: Sport Recife +2.5 corner handicap (or +3 European handicap) vs Flamengo 2.2U to win 2U @ 1.90 (Bet365)\n\nWrite-up: Definitely the worst pick I’ve posted on here, at least there’s no more international football for a while. The league games are a lot easier and reliable to analyse so it was a mistake on my end to go for this play. England dominated the game as they’ve been doing under Tuchel, taking the lead through Saka in the first half before an Eze goal buried the Eagles late in the second. Kostić got booked late for a foul but that was the only fight Serbia really showed, as if they didn’t realise they’re out of the race to the World Cup.\n\nRecife were promoted to the Serie A this year following a 3rd place finish in the second division. This season has been a disaster though, sitting with just 2 wins after 32 games and a tragic 17 points amidst financial difficulty. They’re basically relegated (not yet mathematically but it would require them to win their last 6 the three teams in front of them to lose all so you get the point) so have nothing to lose. Flamengo are neck-and-neck with Palmeiras at the top of the league, only being second as Brazil implements a most wins system to settle points ties. Flamengo impressed at the Club World Cup (which was in the middle of their season) where they beat Chelsea and lost to Bayern in the RO16 in a pretty tight game.\n\nDespite Recife’s awful form, at home they’ve averaged 5.8 corners won + 4.4 conceded this season compared to Flamengo’s 5.5 won + 4.3 conceded on average in their last 20 on the road. Using recent form and all things considered I get an expected 5.2 Recife corners and 5 from the away team. That gives this play a 76% chance of winning. Yes the Mengão should control possession which is a concern for corners but remember this is Brazilian football, teams don’t just park the bus they’re constantly attacking. These two faced off just 2 weeks ago at the Maracaña and the line was cleared (9-8) despite the 3-0 win. Recife have also covered the line in 14/16 home matches this year (even having more corners than Palmeiras, Bahia and Mirassol who are make up the other 3 of the top 4), whilst opponents have in 14/20 against Flamengo at home so I really like this spot. BOL !\n\nI’m raising money for Movember, ALL proceeds will be going to a good cause. Donations aren’t expected but very much appreciated so if you have profited from my picks please do consider donating, a little goes a long way.

Prates comes into the fight following a highlight reel finish over Geoff Neal this last August and is riding a wave of momentum. Leon Edwards is on the other side of the coin after losing his belt last year and then getting dominated in March by Sean Brady. \n\nLeon Edwards has never been knocked out in the UFC but he’s never faced a striker like Prates in his lengthy career. Carlos Prates is a finisher who in every fight is looking to put his opponents lights out. In this week’s press conference leading up to the event, Prates vowed to be the first man to finish Edwards, As he did Neal in the summer. \n\nThese men are on different career trajectory’s and I expect the Brazilian to pressure Edwards and find the kill shot.

I avoided fading them last week mainly because I felt that the books started to inflate their spread too much as the line had gotten up to -21.5 for Oregon State to cover. Sam Houston State ended up sneaking a win out here in one of the weirdest games I've seen this year. Oregon State was up 17-0 at one point with the potential to go up 24-0 right before the half until they threw an interception with 1:20 to go in the 2nd quarter and Sam Houston was able to go into the half 7-17. Oregon State then proceeded to not score at all with a disaster class from their special teams allowing a punt return touchdown as well as blocked punt touchdown and the game ended 21-17 with Sam Houston State winning. Oregon State had 28 total first downs to Sam Houston's 8 first downs and Oregon State also had well over 300 more total offensive yards combined than them. Needless to say it's a miracle that Sam Houston managed to pick up their first win last week and I don't think Delaware will make the same mistakes as Oregon State. The only worry here is it kind of seems like Delaware plays much better at home as their only win on the road is against FIU but we only need the ML here and aren't on the -10.5 spread.\n\nFor the next leg we head to probably the best UFC card and title fight of the year. Islam Makhachev will face off against Jack Della Maddalena in Madison Square Garden. I'm gonna be honest since we haven't seen Islam at Welterweight before it's hard to gauge how he will do vs a guy who slightly bigger than him but off pure skill I will take Islam here. Jack is a high level striker but in my opinion I would take the wrestler over the striker most of the time. Jack managed to defend Belal's takedowns well in his last fight and force him to strike with him but I just think Islam is way more of a threat than Belal and will definitely manage to get him down and hold him down unlike Belal and actually be a submission threat. Islam also has more motivation here as a win here would help him secure double champ and set up a potential superfight vs Topuria. Not gonna overthink it and go with the guy who was pound for pound #1 before Topuria knocked out 3 legends in a row, BOL and bet responsibly.",

Injuries are manageable: the Gills are without Glen Morris, Conor Masterson and Armani Little, but their opponents Crawley Town are in far worse shape. Crawley arrive seriously undermanned, missing key players Danny Cashman, Harry McKirdy, Harvey Davies and captain Scott Malone, with an additional squad member away on international duty. Tactically, Gillingham’s physical and direct approach — especially at Priestfield — is well suited to exploiting Crawley’s weakened lineup and poor away record, with the visitors having taken only four points on the road. With higher motivation, clearer structure and the opposition stretched thin, Gillingham look the solid choice to take all three points.",

Their starting five hardly has any real minutes together this season, so the chemistry just isn’t there. Also plagued by injuries to key players (LaMelo, Green, Grant Williams, etc.). That weakens their offensive core.\n\n\nOKC is just the better team right now. Their rotation is solid, everyone knows their role, and they don’t really have any major chemistry issues. Hornets? Kinda the opposite. They’ve got injuries everywhere, their main lineup barely plays together, and the bench has to do way too much.\n\n\nStat-wise, OKC has the stronger defense and usually wins this matchup by a good margin. Hornets struggles to score consistently, especially without their full squad.\n\n\nBOTTOM LINE IS :\n\n\nOKC with extra rest has the stronger track record, better defense, offense , and way more lineup stability. Hornets also on B2B . \n\n\nOKC -10.5 \n\n\nP.S : Only bet what you can afford , its just gambling after all ( It can go wrong sometimes ).",

Poland changed their strategy and played through the left much more than the right. Bad read on my part, sorry friends. Bounce back day today. \n\nBack to our roots here, taking a high energy forward against a clearly stronger team. Kvaratskhelia plays his club soccer with PSG and wound up with a goal in his last match before this break. In his last 4 competitive matches with Georgia, he has two goals and is averaging 3 shots with 1 on target. Kvaratskhelia will chase any ball kicked his way and will With Georgia's main striker out injured, I see our guy taking a few shots, especially on counter attacks. \n\nNow to Spain. They've been nothing short of dominant in this World Cup Qualifier and have not yet conceded a goal. However, if one can fault them anywhere, they are giving their opponents opportunities on the road. With Turkiye firing off 13 shots (3 on target) and a very poor Bulgaria team taking 4 shots (2 on target),  Spain is not bulletproof on the road. Georgia also plays tough at home, having not been shut out since October 2024. \n\nMake no mistake, Spain should dominate this game. But I like rooting for underdogs and I like our guy Kvaratskhelia to land a shot on target (and maybe even find the back of the net) in front of the home crowd. \n\nBOL!",

      "text": "\nPICK OF THE DAY RECORD : 3-1\n\nRECORD ON YEAR : 3-1 (+5 units) \n\nPREVIOUS PICK : Jalen Suggs over 12.5 PA (+100) 2.5 U\n\nSUMMARY : Suggs was cruising against the sixers once he checked in late in the first and cashed before half I believe, if not early third. He did reach his high in minutes too which I was thinking he would get to 20 which was nice has he finished with 21. Great get back after the ugly Myles Turner pick. \n\nTUESDAY OCT 28 PICK OF THE DAY \n\nEVENT : BUCKS VS KNICKS (NBA 8:00 PM EST)\n\nJosh Hart over 11.5 RA +100(Hard Rock Bet) 2.5U\n\nI love this pick against the bucks as they have let hart clear this line in 5 straight. Hart himself has gotten 17 and 10 RA‚Äôs the first two games and went from 19 minutes to 29 the second game so I expect 30 plus. The bucks have let guards/forwards eat on the glass giving up the 12th most to forwards and 5th most to two guards. Hart plays 2-4 when he‚Äôs out there so that bodes we‚Äôll for his rebounds and he‚Äôs one of the best at his position. For the assists he‚Äôs been able to collect 5 and 3 with limited minutes so I at least expect 3 and his rebounds sit at over 6.5 at (-155) while the assists are at 3.5 at (-175 so mi love taking a stab at RA at plus money at 11.5. I‚Äôll also be placing a unit on a double double at +450 as he has done it the last two times he‚Äôs played them and finished with 9 boards the other two times. BOL!!",

      "text": "**1-0 | +10 units**\n\n**Previous Pick** - Marcus Mariota 25+ rushing yards + Rashee Rice ATTD -187 and -105 = +200 (5u) üí∞\n\nNice to win my first pick. The crazy amount of red zone targets and targets per route run from Rice‚Äôs debut last week, along with Washington‚Äôs major struggles against slot receivers, made the ATTD an appealing option despite the inherent high variance. I don‚Äôt usually go for ATTD for a WR, but the stats told me it was a very good idea here. Took until the 4th quarter, but it happened. Mariota scrambled quite a bit as I predicted, and the Chiefs rush yards allowed to QBs track record proved to be a successful indicator. \n\nI started off with a +200 pick and I‚Äôm going to go right back to another +200 pick now. Why not eh.\n\n**Pick** - Jaume Munar ML vs Daniil Medvedev (+200) 2 units\n\n**Paris 7:10AM EST**\n\nI like this based on value for a few reasons. \n\nMunar is having his best year on hard courts, and has done well on indoor hard (6-2). He performed great in Basel, beating Shelton and FAA ‚Äî top players known for their prowess on the surface. He was also very good in Shanghai earlier this month.\n\nThe courts in Paris are reportedly playing slow which I think should be an advantage for Munar. Munar is a clay specialist foremost, and slower hard courts can feel closer to clay and are favorable for him. \n\nMunar defeated Medvedev earlier this year in Miami which is one of the slower hard court tournaments on circuit as well. This was during a relative slump for Medvedev, and I don‚Äôt expect another easy two set win for Munar, but it demonstrates that he can defeat him on hard courts. \n\nMedvedev is notorious for his disdain for slow-playing hard courts. He‚Äôs called them a disgrace in the past, and his game is generally better suited to faster courts. He has a poor record in Paris too, never having advanced past the 2nd round of this tournament.\n\nMedvedev has played pretty well in the past month, so I‚Äôll only go with 2 units on this, but the value is there.",

They had a 11 pt lead at the half but were outscored in the second half by 88-51. Atrocious.\n\n¬†\n\nNext Pick:¬†**Mikal Bridges (Knicks) O22.5 PRA @ 1.82**. 3U play.\n\nBridges is over this line in 2 of 3 games this season. He‚Äôs been shooting efficiently and in Mike Brown‚Äôs system he has higher usage and more offense flowing through him. Forwards have found success against the Bucks this season, going over their lines more often than not. With KAT remaining questionable and the game expected to be close, I‚Äôll back the in-form Bridges to cover this relatively modest line.\n\n*This line is available on FD.*",

Both teams have had consistent perma bans so should be a very straight forward veto, paIN ban Train, B8 ban Nuke, paiN pick Inferno/Dust 2 and B8 pick Mirage which would be map 2.\n* B8 are one of the best Mirage teams in the entire world, despite being a tier two team they have consistently showed how deep/good they are at this map. Their stats speak for themselves which will show below.\n* Overall paiN aren't a BAD mirage team, they have had moments of being very good/strong on the map overall, but I think they are just wildly inconsistent on the map, especially since picking up DGT, which is shown with recent losses on the map to FUT and Virtus Pro, they beat GM 13-10, but GM are 20% winrate on Mirage\n\n**Mirage Stats:**\n\n* paiN are 50% winrate on 6 maps of Mirage, 13-13 record in 2025 on the map\n* B8 are 80% winrate on 10 maps of Mirage, 40-12 record in 2025 on the map\n* B8 are on a 4 map winstreak and have won 8 of their last 10, despite being a tier two team, they have beaten some huge names on Mirage recently including Astralis, FaZe, FURIA, and G2. Similarly when they played GM on Mirage (the team paiN won 13-10 against), they won it 13-3\n* Overall keep it simple, NPL is an absolute monster on Mirage, best player in the series on his best map",

      "text": "Record: 151-134, -6.83 units\n\nLast Pick: Patrick Zahraj ML vs Thai-Son Kwiatkowski (-125, 2 units): Win\n\nTennis | Charlottesville Challenger | 6:00 PM EST (estimated)\n\nToday's Pick: Rafael J√≥dar vs Murphy Cassone | **J√≥dar to win 2-0 at +125. 1 unit.** \n\nWrite-up: I felt like that was a solid pick, as Zahraj closed at -215. The first set was pretty up-and-down, as Zahraj had to fend off a set point on his serve, but he ended up closing it out and then winning the second in fairly straightforward fashion.\n\nToday, I'm going with Rafael Jodar to take down Murphy Cassone in straight sets. Jodar is probably the strongest college tennis player right now, and has already improved his ranking to the point where making Australian Open qualifying is all but guaranteed, leading many to suspect that he may not return to Virginia in the spring. Even with AO qualies locked in, Jodar still has plenty of reason to improve his ranking right now and try to sneak into some ATP events next year. \n\nThis summer, Rafa has already captured two Challenger titles (including one indoors) and made an additional two semifinals. He should be intimately familiar with the setting, as this tournament is actually hosted at Virginia's tennis facility, and I have no doubts that he'll attract the bulk of the crowd support. I feel that his game suits indoor conditions very well, as he plays with quite an aggressive style and loves to dominate with the forehand.\n\nMeanwhile, Murphy Cassone, another former college standout, isn't coming into this tournament with nearly as much confidence. He had a decent start to the year, but his form has dipped dramatically, with his most recent match being a concerning straight-sets loss to Mats Rosenkranz in Sioux Falls (5.43 performance rating). I honestly don't view Cassone as having a very high ceiling game - he doesn't do anything particularly poorly, but also doesn't really have weapons at this level. He's comfortable enough indoors, but his recent performances simply have not been confidence-inspiring. Jodar was recently priced around the same odds against Patrick Kypson in Sioux Falls, but there's a pretty big gap in form between Kypson and Cassone right now, making me feel that these odds are a bit mispriced. Sure, Rafa lost that match (6.17 performance rating), but that shouldn't be such a big factor in how the market is pricing this match. \n\nFor all of those reasons, I like Jodar to take care of this one in straight sets at plus money. \n\nNote: The [POTD Capper Tracker](https://potd.lol), which you may remember from its Google Sheet days, is finally back in a cleaner, more robust website format!

Morierense had an XG of 0.28, 1 shot on target and they scored in the 18th minute. Porto won but man that was tough. A losing streak has started, let's try kill it off fast. \n\nTODAYS BET \n\nEVENT/S = Real Sociedad VS Negreira AND Sevilla VS Toledo\n\nPARLAY BET =¬† (Real Sociedad VS Negreira Total Goals Under 8) AND (Sevilla Handicap -2) @2.01\n\nUNITS = 3U to Profit 3.03U\n\nSUMMARY = These games took a lot of time to research and decide on my parlay. Copa Del Rey round one's always have some mismatches. Let's talk about Sociedad first. I took Under 8 goals Total for the value of it. Sociedad are having a bad season and currently sit 17th in La Liga. They are having an alright season when it comes to home games winning 2 and drawing 1 but when it comes to away form they aren't doing well at all. They have lost 3 and drawn 2. Playing away against Negreira I do expect them to win but I don't think their form has shown any reason to think by more than 7. Personally i think it'll be 4-0. Playing on a worse pitch than they are used to, without their home support and while being in bad form it will be tough for them. \n\nNow onto Sevilla. Sevilla to win by 3 or more goals against a team from the 5th division of Spanish football is more than possible with the form Sevilla are in. Having a pretty decent season so far with the highlight by far being 4-1 against Barcelona. They are averaging 1.7 goals per game in La Liga. You might think Sevilla away would be similar to Sociedad having struggles and when it comes to the pitch this would be correct but when it comes to the league. If the league was just based on away games, Sevilla would sit in 4th. That's a big difference from 11th so their away form is great, winning 3 out of 5 games. I think Sevilla will easily clear this line.",

It‚Äôs early days but could this finally be their year? It‚Äôs not the prettiest football but is undeniably effective and limiting a giants slayer like Palace to just 1 SOT is impressive and has been the tale of their season. Time will tell. Anyways on the cards front not only did Crystal Palace not get carded but there were simply no bookings all match. Mr. Bramall once again proving to be extremely lenient on them as one or two challenges could‚Äôve definitely be sanctioned but I‚Äôm definitely not complaining.\n\nNapoli are sitting at the top of the league but it‚Äôs pretty close with just 3 points separating them from fourth to Inter Milan. They secured a big win against the Nerazzurri, needing to bounce back from their hefty 6-2 defeat against PSV mid-week. Lecce meanwhile sit just above the relegation zone in 16th counting just one win all season. Their goal this season will be to survive the drop once again having avoided relegation by the skin of their teeth last season. On the corners front, Lecce has averaged 5.3 corners and conceded 5 at home whilst Napoli has averaged 4 corners and conceded 4.6 on the road. In terms of playing styles that may alter the numbers, Lecce have been playing with width since appointing Di Francesco with crossing being a key part of their playing style - leading to more corners. Meanwhile Napoli like to control possession and attack through the middle which leads to less corners, especially with KDB‚Äôs absence which will lead to a big loss in creativity. Nevertheless I apply some pressure on Lecce‚Äôs numbers as Napoli are simply the better team. Using all factors I get a mean of 5 corners for Lecce and 4.5 for Napoli.\n\nThat gives this play an estimated 83% of winning which is exceptional value as I literally predict Lecce to have more corners (though the margins are tight). In fact, last season in this exact fixture the Giallorossi had 5 corners to Napoli‚Äôs 2 to crush the line.

Smokes him in the first setand broke him at 4-4 to win the set. Nothing much to say here. \n\nI was deciding between 2 plays from the Italian league or a tennis pick again. \n\nTodaya Pick:\n\nATP Paris: Ben Shelton vs Cobolli: Cobolli ML@1.85 ( i got it at 2.1 but the line is dropping fast)\n\nI‚Äôm going back to Cobolli here after he cashed for us in straights. These Paris courts are playing way slower than anyone expected,  the ball grips, rallies extend, and flat hitters are really struggling to hit through the court. That hurts a guy like Shelton way more than Cobolli.\n\nShelton still hasn‚Äôt looked right since the shoulder injury at the US Open. His serve doesn‚Äôt have the same pop and he‚Äôs been off-rhythm in rallies. he scraped by Majchrzak, then got handled easily by Munar and didnt look like he is at 100%. On a fast indoor court maybe the market makes sense, but here? Totally different story.\n\nCobolli‚Äôs game just fits better right now: great defense, makes a ton of balls, and forces opponents to overhit. He just beat Machac again playing confident, clean tennis and even pushed Sinner hard for a set. Momentum‚Äôs on his side.\n\nGiven the surface, the matchup, and Shelton‚Äôs form, I honestly think this should be closer in favor of Cobolli. The market opened with 2.2 for Cobolli and it keeps dropping. With long rallies expected and Shelton still rusty, Cobolli has a real shot to grind this out.\n\nGL on your bets",

They have an incredible record in the German Cup against lower-league teams, winning their last 15 cup matches against teams from lower divisions, which means they always take these games seriously and win by big scores. Energie Cottbus are only a 3. Liga team who are the leaders of the third division but the quality gap between them and a Champions League team like Leipzig is absolutely massive. Cottbus have not made it past the second round of the cup in their last 11 tries, showing they always struggle when facing better teams. \n\nIf you found these picks helpful, tips or donations are greatly appreciated as they support the time and effort I put into creating them: [buy me a beerüçª](https://buymeacoffee.com/hercules.son.of.zeus)",

I will be at this game as Kennesaw St is my Alma Mater & I live closeby, although I‚Äôve been a lifelong Georgia Tech fan. __It‚Äôll be a packed house at Fifth Third Stadium as Kennesaw St has a chance to get their 6th win & become Bowl Eligible for the FIRST time in program history. This is the biggest game ever for KSU football.__ It‚Äôs the last week we get Tuesday/Wednesday football action so I figured I‚Äôd fire up a writeup. Tuesday we have UTEP (2-5, 1-2 CUSA) traveling to Kennesaw St (5-2, 3-0 CUSA). __KSU is coming off a 45-26 road win over FIU, extending their 5 game win streak.__ They are 1st in the CUSA right now & are coming in hot. Let‚Äôs take a look at their last 5 games including each teams Sagarin rating (my most trusted analytical CFB & CBB rankings I‚Äôve used for years). Starting with the most recent game: \n\nKennesaw St‚Äôs Sagarin Rating #107:\n\nW21 @ FIU - #149\n\nW28 vs LA Tech - #103\n\nW8 vs MTSU - #171\n\nW7 vs Ark St - #108\n\nW14 vs Merrimack - #225\n\nKSU had dominant 20+ point wins in their last 2 games. LA Tech is a good team who is Sag ranked 45 spots better than UTEP at #103. FIU is ranked #149 which is right next to UTEP who is ranked #148. __Let‚Äôs take a look at UTEP who has lost 4 of their last 5 games:__\n\nUTEP Sagarin Rating #148:\n\nW18 @ Sam Houston - #207\n\nL11 vs Liberty - #120\n\nL19 vs LA Tech - #103\n\nL6 LA Monroe - #160 \n\nL17 Texas - #9\n\nUTEP‚Äôs only win came against an 0-7 Sam Houston. __But the biggest takeaway is UTEP lost by 19 to LA Tech. Kennesaw State beat that same LA Tech team by 28 the very next week. Sagarin‚Äôs analytical predictions has KSU winning this one 33-16.__ Having said all that, rankings aren‚Äôt everything. I just wanted to give background on these 2 virtually unknown teams.\n\nMitch Militello is in his 1st season as the Offensive Coordinator & QB coach at Kennesaw State. Militello came to KSU, reuniting with head coach Jerry Mack, after 4 seasons on the offensive staff at Tennessee working closely under UT‚Äôs HC Josh Heupel, specifically with Vols‚Äô QB‚Äôs. Last year‚Äôs horrible KSU team ran an option offense. Militello came in & immediately made an impact. implementing a Veer & Shoot offense. __KSU‚Äôs has their #1 offense in CUSA in EPA, the only one with a positive EPA. This new offense ranks 44th nationally in EPA & 27th nationally in EPA/Pass.__ Their offense very balanced with the pass & run, as evident in last week‚Äôs win where they produced 284 passing yards & 214 rushing yards They were on fire averaging 5.2 yards per carry & a whopping 16.7 yards per pass. Their offense is led by Wofford transfer Amari Odom. __Odom is a dual threat QB who ranks Top 10 in the NCAA in Completion percentage (70.8%). Odom is the best QB in CUSA with the highest QB Rating (69.1) & the 43rd ranked in the NCAA.__ Odom has excelled in the Veer & Shoot offense with 5 pass TD‚Äôs & 3 rush TD‚Äôs on just 1 INT this year. Odom popped up on the injury report this week & is considered day to day. Ever if he can‚Äôt go Tuesday night, they won't miss a beat with Senior dual-threat QB Dexter Williams under center. Dexter Williams has also been solid in substantial playing time, completing with 605 yards, 5 TD‚Äôs & 1 INT, while also adding two scores on the ground. A lot of their offensive success is due to a great offensive line. __KSU‚Äôs OLine has only given up 1.2 sacks per game, 22nd best in the NCAA.__ Out at WR they are led by 2 Senior studs. They have a lightning speed guy in Senior Gabriel Bernard. __Bernard has the most receiving yards in all of CUSA (495 yds).__ They also have a 6-3 monster in Christian Moss who‚Äôs averaging 15.9 yards per catch. They face a UTEP defense that refuses to get turnovers. __UTEP‚Äôs defense ranks T126th among FBS teams for INT‚Äôs this season with only 2. They are -8 in turnover margin 130th.__ They also can‚Äôt get any stops on 3rd down. __UTEP ranks 129th among FBS teams for 3rd down conversion percentage this season (31.4).__ Their defense struggles majorly against the pass. __UTSA ranks 120th in EPA/Pass allowed.__ KSU wins in the trenches & this team‚Äôs balanced offense that has scored 27 points in 4 of their last 5 games against better defense is going to keep it going this week. KSU‚Äôs defense has been hot as well.\n\nUTEP saw success against a brutal Sam Houston State defense last week, but I don‚Äôt expect that to continue against a stout Kennesaw State defense. __If you take away the outlier game where KSU played an unfair game vs Indiana, they have allowed just 15.5 points per game. That would rank 11th in the NCAA. On the season, UTEP averages 21.0 points per game, ranking around 122nd nationally.__ \n\nKennesaw St is #1 in CUSA in EPA (59th in NCAA) & is the only team in the conference with a + EPA margin (+0.037). UTEP is 2nd worst in EPA in CUSA, #131 in NCAA (-0.319). KSU has covered 4 straight games, and the Owls seem to be getting better with each passing week. KSU gets the biggest win in program history becoming bowl eligible and covers.\n\n*More writeup incoming*\n\n__Kennesaw State -9.5__\n\nAppreciate the love!

Porto (-1.0 &-1.5) Asian Handicap. 3u @ $1.54 ‚ùå /‚úÖ¬†\n\nLost half the initial stake as the first bet (-1) pushed, and the other (-1.5) lost. Unsure exactly how to write that on the ledger, but counting it as a loss because I walked away with less money than I put in.¬†\n\nPorto dominated possession but didn't create that many chances from it. Moreirense scored within 20 minutes, which wasn't ideal. Porto equalised just before halftime.¬†\n\nIn the second half, Porto dominated again, but didn't get the winner until the 88th minute. From there, it was unlikely they'd push the issue for a third.¬†\n\nToday's Pick: Thun v Winterthur. Thun (-1.0 &-1.5) Asian Handicap. 3u @ $1.87\n\nPick: Going with the Asian Hanidap again on Thun.¬†\n\nNewly promoted, but currently in first place, Thun hosts last-place Winterthur in the Swiss Super League.¬†\n\nThe Swiss Super League has started tight, with every team losing at least two of their opening ten games. Thun's two losses so far have been to Young Boys and Basel, who are two of the best teams in the league.¬†\n\nThun's two goals a game is the second-best in the league, and their 1.3 goals against are the third-best in the league.¬†\n\nWhile I don't expect them to win the league in their first season back in the top flight, they've looked good so far.¬†\n\nMeanwhile, Winterthur are 0-1-4 in their five away games in the league, copping seventeen goals in those games. In fact, in Winterthur's ten league games, they've conceded 30 goals, which is the worst in the league by 11 goals.\n\nI like Thun at home in this match.¬†",

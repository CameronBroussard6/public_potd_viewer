If that’s the case, this will be the 4th time these teams and goalies have matched up this season. In those games, the total goals scores is 9, 7, and 5. \n\nIn the last month, Saros has been averaging 3.35 goals against and under .900 save percentage. The last game he gave up less than 3 goals was against the Blackhawks on 1/10. The o5.5 goals has hit in 7 of the last 9 Predators games.\n\nAt this point, the Blues season is over and while Hofer is the better goalie, he doesn’t have a lot to work with. He had a pretty good GAA of 2.69, but in his last 2 games, he gave up 4 goals each. The o5.5 goals has gone 4-0 in the Blues last 4 games.\n\nGood Luck!",

Both teams play open, fast and creative football at this level. Defensive structure is often secondary in youth competitions, leading to high scoring games. Recent fixtures from these sides have regularly produced five or more goals. Expect chances, mistakes and constant action. Over 4.5 goals looks excellent value here tonight. Confidence is high. Recommended selection. Enjoy the match.",

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 27-37-5 (Avg Odds +126)\n\n**Previous Pick:** Samuel Chukwueze 1+ SOT (+125)❌️\n\n**Today's Event:** English Premier League (Soccer) | Sunderland vs Burnley (12:00PM PST)\n\n**Pick:** Brian Brobbey 2+ SoT (+185)  1 unit to win 1.85 units\n\n**Write Up:** We've got one more Monday match to round out the EPL weekend as 11th place Sunderland host 19th place Burnley at the Stadium of Lights in a battle of teams who were promoted this season. A win here for Sunderland puts them in 8th place and, believe it or not, this newly promoted team is in striking range of European football for next season. Burnley are fighting for their lives at 11 points from safety, at this point it will take a special run of form to pull themselves out of the bottom 3. \n\nBrobbey has been on a great run of form at Sunderland's first choice striker, scoring a goal in 3 of their last 4 matches. While his shot volume is not huge, he has a great SOT conversion rate on his shots. He's a willing runner, chasing everything sent his way and great both with his feet and in the air. He didn't take over as Sunderland's main striker until midway through the year, so while the numbers aren't huge, he has looked great over the last few weeks. \n\nI also like this play because Burnley concede the most SOTs in the EPL and it's not particularly close, at 140 so far this year. They also struggle against center forwards - recent notable matchups were conceding 2 SOTs to Ekitike on 6 shots, 7 SOTs to Sesko on 8 shots (2 goals), and 2 SOTs to Wissa on 4 shots. I think there's great value here given the data and current form of Brobbey.\n\nBOL and happy Monday!",

      "text": "‎**Record** : 5 - 0 ( +6.75u )\n\n‎***That's 5 in a row , Couldn't be Happier for my Campaign***\n\n‎**Prev Pick** : Dortmund ML + Ajax Over 1.5 Goals✅\n\n‎**POTD** : ( Serie A & Primeria Liga)\n\n‎**Match** : Udinese Vs AS Roma & Casa Pia vs Porto‎\n\n‎**Pick** : AS Roma DC + Porto Over 1.5 Goals\n\n‎**Start Time** : 14.45PM & 15.45AM EST\n\n‎**Odds** : -126 (1XBET)\n\n‎**Units** : 1.5U to win 1.19U\n\n‎**Writeup** :\n\n‎First off, **Roma** are straight-up owning this fixture. ***Last 5-6 meetings? All Roma wins***. They beat these boys 2-0 at home back in November, and before that it was the same story , Udinese can't buy a result against us. Head-to-head is brutal: **Roma have won like 9 out of the last 12 or something stupid**. Udinese haven't beaten us in forever.  No crazy risks here Roma might not blow them out, could be a boring 0-1 or 1-1 if Udinese park the bus, but they don't lose this. Their attack might miss a couple guys, but they still have enough to nick it or hold firm.\n\n‎Now for **Porto ** First, head-to-head is a massacre. Porto's unbeaten in like 10 straight against Casa Pia  **won 9, drew 1, and they've smashed them plenty***. Last meetings? **Porto 4-0, 2-0, clean sheets galore**, and Casa Pia barely scores ***(they've got like 3 goals total across 8-10 games vs Porto)***. These boys just can't handle the Dragons Porto owns them. Second, Casa Pia are in the mud right now. Sitting 16th, just scraping above relegation, **winless in their last 4, and leaky as hell at the back – conceding 9 in recent games or whatever the stat was**. They've got one of the worst attacks too, **third-fewest goals in the league**, so they park the bus but it doesn't hold vs top sides. Porto are league leaders or right up there (18-1-0 form vibes), smashing away games, and their attack is clicking versatile, quality everywhere, they grind or blow teams out when they get space.\n\n\n‎\n\n\n‎Lets Make it 6 in a row !!",

      "text": "Record: 42-24-1\n\nSoccer\n\nLast Pick: Aston Villa to win @ 2.14 ❌\n\nLast Pick Write Up: Very frustrating game. Brentford got a red, then immediately scored. Second half, Villa scored… but the goal was disallowed, and that’s it. This ends our streak. I even added 0.5 units at half time because I didn’t believe they would bottle this against Brentford with a red card.\n\nI also had BTTS as a hedge lmao.\n\nNow for today..\n\nPick: Sunderland to win @ 1.8\n\nWrite Up: Burnley will probably be in a fighting mood. However, Sunderland are undefeated at home with 6 wins, 5 draws and 0 losses, while Burnley are very poor away with 1 win, 2 draws and 8 losses. \n\nNo gigantic injury list here like in the Villa game. Let’s bounce back, boys!",

      "text": "AS Roma @ 1.97 - €300.00\n\nLast 5 > WWLWL // Profit: €4,498.04\n\nRoma is the 3rd best away team in Serie A, they are 7-0-4 on the road. Udinese at home are 14th and have a 3-4-4 record. In the H2H Roma hold an 8-1-1 lead in the last 10 games and have an 6 game winning streak ongoing. At the stadium of Udinese they have won 2 straight and in the Serie A Roma are on a 2 game winning streak when playing away. Managerial H2H in favour for us (2-1-0).\n\nSince this is still Serie A though, I would recommend staking wisely... random ahh stuff happens here.",

Bilbao 1 - 1 Real Sociedad\n* Pick: Real Sociedad to win @ 3.68\n* Comment: Real Sociedad was winning until they got a guy sent off with 10 min left to go, and ended up conceding 5 minutes later. Not off to a great start.\n\nToday's pick:\n\n* Event: Casa Pia - FC Porto\n* Pick: FC Porto corners over 7.5 @ 2.5\n* Comment: There has been a massive storm in Portugal, which has completely decimated some cities in the center of the country. Casa Pia's stadium has been affected by the storm, and the pitch won't be in the best condition. In Portugal, teams tend to resort to set pieces when there are no conditions to play \"normally\". Additionally, when Casa Pia is forced to defend at home, they often concede a lot of corners. FC Porto has also been very strong in set pieces throughout the season.\n\nBOL!",

I'm a Jays fan and Gausman had been great this postseason and we always need starters to go deep. 5.1 innings is very doable for him against a lineup that so far has been struggling.",

With a crazy looking court and costumes in the crowd, I think players will be pumped to step up and shine. And that includes Kelly Oubre. \n\nOubre has hit 2+ 3's each game this season, including three 3's in the insane come-from-behind win on Tuesday against the Wizards. Sure, Oubre struggled from behind the arc in the 2024-25 season (shot 29.3%), but he was also dealing with multiple injuries. He seems to have turned it around this year, with his 45.0% three point shooting percentage on the season helping propel the sixers to a perfect 4-0 record. I'll be riding with him, and hoping he delivers a treat on Halloween. \n\nTailing or fading, BOL!",

I. Sorokin is another goalie that is just giving up goals.  In his past 7 starts, he has allowed 4 goals in 5/7 matches.  The other two matches, one still got to 4 through an empty netter and the 1 game he didn’t give up 4 was to the Sharks.  Even though he wasn’t in between the pipes yesterday, the islanders gave up 6 goals.  Last match between the two teams, the capitals put up 4 against Sorokin.  They haven’t been effective on offense the past few games, but I’ll take my chances with the capitals at home on a few days rest versus this islanders team that has been getting pounded the past few games.  Good luck if you’re talking! Let’s win!!",

Marseille needed to win to take us to the money but a 96th minute goal meant the game ended in a draw. Tough luck for us, hope a few of you guys cashed out as the cashout I saw was 97% of the full amount. Onto today.\n\nTODAYS BET: Dortmund ML + Erzurum DC + Coventry City DC\n\n5u @ 2.39 odds \n\nEVENTS: Dortmund (Bundesliga) take on an out of form Augsburg who have won 1 from 4 homes games so far conceding the most goals out of any other side when at home. Dortmund are the much better side here. \n\nErzurum BB haven't lost a game so far from the 11 games they have played. Hatayaspor haven't won a game out of the 11 so I'm confident Erzurum can win the game let alone not lose. Especially considering Hatayaspor concede 3 goals per game on average. \n\nCoventry City - wow what a side this year. I wanted to tip this team alone as my pick with the ML but Wrexham have that Hollywood buzz about them that can rile them up at home. Coventry are yet to lose so far and will want to keep that run going. I don't see Wrexham being that team to beat them however, a draw isn't off the cards here. Coventry average 3 goals per game while Wrexham average 1. Take into account Coventry have not conceded 2 in the same game since there opening away game vs Derby (they won 5-3), I am confident in Coventry at least scoring 1. I can't see Wrexham scoring 2.",

He went 0/6 from three and had an uncharacteristically low assist output with only 1 assist on 11 potential assists. That’s a crazy ratio. Teammates let him down big time with that. But hey—first game of the season, and oh by the way, their coach was about to be arrested by the FBI the next morning. Might explain some things… some of those misses 🤣 We’ll put the miss on Chauncey. \n\nSince the Feds took down his coach, he’s been aces. There’s very little variance in his performances. They’re all clustered together like expertly thrown darts around the bullseye that is his 33.3 PRA average over this span. That’s an important indicator, when deciding on making this type of bet.\n\nDeni’s last game vs the Nuggets: \n\nMarch 21, 2025: 36/8/7 (51)✅\n\nHe has cleared 30+ PRA in every game he’s played at least 30 minutes in vs the Nuggets over his entire career. \n\nHe’s averaging 32 minutes this season, and should play at least 30 minutes and keep that streak going.\n\nAG has a perfect clear rate for 3+ 1st quarter points with 11, 4, 7, 4.

Love to see it.\n\nEvent: 🎾 ATP Paris — Valentin Vacherot vs Felix Auger-Aliassime\n\nPOTD: Felix Auger-Aliassime ML @ 1.56 — 3u\n\nVacherot has made it this far basically running on fumes. His match vs Norrie looked good on paper, but he survived only because he won every key point and saved 6/6 break points — not exactly something you can rely on every match. Don’t forget this guy was ranked around 200 in the world a few weeks ago and has never been a top-level player at 27 years old. Let’s not suddenly hype him just because he beat opponents who weren't playing great.\n\nFelix, on the other hand, is simply on another level. He's a legit top player, used to competing at ATP events week in and week out. With some big rivals already knocked out, this is a huge chance for him, and motivation won’t be a problem.\n\nQuality, experience, and physical level are all on Felix’s side. Vacherot is running on empty and will have to go all-out just to keep up — and I don’t think he can.",

The goal for the home team was nearly corrected by VAR again for offside and I might've flipped if that was the case 3 times in a row.. But it stood and that made the BTTS complete to end the losing streak! Lesgoooo!\n\n**Today's Pick:** ***Qarabag to win(1.32) + Erzurumspor to win(1.53) @ 2.02 -- 3 units***\n\n**Write up:**\n\nIt's Friday again and we are kicking off with an early Azerbaijan game once again.\n\n**Qarabag v Imisli FK**  \nThis time its Champions League revelation Qarabag. They can also go top of the league with a win against 8th place Imisli. The thing that is worth mentioning here is that Imisli had a cup game on Tuesday against a THIRD division side that they came behind in and eventually won 2-3 with a last minute winner. Now this must have drained more energy then they would have liked and they are now already facing the best team in Qarabag today. Now the fact that they struggled against a team that came last in the Azerbaijan second division last season and now play third division tells me enough here to be honest. But I looked further into them and 7 of their 12 points were received against teams below them, and if you regularly trail my picks you'll remember that in Azerbaijan the bottom 3 teams might as well have been playing a league lower as that is the quality of their squads. Qarabag have only allowed 3 goals against in 8 matches. Scoring 13 themselves. They are bound to be top of the league here after this win and motivation will be high.\n\n**Hatayspor v Erzurumspor**  \nA game here in the Turkish second division featuring relegated side Hatayspor. Now Hatayspor is far from promotion, in fact they are looking at another relegation battle. With a sad 4 points in 11 games, with big number losses amongst them they aren't competing this season. Erzurumspor won against a relegation battling side last week and will want to continue this form into today as they are in need of points because of their 7 draws so far this season. They've won against all bottom sides so far and I think they'll add another one to that tally.\n\n**Best of luck if tailing!** 🍀\n\n**PS:** If you want you can check my record and units won on [https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/OliveCritical5134-qXXxJZ](https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/OliveCritical5134-qXXxJZ)",

We got this line much better last game (4.5) but Embiid is building nicely and showing glimpses of his offensive best. If he is even slightly close to it, he should track at least at a point per minute and he should hopefully get 7 minutes of court time as he did 2 games ago. Embiid gets the Celtics who in my opinion simply don’t have the size to contain him for even 6 minutes. He will hopefully just play a post game with the size advantage he has and draw fouls, last time v the Celtics he shot at 3s early and it just wasn’t the way to go I think, so hopefully that’s corrected. I don’t tend to believe in “motivation” reasons as I think most elite sportspeople are elite because they are competitive consistently - but I don’t think Embiid playing poorly v the Celtics in game 1 of the season will 1) hurt this bet and 2) requires too much reading into. \n\nHe’s hit 9 & 8 last 2 games. His shot is falling and he is building minutes and usage. 7 & 6 minutes last 2 1Q. \n\nAs for food for thought/considerations of why you might not tail - it’s the same story as yesterday. He might get all the minutes & usage but if he gets cold he won’t hit on a streaky 1Q bet.\n\nEDIT: cashed out B365 bet ($1.86) and got on at Sportsbet (an Australian book which I don’t regularly use) @ $2.10 - I.e gone from -116 to +110. Time of edit is 1930 Friday AEDT, or 0430 New York time whatever timezone that is",

Both teams are looking to snap 4 game losing streaks and have had absolutely nightmarish seasons up to this point. Syracuse began the season with a promising 3-1 start before losing their starting QB to an achilles tear and they have yet to score more than 18 points in a game since. Meanwhile, North Carolina’s circus of misery comes to town after also failing to score more than 18 points during that stretch (6 points less than the age of Bill Belicheck’s girlfriend). \n\n\nThe key difference maker here is the recent form from each team. North Carolina lost a close one to an underrated Cal team and nearly upset a top 25 ranked Virginia team last week, while Syracuse has suffered blowout losses to both Pitt and #8 Georgia Tech. It might not look like it on paper, but these teams are going in 2 different directions. Ultimately on a short week I’m going with the team coached by a washed up superbowl winner facing a backup QB. BOL to those tailing, let’s do some winning!",

The Serbian superstar has opened the 2025–26 season with four straight triple-doubles, averaging 11.3 assists and 14.5 rebounds per game, along with elite creation metrics of 17 potential assists and 22.3 rebound chances per game.\n\n-With another all-around performance tonight, Jokic would be the first player ever to start a season with five consecutive triple-doubles, further cementing him as the league's most complete offensive engine.\n\n-Against the matchup, Jokic faced Portland three times last season, and he had a triple-double in one of them. In the other two, he had 8 assists with very good playmaking indicators, adding 13 and 9 potential assists, respectively. He was close in all three, just a few made shots from teammates away.\n\n-Though his NBA Cup record isn’t quite spotless (just 2 triple-doubles in 6 appearances), it’s worth considering that there’s a discernible pattern from the Nuggets’ coaching staff: Jokic stays on the floor into the third quarter of would-be blowouts to secure his statistical milestones. The consistency in minutes is a major plus for this prop.\n\n-In addition, tonight’s opponent should keep things competitive. The Blazers’ improved pace and offensive consistency mean Denver likely won’t run away early — ensuring Jokic plays his usual 33–35 minutes, plenty of time for him to rack up the necessary production across all categories.",

Part of me wanted to take the over 5.5 in this game. But the more I look into it it just seems a bit easy. The islanders are now 9-1 to the over and we’re seeing a line under 6. SKETCHY. Look here’s why, the capitals are one of the best defensive teams in the league right now. Allowing the least amount of goals in hockey with one of the best goalies in hockey with Logan Thompson. While they haven’t scored as much as I’d like. (26th most goals in the NHL). I believe positive regression is on our side. (Capitals rank 5th in nhl in expected goals for) only 21 spots higher than where they actually score. So now go look at their games in which they lost. Majority were with the backup goalie in Lindgren. I gotta wonder how much this islanders team is really jazzed up to hop on a plane and go to Washington tomorrow on Halloween to play another game after just getting throttled twice in a row. Meanwhile Washington has been sitting rested after dropping two straight, and will be eager to put on a show in front of a packed home crowd on Friday night (and it’s Halloween) so obviously let’s get a dub for the fans. I believe this will be a convincing win for the capitals against an islanders team with tired legs and that probably just wants nothing more than to end this road trip and get back to New York for their game against the blue jackets on the 2nd. Happy to once again write another pick for Y’all and idk about u but I’m tryna make some more fucking money 😏 best of luck",

It’s usually a high flying matchup when they square off, and with a days rest for both teams I think they’ll be ready to score. \n\nThe Avalanche are the #1 offense in the league and are humming right now. They have the second most goals for, as well as second highest goals percentage. Nathan MacKinnon is the best player in the league right now and there’s not much teams can do to stop him and Makar. I’m confident they’ll put up 4-5 goals. \n\nThe Knights situation is a little different. They are battling the injury bug with mark stone going on LTIR (again) and have a mediocre offense. However, when it comes down to it, Colorado is middle of the pack and in goals against and has okay goaltending in net. I see this as 5-2 6-2 type of game.\n\n1U\n\nFeel free to tail, or not!

Not really too sure, based on how the Warriors played, we didn’t need Giannis to win that game. Either way, a push is not bad.

After a bit of a rough last game for his early standards, I expect him to have gotten the reps in now with Embiid who is slated to play against the Celtics. His poise on the court seems like he’s a growing and learning player, I expect him to want to focus on getting Embiid involved as well as being able to score well himself. In addition, VJ might be able to cash this line himself off of just points. He’s fighting for a strong ROTY campaign and I don’t suspect him to have 2 bad games, especially the confidence of knowing he can and have torched the same defense previously.",

Marshall kept getting 10 point leads and then giving up touchdowns to Collier, who kept CCU nipping at their heels. It was looking good at the start of the 3rd quarter with Marshall up 27-17, but CCU struck back quickly to make it 27-24, and from there, Marshall’s high powered offense responded by absolutely imploding. Four drives in a row went comically wrong, with their star QB throwing fumbling once (for his first lost fumble of the entire season) and then throwing 2 interceptions on back to back drives (DOUBLE the amount he’s thrown the entire season) before fumbling AGAIN on the fourth drive to make it 4 turnovers in the blink of an eye (what the actual fuck). Coastal capitalized on that chicanery and it was over. ❌\n\nMalik Washington was quiet in the first half, only getting 8 yards on 1 catch, but the Dolphins fell behind 28-6 shortly in the 3rd and were forced to play catchup through the air in the 4th, creating a positive game script for the dolphins receivers. He finished with a season high 48 yards. ✅\n\nDoesn’t matter because Marshall lost though.\n\n——————————————————\n\n**Today’s Pick** - **Fernandez ML** vs Cirstea (-191) & **Lauri Markkanen 30+ PRA** (-202) |**+127**| **3 units** | draftkings \n\n——————————————————\n\n**Hong Kong WTA 8:00 EST**\n\n——————————————————\n\n**Jazz @ Suns NBA cup group play - 22:00 EST**\n\n——————————————————\n\nWith this high plus odds strategy, we only have to win around 45-50% of our bets to make a nice profit in the long run, so it’s very important that I don’t let a single loss, or even multiple in a row, deter the process. Gotta stay psychologically strong. \n\n——————————————————\n\n**Fernandez ML vs Cirstea (-191)** ✅\n\nLeylah Fernandez is in excellent form at the moment. She started her Japan tour off with a title earlier this month — winning the Osaka WTA. \n\nIn the Osaka WTA tournament, Cirstea had the misfortune of having to play against Fernandez in the semifinals. It was a three set victory for Fernandez, who showed great grit in the final set, coming from behind 3-1 in the final set to win comfortably in the end.\n6-1, 2-6, 6-4\n\nQuick breakdown of the statistics from it:\n\nTotal points: Fernandez 81 — Cirstea 71.\nWinners: Fernandez 33 — Cirstea 21.\nWinner ratio: 41% vs 30%.\nBreaks: Fernandez 6/10 (60%) — Cirstea 5/5 (100%) (Fernandez had twice as many break chances).\n1st serve in: 74% vs 56%.\n1st-serve points won: 58% (33/57) vs 50% (21/42).\nAces / DFs: 1 / 2 (Fernandez) vs 4 / 0 (Cirstea).\n\nFernandez hit more winners and earned her winners at a higher rate, reflecting sharper shot selection and cleaner execution. That gap is something that usually holds up in repeat matchups unless the opponent radically adjusts.\n\nThe break disparity and conversion efficiency is a key thing to note here. Fernandez created double the break chances, with 10 to Cirstea’s 5, but only converted 60% of them compared to 100% for Cirstea. She left plenty on the table. Even converting at just 60%, she broke serve more often. If she maintains similar pressure, and statistically, she should, we’ll likely see a more decisive scoreline this time.\n\nCirstea once again finds misfortune on her side, getting paired with a superior opponent who will send her packing. \n\nAfter Leylah’s title win in Osaka, she performed well in Tokyo, beating the Greek Tank Sakarri. She lost in the next round to world #6 Rybakina, but there’s no shame in that.\n\nShe’s bounced back in Hong Kong, playing peak tennis at the top of her game, already having dispatched #167 Wang and #44 Lys as if they were amateur rec league players: (6-1, 6-4) then (6-4, 6-1). \n\nCirstea has won against #96 Galfi and #86 Tomljanovic, but she dropped a set in the latter, has not looked as good as Leylah, and has given no indication that their rematch will differ in result.\n\nAnother reason I like this pick, is because Leylah has an excellent track record here in Hong Kong — making it to the semifinals in 2023 and winning the whole thing last year in 2024. She clearly has an affinity for these courts, and I am confident in predicting a win. \n\n——————————————————\n\n**Lauri Markkanen 30+ PRA (-202)**\n\nLauri Markannen has cleared 30 PRA in every game so far this season and he and he got 68 PRA with 51 points on 34 shots vs the Suns in their last matchup, just a few days ago. That one went to overtime, and I don’t expect a duplicate performance, but he has a taste for their blood now and is likely to attack them hard again in this NBA cup group play game.\n\nGame logs: \n\nJazz vs Clippers: 20/6/5 **31** ✅\n\nJazz vs Kings: 33/4/1 **38** ✅\n\n**Jazz vs Suns: 51/14/3** **68** ✅\n\nJazz vs Blazers: 32/5/2 **39** ✅\n\nBOL",

Solidifying the o53.5 before heading into the 4th quarter felt good. For Friday's pick, I'm looking at the College Football lineups and will be targeting the C-USA matchup between Sam Houston and LA Tech.\n\nNeither of these teams boast a great record in conference play, especially with Sam Houston sitting last in conference with an 0-7 overall record.

The Bulldogs starting Kicker DNP in Tuesday's game and the Bulldogs likely wished he had. They ended up missing two field goals in the duration of the game, the last one being the game winner.

They took the lead just before the half through Maswanhise and doubled it towards the end of the match with Watt scoring. On the cards front Hendry picked up a booking in the 63rd with nothing after that with only 9 fouls conceded.\n\nAfter two very mixed seasons (for their standards) where they finished outside the top 3, Dortmund are slowly rediscovering some consistency under Kovac and are playing some nice transitional football. They defeated Frankfurt on penalties in the DFB-Pokal a few days ago and are 4th in the league - 2 points off second after some tricky opening fixtures to start the season. On the other hand Augsburg finished 12th last season, comfortably avoiding relegation  but find themselves in 15th spot right now after a poor start to the season. Under former Bayern player Wagner they have developed a counter-attacking style similar to Dortmund. At home, Augsburg have averaged 5.2 corners won over their last ten with 3.8 conceded whilst on the road BVB have averaged 4.1 won over the same period. That gives me 4.2 corners for Dortmund even by applying pressure as they are the better team.\n\nThat gives this play a 75% chance of winning with some very good value at stake. This line cleared in last year’s fixture and in 9/10 of both BVB’s last 10 away matches and for Augsburg’s opponents at the WWK Arena.

Both teams score and let goals in almost every game. BTTS seems like a great bet but I want the better payout for this one. Reasoning below. \n\nIn September and October 7 of 8 matches BTTS hit for Shanghai \n\nSame time frame Shezhen BTTS hit in 4 of 5. \n\nI’m also using the lines to help guide my hand here. Shanghai ML is -425, spread is -1.5 Shanghai and O/U is 3.5. \n\nImplied score is 2-1 or 3-1 in Shanghai’s favor. \n\nTrusting the lines and the data points to see BTTS and a Shanghai win. \n\n3-1 Shanghai\n\nUPDATE: We got a goal at the 2’ mark and then nothing the rest of the game. Sorry everyone was confident in this one.",

PSV’s attack has been strong recently, with three of their last six games going over 3.5 goals. They dominate possession and create plenty of scoring chances, especially at home. Fortuna can sometimes defend deep but also struggle against fast, attacking teams like PSV. If PSV start well and take control early, the game could see several goals again. Over 3.5 goals looks possible considering both sides’ recent trends and PSV’s attacking form.",

Over 3.5 Goals AND KuPS to win v Gnistan. 3u @ $2.20 ❌\n\nAnnoyed at myself for this one. Bangkok won 7-0 so that over was easy. \n\nKuPS were winning at half time and looked good for it, but gave away a bad penalty with a tad over 10 minutes to go. Match ended 1-1. \n\nToday's Pick: Coventry to win at Wrexham. 4u @ $1.86\n\nPick: Larger write-up coming...   \n  \nThis is a pick for a few different reasons. But it boils down to two things that compound into one another. \n\n1. I think bookies have really struggled with what to make of Coventry so far. I feel like odds have been off for a while - which is fair to a degree, this has been pretty unexpected. It's tightened a bit in the last few weeks, but still some caution. \n\n2. Wrexham, imo, have been overrated in the odds in a large percentage of games. \n\nAdd these two together, and you get pretty good odds. It was at $1.91 but it changed in literally the ten minutes it took me to write this up. It might shorten again.",

They have one of the best attacking records in the league and strong home performances. Theyve been in great form lately, creating chances nonstop and usually finding the net at least twice in most games especially at home.\n\nAl Shabab’s defense hasn’t exactly been solid either, so unless they suddenly tighten up, Al Hilal should have enough quality to put in a couple of goals.\n\nOnto next pick I think the over 2.5 goals in PSV vs Sittard has a good shot. PSV almost always play attacking football, especially at home , they press high, create a ton of chances, and usually score two or three on their own.\n\nSittard might not be a top team, but they can sneak in a goal if PSV relax a bit at the back. So even if PSV run away with it, something like 3-0 or 3-1 feels pretty realistic.",

Trefl should be the favorites, even slightly. This is because the balance of strength currently favors Trefl Gdańsk. They started the season with a 3-2 win over Barkom Lwów, with MVP Tobias Brand (New Transfer) scoring 23 points. In week 2, they lost 2-3 away to Asseco Resovia in Rzeszów, making it 1 win and 1 loss in the first two matches. The on-field backbone (setter, hitter, and libero) is more established, and there's more depth. The transfer window was a productive one for Trefl. High-level \"winning profile\" additions: Experienced/effective players like Tobias Brand and Piotr Nowakowski directly boosted the quality. Aliaksei Nasevich (OPP): He sprained his ankle in a league match on October 26th and was substituted. It's uncertain whether he'll be ready for the away game against Suwałki.\n\nŚlepsk Malow Suwałki lost 1-3 at home to Resovia and 0-3 away to Jastrzębski Węgiel in Week 2; they opened the season 0-2. The long, 33-31 victory in the third set came in the Jastrzębie match. A major summer overhaul: two new setters (Kamil Droszyński, Karol Jankiewicz), midfield reinforcements (American David Smith, Jan Nowakowski). Captain Bartosz Filipiak has been extended; he remains the team's primary scoring option.\n\nTrefl has looked competitive and productive in two matches, while Ślepsk struggled to create sets against two strong opponents. Trefl's core is ready for the season opener. Trefl's wing/backline is capable of holding sets inside and will give their all to win this match.",

Technically still made .34 units off of it even with the void so we'll just count it as a win, unfortunate though because it was looking like a good fight.\n\nToday's match: LA Tech vs Sam Houston State (CFB) \n\nPick: LA Tech -14 Alternate Spread (-142, Fanatics)\n\nIf your book does not have whole number spreads you must calculate it yourself using a run line calculator with -14.5 and -13.5  (https://zcodesystem.com/runline\\_calc/)\n\nBack to fading my favorite team today, Sam Houston State is still winless in 7 games and they are coming off a bye week so the last time they played was the last time we faded them against UTEP. If we take a look at similar opponents these two teams have faced this year we can see that there is a clear talent gap here because LA Tech is actually blowing out the teams that are blowing out Sam Houston.\n\nSam Houston vs WKU 24-41 Loss\n\nSam Houston vs NM State 10-37 Loss\n\nSam Houston vs UTEP 17-35 Loss\n\nLA Tech vs WKU 27-28 Loss\n\nLA Tech vs NM State 49-14 Win\n\nLA Tech vs UTEP 30-11 Win\n\nAs you can see LA Tech has covered the  spread against all teams who covered the spread against Sam Houston except against WKU. Admittedly LA Tech has not been in good form, they closed against Kennesaw State as a -5.5 favorite and against WKU as a -6 favorite and lost to both outright. They got destroyed by Kennesaw State 35-7 but performed much better in their loss against WKU in the second half which I'm hoping carries over to today. They were trailing WKU 20-7 but then held WKU scoreless in the second half and was able to force OT which they lost. I think this is a good bounce back spot for LA Tech who are basically the better team everywhere compared to Sam Houston, personally taking -14 for a two touchdown cushion which would be a push but I also like -16.5.

This past weekend PSG visited 12^(th) place Brest and beat them 3-0. I expect a similar result against an even weaker opponent. This leg has the same deal than the first, if they win by 1 it's a push.",

      "text": "Record: 152-134, -5.58 units\n\nLast Pick: Rafael Jódar to win 2-0 vs Murphy Cassone (+125, 1 unit): Win \n\nTennis | Charlottesville Challenger | 11:30 AM EST (estimated)\n\nToday's Pick: Jay Clarke vs Dylan Dietrich | Dietrich ML at +135 (MGM). 1 unit. \n\nWrite-up: Jodar closed around -120. The match one was a bit more competitive than I expected, as Jodar was actually down a break for the majority of the second set (and even faced a break point at 1-3, but it felt like he was able to get his nose into all of Cassone's service games. For that reason, it wasn't a huge surprise to see him break back with Murphy serving for the set and roll from there.\n\nJodar might be an exceptional player, but he wasn't the only one behind Virginia's success (9-4 record in competitive conference and NCAA tournament QF appearance) last season. Today, I'm actually going with another strong Virginia player, Dylan Dietrich, to get a win on familiar grounds. Last year, Dietrich played at either #2 or #1 in the lineup depending on whether Jodar was available. He put together a really nice dual season (6-3 at No. 1, 12-2 at No. 2) that led to him being ranked at #9 in the ITA's preseason ranking for this year. He was especially strong at home, where he scored wins over ITA #2 Sebastian Gorzny, #11 Aidan Kim, and #6 Jay Friend. All of that is to say that his current ranking of #1172 in the world is in no way representative of his playing ability. \n\nDylan already got off to a strong start here in Charlottesville, defeating world No. 318 Alfredo Perez in straight sets (7.04 performance rating) after being pushed down to 2.20 from a 2.70 opening price. That match serves as a useful comparison, since he's being priced similarly to his closing odds here. Similar to Jodar, I feel that Dietrich has a very strong indoor game. He's definitely not as stable from the baseline from Rafa; however, he stands at 6'5\" and possesses a massive serve that produced 11 aces and a 9.0 shot quality rating in that match. \n\nMeanwhile, Jay Clarke had an absolutely horrific start to the season, but was able to rebuild his form by playing some ITFs. However, he's not really your average Brit in that his strongest career results (including this season) have come on clay, not fast indoor hard courts. He got a solid first-round win over Tyler Zink (7.12 performance rating); however, the fact that he was priced as a pick'em in that match isn't a great sign of the market's confidence in him (Zink had one big run in Tiburon, but his Challenger results haven't been too great outside of that). Going back to the Perez match, I feel that Clarke is the slightly weaker player compared to Alfredo, who has recently taken sets off guys like Abdullah Shelbayh and Michael Zheng. \n\nOverall, this match feels like a toss-up to me, so I like Dietrich at plus money. Clarke's biggest asset is his heavy topspin forehand, which doesn't work as well on this surface, and Dylan's game should be better suited to these conditions. Prices on this play vary quite a bit across books - I would take it down to +120/2.20 or so, but I don't think there's value beyond that. \n\nNote: The [POTD Capper Tracker](https://potd.lol), which you may remember from its Google Sheet days, is finally back in a cleaner, more robust website format!

And those were all with Garland active.\n\nAcross those 9 meetings, Mitchell averaged 37.8 minutes and 23.7 FGA. In games where he logs 36+ minutes on 22+ FGA, he’s gone over in 24 of his last 28.\n\nThe Celtics have struggled to contain guards this season, allowing 3 of 4 to smash their lines: ⬇️\n\nJordan Poole – 22 PTS (Line: 20.5)\nJalen Brunson – 31 PTS (Line: 24.5)\nTyrese Maxey – 40 PTS (Line: 25.5)\n\nWith this game expected to stay close (Cavs -4.5), Mitchell should see heavy minutes and strong usage.

      "text": "Record: 45-27 (+33.5 units)\n\nLast 10 (most recent on right):  ❌✅✅✅✅✅✅❌✅✅\n\nLast Pick: Lecce +3 corner handicap vs Napoli ✅\n\nEvent: SPFL (Scottish Premiership) ⚽️\n\nPick of the Day: Motherwell U1.5 cards vs Dundee United 4U @ 2.37 (Bet365)\n\nWrite-up: Napoli keep their place at the top of the league but were truly made to work for it. Napoli had two quick corners around the 15th minute in a first half pretty poor of opportunities despite Lecce being incapable of keeping the ball. The Giallorossi then started the second half much better than their opponents winning two corners shortly and Camarda missed a penalty. Napoli then brought on their rested big guns in Mctominay and Hojlund to regain conrol, taking the lead shortly after through Anguissa. This coincided with the corner count ending 5-3 to the Napolitans with late heartbreak for those on the +2 handicap that the line moved to after they were afforded a 95th minute corner.\n\nMotherwell find themselves mid-table in 7th spot and defeated Livingston at the last minute in their previous match. They also are into the Scottish League Cup semis where they’ll face off against St.Mirren in a couple of days. Since Askou took over the club in June the steelemen have been playing some nice attacking football and have averaged just 1 card per match this season. On the other hand Dundee United are in fourth spot, ahead of Rangers in what has been a strange season where Hearts are well clear of Celtic and the Gers. They tend to be quite aggressive, averaging 3 cards per match this year. Those stats are in line with referee of the day Chris Graham who has averaged 3.9 cards over his career in Scotland (4.3 this season though the sample size is very small). Using all the stats I have I get a mean of 1.1 yellows for Motherwell.\n\nThat gives this play an estimated 72% chance of winning. Honestly I’m quite surprised at the odds as they’ve covered this line in 7/10 matches this season. Obviously it’s quite risky as a red card would kill the bet and in general there isn’t much lee-way but the value is too good to ignore for me so will assume the risk that comes with it.

Keeping last season's MVP maintains their attacking ceiling. National-level outside player Lim Sung-jin left for KB Insurance during the April FA season; this departure has weakened KEPCO's wing scoring. KEPCO's revision in wing scoring and their 0-3 performance in the opening week, combined with Hyundai's serve-blocking dominance, could tip the balance in the early sets. Hyundai's side is reasonable in this match; my scoreline is 3-1 Hyundai. The risk is that KEPCO's new outsider might steal a set in a \"warm-up\" scenario, but Hyundai's passing and blocking discipline throughout the match favor them.",

      "text": "Record: 15-7\n\nLast Five Predictions (Old - New): ❌✅✅❌✅ \n\nNet Units: +22.49\n\nYesterday's Pick: Thun v Winterthur. Thun (-1.0 &-1.5) Asian Handicap. 3u @ $1.87 ✅ \n\nI'm writing this as the game goes on. So apologies for any tense jumping...\n\nThun started really well, scoring two goals within the first 36 minutes. However, three minutes after their second goal, they copped a straight red card, so they played 50+ minutes with 10 men. \n\nWinterthur dominated possession in the second half - but the shot count was pretty even. As the half went on, though, Thun dominated the xG stat, even though they had next to no possession—which is precisely what you want when you're a man down and in a winning position.... Give away limited decent chances, and hit them on the break when you do have the ball. \n\nThun even had a great chance in the 78th minute to make it 3-0, which would have given some breathing room. \n\nHowever, Thun then scored a couple of minutes later to make it 3-0 with under 10 minutes left.\n\nThun held out for the rest of the game to win 3-0. Was unsure how we'd go with this once the red card happened, but a good win for us. \n\nToday's Pick: Roma to beat Parma and u3.5 total goals. 3u @ $2.05\n\nPick: Off to Italy today as 15th-placed Parma travel to Rome to play 2nd-placed Roma.\n\nMost of the time, I would be all about the 2nd-place team comfortably beating the 15th-place team at home... And I'm not against that... But I like the u3.5 goals here. \n\nNow, you could say a lot of things against Gasperini's Atalanta, but you wouldn't say they played boring games. \n\nAt Roma, though, his side looks a little different. There are a hell of a lot fewer chances. Parma are not much different.\n\nBoth teams have played 8 games in Serie A this season. \n\nRoma matches have had 11 total goals.\n\nParma matches have had 10 total goals\n\nRoma have scored eight goals and won six games. Now, that's efficiency.\n\nIt's not like they've been smashing xG and missing goals either; they're 9th in the league for expected goals with an even 10 in 8 games. \n\nIt's their defensive work that's put them in second so far; they've conceded 3 goals this season off a league-beating 7.0 expected goals.\n\nParma games have been super tight, but very low scoring too. \n\nParma have only scored three goals in their games so far off their 6.6 expected goals. \n\nOn top of that, none of their goals scored have been away from home.\n\nHowever, they've only conceded seven goals themselves. Parma have the 7th best defence xG-wise with 8.3 expected goals against. \n\nParma have also played Como, Atalanta, and Juventus.... So it's not like they've had a super easy run.\n\nStill, I can't see Parma scoring enough to do anything.\n\nI was tossing up between this and the overall under 2.5 goals scored at $1.73. Obviously pros and cons for both. Putting half your stake on both of those results wouldn't be the worst idea - but it's not exactly a POTD if I do that! ",

Sociedad prediction was spot on, Under 8 goals.. they had under 4 in the end, they really aren't having a great year. Sevilla result Won too but it was 4-1. Toledo got an early goal but it was the best thing for the game, it woke Sevilla up. Coming back from a break and losing back to back sucked so let's try build some momentum again \n\nTODAYS BET \n\nEVENT/S = PSG VS Lorient \n\nBET =  PSG to score over 2 goals @1.83\n\nUNITS = 5U to Profit 4.16U\n\nSUMMARY = I love this line and think it has way too much value with the current form of PSG. They come up against 16th place Lorient which in the French league is a relegation playoff spot. Lorient have played 3 teams in the current top 6. Monaco, Lille and Marsielle. Monaco had a first half red card so they actually lost to Lorient but Marsielle and Lille beat them 4-0 and 7-1 completely dominating them. So when Lorient come up against a good team they struggle. Psg haven't cleared this in every game they should in my opinion but I think that's because they haven't had PSG calibre line-ups most of the season. PSG have had some world class attackers return from injuries recently including Dembele which is huge for them. He has only been coming off the bench for 30 mins in the last couple of games but I feel like this would be the perfect game for him to come back in and start. Honestly I don't really see how PSG don't score 3 goals here, they have potentially their strongest line up coming up against a team that struggles that don't have a world class keeper that bails them out. I can see this being 4 or 5-0 \n\nIf my picks help you and you'd like to show your appreciation a thumbs up is perfect, if you'd like to tip which is never expected but always appreciated and does help motivate me for the research here you go.

Bayern have won 13 straight matches to start the season, which ties the all-time European record, and they will be looking to extend that run to be the record holders for the only team in top 5 league to have won 14 straight wins to start the season. Bayern have scored 47 goals in those 13 games while only letting in 8 goals, showing they are unstoppable in both attack and defense. Harry Kane is in incredible form with 20 goals already this season including 12 in the Bundesliga, and Bayern just destroyed Gladbach 3-0 away last Saturday showing they score lots of goals even on the road. \n\nBayern have not lost to Koln since 2011 and have won 18 of their last 20 meetings against them. Koln are struggling badly right now, losing 1-0 to Dortmund last weekend without managing a single shot on target, and they barely survived the first round of the cup needing two goals in the 95th minute to beat a third-division team. Bayern are very motivated to win the DFB Pokal because they have not won it since 2020, and their coach Vincent Kompany just got a contract extension and wants to win trophies. With Bayern scoring almost 4 goals per game this season and Koln's weak defense and terrible form, a scoreline like 3-0, 4-0, or 3-1 is very likely, making the -1.5 handicap one of the safest bets tonight.\n\nIf you found these picks helpful, tips or donations are greatly appreciated as they support the time and effort I put into creating them: [buy me a beer🍻](https://buymeacoffee.com/hercules.son.of.zeus)",

I don’t like betting against home dogs. Especially in less than a TD spread but this one is the exception to the rule. \n\nThe reason I’m breaking my rule is I think a run game travels, and boy can JVST run. They are third in the country in rush yards per game at 277. MTSU allows on average 142 a game putting them at 67th defensively. \n\nMTSU is also not a very good team offensively. They rank 125th in points scored per game, 60th in passing and 134th in rushing yards per game. \n\nAdded bonus, JVST is coming off a bye week so they should be fresh and fired up. \n\nSagarin has JVST at 118 and MTSU at 171. \nJVST 4-3 MTSU 1-6\n\nNot a transitive property of football believer but worth noting, \nMTSU lost to Delaware last week by 3\nJVST beat them by 13 2 weeks ago. \n\nTailer Beware: JVST is 1-5 ATS last 6. \n\n35-24 JVST",

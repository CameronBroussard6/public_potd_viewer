Bills are banged up on defense in both the trenches and in their secondary. Rashee rice target rates increase a ton vs. zone, and bills are zone heavy. Bills have gone 3 straight games allowing double digit receptions to the opposing #1 receiver. Bills give up a heavy slot target rate, and rice is targeted at the highest rate from the slot on the chiefs and versus the other positions where he lines up.",

The last QB just got benched after going 1-14.  This won’t go any better. \n\n\t•\tThe Saints have hit rock-bottom at 1-7, and the franchise is clearly shifting into full rebuild mode — or should. We will know at the trade deadline.\n\n\t•\tLos Angeles enters this match as the superior, more experienced team. They have covered double-digit spreads in recent matchups and hold dominance in the head-to-head series.  \n\n\t•\tPro models have the Rams favored by around 14 points today, reflecting market sentiment that this is a two-td blowout.  It’s going to be worse for the Saints. Much worse. \n\n\nThis spread isn’t just big—it’s right. The Saints’ offense is awful, the qb change signals surrender of short-term goals, while the Rams are going to be arriving at their peak form soon. Expect nothing less than a dominant home win from LA. \n\n☕️ Tips: https://buymeacoffee.com/pickwizard",

The frontrunner for OPOY and MVP candidate is likely going to stay hot against an overpaid steelers defense. The steelers have been gashed in the run all season, allowing a staggering 4.9 ypc to backs and have allowed 100 yards rushing in 5 of 7 games. With the way Taylor is playing I wouldn’t be surprised if he got close to 200 rushing receiving today but i’m settling for the 109.5 line. \n\nTAIL OR FADE, BOL!!!!",

      "text": "Record: 7-1-1\n\nNet: 8.56u\n\nPast Pick: KD o24.5 pts\n\nRecap: No sweat and I feel my reasoning was on point. Not much to recap in all honesty. Ended up falling asleep early last night and missed the Dodgers ending and the Pistons game so I couldn’t go searching for lines when they were released, but it’s ok, value can always be found.\n\nEdit Lamelo Ball is likely out, will change the pick\n\nGame: 76ers @ Nets at 6:00pm EST\n\nPick: VJ Edgecombe 20+ pts, +110, 2u -> 4.2u\n\nReasoning: Edgecombe is coming off an ok but not great game against the Celtics. With Embiid out today, I expect much more of the offense to be going through Edgecombe as the 2 man between Maxey and Embiid isn't possible. Also given that they are playing the Nets, I expect him to be able to get his fair share of shots and minutes\n\n~~Game: Jazz @ Hornets 6:00pm EST~~\n\n~~Pick:  LaMelo Ball o6.5 rebs, +122, 1.5u -> 3.66u~~\n\n~~Reasoning: This is one of those lines I’ve been doing a lot but hasn’t made my POTD. Lamelo has hit this line every game so far this season and it’s been printing me a lot. For today, it was between this and Edgecombe 20+ points, but since I did that 2 days ago, we’re going back to Lamelo rebounds.~~\n\n~~The Hornets are playing against the Jazz which will be a good matchup when it comes to rebounding. Lauri and LaMelo both rank highly when it comes to 3pa, this is primarily where LaMelo excels when it comes to rebounding as his lankiness and speed allows him to outboard several other guards and forwards. Especially given that the Jazz aren’t a very good rebounding team and their guards are relatively undersized, I think it’s very likely here that Lamelo is able to get 8-9 boards easily~~",

      "text": "NY Giants Team Points Scored Over 23.5 (-108)-3 units \n\nThe Giants scored 20 points last week in a blowout loss to the Eagles, which has lowered their line for this week. Before that, Dart and the Giants put up over 33 points in back to back weeks. Tyrone Tracy is the starting RB now. He was a lock to be the starter prior to this season, so the loss of Skattebo should be manageable on the field today. \n\n49ers gave up 26 points last week to the Texans who were without their best WR (Nico Collins). Since the 49ers have lost Fred Warner for the season, their defense hasn’t looked quite the same. They’ve also given up 23+ points in 4 of the past 5 weeks (Bijan rushed for only 40 yards/2.9 YPC against the 49ers and they were only able to muster 10 points). \n\nI have watched the Giants a lot this year. They have a lot of ‘juice’ with Dart. In addition, with Andrew Thomas back at Left Tackle, their offensive line has looked like a formidable unit.",

Caleb Williams is facing the Cincinnati Bengals who rank 29th of 32 teams in passing yards allowed this season which gives him a favorable matchup. Christian McCaffrey has gone over 99.5 rushing and receiving yards in 7/8 games this season (87.5%). Today, he faces the New York Giants who rank 29th out of 32 teams in rush + rec yards allowed (399.6 yds) and 27th out of 32 in rush + rec yards allowed to RB’s (144.5 yards). With the favorable matchups and high hit rates this play provides, the most important factor in this whole play is that when analyzing the true and actual probability of this parlay, there is significant value/edge based off the odds (-150) and the true probability. With that being said,\n\n👇\n\nTake Caleb Williams over 199.5 passing yards + Christian McCaffrey over 99.5 rush + rec yards",

With Trae out, and with Cavs being strong in the paint, I expect a tougher game for Jalen Johnson than he had against the Pacers. And KP was brought in for his offensive potential as much as his rim protection, and I expect him to take more shots here and need to be closer to the rim on defense, both of which will help him rack up those Pts and Rebs. As a Celtic, in the 5 games he played against the Cavs, he was over in all 5 games, by a comfortable margin. \n\n \n\n*This line is available on DK.*",

Houston dominated, with 7 guys scoring double figures and shot 65% from 3 (19/29). \n\nTodays write up will be short but don’t let that make you think I don’t have 7 paragraphs to write about , just busy this weekend but had to get it on here. I fucking love this play.\n\n**76ers -5.5**\n\nRead my play a few days ago talking about Philly for what I like about them, but Brooklyn is the key factor in this play. They are one of the worst NBA teams I’ve seen in a very long time. I’m not joking when the season started they had guys playing big mins I’d never heard of, and I watch a lot of basketball. Aside from the names they just make no sense together, and a group of guys trying to get buckets. \n\nI watched the entire Brooklyn / Cavs game a few games back, and they cut a gigantic lead by getting insanely hot from 3 (Zaire 6 3s) and made it very interesting in the final few mins. Honestly they should have beat Cleveland that night however down the stretch they played some of the worst basketball I’ve ever seen. MPJ & Cam taking turns trying to create buckets on their own. When it wasn’t them w the ball, the other players on the team were doing the same fucking thing.\n\nAnyways I could see BKN winning 10 games this season, and tomorrow against Philly isn’t going to be one of them. Also, I worked at Barclays center for 3+ years, and there is absolutely no home court advantage. Yes die hard basketball fans go to these games, but few are actually invested in the Nets.\n\nPS: Wemby on 2 days rest against a terrible suns team. I’m laying them -6.5 too",

The amount of games where he gets 4 points will not be equal to 70 cents per dollar, it’s just ridiculous. Better off taking 3 for $1.50 if you’re playing safe! \n\nAs always with the last few 1Q plays - the caution is that streaky things can happen! At 2.35 units returned per unit spent, you don’t need to go big if tailing - more often than not this bet would lose by the odds (being >+100), but I’ll take it due to the large jump in odds, and hence value.",

Australia lead 1-0 in the series so far and they'll look to at it again. But it's worth noting that Australia will have to play without their best bowler Josh Hazlewood.

India's captain and vice captain are under  scrutiny for their bad form for a long time in this format. Jasprit Bumrah hasn't had a great game either and you can't keep him out for a very long time.

Since Omarion Hampton went on injured reserve in Week 5, Vidal has taken over as RB1 and made an immediate impact. He’s averaging 5.2 yards per carry and has scored two total touchdowns in just three games since being activated. With Najee Harris also out for the season and Hassan Haskins sidelined, Vidal is the only healthy back on the Chargers roster, making him the clear goal-line option.\n\nThe matchup couldn’t be better. Tennessee has allowed the most rushing touchdowns to running backs in the NFL, surrendering 13 scores through eight games.

After a couple rough POTD losses I have to turn to my lifelong favorite team, the Tennessee Titans, to do what they do best this year, play absolutely horrendous football. This team has been an embarrassment and it pains me to fade them but my gut knows they wont be competitive in this one and Ill explain why. After trading away our two best corners (L’jarius Sneed doesnt count hes made off glass and has been on IR all year and will miss this one) Jarvis Brownlee and Roger McCreary this secondary is basically a practice squad secondary and I think Herbert will be able to pick this defense apart. The pass rush will most likely be nonexistent as interior defensive lineman Jeffery Simmons and edge rusher Arden Key will be out in this one as well. On the offensive side of things it doesnt get much better. Cam Ward doesn’t look NFL ready and how could he, he has no weapons. Wide receiver Tyler Lockett literally quit on the team and demanded a trade and Calvin Ridley will be out in this game as well and it would be hard for any rookie quarterback to succeed behind the offensive line who blocks for him. Cam Ward also has more interceptions than touchdowns along with a couple inexcusable fumbles to go along with it.

By that point they were on six corners to Bayer’s 1 to pretty much already kill the bet. With Grimaldo confirmed on the bench the odds drastically swung the wrong way as he was the main threat at gaining corners and Hjulmand set up his team too defensively for this encounter which increased deflections. To be fair they stepped it up in the second half, reflective of earning 3 corners to Die Roten’s 4 and more possession but was too late.\n\nWest Ham have had a shocking start to the season, currently in 19th spot with just one win all season. They sacked Potter and replaced him with Nuno Espirito Santo which hasn’t given a true boost to the Hammers so far. The players simply look disinterested and if the situation continues like this they could very well be looking at a season in the Championship. Newcastle are currently sat in 13th which on paper doesn’t sound good as they should be fighting for those European spots but they’ve had some pretty tough opening fixtures to play and are passing the eye test at the moment. Over their last 20 home matches West Ham have won an average of 4.8 and conceded 5.2 corners whilst Newcastle away from home have averaged 4.6 won + 5.5 conceded. Adjusting for more recent data to fit Espirito’s stats at West Ham gives a mean of 5.2 corners for the Hammers and 5.0 for the Geordies.\n\nThat gives this play an estimated 71% change of winning. This line also cleared in last year’s fixture. BOL !\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i7obfjrgfryf1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aa63bf67e0033335b1becdb7ee116090dffef487",

Boston Celtics got blown out and Prichard finished 1/4 from deep. \n\nToday’s Pick: Lugentz Dort Under 2.5 Made Threes/Mikal Bridges +12 Points (-108 DraftKings)\n\nReasoning: Similar to my last two picks I’m going to exploit poor shooting, and lines that haven’t caught up. Dort is averaging 5.5 attempts from three and is shooting 18%. Unless he has his best game of the year from beyond the three line, this cashes. Mikal Bridges has taken on a leadership role in NY and is considered a veteran among the team. The Knicks lost to the Bulls on Friday night, but they play again tomorrow. Bulls are 5-0 and the Knicks look to avenge the loss. Bridges scored 23 points on Friday, shooting 64% from the field and making 4 threes. He’s averaging almost 3 made threes a game, so 12 points in a crucial rematch (as a veteran leader) this line should cash.

Nico Collin’s is back and so is Christian Kirk. CJ stroud has been on fire recently (passing for nine touchdowns with two interceptions in the past four games (three wins)). Not to mention, surtain is going to be out at least a month and the broncos will be going up against a Texans team with the number one scoring defense in the nfl (14.2). Houston is #1 in the league in opponent-adjusted points allowed, and while Denver is top 10 in points scored, when you opponent-adjust those numbers, that falls to 16th. \n\nAnother thing I find interesting, When both teams are coming off a win, as is the case here, the non-division home favorite is 73-24 (75%) straight up with an 11% ROI since 2022.\n\nHome favorites are 53-21 (72%) straight up with a 3% ROI this season. If they also made the playoffs last season, home favorites improve to 32-10 (76%) straight up with a 6% ROI this season.\n\nThe Texans have remained at home since last week and I expect them to come out and take care of business yet again now that they are regaining their health. \n\nWhat a comeback win for us with miss state, I said it exactly in my write up, Arkansas can and will score but they sure as hell can’t stop anyone, miss state had no business being over a 3 point favorite\n\nLet’s get another on the board fellas, cheers 🍻",

Too inconsistent. Instead I'll be looking at value picks with little risk.\n\n* Groningen are 5th in the table with 18 points from 10 games. Twente are in 8th place with 14 points.\n* Groningen play at home, a place where they are usually very strong. In their last two home matches, Groningen lost 0-1 and 0-2 without scoring. In the cup midweek they got knocked out by Sparta in a trashing 5-2 loss. After such a big loss, teams usually bounce back. I also really don't see Groningen failing to score for a third consecutive home game.\n* Twente have conceded at least 1 goal in every away game this season. In their last Eredivisie away game, they even conceded 3 goals to NEC.\n\nThe good thing is about this bet that we only lose if Groningen don't score at all. If they score 1 goal, we get a refund. If they score 2+ goals, we win the bet. Simple as that. I really like the odds for this one at 1.60\n\nGood luck and bet responsibly 🍀\n\nI share all this research for free so everyone can benefit.

He only played 2 weeks before getting injured (and in all honesty I think the Vikings kept him out longer than they could have because at least their backup gave them somewhat of a chance). During those 2 games, he looked good for 1 quarter - the other 7 quarters was some of the worst QB play I've seen. Additionally, he only had 20 and 21 pass attempts in those games. Even with the Lions secondary being banged up, opposing QBs actually are still performing slightly below average against them. While the Vikings are heavy underdogs and will be playing from behind thus needing to throw, I simply don't see how it's possible for McCarthy to throw 31 times after coming back from injury and looking incompetent during his first two starts. The Vikings will probably rely on their run game a bit in order to get McCarthy feeling comfortable again and now that the Vikings have both of their running backs healthy. I have him throwing somewhere between 21-25 times, which is a huge gap from the line. \n\nRemember to only bet what you can afford, and BOL!",

Indy is currently leading the league in total yards per game (385.3) behind a remarkable turnaround for Danny Dimes and an MVP caliber season from Jonathon Taylor. The Steelers on the other hand rank 30th in yards allowed per game (386). Meaning if the Colts put up their league-best 385 yards per game it would be an improvement for a sorry Pittsburgh defense. Pittsburgh also ranks in the bottom 10 for offensive yards per game (297.1). While the Colts don’t have a top-tier defense, I still trust them much more than Pittsburgh’s defense.

They have won their last 5/6 away matches this season and are fighting for the Serie A title with a solid team. Verona, meanwhile, are near the bottom of the table, struggling for results, and have only scored 9 goals from 8 matches while conceding 18, making them weak at both ends of the pitch. Verona are winless in last 10 games. All this suggests a win of the visitors and Inter scores 1.75 goals per game while Verona conceds 1 goals per game, making under 4.5 goals more probable. \n\nIf you found these picks helpful, tips or donations are greatly appreciated as they support the time and effort I put into creating them: [buy me a beer🍻](https://buymeacoffee.com/hercules.son.of.zeus)",

How different was Marseille when they received a red card for a stupid challenge at the halfway line, with a goal reversed by VAR earlier in the game it was a sweaty game, but we managed to get the high-risk parlay over the line!\n\n**Today's Pick:** ***FC Utrecht v NEC Nijmegen over 2,5 goals(1.65) + Rennes v Strasbourg over 2,5 goals(1.66) @ 2.75 -- 2 units***\n\n**Write up:**\n\nIt's starting to look like a French weekend for my picks, with Marseille yesterday and another French game in today's pick. Another high overall odd in this parlay where we need 6 goals in 2 matches. Do-able? I think so, but we lower to 2 units today.\n\n**Utrecht v NEC Nijmegen**\n\nUtrecht is a very attacking side with amazing set pieces. With **left-back Soufiane El Karouani at the top of the assists chart** in the Eredivisie they are looking to get more goals today against NEC. NEC is probably the most attacking side in the Eredivisie, of the 11 players their coach puts in the squad, 8 are attack minded. With only the centre backs and goalie thinking defensively, NEC's matches are goalfests. **46 goals in 10 matches so far in matches that NEC has played in**. Utrecht have covered over 2,5 goals in **4/5 most recent domestic matches.**\n\n**Rennes v Strasbourg**\n\nI've personally watched Strasbourg's game against Lyon last weekend as it was the last game that I needed goals from in a big parlay. This time I'm using the over 2.5 goals market again for a Strasbourg game, but this time its being used in the POTD. Strasbourg have **topscorer of the league Panichelli**, and he really impressed me in that game. They were the better side against Lyon until their red card. Over 2.5 goals has hit in **6/9** of **Strasbourg's games**. It also hit in **6/9 games for opponent Rennes**. Combine those goalscoring qualities and lackluster defenses and this is a pick I'm fairly confident in.\n\n**Best of luck if tailing!** 🍀\n\n**PS:** If you want you can check my record and units won on [https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/OliveCritical5134-qXXxJZ](https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/OliveCritical5134-qXXxJZ)",

Frankly I’m surprised it ended so close considering Texas led by 21 at one point. Nevertheless, kudos to the Longhorns.\n\nEvent: NFL Football Denver Broncos (6-2) @ Houston Texans (3-4) 11/2 1pm EST\n\nPOTD: Broncos ML +105 (1 unit)\n\nWrite up: These two elite defenses collide in an AFC showdown that could be a potential playoff matchup. Denver enters this game on a 5 game win streak featuring clutch defensive performances (holding the defending champ Eagles to 17) and impressive offensive showings (they’ve put up 33 and 44 points over the last 2 weeks). Bo Nix appears to be taking the second year leap, sporting a TD/INT ratio of 10/2 during the win streak. Houston has struggled against quality competition this season, with their most impressive win coming against a banged up 49ers team. CJ Stroud and the offense have been their biggest weakness, with the former Buckeye posting a passer rating below 100 during each loss.\n\nQuarterback play will be the key difference maker here, and the choice seems obvious. I expect Sean Peyton to limit Stroud through the air while Nix does just enough to secure the win. BOL to those who tail. Let’s do some winning!",

The Chicago Bears (4-3) are traveling to Cincinnati to take on the Bengals (3-5). The Bengals are coming off an embarrassing loss, giving the New York Jets their 1st win of the season. The Bears had their 4 game win streak snapped in their last game vs the Ravens. __There are going to be a lot of points scored this game as both the Bears & Bengals are tied for 30th in points allowed per drive on possessions without a takeaway (3.08). Cincinnati has allowed a TD on a league high 37.7% of opponent drives when they fail to get a turnover. The Bears rank 30th at 36.7%. The Bears (6.8) & Bengals (6.1) are the 2 worst defenses in yards allowed per play on early downs.__ The Bengals have had some life in them after acquiring Joe Flacco from the Browns. The Bears have won 4 of their last 5 games & are looking to keep their offense hot vs the Bengals. \n\nGoing into their Week 5 bye the Bears had a weak run game & Bears Head Coach Ben Johnson went to the lab & started cooking. __Before the bye, Bears RB’s averaged 3.4 yards per carry & 1.18 yards before contact. After the bye, they’ve averaged 5.9 yards per carry & 3.17 yards before contact.__ The Bears have deployed a RB tandem with both D’Andre Swift & Kyle Monangai. Monangai only has 1 game with 10+ touches this season, in Week 7 vs the Saints. Monangai had 13 carries for 81 yards. Over the past 2 weeks, Monangai has had longest rushes of 25 yards & 15 yards, his 2 longest rushes of the season. In these 2 weeks Monangai has a 39% rush share, compared to just a 23.6% share in Week 1-6. This week Bears RB’s D’Andre Swift & Roschon Johnson are out, leaving Monangai in a bellcow role. He’s going to see at least 18-20 touches this week. The Bears took Monangai in the 7th round of this year’s draft. Monangai is 5’8″ 211 pound rookie out of Rutgers, who faced elite competition in the Big 10. He played in an awful offense with an awful OLine, & he still but up big numbers in back-to-back seasons as he was their entire offense. He had 270 touches 1364 yds, 14 TDs in 2024, & 250 touches, 1340 yds, 8 TDs in 2023. __Monangai’s 139 forced missed tackles over in his last 2 seasons at Rutgers were the 8th most among FBS RB’s, & he didn’t fumble once his college career with over 670 carries.__ Monangai hasn’t had many chances to show his skills much so far this year, but that’s going to change Sunday as he is the only healthy RB on the Bears roster vs a horrrible Bengals run defense. But he has still put up big numbers. __His 4.4 yards per carry ranks in the Top 24 of RBs this season, & his 5.1 Yards per Touch is 17th. Fantasy Life’s Ian Hartitz created a stat called “Cool Sh*t”, a list of RBs with 50+ opportunities & what % of those went for TDs/explosive plays/avoided tackles, & Monangai ranked 8th with 39.2%. He has a 4.8% explosive rate & averaged 0.17 mossed tackles per rush.__ He now faces an atrocious Bengals run defense that has been torched on the ground this year. Here is how opposing RB’s have faired vs the Bengals this season:\n\nBreece Hall 18/133, Isaiah Davis 7/65\n\nJaylen Warren 16/127\n\nJosh Jacobs 18/93\n\nMontgomery/Gibbs 30/119\n\nJK Dobbins 16/101\n\nJordan Mason 16/116\n\nEtienne/Tuten 22/113\n\n__The Bengals have given up 132 rushing yards per game to opposing RB’s this season. The Bengals are 30th in defensive success rate (52.8%). 89.8% of the rushing plays against the Bengals have gained yardage, the highest rate in the NFL.__ They have a tough matchup this week as Chicago has been elite on the ground this season. __16.2% of Chicago's run plays have gained 10+ yards, 2nd in the NFL behind the Ravens (17.8%).__ The Bengals haven’t been able to stop an RB’s this year. __They are currently 31st in EPA/Rush allowed & are allowing the 4th most yards per carry (5.00). They are allowing the 4th most yards before contact per attempt in the NFL, which won’t improve this week facing a Chicago OLine that is generating the 4th most yards before contact per run in the NFL (2.61).__ Schematically Monangai is set up for a big day as well. The Bengals have been horrible against zone rushing concepts. __Monangai runs zone carries at the 12th highest rate among RBs. Cinci is allowing both the 2nd highest yards per carry (5.71) & 2nd highest success rate (56.0%) in the NFL against zone attempts, as well as the most yards before contact per run (2.65) on these rushes.__ The Bengals also struggle defending exterior runs. __Cincinatti allows the 5th most yards per carry (6.04) & 3rd most yards before contact per carry (2.99) vs outside runs. The Bears offense runs outside on 54% of their attempts, 6th highest rate in the NFL. It works well for them too as they rank top 10 in both YPC & success rate.__ The Bears have been running it a ton over the past few weeks. __Chicago ranks 5th in the NFL in Run Rate Over Expected since Week 4.__ With the Bears favored by 3 points, that should continue this week against a struggling Bengals team.\n\nIn a bellcow role vs a horrible run defense, there’s no one I trust this week more than Kyle The Run Guy Monangai. \n\n__Kyle Monangai over 73.5 rushing yards__\n\nAppreciate the love!

Both teams were top 3 in goals scored before this weeks slate of games started with Man City scoring 17 goals and Bournemouth scoring 16. Even though this matchup is predominately one-sided their last 6 games against each other have seen BTTS over 2.5 in 5 of them. Bournemouth also enter this game in good form starting the season fantastically and sitting 2nd on the table while scoring in every game this year besides one game against Newcastle, similarly Man City have also scored in every game this year besides last game against Aston Villa where we also saw Haaland's 12 game scoring streak come to an end. I'm expecting Man City to get back to winning ways tomorrow being at home but I expect Bournemouth to net at least one goal. BOL and bet responsibly.",

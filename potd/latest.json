On the road the split is even more favorable -- 5 of his last 6 away games came in under this number (15, 14, 6, 14, 10), with only the 26-point game at Michigan State breaking through.\n\nPurdue is elite defensively at home, holding opponents to 51.6 pts/game over their last 10. They've kept 5 of those 10 teams under 50. Lendeborg's minutes range from 25-37 (avg \\~31) so there's no hidden upside from an extended run.\n\nModel projects 10.5 tonight. Even against his real L10 average, the line is set above his typical road output against quality defenses.\n\nBOL if you're tailing! ",

They are hot, riding a five-game win streak. I always like to back Nova because they are consistent and have multiple ways to win. Xavier is 5-9 in conference play. However, they are 11-4 at home, where they can be dangerous when they catch fire. They swing the ball a ton and are always shooting along the wing. All Xavier wants to do is shoot the three, and then once they have you cheating, they start driving. Both teams shoot the three similarly. Xavier shoots better, but Nova's defense is better - MUCH better.\n\nNova ranks 75th in defensive efficiency, while Xavier ranks 196th. Nova ranks 51st in opponent ppg, while Xavier ranks 283rd.\n\nIn two-point shots, Nova holds opponents to 50.6% - 133rd. Xavier = 54% - 277th.\n\nIn three-point shots, Nova holds opponents to 33.5% - 160th. Xavier 34.1% - 185th.\n\nVillanova also holds an edge with rebounding. **Villanova ranks 127th in opponent rebounds, while Xavier ranks 339th.** HUGE. Both teams rank 116th in ppg, averaging 77.8, but with Nova's semi-elite D, this should cause a marginal gap. Villanova ranks 89th in 2P% vs Xavier's 282nd, which makes Xavier super reliant on the three.\n\nI trust Nova a whole lot more than Xavier... even on the road. Defense travels, and they have a slightly better offense. Xavier can get hot and keep this close with their shooting, but I think Villanova can slow this game down (294th in possessions per game) and obtain more quality possessions against a weak defense. Villanova isn't a streaky team; they are going to get theirs. Let's cash. GL\n\n[https://venmo.com/u/SezaBC](https://venmo.com/u/SezaBC)\n\n  \nP.S. Both teams cover the spread well, but the spread opened at -6.5, so we are getting a deal at -4.5",

Anyway.\n\nPSG is in a similar situation at the moment, got handed a very surprising and disappointing 3-1 loss by Rennes in the Ligue 1 which gave the league lead to Lens. However, in UCL they are a different breed and they proved it last year. Last season they faced another French team in the playoff round and completely battered Brest. This year they face a struggling Monaco which are 8th in Ligue 1 and have been producing very shaky results. I think PSG will capitalize on that even though they play away from home. They’re back in full force and I expect them to push the throttle here. Kvara, Dembele and Barcola will be too much for Monaco to handle in this tie. Expect PSG to deal with it in the first leg. \n\nGaltasarary awaits Juventus in Istanbul where they have a golden chance to get in the front foot and hope for a R16 qualification. Juventus has conceded 8 goals in the past three matches which shows how shaky their defense is. Osimhen, Sane, Noa Lang, Gundogan, Galatasaray definitely has a lot of quality going forward and being backed by their home supporters I see them putting at least 1 past this Juventus team that is very low on confidence at the moment. Expect Osimhen to showcase the quality he posseses on the biggest stage. \n\nBOL",

They only lost at home 2x times since the season begun, one against Leverkusen(cup game) and 1 against Inter in the Cl. 13/16 games went over1,5 goals for them too. Atalanta is in decent form too but they are more prone to make mistakes. They just lost recently to Bilbao and Royale Union which are not very good teams right now.\nDortmund is looking to win this tie at home for sure. They will try to accelerate the match, feeding early runs behind the defensive line and atalanta will try to disrupt the rythm. If the game becomes open then Dortmund's attacking efficiency is much better, if it slows down Atalanta should have a chance.\nI expect a 3-1 Dortmund win, but playing it safer with double chance.",

Typical early knock-out stage match with two teams that try to grind as much as they can to bring joy to their cities. \nBorrusia Dortmund is almost regular participant in the knock-out stage in the UEFA Champions League. They qualified further from the group stage in 10 of the last 13 seasons, scoring in 7 out of 10 of the first knock-out match at home. Also, they have the second-highest scoring rate at Bundesliga this season, scoring in every single game at home with an average of 2.36 goals scored per game at home. In the Champions League almost the same, excluding the game against Inter Milan, they scored at home in the other 3 games with an average of 3.33 goals per game. \nConsidering the fact that they are playing the first leg at home, they must attack on the Atalanta’s goal from the first minute.\nOn the other side, Atalanta this season are playing football like a classic Italian team from the early 2000’s, games under 2.5 goals in 2 out of 3 times in the Serie A.\nBut beside that, they improved their form, winning in the 7 of the past 11 games in all competitions and scoring 19 goals or 2.71 per game. \nIn this Champions League phase, they will play as best as they can to make a good result before the rematch in Bergamo.",

Day 2 of the Round of 32 at the 2026 Qatar Open features some big matchups, including the #1 Tennis player in the world, Carlos Alcaraz. This play is less about fading the World #1 & more so about the number. Alcaraz is coming into this one as, well, the World #1, with a perfect 7-0 record in 2026, coming off a historic Australian Open run where he completed the Career Grand Slam. He covered the spread in 5 of those 7 matches & has been nearly untouchable on outdoor hard courts (Doha is hard outdoor). He’s even won 100% of his service games so far this season. Early rounds of ATP 500 events are usually where he makes statements. But -7.5 (alt line) is a huge margin. That would mean he would need to win both sets 6-2, 6-2. Against a server like Arthur Rinderknech, that’s a tough ask. Rinderknech is ranked inside the Top 30 & recently hit a career high around #26, in the midst of having one of his best stretches on tour. He’s 5-2 ATS as an underdog this year. At 6’5 with a heavy first serve, he’s built to protect his service games, which is exactly what you want out of a +7.5 game spread. The over has hit in 75% of Rinderknech’s matches against Top 10 opponents because he holds serve and stretches sets longer than expected. Alcaraz is 4-0 vs Rinderknech, but there hasn’t been any blowouts. 3 of their 4 meetings included a tiebreak. At the 2025 US Open, Alcaraz won 7-6, 6-3, 6-4. Alcaraz will win this one, but Rinderknech is going to make him earn it. __Only one of their 12 sets in their previous matchups against each other ended 6-0, 6-1, or 6-2.__ That’s important when evaluating a spread this large. There’s also the situational angle. This is Alcaraz’s 1st tournament since winning in Melbourne. Even elite players can come out a little flat in their 1st match after a huge win. Doha plays medium speed, quick enough for Rinderknech’s serve to stay effective & steal a tight set, or even least push one to 7-5 or 7-6. But we don’t even need that. All we’re asking for is a 6-3, 6-2 minimum. \n\nAs for Andrey Rublev, he is the defending Qatar Open champion & opens his title defense against Jesper De Jong, this is a clear talent gap. Rublev loves the conditions of these courts, with a whopping 16-5 record here. He has elite power, elite baseline control, & crapload more experience at this level than De Jong. Rublev is a former World #5, 10 time Grand Slam quarterfinalist, Davis Cup champion, Olympic mixed doubles gold medalist, & owns 17 ATP singles titles. The experience and pedigree gap here is significant. __De Jong is ranked #86 & has a terrible 1-4 record to start 2026, with his only win coming against Sumit Nagal, the World #293.__ He’s still chasing his first ATP level singles title & has struggled to find rhythm, including a disappointing Davis Cup stretch. He’s already taken straight set losses this year to players much worse than Rublev. __These 2 have faced each other before with Rublev destroying him 6-1, 6-3.__ The matchup hasn’t changed much since then, De Jong doesn’t have the serve or the firepower to pressure Rublev’s service games, which should allow the Russian to control most baseline exchanges & generate a majority of the break chances. On hard courts, Rublev controls the pace & depth, which historically been a huge problem for De Jong against higher ranked opponents. When Rublev is on, he controls rallies early & forces shorter points on his own terms. But the biggest thing is Rublev is known for locking in during early rounds against lower ranked players, preventing unnecessary 3 set battles early  on in tournaments. If Rublev starts sharp & keeps the unforced errors manageable, this should be a routine straight sets win.\n\nI’ll gladly take a big server at a large spread in one match & back a clear talent gap in the other. Rinderknech doesn’t need to win, just keep it somewhat competitive. Rublev just needs to do what he typically does in Doha, get his easy wins early on.\n\n__Rinderknech +7.5 & Rublev -1.5 sets__\n\nAppreciate the love!

He absorbs pace well and is solid when pressure builds.\n\nBurruchaga definitely has weapons, especially if his forehand is firing early. His upside is high.

PSG have been very inconsistent lately, losing over the weekend. They also lost at Monaco 1-0 in Ligue 1 back in November. It is tough to say what PSG team we will get here.\n\nWith that said, I like Dembele in this spot because he will be very dangerous on the counter attack and has been in good form. He has hit 2 SOTs in his last 2 matches as well as his last UCL match. PSG will want to take it to Monaco early, and I can see this being a very offense forward game. Monaco will realize their only chance in this playoff is to win here, and that should open up the pitch nicely for Dembele. \n\nBOL and happy Tuesday!",

Germany should win by more than 1 goal.\n\n**Leg 2:  Champions League – Benfica vs Real Madrid Over 3.5 Total Cards**\n\nIf anyone is unaware of what transpired on Jan 26 when these teams met in Lisbon, Portugal in the final match of the group stage, please do yourself a favor and go watch the highlights.  For context alone, Benfica’s coach Mourinho used to be the head coach of Real Madrid many moons ago, and was ousted in 2013 after a poor season.  He savored and relished the recent victory against his former club which suffered humiliation losing to a Benfica that was ill equipped to accomplish such a feat.  At least that is what everyone thought.  Mourinho proved once again he can somehow rearrange the chess pieces to pull off the incredible upset, which he did by winning 4-2 in a most dramatic fashion.  A match that had 38 shots, 18 shots on target, 26 fouls, 8 yellow cards and 2 red cards.  A match that saw the goalkeeper score a last second header to send Benfica into the final spot of the playoffs.  Well enough of that match. (Seriously, watch the highlights)\n\nLess than a month later, fate has chosen these 2 teams to play once again in Lisbon, Portugal, for the knockout stage of the Champions League.  This time Real Madrid should be prepared.  They have the better squad, talent, money, and of course the pressure to win.  However, Real Madrid will also be down 2 starters in Rodrygo and Asencio due to their red cards in the previous match.  They will also be missing Belligham and Militao due to injury.  Also, another loss to Mourinho would almost certainly see some heads roll by management.  There are even rumors going around that Mourinho may return to Real Madrid.\n\nBenfica on the other hand have not much to lose as they were not expected to be in this position in the first place were it not for their miracle performance last month.  But they do have a mastermind in Mourinho and rest assured Benfica will not go down at home in front of their fans with their arms crossed.  I expect fireworks in this match and if last month's game was any indication, this one should be testy and could get nasty. \n\nI don’t think over 3.5 cards is too much to ask here.",

Wilkes has also been awful in the lead position for Canada which has certainly not helped their cause. Sweden came into this event with a 9-7 record this season against elite level teams so they are certainly capable of winning this when they are also the hotter team.",

Well now i'm going back with Switzerland with the best odds for under between the four matches tomorrow because this one feels again to me like a low scoring game. Yesterday I was looking at this line and it went from +125 to +100. They're starting to understand that this isn't the group stage anymore. It's win or go home so the amount of goals scored doesn't matter. Italy got destroyed by Finland because Finland could get that bye spot by scoring a lot of goals and also because Finland had a **full NHL lineup**. They're now facing Switzerland who like I said in another POTD have nine NHL players and the rest are Swiss league level. Do I expect Italy to win? Nope. But I expect it to be a closer game than a beatdown. Italy will have the crowd advantage as host and it's now do or die. They'll give a good effort and Switzerland knows this. The captain for Switzerland said this\n\"You've got to win that game before you can think about anything else,\" Josi said. \"And I think you saw Italy, they played great against Sweden, played really good against Slovakia. There were tight games.\"\n\nI've watched the Switzerland games and they tend to play to the level of their opponent. They use their 3 NHL defensemen to create rebounds for the forwards to capitalize and that amounts to a lot of shots from the forwards but with only few NHL forwards (5) on their team the shots are usually not that dangerous. It usually works against European players led team but against team with NHL players who can quickly go from defense to offense like team Canada or Czechia it's difficult to keep the defensive assignments especially with their Swiss-level players. Well, as we know Italy has the worst roster in these Olympics by far and I think they won't be able to generate much offense even if they get some scoring chances. They might get 1-2 goal but I expect the 3 Switzerland's NHL defensemen to get the puck out of the net and their goalie to make the saves (Leonardo Genoni is a Swiss goalie legend because he excels in these kind of games).\n\nI take the model between Switzerland vs France, who are slitghtly better than Italy, as one of the scenarios that could happen tomorrow. France had 27 shots but got shutout while the Swiss NHL players made the difference to win the game 4-0. Italy tomorrow should generate something like 20 shots as the host so something similar to France. The second scenario is the game becomes like Italy vs Slovakia and the Italians make it close by ending the game 3-2 (Slovakia had 7 NHL players on the team as a comparison to Switzerland).\n\nSwitzerland went under the 6.5 goals line in 2 of their 3 games in these Olympics with the last one almost also going under but didn't happen because of a last minute Czechia comeback. Meanwhile Italy only hit it once but the two other games were against Sweden and Finland who like I said had both full NHL lineups and had way more firepower than what Italy will face tomorrow against the Swiss. I just don't see this game become a massacre for Switzerland when it's now a win or go home situation and every mistake could be costly.\n\nBOL!\n\nEdit : ✅️ Booommmm went EXACTLY like the France-Switzerland game. Plenty of shots for Switzerland but they don't have the firepower of Finland or Sweden to make this a blowout like I predicted! I didn't write that damn long write-up for no reason!!! LFG enjoy the money!!",

TSAREVICH was a monster win last start, coming from seemingly 20 lengths behind and monstering them late, however I’ve seen the sectionals and I really think he went right past horses who were paddling, so less impressive than it visually suggested.     \n      \nGL!",

I am updating my net units based on my picks (over 2.5 instead of 1.5) which was +221 instead of the +127 odds posted, the lower gained 5.09 units and the higher line was 8.84 units. Both good cashes for any that tailed, lets get onto todays picks.\n\nCardiff (1st) are host to Wimbledon (15th), the home team boast an impressive record of 10-1-1 at home this season, unbeaten in 11 league games home and away,  averaging \\~2.4 goals at their home ground. In comparison Wimbledon have an away record of 5-3-4 scoring an average of \\~1.5 goals per game. Cardiff won the reverse fixture earlier in the year 1-0 and with home advantage, a higher scoring rate and better form I don't see Wimbledon being able to keep them from putting a few past them. Keeping it simple with the better team winning at their home ground.\n\nLincoln (2nd) are unbeaten in 14 league games, owning a home record of 9-2-1. Northampton (17th) are 2-4-6 in away games, although unbeaten in 3 they are fixtures against weaker opponents and the two away games in that ended in draws to Exeter (14th) and Barnsley (16th). Lincoln are in the promotion race which should give them plenty of motivation to perform at home, with Northampton struggling away and struggling to score consistently I see the team with a stronger form, lineup and home advantage taking all 3 points from a poor travelling, bottom-end team.\n\nShort writeup today, not overthinking it much as the two much stronger teams with good home records should both be looking for 3 points against these matchups.\n\nAppreciate anyone who tailed yesterday, managed to cash all of the lines I had chosen, even whacked them all in a parlay for a nice cash out of +15 units!\n\n**BOL and always bet what you can afford to lose!**",

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 17-41-5 *One loss in the last five, now we're talking! Girona* truly *came out swinging and gave Barcelona one hell of a game, and ended up beating them 2-1. Honestly, they really should've scored a couple more, judging by the fact Barca's keeper even won man of the match. I'll keep riding this wave in the most daring way possible - by going back to the team that had handed me the most Ls to date. Yes, whilst I mostly focused on the \"Barca curse\", one team has been consistently killing my picks one after the other, whilst somehow staying relatively under the radar. I'm talking about Real Madrid. No matter what, whether I backed or faded them, they'd always find a way to break my heart come the end of the game. But after surviving this Barcelona madness, I think the next logical step is to come for Real Madrid. Character progression and all that.* ***This is it, the final boss battle, if you will. Let's get to it!***\n\n**Last Five:** ✅✅❌✅✅\n\n**Event:** Champions League, Benfica v Real Madrid, 3:00 pm EST\n\n**POTD:** Benfica +0.5 Asian Handicap, -103, 5 units\n\n**Write Up:** I don't think I need to explain myself too much here. Real Madrid just haven't impressed me enough to back them in a big Champions League game like this one. The **previous meeting between these two sides saw Benfica beat Madrid** in a spectacular fashion after a stunning headed goal from their goalkeeper (yes, you read that right) helped them beat the Spanish giants 4-2 and secure a spot in the play-offs. Benfica thus proved they can absolutely compete against elite teams, and truthfully, 4-2 might have even flattered the guests a bit.\n\nReal Madrid have since managed to find some consistency, but Benfica certainly have more than enough quality to at least snatch a draw here. Keep in mind, this is the **first leg of a knockout tie, and neither team is going to come out swinging,** especially not Madrid. They're going to be more than happy to **settle for a draw** here and hunt for a win at the Bernabeu, depending on how the on-field balance looks. As a reminder, we're talking about a team that celebrated a narrow first leg defeat to Manchester City, as they anticipated a comeback at their home ground (which they, in fact made happen).\n\nHowever, I've not even come to my favorite part about this pick, which is the **Real Madrid absences.** In case you forgot, the guests collected two red cards in their last match (ironically, against Benfica), meaning **Raul Asencio and Rodrygo** are out of the picture for today's clash. And if these aren't some crucial absences, **Jude Bellingham** is also set to miss the match due to a hamstring injury, while **Eder Militao** still doesn't look ready. And for that final blow, **Kylian Mbappe is still recovering** and is possibly not going to feature for the whole 90 minutes. That's a crazy amount of key first team players missing, and whilst *Benfica are missing Alexander Bah and Fredrik Aursnes* themselves, they just aren't on the same level of importance as the aforementioned players.\n\nUnlike the league phase clash, goals aren't going to rain in this one, so Under 2.5 goals is a good angle if you want to boost the odds further (or go more conservatively with a 3.5). This is essentially a Benfica double chance, but once again, the odds are tastier if I head over to the AH section of my book (-103 v -111). Another max unit play here because the confidence is absolutely sky high and I just think these odds are too good in this context. BOL and let's enjoy this European classic and maybe a cheeky hattrick from the Benfica keeper ☘️🫡",

      "text": "Dubai/Doha/Delray: 0-2 (-7.4 units)\n\nAustralian Open: 8-3 (+17.8 units)\n\n2026 record: 12-10 (+0.9 units) | 2025 record: 55-41 (+26.5 units)\n\nEvent: ATP Delray Beach R32 🎾\n\nPick of the Day: Brandon Nakashima 🇺🇸 ML vs Marin Cilic 🇭🇷 5 units to win 3.3U @1.66 (Bet365)\n\nBig respect to Cilic for holding his own out there at 37 after years of injury problems. One of the most underrated players ever in my opinion simply due to the fact that no one really speaks of him despite winning a grand slam in the toughest era of tennis, players who have achieved far less get more recognition than Cilic. He’s had a pretty good start to the season, losing in R16 of Hong Kong to Borges, R3 of AO to Ruud having beaten Shapovalov in straights and last week lost to Fritz in the semis of Dallas having defeated Tien in round 1. Nakashima started the season on fire by reaching the finals of Brisbane and beating the likes of Davidovich Fokina in straight sets before falling to Medvedev 2-0. He then suffered an upset to VDZ in Melbourne in four tight sets to put a dent into his strong start to 2026 and last week lost to Fritz in R16 of Dallas.\n\nSo both players have had decent season openers but it’s the conditions that are going to heavily favour Nakashima in this match. Unlike Dallas which is one of the fastest tournaments, Delray plays fairly slow so Cilic’s big serve becomes less of a weapon. More neutral balls is going to force more errors from Marin who will be forced to attack to try and end points early. This is going to play exactly into Brandon’s gamestyle who has great rally tolerance and depth to keep rhythm going. Considering Nakashima’s strong serve and Cilic’s relatively poor returning I’m not optimistic on the Croatian’s chances at creating many opportunities on return but on the other side if Cilic’s first serve dips even slightly I expect him to get punished by the American’s depth. Nakashima plays very tactical tennis (his play style is stylistically very similar to Djokovic who Marin struggled against greatly) and if he can be on the front foot with a good return and force backhand-cross exchanges this could be a quick win for him. Not only does Nakashima’s patient game match well against Cilic’s error-proness on these courts but there’s also going to be questions of the Croatian’s fitness. At 37 playing 5 matches in 7 days is going to take its toll and I can see this being a UE fest once the match goes on. I would have fairer odds at around 1.50. Cilic did beat Nakashima in November 24’ on the way to winning Hangzhou but the courts there are also amongst the fastest on tour so I’m not worried by it. BOL !",

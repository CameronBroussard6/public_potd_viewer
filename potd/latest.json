Tough one\n\nHarden gets the best matchup possible to rack up his assists in this one against the Jazz who’s allowing MOST assists to PG’s this season and most assists allowed in the league overall.\n\nTwo man game with Zubac could be lethal here against a weak Jazz interior where Zu should be fed, not to mention that Jazz leaks 3’s aswell where there is good shooters for Harden to find.\n\nHad 7 assists in their last meeting without Zu, but had 11 in the other meeting where Zu was active, both in blowouts where he had 17 potentials in each game.\n\nOf course slight concern for a blowout again but Jazz being at home should hopefully make em stay in the game, spread at 8.5 is suggesting that too. \n\nHarden won’t get a better matchup, backing him in this one.",

They’re creating more chances, converting at a higher rate, and generally managing matches better than Bradford. Bradford, on the other hand, have struggled recently, particularly away from home, where their defensive record and game control drop off noticeably.\n\nWhen you combine Lincoln’s home strength, superior recent form, and Bradford’s issues on the road, this looks like a spot where Lincoln should be winning the game outright rather than settling for a draw. Laying the -0.5 simply backs Lincoln to do what the numbers suggest they’re more likely to do — take all three points.",

He scored 2 goals and the game tying goal vs the Kings (off Faulks 2nd shot) and having points in 4 out of his last 5 games and meeting shooting at least 3 SOG in 4 out of his last 5 games. Both teams just played each other on Friday and was it a good game. Kyrou had 3 SOG and the game in Dallas was settled with a minute left when Dallas took the lead to win.

Not only do I hit on the POTD, but I hit on LeMoyne at +1.5 moments before tip-off. Why the sudden line flip? Because leading scorer and senior center Shilo Jackson didn't play for Le Moyne. But it didn't matter. The Dolphins led by 15 at the half and shot 61 percent from beyond the arc in an easy, easy cash. FDU is straight up ass. We move...*\n\nWhat are we doing here? Marquette already lost 84-63 to Creighton on Dec. 20. If you think homecourt gives you 3-4 points, then this line suggests a 17-point swing. What am I missing? What's changed in the last month? Creighton remains the No. 53 team, according to KenPom and Marquette is 124. The Blue Jays have a higher rated offense (49 vs. 136), defense (88 vs. 128) and nonfoncernce strength of schedule (84 vs. 149). The only thing Marquette is better at is pace of play. Creighton is 33rd nationally in 3s made (10.4), which ought to afford them plenty of come-from-behind energy and certainly win-by-at-least-2 motivation. This is a lost season for Marquette. They're 5-16 against the spread all year. And *this* is the game where they put it together and cover? Miss me with that. \n\nCreighton has a huge shooting advantage. The Blue Jays make 46.6 percent from the field, 35.5 percent from beyond the arc, and 75.5 from the charity stripe. All three are miles better than Marquette (42.2 // 30.2 // 67.8). In a close game, that matters. Creighton also turns the ball over 9.7 times per game compared to Marquette's 11.1. In a close game, that matters. Creighton is 2-1 in games decided by three points or fewer. \n\n....I'll have more to come but I wanted to write up the line early, since I think it'll move more to Creighton's favor. For example, it's already 2.5 on FanDuel.\n\nGood luck and Godspeed!\n\nIf I've made you a few bucks through fades, it's just gonna ask you a few questions: [https://buymeacoffee.com/seventh\\_\\_place](https://buymeacoffee.com/seventh__place)",

Do not be fooled by the 82-59 drubbing of a very bad Rutgers squad-239th in defensive efficiency and 258th in offensive efficiency-because when push comes to shove against the upper echelon of the college basketball world, Indiana is the one on the receiving end. The team is just 0-6 vs Quad 1 opponents and 1-1 vs Quad 2 foes. Meanwhile, the Boilermakers (17-3) enter Bloomington looking to let off some steam. The team enters Tuesday night's tilt on a two-game slide, despite holding leads of five or more points during the final media timeout of each of its last two contests. The loss to Illinois on Saturday is especially tough to stomach, as Purdue shot a blistering 56.9% from the field (36.9% from beyond the arc) with senior guard Braden Smith chipping in 27 points and 12 assists. This Boilermakers squad has an edge over the Hoosiers in points scored per game, points allowed per game, field goal percentage as this Purdue squad is shooting over 51 percent from the field, rebounds per game, three point percentage, steals per game, blocks per game and less offensive turnovers per game. This Purdue squad has a couple impressive wins this year as they knocked off Alabama on the road as well as handing Texas Tech a beat down by 30 points while Indiana has lost by 6 or more to every ranked team they have played this year with losses to Nebraska by 6, Louisville by 9, Michigan by 14 and Michigan State by 21. These two teams have a few common opponents as these teams have played Minnesota (Purdue W by 28, Indiana L by 9), Iowa (Purdue W by 7, Indiana L by 17), Rutgers (Purdue W by 16, Indiana W by 23), Washington (Purdue W by 8, Indiana W by 10) and Marquette (Purdue W by 20, Indiana W by 23. Purdue is the better team here, and this is a perfect spot for them to bounce back after their last 2 performances - When looking at the data on KenPom, KenPom suggest that Purdue would be -10ish point favorites if they were at home - Purdue is top 10 nationally in FG % while Indiana is outside of the top 75 in FG % - They average 84.2 PPG and hold their opponents to around 68ish PPG - Indiana is 1/4 their L5 - and looking at their recent opponents like Michigan, Iowa, Michigan State, and Nebraska - Indiana does not perform as good as they would against a team that is not Top 25, whether that be home or away - One thing that stands out to me here is the rebounding edge that Purdue brings to the table in this one - Indiana can be beaten on the glass, Indiana ranks outside the top 250 in rebounds & ranks outside the 300 in offensive rebounds - Indiana does average 80+ PPG, but that number is inflated due to their weaker non-conference games this season - Looking at their recent results vs. the teams I listed above, they have not gone above 80 PPG in any of those - Lastly, Indiana is more vulnerable to having scoring droughts - I think, Purdue catches Indiana off guard tomorrow, Purdue is in a great bounce back position here - Purdue is a top 5 team and I think they have something to say tonight at the good ole Assembly Hall.\n\nPrediction: 84-74 Purdue\n\nLast pick:🏈Patriots -3🅿️Buying the half point came in clutch there, push is always better than a loss.\n\nBest of luck to everyone tailing and remember to bet responsibly! Had a lot of fun putting this one together with two of legends on this thread!🍀💜🐉\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qk7kke8i8tfg1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=73f03ae580eb510eea56a4cf416832fde5a3a48b",

CJ is now the boss in ATL, JJ is on laundry duty \n\n\nEvent: Clippers @ Jazz\n\n\nPick: Utah over team total 111.5 points \n\n\nWrite Up: It looks like Lauri Markkanen is finally returning, Utah has decided they've tanked enough...for now. \n\n\nStarting with bigger picture stats, Utah averages 119 points per game and 123 points at home this year, with or without their star. That's a top six offense overall and NUMBER ONE IN THE LEAGUE, and it's far above the total of 111.5. They're the best offense in the NBA at home. They've covered this total 16 of their last 20 games, and a chunk of those without their star. \n\n\nA big part of that is their pace, they are #2 in possessions, and of course, #1 at home in possessions. \n\n\nNow we throw in Lauri. Utah is 18 of their last 20 covering this line when he plays, 10 of their last 10.\n\n\nNow the Clippers are a top 8 defense, but they're allowing 116 points on the road vs 113 overall. Both those are still above the total of 111.5. Kawhi is a little dinged up right now, and he's been on limited minutes the last 2 games. Not sure if that will continue, but he's a Questionable GTD to play, and his defense is a huge part of LAC's great defense. \n\n\nI'd be remiss not to mention that LAC has held ALL of their last 10 opponents under this total, so tail with caution knowing that. \n\n\n\n\nI'd take the over even if Lauri wasn't back (it wouldn't be my POTD), so I'm definitely taking it with him coming back to lead the number 1 home offense in the NBA above their projected total. \n\n\nUtah Jazz over 111.5 points. ",

In the last month, Gibson has a .933 save percentage and has a goal against average of under 2. The Wings are 18-8-1 at home this year and their last game was Saturday, so they should be rested up.\n\nThe Kings probably go with Kuemper. They played in St. Louis on Saturday and then were supposed to go play in Columbus on Monday, but the game was postponed due to weather. Kuemper has given up 3 or more goals in 7 straight games. The one thing that could cause some concern is that the Kings have been a pretty good road team this year. \n\nGood Luck!",

While Oklahoma has not looked great at home lately they are still a much better team when playing in the Loyd Noble Center with an 8-2 record. \n\nWhy is this especially more important for this game? While Arkansas has not played many road games this year they have ONE road win and it’s against a subpar Ole Miss team. Arkansas is 1-3 on the road and lack of road tests + lack of road wins = road losses. \n\nLed by Nijel Pack, Oklahoma has plenty of scoring power to keep up with Arkansas in what is sure to be a very high scoring game. OU is playing well lately almost beating Missouri on the road if not for wild buzzer beaters. \n\nLastly, Arkansas is an 8 man deep team. They do not go any further than that on their bench and any bit of foul trouble can really hurt them. They average 1.9 more fouls in away games this year which is a significant amount and can be a game changer in this one. \n\nGive me Oklahoma to win this SEC battle outright but as always in cbb betting, if they are giving you points, take them. \n\nI know I am new here and have no credibility so tail at your own risk. I have been on fire betting cbb this year so I figured I’d try to help others out. Hoping to build some credibility over time and make both of us some money during the rest of this cbb season.",

All from hitting woodwork and poor finishing to getting 11 corners in the last minutes of the game. It is what it is, onto the next.\n\nIm staying confident in my methodology which has proven to work for me. Todays we are visiting the German Bundesliga 1 for TWO fixtures but a mixture of the both. First up is RB Leipzig moneyline, where St.Pauli are winless in 5 fixtures and head to head RB Leipzig haven't lost in the last 3. RB sit 5th in the league with St.Pauli fighting relegation in 17th, most of RB's losses have come from teams which are similar or are powerhouses in the league (Dortmund, Bayern, even Hoffenheim and Stuttgart in current form). They seem to be winning 62% of their fixtures at these odds with St.Pauli only coming through on 8% - this alone, PLUS their current form gives me confidence that RB will deal with SP and come through. SP are the home team, currently in terrible form going 2-2-4 (W-D-L), RB are 4-2-3 respectively and despite these numbers I am confident enough they have the quality to win.\n\nSecond leg of the bet is u11 corners for the other Bundesliga fixture, which has hit u10.5 in their last 8 encounters - current form for corners is last 4/5 for Hoffenheim and 7/8 for Werder Bremen. Hoffenheim sit 3rd and WB sit 15th, WB are winless in 9 games I see them playing for a point at least especially being at home and trying to create a cushion from the relegation zone which they sit 5 points ahead of. Because of this I do think both teams find the net and it could result in an attacking centred but defensively controlled game. Corners tend to be better for unders in games that teams are looking for control in the midfield and defence, while taking advantages of breaks and big chances. Lets hope this plays out how we expect and teams can convert on their chances unlike the last few! If I stuck to my gut yesterday we would be 2W-3L and \\~+4.0 units but such is life.\n\nBOL and always bet what you can afford to lose!",

Arkansas has one of the most efficient offenses in the country and do a great job of spreading assists and playing with tempo. Oklahoma’s hope to win relies on home court advantage, lots of turnovers from Arkansas, or a career night from Xzavier Brown. I think Arkansas is way more talented, more disciplined, and better coached. Arkansas has a size advantage at guard, which I think will be hard to defend. Oklahoma has some size with their bigs, but they struggle in transition and are not as athletic as Arkansas. I look for Arkansas to get to an early lead and push the pace, neutralizing Oklahoma’s bigs and causing foul trouble for Oklahoma’s guards.\n\nEdited to add unit size",

When he is in form, he is just so fun to watch. Unfortunately he just gets injured way too often to go on any longstreaks, but he is injury free again now. In his first game back from start he failed to get any on target, but managed five against Bayern Munich and should probably have had a goal with the chances he had, then last round away against Heidenheim he scored and had two on target.\n\nSt. Pauli is currently in the relegation zone which is not so surprising when you have only won once since the third round, that win came against the only team that is below them in the league table… So things aren’t going so hot for the host. \n\nDespite playing out wide on RB Leipzig’s left wing, he gets centrally very often. If you look at St. Pauli’s map over shots faced, you will see a lot of shots in areas Nusa thrives in. \n\nI see most bookies have it between 1.6-1.65, so one could add St. Pauli over 2.5 corners to boost the odds above evens (Coolbet gives 2.15). \n\n*St. Pauli has managed 3+ corners in:*\n\n* 3/3 h2h\n* 16/18 league games\n* 8/8 home games \n\n*RB Leipzig has given up 3+ corners in:*\n\n* 15/18 league games\n* 8/9 league games away ",

It seems as though he had no holes in his game most of the time except when his focus drops and becomes unrecognisable spraying errors for portions of matches. With how electric his game is it’s almost part of the fun he brings to the court as it can bring some momentary drama to his matches. He’s won 59 of his last 63 matches with only losses to Sinner and Norrie (lmao) but since the US Open it’s just felt like he’s gained a serious boost in consistency in his matches. Alcaraz has dropped just one set in grand slams since Flushing Meadows (against Sinner in the final) and has been dominant yet again here in Melbourne. Following two opening rounds where he was solid if unspectacular he did well to deal steamroll past Moutet’s tricky game and managed to beat Paul in straights in spite of the American playing the match of his life. Carlos is looking to be the youngest person ever to win the golden slam and has been getting better and better, when in confidence he can genuinely be unplayable in the literal sense of the term.\n\nAs I’ve said before De Minaur is a very consistently great player with a glass ceiling when playing against stronger opposition. He will give everything he’s got in front to the home crowd, play a lot of balls back but simply doesn’t have the weapons to harm the top of the top. To have a chance at being competitive with a Sinner or Alcaraz you have to either hope they’re having a truly terrible day or redline as they’re simply better in all aspects. It’s almost impossible to sustain such a level of intensity in BO5 like this but De Minaur physically doesn’t have the raw power to do such so I believe he doesn’t even win a set here. ADM loves rhythm which Alcaraz just doesn’t provide but won’t be able to get out of his metronomic style due to the Spaniard’s intensity putting him on the back foot which his opponent should feast on. I expect the demon’s serve to be largely neutralised in this match-up considering it’s already a weakness of his compared to the elite and with how well Carlos has been returning so far. As a result, ADM’s service games should be more contested than his opponent’s throughout the match. \n\nAs I said Carlitos does sometimes dip in quality in matches which is why asking him to not drop a set is risky but I believe fairer odds should be around the 1.9 mark and therefore see value. I have found that Alcaraz has been dropping the tempo in the less important moments (e.g. Moutet recovering from a double break in the second set) by playing with his food before turning the machine back on when it matters (still won 6-4). This seems similar to last year’s AO where De Minaur brushed aside the competition until reaching the quarters where he lost 3,2,1 to Sinner. BOL !",

      "text": "**Record:** 42-20-1 (+23.52u)\n\n**Last:** (CBB) Arizona -2.5 (1.5u) - W\n\n**POTD:** (CBB) No. 7 Michigan State (-13.5) at Rutgers\n\n**Start Time:** 6:30 PM ET (FS1)\n\n**Odds:** -110 (DraftKings)\n\n**Units:** 1.5U\n\n**Reasoning:** Death. Taxes. Vegas disrespecting Sparty.\n\nIf that Washington line was disrespectful, and if that Oregon line was downright blasphemous, then this line is straight up unforgivable. Especially given that we just got a good look at the disaster of a runaway train that is the Rutgers men’s basketball team when fading them for Friday’s POTD. \n\nBut mostly, it’s because Michigan State has been playing some of the best basketball in the country right now. \n\nSince a 58-56 loss at Nebraska back on Jan. 2, the Spartans (18-2) have reeled off six consecutive victories. All have come by 10 or more points with all but one by 16+. Even more impressive, is the fact that the team has done so by an average margin of victory of 22.7 points, including a 91-48 thumping of Maryland on Saturday. Not surprisingly, Michigan State’s recent form has helped it soar up to 4th in the KenPom rankings. \n\nAs is the case with most Tom Izzo-led squads, the defense has been the backbone. \n\nThrough 20 games, the unit finds itself among the nation’s elite, ranking 4th in scoring defense (62.8 PPGA), 6th in defensive efficiency (0.910), 7th in opponent field-goal percentage (38.8%) and 23rd in opponent three-point shooting (29.7%). But it’s the Spartans’ tendency to take it up a notch away from home that makes them a tough out, ranking 1st in defensive efficiency (0.901), 2nd in scoring defense (61.9 PPGA), 6th in opponent field-goal percentage (38.8%) and 31st in opponent three-point shooting (29.7%) on the road. Furthermore, ever since an uncharacteristic showing against lowly Cornell on Dec. 30—97 points allowed on 46% shooting—the unit has been in something of a flow state, conceding just 56.9 points on 37.8% shooting from the field (25.9% from beyond the arc) in seven outings. \n\nThat all adds up to what should be yet another lackluster offensive effort from the suddenly reeling Scarlet Knights (9-11). \n\nFollowing a 82-59 beatdown at the hands of Indiana last Friday, the team enters as losers of three straight and four of its last five. And while Rutgers already ranks among the worst in the country offensively—258th in offensive efficiency (1.010), 270th in three-point shooting (31.9%), 277th in scoring (69.7 PPG) and 330th in field-goal percentage (40.7%)—things only take a turn for the worse against stiffer competition. In six contests against opponents that rank Top 75 in defensive efficiency, the team averages just 59.2 points on a porous 37.5% shooting (29.8% from the perimeter). That includes being held to 37% shooting or worse in all but one of those games. \n\nUnfortunately for the Scarlet Knights, things don’t get much better defensively. \n\nOn the year, the team ranks 170th in scoring defense (74.5 PPGA), 196th in opponent field-goal percentage (44.8%), 239th in defensive efficiency (1.079) and 332nd in opponent three-point shooting (37.2%). Over the last three games, things have gone from bad to worse, as Rutgers has conceded 82.1 points on 48.5% shooting from the field (40.5% from beyond the arc). Not the kind of run of form you’d like to have when hosting a surging Michigan State offense that enters ranked 41st in field-goal percentage (47.9%), 47th in offensive efficiency (1.147), 71st in three-point shooting (35.8%) and 95th in scoring (79.1 PPG). \n\nBut while those numbers won’t jump out of the page at you, take a look at what the team has managed to do in its last six meetings against opponents that rank outside of the Top 200 in defensive efficiency:\n\nOregon (208): 68 points on 57% shooting (35% from beyond the arc)\nMaryland (278): 91 points on 61% shooting (47% from beyond the arc)\nToledo (286): 92 points on 51% shooting (43% from beyond the arc)\nPenn State (306): 76 points on 46% shooting (56% from beyond the arc)\nOakland (333): 79 points on 46% shooting (27% from beyond the arc)\nCornell (351): 114 points on 55% shooting (46% from beyond the arc)\n\nNot only did the Spartans go 6-0 in those contests, but they did so while averaging 86.7 points on 52.7% shooting (42.3% from long range). That includes shooting 51% or better in all but two games and shooting 43% or better from deep in all but two as well. \n\nIt will be the intangibles that will play an X factor in this one. \n\nMichigan State topped 30 fast break points against Maryland on Saturday, marking the third time this season the team has accomplished the feat—the rest of the Big Ten has only done so twice. Not surprisingly, the Spartans rank 7th in fast break points (17.3 PPG; 98th percentile). That’s an area the team should continue to thrive in against a Scarlet Knights team that ranks 156th in opponent fast break points (9.8 PPG; 57th percentile). But where the team truly struggles is in conceding second-chance opportunities to opponents, ranking 222nd in the category (11.7 PPG; 39th percentile). This is another area Michigan State should be able to take advantage, as the team ranks 28th in second-chance points (14.3 PPG); 92nd percentile). \n\nForget looking ahead. Expect Sparty to put together another dominant performance to springboard themselves into Friday night’s massive showdown with in-state rival Michigan. \n\nBOL if tailing, and as always, please do so responsibly. One bet should not have you crashing out all over Reddit.",

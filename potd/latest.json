      "text": "**POTD Record:** 5-2\n\n**Previous Pick:** Nick Woltemade ATGS (+110) ✅️\n\n**Today's Event:** UEFA World Cup Quals | Scotland vs Denmark (11:45AM PST)\n\n**Pick:** John McGinn 1+ SOT (+110) 1 units to win 1.1 units\n\n**Write Up:** Love me a sweat free plus money cash! Woltemade came through in the 19th minute with a header from a corner to net Germany their first of 6 goals on the day and clinch their spot in the World Cup. We also hit a +640 ATGS Parlay in the soccer thread. Great day overall! \n\nToday we head to Scotland where our hosts face off against Denmark in another winner take all match to decide the group. Winner goes to the World Cup, loser heads to the 16 team playoffs in March, where only 4 teams will make it in. Of additional note is that Denmark goes through with a tie, so Scotland will need to be on the attack here at home. I'm expecting an end to end match here with both teams needing (and expecting) a win here. I'd be shocked if we wind up 0-0 like the reverse fixture in Denmark back in September. \n\nDenmark have had a mildly disappointing World Cup Qualifier thus far, in a group that they were expecting to run away with, and are coming off a disappointing draw against Belarus at home a few days ago. Now here they are, fighting for a spot at the World Cup away from home. They will be aggressive and want the win here and likely control the ball much of the match (73% possession in their last match), which much like our Kvaratskhelia pick, suits us just fine for this pick. \n\nJohn McGinn, the captain of Aston Villa and 5th most capped Scotland player of all time, is my favorite kind of player to back. If you read any of my other write ups you'll notice a theme, but I really do like to back hard working midfielders/strikers who don't shy away from a challenge and always sprint to attack on breaks. Our guy McGinn obviously falls into this bucket and is a fun guy to watch on both ends of the pitch. McGinn has played all 90 minutes in every world cup qualifying match here and is the back-up captain for Scotland, so I see him playing the full 90 here again. We are getting good odds here as he has only hit this line in 2 of the 5 WC qualifying matches. But I've noticed a pattern that he tends to take more shots in the 2nd match of international breaks, hitting 1 SOT in all 3 of these matches this year. I'm also backing the intangibles a bit here, in that I like him to leverage his experience in the big game, take a few shots, and work hard to get his country to their first World Cup since 1998. \n\nBOL!",

Obviously once in a lifetime moment and Alex was rightfully posting airport beers with his girlfriend as he prepped to fly from Brisbane to Sydney. Alex Bolt is obviously the better player but I have to wonder where A) his head is at B) how fatigued his body is [this will be his 6th game in 7 days]. This line is way too wide and *at worst* I get a push off a 6-3,6-3 loss. BUT I also wouldn’t be shocked to see Alex come out flat footed and Takuya snags a sneaky S1. This is gonna be alot closer than the books are predicting. We’re on a silly streak right now come ride the hot hand and see why they NVS 🌟 \n\nIf you guys have cashed with my crazy streak and want to support: [BMAC☕️](https://buymeacoffee.com/nvsbets) [BTC](https://pastebin.com/0Lf0mHqu) [ETH](https://pastebin.com/D2QRi3Bx)",

      "text": "Record: 25-16\n\nForm (old to new): ✅ ✅❌✅❌ \n\nNet Units: +16.03\n\nYesterday's Pick: Netherlands v Lithuania. Netherlands -5 corners. 3u @ $1.85 ❌  \n\nSuper annoying. The Netherlands attacked the entire game. It was disappointing to see them just constantly recycle possession outside the box instead of putting a few balls in or getting some long shots away. \n\nI got on a hedge early in the second half, so I didn't lose money, but I was disappointed to miss the POTD. \n\nToday's Pick: Belgium to win to nil AND Romania to win to nil. 4u @ $1.78\n\nNot a hell of a lot to say here. Backing the two worst teams in Europe to not score and lose is pretty safe to me. Also, I got on this yesterday at $2.17, and it's already down to $1.78, so I'd expect it to go down more too. \n\nHowever, for the sake of the write-up. \n\nTop of the group, Belgium play at home against the bottom of the group, Liechtenstein. \n\nLichtenstein have lost every game and are yet to score, conceding 24 in the process. Last time these guys played, Belgium won 6-0. \n\nRomania had the wind knocked out of them against Bosnia a few days ago (great for us though). Even with that, I can't see them doing anything silly vs San Marino. \n\nThey might not be going at 100%, but San Marino to not score is always a good bet. ",

      "text": "Record: 55-44\n\n**Flensburg - Potaissa Turda** 🤾 Handball EHF European League\n\nPick: **Pințoiu Total Goals Under (4.5)** @ 1.85\n\nThis line is higher than expected! 3.5 would have been a more reasonable option. I see value here. Pințoiu is important in Turda's 9-meter line (especially LB/CB), but he's not the primary ball carrier. Shots are shared more evenly between Mošić and R. C. Ghiță; Kbilashvili is predominantly active on 7-meter shots. This limits \"easy scoring\" opportunities. Flensburg's central defense and goalkeeping quality (against 6-meter and 9-meter shots) should challenge Pințoiu. Below are his goals scored this season.\n\n| Universitatea Cluj | 35-32 | 0 goals\n\n| HC Buzău (D) | 29-32 | 0 goals\n\n| Dinamo București | 29-24 | 2 goals\n\n| CSM Sighișoara (D) | 33-23 | 4 goals\n\n| Bidasoa Irun | 33-34 | 7 goals\n\n| Saint‑Raphaël (D) | 24-42 | 2 goals\n\n| SG Flensburg‑Handewitt | 26-33 | 2 goals.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Track my sports betting picks on \\[POTD.LOL\\](https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/bigtime-operator-UqbzCr?utm\\_source=mdembed&utm\\_campaign=bigtime-operator) (since 09/01/25).\\*\\*\\*",

It comes as no suprise that San Marino are not given a great chance tomorrow. Sitting bottom of the group with a record of 0-0-7 with 1 goal scored and 32 goals against.. Romania on the other hand have missed the chance to qualify for the World Cup via the group and will have to settle for the playoffs. It appears they will field a strong team tomorrow and I would be suprised to see them win by 5+. However, I think the -2.5 handicap is the sweet spot, just incase they take their foot off the gas late on.\n\nPick 2 - Austria ML. Austria come into this game knowing a win or draw vs 2nd place Bosnia see’s them win the group and go to the World Cup. They come into the game with a record of 6-0-1 in the group having scored 21 goals and conceded only 3, impressively not conceding a single shot on target in their last game vs Cyprus. \n\nAustria are starting to look a very strong side under Ralf Ragnick and come into this game with no fresh injury concerns. Bosnia however have 3 players suspended. \n\nBosnia are a half decent side but it as very much been a case of them being the best of the rest in the group and Austria should be able to take control of the game and get the job done. I predict a 2-0 win for the hosts. \n\nAs always nothing is guaranteed in sport so bet responsibly.. but the facts point towards this being a winning play on a very regular basis.\n\nIf you appreciate my picks and are making money, any tip is appreciated link below for the research etc.\n\nhttps://paypal.me/PaymePlease9937\n\nBOL to those tailing and as always, see you on the other side  🫡🫡🫡",

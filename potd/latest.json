One team is trending upwards and the other heading the other direction. I know a lot of people will be looking to pick up all of the wide receiver props this game which I believe will turn out to be good picks in what has the makings to be a high scoring offensive affair. But Javonte Williams has certainly found his stride in the Dallas backfield this season and I believe he has a big game upcoming this week. \n\nJavonte Williams is a true workhorse, he currently ranks 1st in the league in snap share with 52.2 snaps per game. He currently averages 16.5 carries per game with the highest YPC average in his career (4.8).\n\nAlthough the Lions have been a top ranked run defender throughout this season, they have been leaky in their last 3. Over that span they have been allowing 131 yards average per game and over 52% of their opponents offensive snaps were runs. \n\nWilliams has hit the over in rushing yards in 9/12 games this year and I predict with his usage alone he will clear this line.\n\nTail or fade BOL to everyone and cheers! 🍻",

For today’s pick I’m heading to the Netherlands again, where the numbers point strongly in one direction: goals.\n\nDe Graafschap’s last four away games have been absolute chaos, producing 19 goals in total. That’s an average of 4.75 goals per match, with over 3.5 goals cashing in three of those four and both teams scoring in all four. Their away matches are wide open, full of chances, and usually turn into end-to-end football.\n\nVitesse at home follow the same pattern. Three of their last four home games have also gone over 3.5 goals, and BTTS landed in three of them. They’ve been leaky defensively but dangerous going forward, exactly the type of matchup that fits perfectly with De Graafschap’s high-tempo away style.\n\nWith both teams consistently producing high-scoring games and both conceding regularly, this has all the ingredients for another goal-heavy affair.\n\nPick: Over 3.5 Goals\nStake: 2 units\n\nLet’s look for a bounce-back winner here",

Partizan have not yet found a new coach, and if i remember correctly the new interim coach will be Mirko Ocokoljic, one of the staff of Zeljko's time in Partizan.\n\nNow, Partizan is playing at home and shock therapy proved to be very effective in european basketball, i don't feel it is going to be as effective as always. Firstly, Partizan didn't get any new players, Carlik Jones is still injured, and the only one who can be a replacement for him is a 36yo Nick Calathes... \n\nSecond, Partizan fans are currently very hostile to both its club president, and their own players, one for getting rid of their best coaches in their history, and the players because of their non-commitment in their way of playing. Frankly i expect a very hostile arena, which will probably not be fully sold out, which will lessen the impact of home advantage.\n\nNow, i think this sits on the shoulders of Bayern to not be completely shit, and that's why i gave Bayern a sizeable 6 point lead because even if somehow Partizan starts playing better immediatly, which i don't feel like it will happen, i think Bayern can keep it close or to say Partizan will beat itself to death( note 25:0 series against Panathinaikos, 16:2 against ASVEL, and 20:0 against Monaco).\nBOL to everyone who tails🍀",

      "text": "POTD Record: 0 - 0 \n\nPrev Pick : Knicks -8.5 @1.8 1u to win 0.8u ( Pending )\n\nNet Profit : -\n\nEvent: NFL |  Cowboys @ Lions | 8.15PM EST\n\nPOTD: Jared Goff O249.5 Pass Yds @1.8 1u to win 0.8u\n\nWrite Up:  \n \n\nListen, I’m not saying Jared Goff is suddenly turning into peak Marino, but the man’s been dealing this season like he’s trying to get a Christmas bonus early. He’s averaging around 252 yards per game, which means this 249.5 line is basically the sportsbook saying, “Yeah, let’s hope he has an off day.” Cute.\n\nAnd let’s talk matchup,  the Dallas Cowboys pass defense has been more generous than a grandma on thanksgiving , they’re giving up about 251.5 passing yards per game, which is literally above the line we need. So unless the Lions decide to turn into the 1985 Bears and run it 45 times, Goff is gonna have opportunities. Volume is there, matchup is there, and the man loves a clean pocket like he loves a good play action rollout.\n\nPlus Goff already cleared this number in 7 of 12 games this year. That’s 58% and now he gets a defense that lets opposing QBs move the ball like a morning traffic jam. One or two chunk plays to whoever’s healthy, and suddenly you’re staring at 260+ yards before you can say “Cash me out.”\n\nSo yeah, Goff over 249.5 isn’t just a bet. It’s a polite handshake between him and the over column. If he doesn’t hit it, I’m checking the Wi-Fi, because something glitchy had to happen.\n\nDrop the ticket. Let the yards fly. ✈️📈",

      "text": "__POTD Record:__ 58-28-1 (+66.95u) *4-Win Streak*\n\n__Previous Pick:__ [✅TreVeyon Henderson o63.5 rushing yards (-115), 3.45u](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/s/mlyldOGxu6)\n\n__Event:__ NFL: Cowboys @ Lions 8:15pm EST\n\n__POTD:__ *Same Game Parlay:* George Pickens 60+ receiving yards & Jameson Williams 60+ receiving yards (-120), __5u to win 4.17u__\n\n__Write Up:__ Couldn’t let 2025 end without a __5u MAX bet.__ The Dallas Cowboys (6-5-1) are traveling to Detroit to take on the Lions (7-5). The Lions are coming off a 24-31 loss to the Packers at home on Thanksgiving, their 3rd loss in their last 5. Dallas is coming off a 31-28 win over the Chiefs also on Thanksgiving, extending their 3 game win streak, with 2 straight wins vs last year's Super Bowl finalists. The Cowboys defense has been atrocious, but their offense has been one of the best in the NFL. __Dallas is averaging 29.3 points per game, 2nd best in the league.__ Against another high powered offense in Detroit, the Cowboys should put up more big numbers.\n\nThis Dallas offense is coming in hot, scoring 24+ in 3 straight games, including two 30+ point games. Their high scoring has come from the elite trio of QB Dak Prescott & WR’s George Pickens & CeeDee Lamb. __Dak has been slinging it, averaging 8.7 yards per pass (2nd in NFL). That’ll continue vs a Detroit defense that’s allowed the 3rd most yards per pass in their last 3 (7.9 yards) & have given up the 3rd most yards per pass (11.9) this year.__ But not only has Dallas been throwing the deep ball a ton, they’ve also been doing so efficiently. __The Cowboys lead the league in EPA as a passing offense (117.8). Detroit is last in the league in EPA as a pass d over the last 4 weeks (-37.1).__ Dak has thrown for 300+ yards in back to back weeks vs stout defenses in the Chiefs & Eagles. He has thrown multiple passing TD’s in 7 of his last 9 games. He’s avg the most passing yards per game in the NFL (271.8), while also being the only QB with over 300+ completions. His 75.3 QBRating leads the NFL. Their offense has ran the ball at low rates this season. The Cowboys rank 26th in run play % (40.5%). They’ve averaged just 1.62 yards before contact (7th worst), while Detroit has been decent allowing around the league avg at 1.76 ybc. When the Cowboys have had success on the ground it has come from Zone concepts with a 51.8% success rate (7th), compared to Gap runs that have a 44.3% success rate (28th). The bad news for Dallas is Detroit is the 3rd in the NFL at defending Zone runs, allowing just 3.47 YPC (3rd) & a 41.1% success rate (3rd). Dallas is going to air it out a ton this game, as the Lions have been getting burned by the deep ball lately. __Detroit gives up the 2nd most explosive passes (20+ yard passes) in the NFL (5.7%). They’ve allowed 41 catches of 20+ yards, & 6 of 40+ yards. Since Week 10, when defending passes of 20+ Air Yards, Detroit has allowed: 17.6 yards/attempt (31st), 137.1 passer rating (32nd), 52.0% completion % (31st), 3 pass TDs (32nd), & a -1.12 EPA/dropback (32nd).__ An even crazier stat I found myself going through every single Detroit Box Score in their last 20 games dating back to last season: __The Lions have allowed a 30+ yard reception to a receiver in TWENTY straight games dating back to Nov 2024 when the Jags failed to do so. Detroit has allowed 24 plays of 30+ yards, 2nd most. Dallas has 25 plays of 30+ yards, tied with Lions for most in NFL. The Lions gave up huge gains the last 2 weeks, allowing a league high 17.1 yards per completion to Winston & Love.__ They specifically got torched on passes down the sidelines. Love went 12/19, 165 yards (8.7 YPA), 4 TDs, 130.5 passer rating. Winston was 16/24, 364 yards (15.2 YPA), 2 TDs, 137.5 passer rating. Love’s 4 TDs are the most in a single game on sideline passes over the last 4 seasons. Winston’s 364 yards are the most in a single game on sideline passes over the same span. Cowboys WR George Pickens owns the sidelines. Pickens has had 78+ yards in 7 consecutive games. Since Week 4 he is averaging 108 receiving yards/game. He has the 2nd most receiving yards in the NFL with 1,142 yards. The Steelers traded Pickens this past offseason, their entire WR core has just 1,082 yards. Since Lamb came back from injury, he has tied Pickens in target share (27.8%) with 39.2% of the air yards (10th most) in that span. But where Pickens has excelled the most has been against man coverage. __The Lions are playing man coverage on a league high 40.8% of passing plays. Pickens has 14 receptions of 20+ yards vs man this season, most in NFL (next highest 9). He has 504 rec yds vs man, (next highest 321). Pickens has been targeted on 35.3% of his routes for 4.96 yards per route vs man. CeeDee Lamb averages just 2.44 YPR, as he’s more of the zone threat. When Detroit is out of man, they run single high safety 61.4% of plays, 3rd highest. Pickens has 27.7% of targets & 47.9% of the air yards vs single high coverage.__ Dak excels against man too, ranking 9th in completion rate (59.8%) & 6th in yards per pass (8.0 Y/A). Dak & Pickens are going to connect a ton, & Pickens could clear 100 yards for 3rd time in 4 games.\n\nI’m running out of room but Jameson Williams is now the #1 receiver in Detroit as the Lions will be without star WR Amon-Ra St Brown & TE Sam LaPorta. St. Brown left the game last week vs Green Bay after one drive with a sprained ankle. __Williams stepped up & had a career high 37% target share (4th in NFL), had a 1st Read % of 28.6%, & caught 7/10 targets for 144 yards & a TD.__ That is the highest target share in a single week of his career & something St. Brown has only had 4 times in his 5 year career. He led the NFL in receiving yards last week & had the 2nd highest PFF grade among WR’s (91.2), & that was against the 4th best pass defense in the league (GB allows 284 pass yds 4th). Now he gets one of the worst pass defenses in the NFL this week. __The Cowboys have given up the most passing yards in the NFL (3,234). They’ve allowed 168 receiving yards per game to receivers (4th most).__ Dallas has had a great run defense since acquiring Quinnen Williams on the DL. __Over the past 3 weeks they’ve allowed 3.3 YPC to RB’s (3rd) & allowing 0.33 yards before contact (4th). Detroit ranks 27th in rushing success rate (38.1%).__ Detroit is tied with Dallas in plays gaining 30+ yards on offense (25) & I expect them to air it out.\n\nThese offenses rank 2nd & 3rd in scoring, while each pass d is weak. Detroit had its best games following losses this year, scoring 52, 44, & 34 points. Dallas has scored 57.25 more points than their projected totals, 2nd in NFL. These defenses rank 27th & 30th in red zone TD conversion %. This will be a shootout. \n\nPickens has 68+ in 10/11 games. Williams has 66+ in 5/7 games & all 5 were with Amon-Ra on the field.\n\n__George Pickens 60+ receiving yards & Jameson Williams 60+ receiving yards__\n\nAppreciate the love!

      "text": "Last 5 POTD : ✅️❌️❌️✅️✅️\n\n**Previous pick**: Slovakia over 1.5 total goals (-120) ✅️ (2nd goal overturned in the 1st period but they manage to get it done in the 2nd period!)\n\n**POTD Record**: 25-21\n\n**Today's Pick:** Czech Republic vs Switzerland 6:10 am EST (Olympics/Men's Hockey)\n\nCzech Republic over 2.5 total goals (-130)\n\nTwo teams that need a win and goals in order to get the bye in the next round for the quarterfinals. Both teams have pretty much the same amount of NHL players so I'm going with who has the most skilled/experienced players. Czech Republic have Pastrnak, Necas, and Hertl who are lights out in the NHL this season. For Switzerland, although they have better defenders in Roman Josi and JJ Moser, they simply do not have the same firepower that Czechia has especially with the loss of Kevin Fiala in their last game vs Canada. The closest to a NHL point per game player that they have is Nico Hischier and he's not close. Another interesting fact that I saw about the Czech team is that only **one player** in the team didn't play in the NHL. Most of them have at least 100+ matches played in the NHL before going to Europe. Meanwhile Switzerland has 9 players who currently play in the NHL and everybody else **never** played a single game in the NHL. To me this will come down to skill and experience which Czechia is better in both so I expect 2 scenarios. First one is Czechia overpowers Switzerland with their talent and puts up plenty of goals OR the second scenario is that Switzerland puts up a good defensive effort and Czechia gets their third goal in an empty net. I just don't see Czechia only scoring 2 goals or less especially with goals being this important for the standings. \n\nFinally, although they didn't have NHL players playing in that tournament, the last time Czechia played vs Switzerland was in the 2025 IIHF World Championship and Czechia won 5-4. Why am I bringing this up? Because the goalie for Switzerland will be the same that will be starting tomorrow so if he can get scored on 5 times with no NHL players imagine with them being there.\n\nBOL!",

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 33-44-5 (Avg Odds +125)\n\n**Last 5:** (most recent on left) ❌️✅️❌️✅️✅️\n\n**Previous Pick:** West Ham -1.5 (+105) ❌️\n\n**Today's Event:** English FA Cup (Soccer) | Arsenal vs Wigan (8:30 AM PST)\n\n**Pick:**  Eberechi Eze ATGS (+110) 1 unit to win 1.1 units\n\n**Write Up:** I guess that's what you get sometimes when you back bad teams. Absolutely terrible offensive showing from West Ham. Nothing more to be said. \n\nThe FA Cup continues today and we are back to a player prop today and we're taking a player who is \"due\". Eze has really yet to click with his Arsenal team, after making the early season move over from Palace. This seems like the perfect opportunity for Eze to arrive. He is far too talented to continue his scoring drought. Eze has only scored 4 goals this season, 3 of them in one match back in November. I'm thinking he will slot into the #10 role and get some chances to shoot from the edge of the box, which is his most dangerous zone. \n\nWigan are two tiers below Arsenal in England's 3rd tier (League One) and are 22nd in League One to boot. They've got a relegation battle on their hands and I don't see them being up for the task defensively away against Arsenal. BOL and happy Sunday!",

      "text": "**Record:** 2-0-0\n\n**Last Pick:** Trabzonspor vs Fenerbahce BTTS Yes & Over 2.5 Goals ✅\n\n**Football | Turkish Super League | 17:00 UTC+3**\n\n**Match:** Goztepe vs Kayserispor\n\n**Pick:** Goztepe ML\n\n**Write Up:** Goztepe are among the best defensive teams in the league and are keen to stay in the race for a European spot. I don’t see them slipping up against a struggling Kayserispor side down in the bottom half. They’re unbeaten in their last 8 games, and I’m confident they’ll keep that streak going.\n\nI was originally going to pick a different game, but the odds were too low so I switched.\n\n2/2 so far, hope it keeps going like this.",

Despite the low performances for Athletic Bilbao in away games, in such game, the experience & quality should make the difference.  \n\\- Oviedo is expected to focus on defensive organization and counterattacks, with limited offensive opportunities throughout the match.  \n\\- Expect a positive outcome, in the worst scenario - a draw.\n\n\\- FC Red Bull Salzburg has significantly higher squad quality and attacking depth, allowing them to dominate phases of the game and create consistent scoring pressure against weaker opponents like Grazer AK ( 19-31 GD ).  \n\\- Grazer AK tends to struggle defensively against top-tier teams, often conceding momentum and chances over time, making it difficult for them to remain competitive across both halves. - FC Red Bull Salzburg’s previous match was well below their usual standards, as they failed to score despite having an offside goal minutes after conceding 2 in the first half. However, scoring is typically a consistent strength for Salzburg, given their attacking quality and offensive structure. Therefore, this match is expected to present better attacking efficiency and a higher number of goals.\n\nLET'S LOCK THIS IN.",

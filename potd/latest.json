PSV’s attacking depth and relentless tempo often overwhelm weaker defenses, and they are capable of scoring three or more goals alone. Groningen tends to struggle when pressed high and usually concedes chances against top teams. If PSV scores early, the game can open quickly, increasing the likelihood of a high-scoring, one-sided match.\n\n",

Their top rival is only 3 pts behind them so they cannot afford to lose any points. They are also the one team in the league that gets special treatment by the refs on the regular; this is a hot and controversial topic yet being a regular watcher of the league I personally can attest to there being truth to it. While they may have some rotation in their starting eleven due to the fixture (they just played a cup game 3 days ago), this is a team they should easily beat regardless.",

They’ve looked like a team that knows exactly how they want to play the game. Strong early setups, clear mid-game plans, and decisive calls once they get a lead. Even when games get messy, they don’t panic, which is huge in a best-of setting.\n\nVitality, on the other hand, have struggled with consistency. They tend to give away too much early pressure and often rely on opponents making mistakes rather than forcing plays themselves. Against a team like Los Ratones, that’s a problem. Ratones are comfortable punishing overextensions and snowballing small advantages into wins.\n\nAnother key factor is drafting and game identity. Los Ratones usually draft comps that are straightforward to execute and fit their players well, while Vitality have shown some questionable drafts that leave them scaling without control. If Los Ratones get even a slight draft edge, they’re very good at converting that into tempo and objective control.\n\nOverall, this matchup favors the cleaner, more disciplined team and right now, that’s Los Ratones. If they play their standard game and don’t overcomplicate things, they should be in control for most of the series.",

Either Sam Darnold plays the way he’s been playing, in which he’ll absolutely deserve the MVP, or he’ll start seeing ghosts again, in which case the Seahawks won’t even win the game. The only way I see JSN winning MVP is if Darnold turns the ball over more than once and JSN accounts for a huge percentage of the receiving yards and touchdowns, but again, if that’s the case, I don’t see Seattle winning. Given Darnold just had his best game of his career on the biggest stage last game, I like the former.\n\nNow that we’ve established this, our bet essentially becomes Seahawks ML with better odds. I like for this to be a defensive battle, and given that the Patriots OLine has been shaky and Drake Maye quietly has not been good this postseason, Seahawks should come out on top. Even with a defensive battle, Darnold has too many weapons at his disposable and has been playing too well to lose, or win and not earn MVP.\n\nRemember to only bet what you can afford to lose, and BOL!",

Tactically, she's a bad match up for Sangakew, who doesn't have the power to break through Tagger's defense or the serve to keep her at bay. While backing a player who had a decently long week in Dubai is risky, i think Sangakew simply doesn't have the weapons to punish any potential fatigue. Just hoping she doesnt withdraw.\n\nLeg 2 - Nothing much to say here. Just supporting my favorite team in Japan. Going slightly conservative since this cup really doesnt mean much & most top teams will try to experiment here, so these matches are going to penalties (basically, the league stage matches also need to have a result, so we have the normal flow of FT > ET > Pens for every match, till we get a result)\n\nHope we get the W & BoL",

I’m on the Seahawks side here and could see them winning the 7+. Even though they’ve obviously made the SB, I haven’t been very impressed in their wins in the playoffs. This Seahawks team is different than the beat up o-line of the chargers and the inept offenses of the Texans and Broncos.\n\nRhamondre has been above this line in all 3 of their playoffs games this year, but it’s going to be tough to get there on Sunday. He got 25 carries in the AFC Championship game due a lot to the weather. His rush attempts line is around 15 and he will be going against the number 1 defense in the league in yard per carry to the RB position\n\nGood Luck!",

League model putting this at 76% chance of hitting at +140 money, meaning it is incredible value/ROI play\n\n***Baus U 2.5 Kills Map 1 (-182)*** (Teams: Vitality vs. Los Ratones)\n\n* Baus is averaging 1.1 kills per map as top laner despite having a 50% winrate, 10th/10 top laners in the league. Baus is averaging a horrendous, -1037 XP at 15 min, and a -933 gold differential at 15 min, by far the worst metrics in the league, on top of this, teams will ban his sion every game, so he is left picking stuff he isn't nearly as comfortable on. So far this split he has a 1/10 hitrate in maps, with a 0/5 hitrate in losses averaging 0.8 kills per map loss. Vitality are -154 favorites and I think this is a bad matchup for the rats as much as I am rooting for them. I think this line is a near guarantee in map losses, and a <75% chance in map wins. Baus actually played a great lane today, got his gragas, arguably his second best champ outside of sion which he will never get,\n* For my money, **Naak Nako (Vitality top) has been the best top laner of the tournament** so far to my eye test. Naak Nako is averaging **the best GD/15, XP/15 and 3rd best CSD/15, all categories Baus is last it.** Also they should ban Sion + Gragas as Baus has looked significantly worse off of these two and has had two very strong gragas games and force him back on the things he struggles on. Naak Nako leads the LEC for top laners in solo kills with 6, this is a disaster matchup can't stress it enough\n* Lifetime Baus has a 1/27 hitrate in map losses, this is gonna be his hardest lane yet imo, I think today SK showed what NOT to do against Ratones, by picking a tank top laner and not punsihing Baus, expecting this to change tomorrow and Naak Nako and Vitality to play heavily thru top, if Ratones will win, it will be because of Nemesis/Crownie as most of their wins have been, think Vitality will stomp Ratones\n\n***Wunder U 4.5 Kills Map 1 (-182)*** (Teams: SK Gaming vs. Shifters)\n\n* The model didn't see the vision on this line at first until I fed it more data, this is why stats without context arent' always good. Wunder is leading all top laners in kills at 3.5 kills per map, and has had the second best laning stats in the LEC, despite this, a 4.5 kill line for any top laner is absolute insanity which I will break down a bit more below. As for Wunder though, his kill average is driven way up by two double digit kill games, with 10 kills on Kennen and 11 kills on Rumble. Despite this inflated line, Wunder is averaging just 3.5 kills per map this split, this is the highest, with only 3/12 top laners in the LEC averaging < 3 kills per map\n* Wunder took 2025 off, but for extra data, can go back to 2024, Wunder averaged 1.9 kills in 45 maps played, with a 40% winrate overall. During this time, Wunder had a 0/27 hitrate in map losses, and a 1/18 hitrate in map wins. Giving him a combined 1/45 hitrate in 2024, and a 0/7 hitrate in map losses this split and 2/3 hitrate in wins. Combined 3/55 hitrate last 2 years, and 0/34 in map losses\n* For top lane kill averages, in the 4 major regions for league, there are 44 top laners, only 1/44 top laners is averaging 4.5 kills (Kiin, with a 100% winrate), only 1 other is averaging 4 kills, 42/44 top laners are averaging <4 kills, 34/44 top laners are averaging kills, on top of this, a portion of top lane meta right now is tanks, if any tank is locked in, this line is a near guaranteed under off the bat, no matter win or loss. Ksante is a tank with a bit more kill threat, rumble is a kill threat, then Sion is third who is another tank meaning 2/3 of the most played top laners are tanks, in total so far in LEC, tanks have made up \\~42% of top laners picked this split so far\n* SK are eliminated from playoffs, Shifters are technically still in all tho the road is hard. I favor them in this matchup, think bot matchup in particular is very favorable",

For those eight games, they are averaging 154 rushing yards per game. Vrabel wants to control the clock. Stevenson and Maye have showed this playoff that they can be relied on to run, so why not take one of their player props? Henderson has the home run potential as he may be the fastest player on the field (hit over 22 mph on multiple runs this year). I can see the Seahawks stuffing the box against the Patriots. Henderson has been a non-factor in the playoffs, making him an intriguing play for the Super Bowl (especially if he gets good yards on his first few touches). Seahawks allow 92 yards a game against the run, which ranks very high in the league. I’m just betting that the game stays close enough that Vrabel calls a few extra run plays and they can get those 17 extra yards.",

Heroic is fielding a 16-year-old rookie, TaiLung, who looked fine against a lower-tier team, but today he has to lane against bzm, one of the best midlaners in the world.

While Heroic was scrapping for their lives against Rekonix and showing all their strategies, Tundra was resting and watching their games.

Silkeborg coach Kent Nielsen has openly highlighted the team’s many “offensive essences” in his pre-match press build-up, naming several attacking profiles and making it clear that Silkeborg intend to play proactively at home despite their defensive issues this season. With Silkeborg needing points to stay clear of the relegation battle, a passive setup is unlikely. From Viborg’s side, motivation is just as strong: they sit only two points from the Top 6 and face a brutal upcoming schedule, making this a game where they must push for a win. Tactically, the matchup favors Viborg scoring multiple times. Silkeborg’s possession-based 4-3-3/4-2-3-1 under Nielsen involves high full-backs and aggressive positioning between the lines, a structure that has repeatedly left space in transition. Viborg are well suited to exploit this, sitting compact before attacking vertically through quick combinations and wide overloads into the channels behind Silkeborg’s advanced defenders. With Silkeborg unlikely to abandon their proactive style and Viborg confident after a strong winter and positive test matches, the tactical and motivational setup strongly supports Viborg scoring two or more goals, making Over 1.50 goals a compelling angle.\n\n",

Bublik got an easy 6-0, 6-3 win to start, and later in the day Gojo finished things off after moving from -364 to -453 pre-match. \n\nToday, I'm fading the 18-year-old local talent Mees Rottgering in a situation where I see him being overmatched. Rottgering did really well to get past Kyrian Jacquet after being bageled in the first set, but his performance rating came in at just 6.31/10. Roberto Carballes Baena may not be a natural hard-court player, but he does have experience in all conditions, and he already scored a nice win over Pablo Carreño Busta with a 7.16/10. Another factor to consider is that Jacquet was a much bigger favorite than RCB is here, even though I don't see a huge level gap between them. Even if Rottgering has a strong serve and overall game for his age, he still doesn't feel fully developed as a player, and I don't think that's going to cut it against someone like RCB. These courts are indoors, but they don't play lightning-fast, and that works to the benefit of the more consistent Spaniard.",

So there is no push/void here. The second point is the odds being really weird here. Feyenoord have a huge motivation to win this game, sure it’s an away game. They are aiming for second place on the table, which gives direct Champions League placement. Utrecht on the other hand, seems to sit safe from relegation so far. The thing is that Feyenoord won the last two away games vs Utrecht and this handicap hit. Another weird thing here is the fact that the odds are so high for Feyenoord just to win at 2,17 (time of writing). That’s just ridiculous in my opinion. Either they know something which we don’t or they completely misplaced the odds. I’m thinking the latter and I’ll gladly take those 4,2 odds with a handicap on. \n\n\n\nNot much to say besides Feyenoord being the stronger team here and having the potential to completely outplay their opponents in this league. The exceptions are of course PSV and Ajax, who usually finish on the top every year. Handicap results here are quite common just like in the Portuguese league, where a gap between the top and the rest seems to remain.\n\n\n\nI’m trying to keep track of the results in all the top leagues. I had way too many games to pick from Sunday, and honestly almost got a headache from trying to choose one. My goal is to have something around the 3x odds barrier or higher. This one qualified well and we will **always aim for** **long term** gains. I will try to post another pick in the coming days. Seems like a good week is coming, with lots of league football to pick from. Good luck everyone.\n\nBookie: **Coolbet** and a **5** unit bet.

This may hold especially true with the Patriot’s defensive that will most definitely be pressuring Darnold all day.",

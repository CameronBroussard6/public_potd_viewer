Should have done something more conventional instead of trying to be unique.\n\nPick: **Max Verstappen to win and Lando Norris to podium** | Formula 1 | 8AM ET | (1.95 on FD) (3 units)\n\n**Writeup:** This can be found on Fanduel under MotorSports Specials. Its also on Draftkings but worse odds and likely Bet365.\n\nMax has an aggressive race start so he should stay in 1st after the 1st corner. All Lando has to do to win the drivers championship is get a podium which should be done since hes starting 2nd with his teammate in 3rd in one of the best cars. I think Lando doesn't attack too hard since if he crashes, he doesn't win the drivers championship. He needs a podium which he can easily get with moderately safe driving. McLaren will focus on getting Norris a podium and not 1st place. Feel good about this one.",

He’s drawn more double teams, which creates more open shooters which he’s doing a good job of finding. He’s gone over this line 8 of the last 10 games. Toronto is in the bottom 10 teams in the league for team rebounds. I think JB has a big game, draws a lot of double teams, finds the open man, and makes an impact across the stat sheet. BOL! \n\n**And for all my fellow Celtics fans, Lets get another Celtics win ☘️☘️☘️**",

Curry is listed as questionable, but I’m almost sure they’re planning his return for the T-Wolves game at home on Friday. Without Curry and most likely butler too, this warriors team is going to play slow and keep this score low. \n\nThe bulls have not shown the ability to score points against any kind of tough defense. I would hammer this line and play it all the way down to 220, which is where I expect it to be around game time. BOL!",

The Seahawks do give up some yards to the TE, so I could see a lot of plays to Pitts and not a lot to Mooney down the field. \n\nKirk had a tough time with down the field throws in their last game, despite totaling 234 yards passing.\n\nSeattle needs this game to keep pace in their division, so I think they will be ready and on top of their game on both sides of the ball. \n\nGood luck!",

No seriously I died and was reincarnated into a slightly better form of myself. Not really but it makes me feel better saying it….Sunday morning we have ourselves a heater of a snooker match, the UK Championship FINALS! Judd trump vs Mark Selby. Trump is coming in with a potential B2B championship win, Selby is coming in most recently the 2016 champion. They both have two UK Championships under their belt and I believe Trump has one more appearance. But those were different years. Today/tomorrow we’re talking about 2025. Trump has reached 3 other finals in ranking matches in 2025 while Selby has reached 3 others as well and one two, NOTABLY the Champion of Champions final where he BEAT Trump 10-5… I know Trump is overdue for a Win but I just don’t believe it’s tomorrow. Selby is the KING of safeties and escaping them when it matters. Trump looked a little shaky vs Robertson today until he found his grove AFTER going down 3-2 today, I dint see Selby giving up a lead as easy as Robertson did. This entire tournament Selby has been IN CHARGE, winning 6-2,6-2,6-2 an 6-3. Although Trump leads their overall head-to-head, Selby’s recent victories and experience in long, tactical matches give him an edge in a best-of-19 final where patience, safety play, and momentum matter as much as heavy scoring. MARK recently said, this season he’s “found something” and I think he’ll find his second silverware versus Trump and for PLUS money.\n\nIf you’re down for a good ole fashion 6hr snooker match tomorrow, hop on the train!\n\nBOL AND ALWAYS OVER BET! Just remember Snooker is a silly sport, this shit could be a blood bath on either side, but as a wise man once said, “There will be BLOOD”\n\n![gif](giphy|iK7k1cqxaiOnS)",

This team hasn’t lost two consecutive games at Allen fieldhouse since February of 2018. The tigers are coming off a hard fought loss at notre dame which was their first true  road test. Not to mention they have had the easiest cake walk of a schedule in all of college basketball. Three point shooting has been one of their main strengths yet Kansas comes into this matchup holding their opponents to the 5th best three point percentage in the nation. My power ratings make this Kansas -8 regardless. This is a win. Not to mention. Darryn Peterson could be back 👀 \n\nPackers: \nThe bears might just be the luckiest team in the NFL. They have a bottom 5 SOS. They barely beat the 6-6 Steelers by 3 points, they barely beat a 4-8 Vikings team by 2 points last minute. The 2-11 giants by 4 points. And allowed 42 points to the bengals. Lost to the 6-6 ravens by 14. Beat the 3-9 commanders by 1 point on a Game winning field goal. The 2-10 raiders by 1 point. And allowed 52 points and got their ass handed to them by the 7-5 lions and lost week 1 to that same Vikings team. The packers are top 5 in total defense and top 10 in total offense and have revenge from last years loss at home to the bears. Public is also all over the bears and they do not even have Odunze. This is also a win.\n\nLet’s get after it fellas. As always, cheers 🍻\n\nOdds have now changed for anyone looking to place since Kansas has gone from 4.5 to 6.5",

The weather is supposed to be atrocious tomorrow, with pouring rain throughout most of the game.\n\nThe Colts will be without DeForest Buckner as well, which hurts their rushing defense. The Jags have run well most of this year, despite last week's odd result. The Jags had very few long drives, opting instead for chunk plays and short fields.\n\nI think he easily hits this super low line, as he has most games this year with Brenton Strange on the field.",

      "text": "Apologies to those of you who have started following me over the last couple of weeks, it’s been really brutal. Gonna switch up my pick philosophy as my personal plays based on gut calls have been doing so so much better than these picks that I put way more research into. Pretty ironic, but it’s time to turn things around for the holiday season.\n\nRecord: 27-19 (+23.14u)\n\nLast 10:✖️✖️💰✖️✖️💰💰✖️✖️✖️\n\nLast POTD: 🏈 George Pickens longest reception over 25.5 yards ✖️\n\nWriteup: Pickens reminded us why the Steelers let him walk. Lackadaisical, low effort, out of it. Dak threw a perfect 30+ yard pass right to Pickens at the end of the game and he put in zero effort to get it and let it drop right by his feet.\n\nToday’s POTD: 🏈 Commanders ML (-124).\n\nGame starts at 1pm EST. Bet 3.25U\n\nWriteup: Welcome to day 1 of my new pick mentality. For this pick, give me my Commanders winning straight up against the Vikings. \n\nJayden Daniels had the greatest rookie QB season of all time last season, and finally has all of his wide receivers healthy for the first time this season. On the other side, J.J. McCarthy might be the worst starting QB in football. The Vikings have one of the best receiving cores in the league, but McCarthy has completely stifled any and all offensive momentum and playmaking for his players. \n\nOn defense, the Commanders defense has not been good, at all. However, Dan Quinn took over the defensive play calling a few weeks ago, and they look like a completely different defense. Still not great, but they are playing with a completely different energy. The Vikings have a much better defense on paper, especially in the pass game. However, these stats are completely skewed thanks to them getting to go up against the Bengals when Jake Browning was the starting QB. Take this game out, and the Vikings are the 22nd best defense in football. \n\nSo for arguments sake, we’ll call these 2 defenses pretty equal, and I’ll take this Jayden Daniels led defense over J.J. McCarthy any day of the week. Commanders win this one outright.\n\nRemember to only bet what you can afford to lose, and BOL! ",

Dortmund are third in the Bundesliga and are a strong attacking team at Signal Iduna Park, while Hoffenheim are fifth with 23 points and have had both teams score in five of their last seven games away from home, proving they will definitely have high chance of scoring. Dortmund have dominated this fixture historically, winning 8 of their last 10 meetings against Hoffenheim. Both teams are on unbeaten streaks in the league, with Dortmund unbeaten for almost two months and Hoffenheim unbeaten in six consecutive league matches, meaning both teams will attack and create chances instead of playing defensively. Hoffenheim are ranked second away from home in the entire Bundesliga and have scored 12 goals in their last five games, so they will come to Dortmund with confidence and attack-minded football, while Dortmund have scored 10 goals in their last five home games, meaning both teams have the quality to break through and score goals. The win or draw protection gives you safety in case Dortmund only draw, while the both teams to score requirement is almost guaranteed based on the last four to five meetings where both sides found the back of the net every single time. \n\n\nIf you found these picks helpful, tips or donations are greatly appreciated as they support the time and effort I put into creating them: [buy me a beer🍻](https://buymeacoffee.com/hercules.son.of.zeus)",

While that may happen to some extent, a closer look at the data suggests a run-heavy script. \n\nBengals D: Yes they give up a lot of yards through the air (265/game - 6th most) but they are even worse defending the run (RB's rush for over 128/game against them- worst in the NFL).\n\nBills D: Is a funnel rush defense - giving up the third most rushing yards (113/game) while having the stingiest pass defense in the league (177/game - 1st) \n\nThis matches up well with where both offenses have been recently. The Bills have a receiver problem. Kincaid went down, Coleman had been a healthy scratch for weeks before they couldnt find anyone else to catch the ball, Gabe Davis sucks, and Shakir - their only decent wideout - had 1 catch for 5 yards last week against Pittsburgh. In fact the Bills overall had 125 total pass yards against the Steelers D which was second worst in the league against the pass (263/game). That same game James Cook, on the other hand, rushed **34 times** for 144 yards.          \n\nMeanwhile, Chase Brown has been on a roll. Over the past 6 weeks he has rushed for 108-73-37-99-77-108. Thats 2 - 100 games and only one game under 70. Over the same last 6 game span - James Cook has 4 games of over 100+ yards including one of 216. Asking these two to combine for 150 yards rushing against two of the worst run defenses in the league on a cold day in Buffalo doesnt seems like much.\n\nThis bet is under Rushing -> Combined Rushing Yards -> **Cook and Brown Over 150 (-138)** on Draftkings. If you dont have this bet - you can also find it under Head to Head Matchups - where their total over is at 155 (-114) BOL if Tailing!",

Clean straight sets win.\n\n**Tennis** | **Challenger Angers (Women)** | **9 AM (Eastern Time)**\n\n**Plays will always be shared as 1 unit for fair record purposes**\n\n**Pick:** **Korpatsch vs Rakhimova - Rakhimova ML @ 1.71**\n\nBoth players have been playing solid tennis. Korpatsch didn't drop a set in this tournament but faced two weak opponents in the first two rounds, before beating Parks, who played at a terrible level, and then Friedsam, who I was expecting to get knocked out after a really intense battle in the previous round against Sonmez.\n\nRakhimova had a much more difficult path to the final, where she faced Klimocicova and Ruzic, players who can certainly be dangerous on a good day. All her opponents in this tournament were solid from the baseline, and she was able to get the best of them, playing at a high level even when she needed to win in 3 sets.\n\nWhen it comes to playstyles, both players certainly play baseline tennis, but Korpatsch tends to be a lot more passive, and usually things don't go right for her when she's forced to be aggressive. Rakhimova, on the other hand, is much more efficient when turning defense into offense, and her backhand is certainly an advantage in this matchup.\n\nI believe that Parks and Friedsam, players who tend to make a lot of unforced errors, were not a good test for Korpatsch, and she will find a lot of contest from the baseline in this final. With this, I'm expecting Rakhimova to win this match. Their H2H record is 1-0 in favor of Rakhimova, where she won last year in the hard courts of Ningbo by 6-0/6-3.\n\nGood luck!",

Long time tailer and first time picker with this one.\n\nEvent - NFL, Cardinals/Rams, 2:25 MST\n\nPick - Michael Wilson O5.5 Receptions -106(currently at -148 on FD) 2.5U\n\nGoing to keep my first pick short and to the point.  The cardinals are having an abysmal season and are dealing with a ton of injuries.  Wilson averaged 12.5 receptions a game when MHJ missed 2 games earlier this season, and that was WITH Dorth and Dimercado playing(they are both injured and OUT for this game, Weaver is also questionable with a DNP yesterday, MHJ is OUT).  The card are playing one of the best offenses in the Rams, and i expect them to be playing from behind and throwing the ball a ton like they have all season against lesser offenses.  Someone has to catch the ball besides McBride!\n\nI wish the Sunday picks were up earlier as there has been massive line movement.  I'm laddering this up to 10 receptions personally.  BOL!",

Rodriguez has had 90% of the 1st Quarter RB carries in Washington’s last 2 games. Rodriguez has now had 10+ carries in 3 of his last 4 games, going for 41 yards, 79 yards, & 65 yards. His one miss was when he suffered a shoulder injury vs the Lions. Last week his 41 yard performance was against the Broncos who have a top 5 run defense, allowing just 93.1 rushing yards per game. Now he faces a Minnesota defense that ranks 23rd in rushing yards allowed per game (128.4) & ranks just 20th in EPA run defense. In their past 6 games they’ve allowed:\n\nWalker 13/56, Charbs 14/52\n\nJacob’s 28/107\n\nSwift 21/90\n\nHenry 20/75\n\nMonty 11/40\n\nVidal 23/117\n\nNow they face Washington who has turned to a run first approach offense in the past month. In the first 8 weeks of the season, the Washington’s RB’s averaged 17.4 runs per game. In their past 4 games that number has shot up to 24. This week Washington gets star QB Jayden Daniels back at QB from a dislocated elbow & their offense should be firing on full cylinders. The Commanders enter the game as favorites, vs a struggling Vikings offense that ranks LAST in points per game over their last 3 games averaging just 7.7 points per game. \tMinnesota has the league's worst turnover differential (-15) & ranks LAST in the NFL in EPA pass offense over the last 8 weeks (-67.0). Minnesota does have a great pass defense. Over the last 5 weeks, Minnesota has allowed a 59.6% completion rate (7th), 6.3 yards per pass attempt (9th), & a 2.1% TD rate (3rd). Minnesota leads the NFL in 2 high safety rate (64%), which helps them limit deep passing, allowing just the 4th fewest deep yards per game (21.3) over the past 6 weeks. Their 2 high approach also allows them to limit the sidelines & specifically deeper downfield passes (2nd fewest years per game allowed to 15+ yard targets on sidelines). \n\nWith Daniels coming back from injury, the run game heating up, & Minnesota sucking on offense, Rodriguez is in line for his busiest game of the season & Vegas has not awfully adjusted his rushing props.\n\n*More write-up incoming*\n\n__Chris Rodriguez o41.5 rushing yards__\n\nAppreciate the love!

Hope someone tailed!\n\nPOTD: German Bundesliga II Hertha BSC ML -Magdeburg @ 1.8 - 3 Units\n\nThis is my favorite pick of the day! My favorite team is playing, and history is in the making. Hertha are on a **7-game winning streak**, with **6 clean sheets**. Their clean-sheet streak was broken last match by a somewhat lucky long-range shot from Kaiserslautern.\n\nHertha now face Magdeburg, who sit dead last and are playing terribly. Hertha should win this comfortably. The only thing worth noting is that Hertha sometimes tend to play down to weaker opponents, but even with that in mind, I’m very confident. They have the best squad in the league, which is why I’m putting 3 units on this.\n\nAs always, everyone should do their own research and bet according to their own risk tolerance.\n\n**BOL!**",

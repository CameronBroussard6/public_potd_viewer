H2H they have won 3 straight over Monaco, who come into this match off 3 straight league losses, including 2 at home. Brentford are at home where they have 4 wins, 1 draw, 1 loss in the league. Those wins came against Aston Villa, Manchester United, Liverpool & Newcastle... They face Burnley, who on the road this season have 1 win and 5 losses.

I try to keep my rationales very straight-forward and to the point and don't try to over-analyze stats or trends. \n\nFor example, I was all over the dogs on the NFL slate (packers ML bc it felt like a game lions would struggle in without Ben Johnson, cowboys moneyline bc their offense has been clicking and they're playing with new purpose after the unfortunate tragedy two weeks prior, bengals spread bc Burrow return and the Ravens struggling on offense esp since Lamar came back from injury, and Bears ML since the eagles offense has also been sputtering, and this was the first true test all season for Ben Johnson's bears). Overall, went 4-0 in this slate and excited to keep my foot on the gas pedal moving forward. Simply put, in conjunction with my model, I use the eye test as well as my gut feeling to play what I believe is the most-valuable pick on the slate. Alabama enters the game with a stronger record and a higher ranking. I anticipate Auburn to have difficulty sustaining drives, and Alabama's offense, led by Ty Simpson, to show consistency throughout the game that will allow them to keep Auburn at bay. Auburn has had an inconsistent season and I anticipate them to lose by a touchdown tomorrow. I was skimming through the thread and did see that I am going against the one of the top cappers which was unintentional on my part, but cheers to a great game, and please remember to gamble responsibly and to only wager what you can afford to lose. \n\nBOL!",

      "text": "Record: 168-137, +7.23 units\n\nLast Pick: Nicolas Mejia ML vs Juan Pablo Varillas (+142, 1 unit): Win\n\nTennis | Temuco Challenger | 9:00 AM EST\n\nToday's Pick: Federico Agustin Gomez vs Alafia Ayeni | **Over 20.5 games at -110 (FD). 1 unit.**\n\nWrite-up: Mejia closed at +134, and played a great match after a tough start. The crowd was behind him the whole match, and he seemed extremely pumped up after getting it done in straights. **That play brought me to 10 wins in a row, my best streak ever!** Still, make sure to tail responsibly, as no play is guaranteed to hit. \n\nInteresting match here between Fede Gomez and Alafia Ayeni in Temuco, a rare hard-court event on the SA calendar. Ayeni has made an incredible run here in Temuco, beating clay-courters Nicolas Kicker and Juan Manuel Cerundolo as a big underdog. What I think has played in Ayeni's favor  is that he actually came into this event with pretty fresh legs, which is a massive advantage at this point in the season. He also plays with a serve-and-volley style that's almost entirely unseen in the modern game, and those two things have combined to make him a really tough opponent to deal with. \n\nFede Gomez, meanwhile, is a player that has the potential to be an all-courter, but still structures his season primarily around clay courts. A possible reason for this is that Gomez has struggled (and continues to struggle) with various different injuries, and clay courts tend to be lower-impact on the body. Gomez has been decent in his first three matches, but he is coming off a three-set battle with Facundo Diaz Acosta in the third round, and also made it deep in Guayaquil last week. Another thing I want to highlight is the serve and return performance of each player, as Tennis Insights tracked each of their second and third round matches. Ayeni recieved an 8.0 and 6.9 serve rating in his matches, while Gomez's return rating came in at 4.0 and 6.5 (shot quality is scaled so that the average player's return rating is not lower than their serve rating). If Ayeni is able to consistently hold serve, it's possible for him to cover this without winning a set, which is one reason I went for this over the set spread.\n\nEven if Ayeni likely won't be able to sustain his success in future tournaments, that doesn't make his first two matches a fluke. The circumstances simply make it easier for him to do well, and the odds here are quite tempting. Gomez was priced around these odds in R2 against a mid-tier ITF player in Daniel Nunez, and I don't believe Ayeni should be close to Nunez in odds given the caliber of his recent wins. Sure, the market didn't adjust its priors that much after the Kicker match, but the Cerundolo result feels like a turning point, and these odds have already started to drop. Gomez is happy to trade heavy groundstokes from the baseline on slow hard courts, but Ayeni should be primed to take him out of his element. Gomez's overall level is obviously higher, and I expect him to work things out as the match goes on. However, it's hard to see Ayeni making this easy with so much motivation and momentum on his side. Regardless, the margins are thin enough on this play that I would only take this up to around -120, and would only take o21.5 at +100 or better. \n\nNote: The [POTD Capper Tracker](https://potd.lol), which you may remember from its Google Sheet days, is finally back in a cleaner, more robust website format!

That’s right, if you check his record out on the Capper Tracker at this link:  [Major Couch Potato Record](https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/major-couch-potato-xJXnQW)   you can see the progression of picks leading to the last 10 wins. Congratulations are in order!!!\n\n**Now to the pick:**\n\nMore than 20 years after being relegated to the lower division from the Premier League, Coventry are securing their promotion back to the top flight in spectacular style. They are simply destroying everyone in their path. They have not only won 10 of their last 11 matches, but sit at the top of the table 10 points clear of second place Stoke, and with a +30 goal differential. Coventry play at home and host 16^(th) place Charlton with a -3 goal differential.\n\nNot sure what to add here other than at home Coventry have the best record in the league with 6 wins and also have the best goal differential with +16.  This is simply a huge mismatch. Coventry have not lost at home all season and although their star striker Brandon Thomas-Asante will be sidelined with a thigh injury, Charlton do not offer much of a threat regardless.\n\nThere is little doubt that Coventry can easily pull off a win at home against Charlton. A -1 asian handicap gets us a push should they only win by 1 goal.",

      "text": "Record: 1-0 (+2.00 units ROI)\n\nSoccer | Premier League 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿| Manchester City vs. Leeds United | 16:00 CET (Amsterdam)\nPick: Manchester City -2 Asian Handicap | 2 units\n\nWrite Up:\n\nWe kicked things off nicely yesterday with ADO Den Haag winning 0-3 at VVV Venlo, comfortably cashing the -1 Asian Handicap. A strong start to open the record.\n\nFor Saturday I’m going with Manchester City -2 on the Asian Handicap. City at home has been as reliable as it gets. They’ve won their last 5 out of 6home games in all competitions by at least two goals, and they’ve looked dominant doing it. Against Leverkusen we saw plenty of rotation and rested players, something I don’t expect at all against Leeds with Premier League points on the line.\n\nLeeds, on the other hand, have struggled badly away from home. In their last five matches they average only 0.8 goals, and they’ve lost every away game this season except their visit to Wolves, who sit at the bottom of the table with 2 points after 12 played. They also got blown out 5-0 at Arsenal, showing how vulnerable they are defensively against top opposition.\n\nCity should come out with full focus, full strength, and enough firepower to win this comfortably. Haaland, Foden, Cherki, Doku, Savinho, Reijnders are all big threats to the defence of Leeds. Also Haaland can get is 100th premier league goal which I think is a record for quickest if he gets at least one goal against Leeds, which is extra motivation for him. A 3-0 or 4-1 type of scoreline is very realistic as I just don’t see Leeds keeping it close, and the -2 line gives us a push if it lands exactly on two goals. \n\nManchester City -2 Asian Handicap for 2 units. Let’s try to make it two in a row.",

Not being able to put up over 20 points, while keeping GT to just 9 is really unfortunate. Gunner Stockton did not look comfortable out there at all.. That miss is on me, but we're gonna bounce back today!\n\nEvent:  **NCAAF - Penn State @ Rutgers, 3:30PM ET**\n\nPOTD:  **Penn State -13.5 (-120) 1.2U**\n\nWrite-Up:\n\nThese past 2 weeks have been refreshing, when watching this Penn State team play. They are finally getting the job done, especially in the games they are supposed. Now they get a match up against a Rutgers team that has clearly been struggling this season. They should be able to continue with this momentum and completely roll Rutgers.\n\nThe main proponent of Penn State's success has been the re-emergence of the running game. They have 2 stud RBs in Kaytron Allen and Nick Singleton. This duo has over 200 rushing yards combined in their last 2 games. Rutgers is currently ranked as the 129th of 136 teams against the run. This will be the exact area that Penn State will look to exploit. I'm expecting another 200+ yard performance on the ground where the Nittany Lions are able to completely control the game clock.\n\nThe cherry on top is what Terry Smith has done in his little time as interim head coach. He has been a breath of fresh air, especially as Penn State needs to finish out this season strong. After the firing of James Franklin, they just about lost every single recruit from the 2026/2027 classes. Including 5-star RB, Kemon Spell. Finishing the season on a high note will give incoming recruits hope for the program moving forward. \n\nLet's start another streak here today!\n\n*As always, BOL!*  \n\n\n*Also, never feel obligated to tip, but I leave this here just in case:*  [BMAC](https://buymeacoffee.com/thooney_toons)",

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 9-5 (Avg Odds +122)\n\n**Previous Pick:** Donyell Malen 2+ SOT (+120) ✅️\n\n**Today's Event:** English Premier League | Everton vs Newcastle (9:30 AM PST)\n\n**Pick:** Nick Woltemade 2+ SOT (+245) 1 unit to win 2.45 units\n\n**Write Up:** Malen came through for us in 27', ending the first half with 2 goals and 3 SOT. Game played out much as expected and we wound up with a great sweat free holiday win! \n\nWe're back after a day off and headed to Everton as they host the Newcastle Magpies for a middle-of-the-table match. We are backing Newcastle's 6'6\" tall center forward to get 2 or more shots on target. I waffled a while over ATGS for worse odds, or even O1 SOT (push at 1 SOT), but I ended up going with my gut and the better odds of 2+ SOT. I actually think ATGS (while I like it) is the riskier pick even though the odds are lower, as Pickford is a tough keeper to beat. \n\nMy love for the lanky German (I do not think this is an official nickname, but I heard an announcer call him that during a match one time and it stuck with me), is no secret. He's a true center forwards' center forward. He's usually the tallest player on the pitch, always chases the long ball, and tries to head every cross. He's coming off of a 2+ SOT match against Man City and 3 goals in two games during the international break. He got most of the mid week UCL match off this week so I expect him to be fresh and play most of the match today. The man is on fire and I expect that to continue here. \n\nThe other reason I like this pick is that Everton does not handle big center forwards well. Comparing Woltemade to some similar style strikers against Everton - last match at United Zirkzee had 3 shots (2 SOT), Haaland had 5 shots (4 SOT, 2 goals), Matetta had 3 shots (2 SOT). They just don't have the height to deal with tall strikers and our lanky German has 2\"+ height on all three of those guys. \n\nBOL if you decide to tail, have a great Saturday!",

      "text": "POTD Record: 22-9 (+15.3U)\n\nLast Pick: Michigan State ML (-130) (2U)✅\n\n[MSU write up](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/s/yDIx0GgnVr)\n\nMSU is a top 5 team in the nation, argue with a wall, like I said that defense combined with the shots starting to fall is no good for any one of their opponents! That win brings us to a 4-1 record for our 2 unit hammer plays 😤\n\nEvent: Auburn vs Alabama “Iron bowl” (NCAAF) (6:30pm central)\n\nPOTD: Auburn +5.5 (-110) (1U)\n\n-everything is bet to win unit amount-\n\nWrite up: \n\nAuburn +5.5 is the right side in the Iron Bowl because the matchup, the history, and the motivation all point in their favor. Alabama’s offense has been far too one‑dimensional this season, leaning heavily on the passing game because the rushing attack has been ineffective. The Tide average just around 123 rushing yards per game and only 3.7 yards per carry, numbers that rank near the bottom of the SEC and expose their inability to control the line of scrimmage. That weakness plays directly into Auburn’s strength, as the Tigers boast one of the nation’s most formidable rush defenses, allowing under 95 yards per game and holding opponents to just 2.7 yards per carry. When Alabama is forced into predictable passing downs, Auburn’s defensive front can attack with pressure, which has been the formula for keeping games close against elite opponents all year.\n\nThe matchup against Oklahoma at home certainly reinforces these ideas. I believe OU plays very similar to Auburn and the tape is out on how to beat bama!\n\nHistory reinforces the value of the points. Alabama has won four straight in the series, but no team has ever won five in a row, and the last three meetings at Jordan–Hare have all been decided by three points or fewer, including Auburn’s 48–45 win in 2019. Rivalry dynamics consistently compress margins, and catching more than a field goal at home is a gift in this spot. Auburn enters at 5–6, needing a win to secure bowl eligibility, while Alabama must win to keep its playoff hopes alive. That double incentive guarantees maximum intensity from the Tigers, who would love nothing more than to end their rival’s season while extending their own.\n\nAuburn has also proven resilient all year, as none of their six losses have been by more than seven points, which makes catching +5.5 even more valuable. Betting trends add another layer: Alabama is just 2–5 ATS in its last seven SEC road games, while Auburn has covered in three of the last four Iron Bowls played at Jordan–Hare. With the spread sitting at 5.5 and the total around 46.5, oddsmakers are signaling a lower‑scoring, possession‑driven game — the exact environment where a home dog thrives.\n\nPut it all together: Alabama’s run game inefficiency, Auburn’s elite rush defense, the rivalry’s historical tightness, Auburn’s motivation for bowl eligibility, and their track record of keeping games within one score. The matchup, the number, and the context all align. The bet of the day is Auburn +5.5, and it’s backed by stats, history, and market logic. As always, cheers 🍻",

Away from home Fulham are tied last with Wolves, being 1-0-4 on their away trips. And Tottenham, well they are 1-2-3 at home but this can be explained. \n\nWhen looking at Spurs their opponents at home, they were United (D), Chelsea (L), Villa (L), Wolves (D), Bournemouth (L), Burnley (W). So against all teams which are above Spurs in the ladder, Tottenham lost. And the 2 draws could be considered good against United and somewhat unlucky against Wolves.\n\nOn the H2H side Tottenham are 11-5-2 against Fulham.\n\nWith Tottenham having a very bad home record and them being on a losing streak, this is the perfect game to gain momentum back with all the pressure on Spurs to get a good result in front of their fans.",

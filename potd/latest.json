      "text": "POTD record: 12-14-1\n\nDarts, 2026 World Championship 🎯\n\nPOTD: Ryan Searle ML vs Johnny Clayton @ 1.73\n\nRyan Searle has been playing phenomenal darts and hasn’t lost a set yet during this tournament. That’s 14 sets won, 0 lost. Obviously, he played against worst opponents, but he’s been overclassing all of them so far. Expecting he’ll outclass Clayton again today.\n\nHis opponent Clayton has been feeling a little off during this tournament and could be called lucky to even win against Harrysson in his last match. He hasn’t shown the level, form, or consistency of Searle yet. I’m happy we're getting good odds and confident in taking Searle ML @ 1.73\n\nBOL!",

      "text": "POTD Record 15-13 (+2.02u)\n\nWednesday’s Pick ❌ - Tampa Bay Lightning 3 way line +115 (1u to win 1.15u)\n\nThursday’s Pick - Washington Capitals ML +126 (1u to win 1.26u)\n\nWe don’t have any news on Ullmark yet. He was granted a leave of absence starting on Sunday and that’s the last we’ve heard. If he remains on his leave, then it will probably be Leevi Merilainen in goal. He has been abysmal for the Senators. I don’t see a world where the Senators can be favored if he starts.\n\nRegardless of who the Senators goalie is, neither are on the level of Logan Thompson this year and the Capitals are the better team. The Capitals are in a little bit of a slump and they’re on the second half of a back to back, but they are the better team here and I like them at + money, even if we find out Ullmark is back.\n\nGood Luck and Happy New Year",

Hopefully today we’re gonna cash too.\n\nThese two teams already played in the group stage, the game went on for 54mins and we got our first win I don’t think this time will be any different especially on a knockout stage game teams tend to be more careful, play safe and calculated rather than rushing to hit towers and going  high ground.  Both of these teams have history of playing long games and playing for the late game. And yeah I love betting over map duration on Falcons, they are the most boring team when they are ahead, no kills no action for 10-15min and just farming.\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/s/PHb3z8TWLB\n\nI might post here about other matches",

With this win, they are going to have a good chance for a top 6 and direct 1/4 in the playoffs. The top 10 place is almost secured, but not quite.\n\nMaccabi has a 5-game loss streak in away games. Maybe it doesn't play a big role, but they were a home team in Belgrade before moving back to Tel Aviv, and they have a really good relationship with Belgrade teams (as does Izrael with Serbia in general), and I don't expect a big fight from them here, a nice friendly training game, with a comfortable 12-15 points win of Zvezda team.",

      "text": "**Pick of the Day**\n\n**POTD Record:** 8-10\n\n**Last 5: 💰❌❌💰❌**\n\n**Profit: -31€**\n\n**Last Pick:** Besiktas to WIN ❌💸\n\n**Today's Event:** La Liga - Celta Vigo vs Osasuna \n\n**Pick:** Celta Vigo to WIN, odds 1.95 (bet365), 100€ to win 195€\n\n\n**Reasoning:**\nBack again with a solid La Liga spot that I think is being priced closer to a coin flip than it should be. Celta at home is a completely different team compared to their away form, and this matchup sets up well for them from both a tactical and statistical standpoint.\n\nCelta is a possession-based side that creates the majority of their chances through sustained pressure and wide overloads, which plays directly into Osasuna’s biggest weakness, defending for long stretches away from home. Osasuna are far more comfortable when they can sit deep and counter selectively, but their away performances often show cracks once they’re forced to absorb pressure for 90 minutes.\n\nAt Balaídos, Celta consistently post stronger underlying numbers: higher shot volume, better xG creation, and more control of territory. Even when results don’t always reflect it, they tend to win the process, which is exactly what I want when backing a moneyline favorite rather than chasing handicaps or goal lines.\nOsasuna’s road form has been shaky, and they struggle to create consistently when not dictating the tempo. If they fall behind here, they don’t have the attacking depth to easily chase the game, while Celta are comfortable managing narrow leads.\nAt odds of 1.95, the implied probability is just over 51%, but I rate Celta closer to 58–60% to win this matchup at home. That gap is enough for me to see value on the straight ML rather than complicating things with extra conditions.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\nNot a lock, not flashy, but a disciplined home ML where the matchup, venue, and game script favor the hosts more often than the odds suggest. Keeping it simple and letting Celta do the work.\nGood luck 🤝",

Down by 10, then Luka got injured, but the boys eventually found a way to win and cover the spread.\n\nPOTD: Boston -5.5 v Miami\n\nWrite-up: The #3 team in the east facing up against the #8 team in the same conference. Both teams have depth and love to grind it all out on the court. You can probably call this a rivalry due to how many times they met in the playoffs. However, this year? Against a rival? Ohhh i do love some Boston here. \n\nThe Celtics have been playing great basketball without Tatum. Jaylen Brown is playing out of his mind and one thing’s for sure, no one can’t stop him from getting his buckets. The Celtics are on a 4-win streak. \n\nHowever, let’s stop all that eye test and go to our reliable stats.\n\nOn the last 5 games, Boston ranks 2nd in Net Adjusted Efficiency (NAE). This is like NBA’s version of EPA. While, Miami ranks 16th.\n\nAt home, Boston has been unstoppable ranking 3rd in NAE. \n\nOn the road, Miami has been decent since they are ranked 9th in NAE.\n\nNo significant injuries as of this moment for both teams.  \n\nBest of luck, boys! Hoping we can continue the streak!!! \n\nTip jar: https://www.paypal.me/AaronLucas265",

With Jayson Tatum (Achilles) officially ruled out the Celtics lose their lead rebounder (8.3 RPG). Historically, Brown averages 8.1 rebounds in games without Tatum, a massive jump from his seasonal average\n\nEvidence 2: The \"Heat Funnel\" Strategy. Miami allows the 2nd most rebounds in the league to the Small Forward/Power Forward positions. They play a \"shrink the floor\" defense that leaves the perimeter open for crashing wings like Brown.\n\nEvidence 3: Recent Forensic History. Brown is 4-for-4 in clearing his rebounding line against Miami over the last two seasons, including a 9-rebound performance just two months ago\n\nScenario Playbook\n\nScenario A (The Ideal): Boston’s defense forces Miami into contested mid-range jumpers (their specialty). Brown crashes from the arc and secures 4 boards by halftime, coasting to 9 or 10 by the final whistle.\n\nScenario B (The Grind): James Capers calls a tight game, slowing the pace. The total points stay low, but because the game is close, Brown plays 38+ minutes, eventually hitting 8 boards through sheer volume and effort.\n\nScenario C (The Outside Influences): Ref Pat Fraher is assigned. He allows a fast-paced game (235.1 PPG avg) More possessions = more missed shots = more rebound opportunities.\n\nScenario D (The White Flag 🏳️): Boston blows Miami out by 25 points in the 3rd quarter. Brown sits the entire 4th. Scenario Proof: Even in blowouts, Brown has historically secured 6-7 rebounds by the 3rd quarter. Without Tatum, he is the #1 priority on the glass.\n\nScenario E (Cold Night): Both teams shoot 55% from the field (highly unlikely for Miami on the road). Fewer misses mean fewer chances. This is the only \"red flag\" for this prop\n\nScenario Proof: Brown has cleared 7.5 rebounds in 70% of his last 10 games against Miami , and that was with Tatum taking 8 boards away from him.",

      "text": "**POTD Record**: 4-2-2 (+3.15u) [All 1 Unit Plays]\n\n**Event**: League of Ireland - Shamrock Rovers vs Dundalk - 20:00 GMT+0\n\n**Pick**: Shamrock Rovers to win @1.5\n\n**Write Up**: The League of Ireland is back and we're going to kick it off with a bet on the champions against newly promoted Dundalk. Rovers won 12 of their 18 home league games last season. 16/26 in all competitions. Which has been largely consistent with their performances overall under Stephen Bradley. Getting around this amount with a record high of 16 wins in 2023 and a low of just 9 in 2024. He has been in charge since 2016. Another notable thing is Rovers' record against the 'bottom 4'. They played the bottom 4 eight times last season and picked up 6/8 wins. One was a 0-0 draw and the 2-1 loss to Sligo Rovers but this was after the league was won and they played a rotated side.\n\nOn opening days, Rovers have a mixed record. 3 wins, 3 draws and 3 losses under Bradley but they are usually against stronger opponents than they face here. In the only time they played a promoted side in UCD, they won that game 3-0. \n\nRovers have probably gotten weaker over the break but they still have much more quality than Dundalk. The options they could bring off their bench make a massive difference to what Dundalk could do to change the game. They are quite limited in terms of options. \n\nOverall, Rovers are being priced at a 66% chance to win, in line with how many games they won at home last season but against the new team in the league, the chance should be higher. They won their games against the bottom 4 at an 75% rate, with two 4-1 wins against Cork City (the new side last year). Rovers should win this game. \n\n**Additional Thoughts**: I've tried to come back a couple times now and has been postponed twice. I was going to play yesterday but got the nerves about it. Just coming here with something to get a win on the board.",

Over these 9 games he has a total of 50 3PAs for an average of around 5.5 3PA/game.  \nThe Pacers have a lot of notoriously pesky perimeter defenders in McConnell, Nembhard, and Nesmith. I expect one of these 3 to almost always be marking Rollins. This, in combination with their weak interior defense (newly acquired Zubac will not play), probably is the reason for guards to make threes over the Pacers. Here are some guards who I think are comparable to Rollins' three point shooting ability and their 3 point numbers against the Pacers:\n\nNAW: 3/7, 5/10  \nCoby White: 1/5  \nSGA: 1/4  \nPayton Pritchard: 1/5  \nAnfernee Simons: 1/4  \nDerrick White: 1/4  \nTyrese Maxey: 1/4\n\nWith the exception of NAW, everyone else struggled.\n\nHere are reasons why you might not want to take this pick.  \nIn Rollins' two games against the Pacers this season, he went 2/4 and 2/5. These are under the line, but he shot efficiently from three.  \nI am not sure of KPJ's status for the game. He is not listed on the injury report at the time of this write-up, but he is coming off an injury and might have a minutes restriction. I'm not completely sure of this but it would be safe to assume so because this is only his second game back. The less minutes KPJ plays the more the ball is going to be in Rollins' hands which definitely would not be good for this pick.",

More opportunities & more possessions leads to more rebound chances which is very welcome.\n\nJB is over in 2/2 against the Heat this season with 9 & 7 rebounds avg 13 rebound chances, with 12+ rebound chances he’s over in 18/21 games.\n\n86% hit rate in his L15 games aswell.\n\nHeat play with the fastest pace in the league and as a result allowed 2nd most rebounds in the league.\n\nAddition of Vucevic doesn’t scare me too much, he’ll share the workload with Queta and the weak side rebounds will be there, expecting JB to be active.\n\nPersonally sprinkling on a DD aswell",

      "text": "Record: 4–1\n\nLast 10: 4–1\n\nLast Pick: Chicago State @ Central Connecticut State — Full Game Under 138.5\n\nResult: ❌ LOSS (145 points)\n\nReview: This under ultimately failed because several efficiency-based factors aligned at once, rather than the game breaking structurally. CCSU shot well above their baseline (55% from the field, 36% from three), which immediately lifted the scoring floor and reduced the game’s ability to compress downward. At the same time, Chicago State avoided the type of full offensive collapse that typically anchors these matchups, reaching 67 points instead of landing in the low-to-mid 50s.\n\nFree throws also played a meaningful role, with both teams converting at a high rate and adding points without using much clock. Chicago State generated an unusual number of easy points off turnovers, further supplementing their scoring without needing sustained half-court efficiency. The pace never spiraled out of control, but when strong shooting, foul scoring, and opponent cooperation all show up together, the margin for error disappears — and that combination is what ultimately broke the under.\n\n⸻\n\nToday’s Pick\n\nCollege Basketball | NCAA Men’s Bradley Braves @ Northern Iowa Panthers | Friday, February 6, 2026 | 8:00 pm\n\nPick: Full Game Under 131.5\n\nOdds: -110 (DraftKings)\n\nWrite-Up:\n\nThis is one of the cleaner under setups on the board because it’s built around pace control, not hoping one team simply can’t score. Northern Iowa plays slow by default and sticks to that identity regardless of opponent or game state. Even when shots don’t fall, they don’t turn misses into chaos — possessions reset, the clock keeps moving, and the game stays compact.\n\nBradley fits that style well. They’re not an explosive offense and don’t have a reliable second gear when efficiency dips. If Bradley struggles to score, the game doesn’t “fix itself” by adding possessions or fouls — it just grinds. In a total sitting in the low 130s, that matters, because it removes the late-game paths that usually push games over.\n\nFor this game to clear 131.5, a lot has to go right at the same time: both teams would need to shoot efficiently, maintain that efficiency without slowing down, and create extra points late through fouls. That’s a tough combination to hit in this matchup. More often than not, when things go wrong offensively here, the game compresses instead of spiraling — which is exactly the profile you want when backing a full-game under.\n\nBest of luck! Here’s to bouncing back!\n\n⸻\n\nFor those who find the analysis valuable, contributions are appreciated — no pressure. https://buymeacoffee.com/kindlyquantifying",

They absolutely strangled Cincinnati after the break. Color me impressed.*\n\n**Today's reasoning:** What. 👏 A. 👏 Game. 👏 This will be. We get the fifth-most efficient defense in NCAA, according to KenPom, travelling to the second-most prolific scoring offense in the Big East. If we're getting what is essentially a pick'em for a line, then there are so many more reasons to hitch your wagon to the Huskies. Not the least of which is straight-up revenge. Let's dive in.\n\nForget KenPom, UConn (22-1) ranks even higher with Bart Torvik, where the Huskies are second in adjusted defensive efficiency and third in effective field goal percentage defense - and that's for all of NCAA, not just the Big East. UConn also ranks sixth in 3-point percentage defense. Plus, opponents are only hitting 40.4 percent of close two-pointers (shots within the restricted area). This is a UConn defense that grabs you by the throat and squeezes the shooting life out of you. In its last outing, UConn held Xavier to 36 percent en route to a 32-point win. All that to say this: UConn is tops in the Big East, allowing 63.8 points per game - good for ninth in all the land.\n\nAnd yes, St. John's *is* an impressive 10-2 at home. But they can be got, especially by a UConn team that hasn't lost on the road. St. John's first home defeat came in its second game of the season, when the Johnnies (17-5) tried to get into a track meet with Alabama. St. John's lost, 103-96, despite making 49 percent from the field and attempting 40 free throws. We'll chalk that up to a system loss early in the season. But the second home loss came on Jan. 3, with a 77-71 defeat at the hands of sub-.500 Providence, when the Friars were getting 14.5 points. In that game, St. John's was held to 28 percent shooting - 22 percent from beyond the arc - and missed 13 of their 37 free throws. There is the blueprint for beating St. John's. Mind you, Providence's KenPom defensive rating is 190 spots below UConn, which is currently holding conference opponents to a league-best 39.5 percent shooting and 28.5 from beyond the arc. If St. John's isn't shooting well, I suspect they'll revert to bully ball and try to earn free points at the charity stripe.\n\nMeanwhile, St. John's recent shooting has been bipolar in general. Over their last five contests, they've hit over 50 percent twice (56, 51) and exactly 35 percent twice, including their previous outing - a 68-56 win over DePaul on Tuesday. To be fair, St. John's might've been looking ahead to UConn, and they *did* cover, but I think the Huskies pose a unique challenge. St. John's is third in the Big East in rebounding, just ahead of UConn. On the other hand, the Huskies might negate that advantage with their first-place ranking in opponent rebounding.\n\nAs for offense, UConn is *the* best shooting team in the Big East at 48.8 percent. KenPom has their offensive efficiency ranked No. 25 in the NCAA (St. John's is 26). Interestingly, UConn's adjusted tempo ranks quite low (310). Basically, they find the best shot each time down the court in a controlled, methodical way. To wit, UConn ranks 12th in NCAA in assists, and 23rd in assist-to-turnover ratio. When they hit their shots *AND* play suffocating defense, the result is the 10th best scoring margin in the nation at +15.7 points per game. For context, Duke leads with +20.5. I just don't see how St. John's plays within a possession. And did I mention they shoot incredibly well? UConn is making 65 percent of their shots in the paint, and they're getting nearly 10 percent of their shot attempts from dunks.\n\nDevil's advocate: UConn does foul teams. They're second-worst in the Big East in opponent attempts, although St. John's isn't exactly crushing it from the free-throw line. St. John's *is* really good at forcing turnovers. The Red Storm rank second in the Big East in turnover margin (UConn is middle of the pack). Oh, and the Huskies have been awful against the number, going 8-15 ATS. If you want the records, UConn is 5-7 ATS in Big East play, 3-3 on the road in conference, and 4-3 on the road all season. But this is basically a bet that they will win by one measly basket in a hostile environment. On the other hand, St. John's is 5-7 ATS at home, including 2-3 ATS in conference home games. So if bully ball doesn't result in easy points, and St. John's isn't turning the Huskies over, what else is left?\n\nThere's another consideration. Revenge. St. John's swept UConn last year, including a 14-point loss the last time these teams played on this court. Don't think Solo Ball and Alex Karaban have forgotten. My thesis: St. John's will struggle to shoot and try to bully its way to points or simply outrun UConn. But I think St. John's shoots sub-40 percent, while UConn plays its steady, methodical offense. Despite their spread woes this season, the Huskies have covered two in a row. Let's make it three.\n\nGood luck and Godspeed!\n\nPOTD tracker: [https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/Seventh\\_\\_Place-z37cn7](https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/Seventh__Place-z37cn7)\n\nIf I've made you a few bucks through fades, it's just gonna ask you a few questions: [https://buymeacoffee.com/seventh\\_\\_place](https://buymeacoffee.com/seventh__place)",

      "text": "Record: 178-148, +5.18 units\n\nLast Pick: Borna Gojo ML vs Tristan Boyer (-152, 1 unit): Win\n\nTennis | Davis Cup World Group I (Kazakstan vs Monaco) + Cleveland Challenger | Times TBD\n\nToday's Pick: Alexander Bublik vs Hugo Nys | **Bublik to win 2-0 at -500.**\n\nBorna Gojo vs Quinn Vandecasteele | **Gojo ML at -364.**\n\n**Combined odds: -192 (DK). 1 unit.**\n\nWrite-up: Gojo closed at -312, and while he faced a break point early in the first set, it was smooth sailing after that. \n\nReasoning for the first leg is pretty simple: Hugo Nys is a solid doubles player, but he hasn't stepped foot on the singles court in over a year. In fact, he hasn't been a full-time singles player since 2020, with his only singles appearances since then consisting of two as an alternate into ATP qualifying (this can sometimes happen when no singles players are available on site), two as a wildcard into his home Monte-Carlo tournament, and two Davis Cup appearances due to a lack of options for Monaco beyond Valentin Vacherot. In the 3 Monte-Carlo appearances, he faced Munar, Ruusuvuori, and Rinderknech, had higher odds than this in all of those matches (even though I think this is an even tougher matchup), and lost all of them 2-0. He did actually score one win over Morrocco's Yassine Dlimi at the 2024 Davis Cup; however, Dlimi is an ITF-level player, and Nys was still priced as a significant underdog. Bublik obviously has a massive advantage in this matchup, and the only concerns would be him not taking things seriously or Nys somehow servebotting his way to a set on indoor hard. In terms of Bublik's motivation, I feel like he's become a new player in that regard lately, and he'll be playing in front of a home crowd in Astana, one of his primary training bases. In addition, the surface being used (GreenSet Comfort) isn't known for being particularly fast, and it's hard to see Nys consistently holding serve, especially as he's far from the biggest server on the doubles tour. I expect Bublik to serve well and take control of this from the start. \n\nFor the second leg of this play, I'm going with Gojo again, this time to defeat Quinn Vandecasteele in the quarterfinals. As I mentioned in my last write-up, I think this could be a week where Gojo wins the title, and I don't see Vandecasteele being able to stop him. Quinn has had a long week, playing four matches back-to-back (6.68/10, 6.45, 6.61, 6.82), and I don't see him at the same level as Boyer. If you want evidence, he was a +175 dog against Cassone in R32; Boyer faced off against Cassone a couple weeks ago and was favored. As a result, I don't think these odds should be so close to where Gojo closed against Boyer. Vandecasteele is a solid grinder, but I don't think he has the weapons to keep up with Gojo on these fast courts.",

I see multiple reasons for Dalla to win this match\n\n1) He is leading their H2H with a 1-0, winning their last match 2-0\n\n2) He has played 4 good matches already and qualified to this tournament, while Romano got a wild card. I see him in better shape and form right now.\n\n3) He is ranked better and got more experience than the young Romano, who is only 20 years old.\n\nI see a good value in this bet and good luck!\n\n\\_\n\nIf you follow my bets, I would appreciate a little tip - I spend a lot of time analyzing the bets day to day.

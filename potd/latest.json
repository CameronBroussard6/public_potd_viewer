The Canadiens are 4th in goals scored however the Wild are on of the best defensive teams in the league in terms of goals allowed and their goalkeeping has been solid lately. The Canadiens defense is below average in goals allowed however they aren’t going up against an offensive juggernaut. The Wild are average offensively at best and are missing key forwards, Matt Boldy and Eriksson Ek who are on injury reserved. The Wild are also on a back to back having played yesterday. As for trends, they favor the under as well. These two teams have a history of going under. In fact, six of the last seven games between these two teams has gone under. With that said, I’m taking the Wild and Canadiens to go under 6.5 goals tonight.\n\n👇\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y4qm6aa0kjeg1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=04aba141faa26e2e2a98856964bc96b7cbd470c4",

Jarry very very likely to bet in net for the oilers and is 3-0-1 with them winning against VAN, BOS, and PIT. He is 13-3 in his night games including his pittsburgh games. Jake Allen is confirmed playing tomorrow for the Devils and he is 6-10 in his night games, Allen is 35 and late fatigue could be a factor to why his night record is so poor while his daytime game record is 5-1. Allen is also 5-7 in away games with a 2.67 GAA and .909 sv%. The Devils are also struggling as they are 2-3 scoring only 2.40 goals per game and allowing 4.20 goals per game.\n\nEdmonton produces at the highest PP% in the game right now at an insane 33.1% and with the Devils playing on a b2b I expect them to take penalties they might not normally. If they do take penalties the Oilers will pound the net with the Devils average PK at 76.7%. The Devils last night took 4 penalties agaisnt the Flames yesterday. \n\nThe Devils are 1-3 in b2b games this season while losing by 2+ goals where Allen played the 2nd game. He lost 4-1 to Anaheim, lost 4-1 to Boston, Won 3-2 against Columbus, lost 3-1 to Carolina. Although the travel isnt far from Calgary to Edmonton its still a factor on a start of what is a 4 game road trip going up against the Oilers who are 12-6-4 at home.\n\nMcDavid at home has 44 points in 22 games, while producing a massive 58 points in 25 wins. IF the Oilers decide they wanna show up against McDavid will be a main contributor. He also got 2 assists last time these two teams played and only has 7 pointless games on 50 games played with all 7 of those games being losses. The last time the Oilers won without McDavid getting a point was January 11th 2025\n\nBOL! All my picks are 1U bets!",

The Devils have Jake Allen in net, he has been great this year. This season, Jake Allen has a .908 save percentage, alongside a 2.68 goals against average. On the other side, Oilers newly traded for goalie Tristan Jarry has also been playing great, with a .909 save percentage, and a 2.53 goals against average. Both goalies are well above average this season, and the Devils are one of the worst scoring teams this season, ranking 28th in goals, while being 5th in the league in shots on goal. They are getting shots, but they aren’t scoring much on those opportunities. The Oilers are a very strong offensive team, ranking 3rd in the league for goals, but their second best player, and best goal scorer, Leon Draisaitl, is not in the game due to personal reasons, (family member in Germany is ill). With both goalies in net being great and Oilers missing a key goal scorer, this game is going to be a goalie duel and there won’t be a lot of opportunities to get goals past them.\n\nTake The Under 6.5 Goals!",

I'd typically expect both teams to score plenty of goals and win handily but given their recent forms one of these games will probably be a sweat. Anyways, these are 2 of the best teams in the CL so betting both MLs for anything better than -150 has decent value.\n\n\nBOL!",

They also net an average of 3 goals per game, so i feel the o1.5 team total goal line seems a little too juicy to miss. Spurs are in absolute shambles & i think the board knows they will be losing this game, so they probably dont want the replacement staff to take over before a losing game.

He played 40 minutes and still wasn’t able to reach 10 rebounds + assists. Today, he pairs up with the Jazz defense, one of, if not the worst, in the league. He should have his way with this defense. They cannot defend the three, which is Edwards's favorite shot, nor can they stop the drive. Last time they played, it was a beatdown. The game ended 137-97, Timberwolves. I expect the same here. Edwards dropped 37 points that game in 26 minutes… and also didn’t reach 10 rebounds + assists. The Wolves have every starter available, and I just see them torching the Jazz yet again. If they keep it close, I will be shocked. Should be a blowout with the starters getting benched in the fourth. Also, the point total for the game sits at an extremely high 245.\n\nEdwards has hit this line 71% this season and nine of his last ten. The spread is set at -10.5. In games where the Wolves win by 10 or more, Edwards has gone under 11 out of 11 times. He is averaging 32 minutes in those games. When he plays 36 minutes or less, he has gone under 15/16 times. As I said, I’m expecting a blowout, so I’m going off these numbers. The Jazz have lost by ten or more in seven of their last ten games. Half of those by twenty. Let’s trust the numbers and make some 🍞\n\nGood luck, fellas. 🍀",

Going based off purely data here but dortmund has been conceding shots on set pieces and corners lately. Without van de ven, romero will be the target man for almost all of these which is a positive and a negative of course. Purely luck in this case but I think he can get it done for a sweet payout.",

In the past 12 months, Stijn averaged 0.10 180s per leg and Coates 0.25 180s per leg.

I think the Faroe Islands should be slight favorites, which they are now, so I’m staying away from the straight win and instead looking at the team goals over.\n\nRegardless of how the match ends, I believe Skipagötu, Mittun, and Teigum will put on a show against Slovenia, much like they did against Montenegro yesterday. They are incredibly sharp, and I don’t see how Slovenia’s defense will be able to stop them. Slovenia will also score quite a few goals, as the Faroe Islands’ goalkeeper is unlikely to have the game of his life again. That’s why I prefer the over rather than the straight win—I think it will land with room to spare.",

Crosby got us right and continues to own the Flyers. If you weren't able to bet on player props the Penguins won and covered the -1.5 as well.   \nToday's pick is the Predators ML -117. The Predators are a pretty average .500 team and I like them at home, but this is more of a fade of the Sabres brutal schedule spot: 2nd leg of a B2B, playing their 3rd game in 4 nights, 4th in 6 nights, and 5th in 7 nights. They are on the 2nd game of a 5 game road trip, and they have a -2 rest disadvantage vs. Nashville- who have had 3 days off. The Sabres have been red hot recently at one point winning 10 in a row before New Year's, but they are cooling off recently: 6-3-1 in their last 10, but 2-3 in their last 5. Nashville is quietly starting to come on and make a push for a wild card spot: 6-4 in their last 10, 3-2 in the L5, the biggest note is their recent shock 7-3 win over the best team in the league- The Avs on their own ice. Nashville will start Saros who is a beast at home 2.65 GAA & .910 SV% vs 3.27/.884 on the road. The Sabres probably start Alex Lyon who has been good this year but hasn't played in 3 weeks- look for rust to be a factor. \n\nTLDR: Sabres super tired, goalie probably rusty. Nashville rested and starting their top goalie at home.\n\nBest of luck if you are tailing!",

Steve Smith is in top form, smashing one of the quickest centuries in the competition's history and then getting a quick 50 last match. The standard of bowling in the Big Bash cannot be compared to the standard of international. He’s just seeing the ball too well. Steve Smith comes into this match in outstanding form after blasting one of the fastest centuries in Big Bash history in his previous game. While the Perth Scorchers are a strong side overall, Smith has consistently shown he can neutralise quality attacks once he gets set. His recent innings highlighted how dominant he can be during key phases, particularly when fielding restrictions apply. With conditions again favouring batting and Smith batting at the top, he should have ample opportunity to build an innings. Given his current confidence, rhythm, and ability to control the tempo, the 31.5 run line still looks very achievable. The only bowling threat I can truely see is Jhye Richardson who should only bowl two overs of the first 4 overs then will come back later in the innings\nBOL!",

Both sides have enough attacking quality to hurt each other, and neither defence has been rock-solid lately, especially in big European games where the tempo is higher and mistakes get punished fast. Spurs at home usually find a way to score, and Dortmund away from home are rarely shy about attacking either, so it’s hard to see one of these teams getting completely shut out. The way both managers like to play also points toward an open game — quick transitions, wide players getting involved, and a lot of movement around the box rather than slow, cautious buildup.\n\nI don’t really see this turning into one of those boring, cagey Champions League nights where everyone’s scared to lose. Both teams have reasons to push for a result, and that usually means space opens up at some point. Once the first goal goes in, the game should stretch even more, which is perfect for goals and chaos. That’s why I believe this will probably be both teams to score and over 2.5 goals, with 3 goals being a fair “push” line for safety. Something like 2–1, 2–2, or even a wild 3–1 just feels way more likely than a tight 1–0 or 0–0 in this kind of matchup.\n\nIm playing for the push, because I do see 3 goals in this game.

Then we add the injuries they have in defense, with John Stones, Ruben Dias, Matheus Nunes and Gvardiol all out. Additionally Bernardo Silva is suspended and Rodri is coming back from injury so I doubt Pep will risk him with another 90 minutes after just doing so against Manchester United. His natural replacement is also injured (Nico Gonzales).\n\nBodø/Glimt is also playing on an artificial pitch which also gives them a small advantage, but Glimt is also just straight up very decent at home and can definitely create a lot of trouble for this City side that we just saw this weekend can be got at with counter attacks.\n\n* **Glimt shots at home:** 18 (Juventus), 17(Monaco), 18(Spurs), 17 (Sturm Graz, playoffs)\n* **City Shots Against Away:** 11, 10, 10, 7, 16, 16, 12, 9, 2, 9, 11 | Only Forest and Swansea in the League cup has failed to have 9+ shots on this run of games\n\nThere is definitely a big gap between the teams still, with the missing players. City just spent a casual £20M minimum on a centerback and gave him 300k in weekly wages, that is about the same amount of money Glimt paid for their seven most expensive signings... And his wages is about 27 times what Glimt's best paid player is earning! Guehi is not available for this game, that also goes for Semenyo as they can't registered before the knockout stage.\n\nBodø/Glimt is also out of season as their season ended in December. They have been spending their last two weeks getting matchfit and playing two friendlies in Spain.\n\nWhen Glimt are home I believe they can create trouble for anybody, I'm not deluded enough to think they can win this one, but they should be able to throw some punches and make things much harder for City than what a lot of TV pundits might think.\n\nBOL",

Spurs come into this match under pressure after a poor run domestically, while Dortmund arrive full of confidence from strong league and European performances. Tottenham’s recent form highlights growing defensive issues. They haven’t won any of their last five matches in all competitions, conceding twice in losses to West Ham and Aston Villa. Even in the draw away at Bournemouth, they let control slip despite scoring twice.\n\nAt home in the Champions League, Spurs have looked much stronger. Comfortable wins over Slavia Prague (3-0) and FC Copenhagen (4-0) showed they can dominate when given space. However, their struggles under heavy pressure remain clear, especially away from home, as seen in the five goals conceded against PSG. Defensively, Spurs have kept just one clean sheet in their last five matches. While the 0-0 draw at Monaco showed good control, recent domestic games suggest their focus drops when matches become more open.\n\nDortmund come into this match in much steadier form. They’re unbeaten in their last five games across all competitions and have scored 13 goals in that run. Wins over Werder Bremen and Villarreal showed their ability to take control early and keep up attacking pressure. In the Champions League, Dortmund have scored four goals in three of their last four matches. Away wins at Copenhagen and strong performances at Manchester City highlight how well they adapt on the road without losing their attacking edge. While they do concede at times, they make up for it with goals, having scored 19 Champions League goals this season, the most of the two teams.\n\nTottenham have averaged 1.6 goals scored and 1.2 goals conceded across their last 10 home matches. Seven of those games went Over 2.5 Goals, with an overall average of 2.8 goals per game. Dortmund, meanwhile, have averaged 2.0 goals scored and 1.8 goals conceded in their last 10 away matches. Six of those games finished Over 2.5 Goals, with a higher overall average of 3.8 goals per game.\n\nGiven how both teams play, this looks like a match where both sides should be able to find the net. Their styles point towards a more open game with chances at both ends. Spurs have scored in four of their five Champions League matches, while Dortmund’s last four European games have all seen at least three goals. Tottenham will also be without Micky van de Ven and Ben Davies, which could give Dortmund opportunities to exploit defensively.\n\n**NOTE: Please only stake what you can afford to lose; know that no picks are 100% guaranteed to hit.

Neestrup has stressed that Copenhagen arrive with confidence and fresh intensity after a positive winter camp, and despite recent rest he wants his team to seek victory through proactive football, not defensive caution. Danish media report Copenhagen’s only absentees are long-term injuries to Rodrigo Huescas and Magnus Mattsson, meaning Neestrup can still field an offensive-minded XI and intends to press Napoli high and exploit transitions rather than sit deep. On the Napoli side, Conte’s presser made clear that injuries have forced tactical reshuffles — Politano and Rrahmani were lost in the last game and Neres still struggles with an ankle issue, leaving gaps on both flanks and in central defence which Napoli must cover with rotated personnel and untested solutions. Conte himself acknowledged these challenges repeatedly, saying his focus is on “finding solutions” with the players available and preparing the team to compete in attack and defence, not just shut up shop. Italian press highlights that Napoli’s absentees weaken defensive structure and force Conte into a more open tactical shape because he cannot rely on his best cover or wingers to sit deep and counter; instead he will likely push available attackers forward to chase a win that keeps Napoli in contention. Combined with Copenhagen’s motivation to score early and Napoli’s need to respond quickly when pressed — plus Conte’s acknowledgment of the difficulty in juggling an intense schedule and injury gaps — the tactical signals from both benches point toward an open game with goals on both sides, making Over 2.50 goals a strongly justified pick.",

Levadiakos gave us a no sweat bet, and we move on to Tuesday’s Champions League slate. I will be laying some action on most of these matches, but I think my favorite pick comes from Dortmund vs. Tottenham. \n\nI love to watch Dortmund play because they are extremely offensively effective (3 goals in each of their last 3 games) which makes for exciting matches. They regularly have multi-goal games, and when they are away from home, they almost always concede at least 1 goal (especially against competent opponents). \n\nIt’s true, Spurs have been a solid home team so far in the 2025-2026 Champions League campaigns, but right now... Tottenham is in turmoil. They are only 2 days removed from a 2-1 loss at home against relegation threatened West Ham. They have a number of key players missing due to injury. Chants were booming through the stadium calling for the sacking on Thomas Frank. It is pure chaos in Tottenham at the moment.\n\nThey have proven to be able to handle sides like Slavia Prague and FC Copenhagen. They are a month of turmoil removed from that last Champions League win, and Slavia Prague is not even close to the same level as Dortmund. I think Tottenham will feel they have something to prove in this one after the West Ham nightmare. This will open the lanes up for Dortmund and I expect them to be able to put 2+ into the net before the final whistle blows.",

Curently the No. 39 her game has seen some serious growth over the last few months. She had a solid end to her year, reaching the quarters of the Beijing WTA 1000 and picking up her first top 10 win over Rybakina in the process. She started her year at the United Cup defeating Lamens easily (2 and 2) followed by a close three set loss against No. 2 Swiatek, a player against whom she’d previously only won 7 games against in three matches. That match really exemplified the improvements she’s made and I really expect a big year from her. Lys has always been a good baseliner with great movement but it’s the depth she’s been hitting at on top of her redirection of pace by taking the ball extremely early and be aggressive from it that has impressed me. That should pay dividends in this match.\n\nCirstea announced that this was her last year on tour after almost 20 years on the big stage. Credit to the No. 41 who had a really solid season last year, going 28-18 and picking up a title in Cleveland. She’s also had a decent start to the season, defeating Pavlyuchenkova and Ostapenko before losing to Sabalenka and defeating Eikeri and Rakhimova in the Adelaide qualifying. So why am I predicting Lys to win? Well first of all she had to withdraw from the Adelaide main draw due to an ankle injury that seemed to bother here against Rakhimova where she was second best. That could suggest that, especially at her age, she isn’t 100% fit and against a player that will make her move as much as Lys could be a death sentence if it’s the case. The match-up is also tough for Cirstea, who is a flat aggressive baseliner who goes for winners as soon as she can, playing a low margin game and will have the serve advantage. However in rallies (which will multiply as the game goes on in our favour), Lys is going to return a hell of a lot more balls than against the average opponent plus with depth and consistency which is going to cause more a whole load more errors from the Romanian who often lacks a plan B. On top of the physical aspect that the German brings to the table it could be a recipe for disaster for the 35 year old as the match proceeds against her younger opponent and the unforced errors accumulate. There’s also the fact that Cirstea is 1-7 in grand slams since reaching the US Open quarters in 2023. Lys easily beat Cirstea on hard in ‘23 as well when she was ranked 100 spots below her (1-0 H2H). If I were to compare Eva to a player it would be Leylah Fernandez against whom Sorana went 0-2 against last year. On the opposite spectrum, the closest to the Romanian would be Boulter (Collins/Vekic would be better but Lys never played them) whom the German destroyed 2,1 in October.\n\nThis isn’t a lock of a pick (just like with any) as Cirstea could very well red-line with everything going in due to the nature of her game but I simply have to disagree with Lys being the short underdog so I see a lot of value here.

      "text": "Record: 175-142, +8.09 units\n\nLast Pick: Laslo Djere ML vs Stan Wawrinka (-102, 1 unit): Loss\n\nTennis | Phan Thiet Challenger | 12:20 AM EST (estimated)\n\nToday's Pick: Yosuke Watanuki vs Omar Jasika | Watanuki to win 2-0 at -165 (DK). 1 unit. \n\nWrite-up: I really wouldn't have predicted that Wawrinka would not only win the match, but actually come back from a set down to do so. That brings me to two losses in a row for the first time since last September, and while I think the first one was still a decent read, that one definitely was not. In general, the opportunities for finding value at Grand Slams, and even tour level to an extent, are extremely thin, and I don't trust myself to find it right now. I'm happy to be up a couple of units betting on main tour events to start the year, but I'll likely be moving back to Challengers for a while.\n\nYosuke Watanuki enters the Phan Thiet Challenger as the No. 1 seed and clear title favorite. Watanuki has a solid Challenger resume with five career titles to his name (including one in November 2025 in Kobe), all on Asian hard courts. Watanuki has gone 4/4 in the first round of Challenger events where he is the top seed, and should be able to extend that here against Omar Jasika. Watanuki should come in here with a fair bit of confidence after pushing Norwegian prospect Budkov Kjaer, who ended up qualifying for the main draw, to three sets in their Australian Open match. \n\nOmar Jasika was once a solid performer on the Challenger Tour, though his strong results were largely limited to Australian events. However, Jasika really lost his way in 2025, going 15-19 overall (9-17 outside of Australia), including five consecutive losses to end the year. He hasn't looked much better to start 2026, either. In the Noumea Challenger, he was blasted off the court by Michael Zheng; another thing to note about that match was that Zheng was a bigger favorite than Watanuki is here, yet I see them at a similar level. Then, he was ousted 6 & 0 in the first round of qualifying for the AO by Kimmer Coppejans, who isn't close to the same level as Budkov Kjaer. \n\nIn terms of the matchup, Watanuki already has a 1-0 edge in the head-to-head, having defeated Jasika in straight sets on grass in July of last year. Like several other Australian players, Jasika actually has quite a bit of experience on grass, but wasn't able to generate a single break point in the match, which took place in the midst of a similar slump. Watanuki also had a 6-2 balance against lefties last year, beating Gaston, Bellucci, Monday, and Monteiro. Watanuki is the much stronger server here, and while his results on return are mixed, he is extremely adept at attacking weaker serves (which won't be good news for Jasika, who was clocked at just 167 kmh in Melbourne). Jasika gets plenty of returns in play and will be able to get himself into some rallies here, but I don't see his combination of high-spin forehand/low-spin backhand troubling Watanuki here. Watanuki has previously seen success against this style against guys like Gaston and Bellucci; he even has a famous head-to-head advantage against Frances Tiafoe, who plays a more powerful version of the game as a right-handed player. Jasika also likes to play the finesse game, but one thing you'll notice about Watanuki is that he loves to play cat-and-mouse points. Overall, this is one of my more confident plays of 2025, though it's not quite in 2-unit territory.",

Very tough draw for Shelton, going up against a guy who made the final in Adelaide and is one of the top unseeded players in the tournament. However, I think this is a good opportunity to buy in at a low price on Shelton. His odds for the matchup are around -165 for a guy who has only lost in the first round of a major once (his slam debut in 2022). I’m not as worried about Shelton not having as much of a tune up to the tournament and think he can still have the upper hand in this matchup.\n\nIn order to boost the odds, I added Fonseca as well, who feels destined for a thrilling 3rd round matchup against Sinner. He’s going up against an American Spizzirri, who has reached his ATP career high of 85, but doesn’t have much slam experience. This is his second slam (US Open last year). This should negate some concerns about Fonseca not having a ton of slam success despite having a great 2025. He should be able to build off of his year last year and make some deep runs this year, as well as win this matchup.\n\nGood Luck!",

Definitely fade me for a bit while we retarget, but I'm going to continue posting and right the ship.\n\nChampion's League is back and I'm hoping the change will get us back on track. Bodo (Norwegian side) host heavily favored Man City as they battle for their Champion's League lives. A loss for Bodo here elimates them from playoff contention, whereas a win inches them closer to a spot. Bodo are 0-3-3 in the Champion's League. They concede a lot but also score a lot. All of their matches other than 1 (5/6) have had 4 goals or more, their most recent home match against Juventus ended 2-3. Being in Norway, winter is their off season so the team has not played a match in over a month. This means they'll have fresh legs, but may be a bit rusty. \n\nMan City are currently sitting 4th in the table and will desperately want a win here to progress towards locking up a top 8 spot and avoiding the playoffs. Man City very much need a palate cleanser after some rough EPL matches. Haaland especially has been cold and needs a goal, I'm expecting him to put in 1-2 goals here in his home country to help his team stay in the top 8. \n\nBOL and happy Tuesday!",

After only 4 minutes, he made a mistake that not even my local league keeper would make, giving Tel Aviv the chance to sit back and play far more conservatively. As the game went on, Beer Sheva created lots of chances but only managed to convert one. Then, almost in the final minute, Tel Aviv had their only shot of the entire second half. The goalkeeper was perfectly positioned, yet somehow let it in with a poor touch. With any decent goalkeeper they would have won the game, but it is what it is. Hopefully today we get a fairer outcome. Now, onto the Champions League.\n\nBoth teams come into this level on points, sitting 23rd and 24th with 7 points.\n\nNapoli are the stronger side overall, despite their inconsistent Champions League campaign so far. They sit 3rd in Serie A, competing week in and week out against a much higher level of opposition. FC Copenhagen are currently 5th in the Danish league, which already says a lot about the gap in quality between the two teams and their domestic environments.\n\nCopenhagen have picked up some important European results recently, but context matters. They are coming off a long competitive break, with no official matches since mid-December, and have only played friendlies since. Against a well-structured Conte side, that lack of match sharpness can be costly, especially early on.\n\nNapoli’s away form in the Champions League has clearly been an issue, but they’ve shown in Serie A that they can manage tough road games, recently taking points against Inter and winning away at Lazio. \n\nEven acknowledging Copenhagen’s strong home atmosphere, this is a matchup where Napoli’s superior squad quality, tactical discipline, and experience at a higher competitive level should prevail. I’m backing Napoli to get the job done and take a crucial three points in a tight but controlled away performance.\n\nhttps://buymeacoffee.com/alexandrelopes",

Michigan State plays tomorrow.”\n\nAfter a 58-56 defeat at then-No. 13 Nebraska, the Spartans (16-2) have been on quite a roll. The team has reeled off four consecutive victories—all by double-digits—with an average margin of victory of 19.3 points. That includes our last POTD on Saturday when Michigan State delivered an emphatic 80-63 victory as just 3.5-point favorites. \n\nBut if Saturday’s spread was disrespectful, Tuesday night’s line against Oregon is just downright blasphemous.\n\nIn what is quickly becoming a season to forget, the Ducks (8-10) enter this matchup as losers of four-straight. That includes losing three-in-a-row by double-digits with an average margin of defeat of 18.3 points. In fact, after a 4-0 start, Oregon has mustered just four wins over its last 14 outings. To make matters worse, the team will also be down its two leading scorers in big man Nate Bittle (16.3 PPG) and guard Jackson Shelstad (15.6 PPG). \n\nHere’s hoping the Spartans defense is bringing its appetite to Eugene, as a feast may be in order. \n\nThrough 18 games, the unit ranks 8th in scoring defense (64.2 PPGA), 11th in defensive efficiency (0.920), 11th in opponent field-goal percentage (39.0%) and 30th in opponent three-point shooting (29.8%). Following an uncharacteristic performance against Cornell—97 points allowed on 46% shooting—Michigan State’s defense has been absolutely lights out, conceding just 59.6 points on 38.5% shooting (25.0% from beyond the arc) over its last five games. Furthermore, as we highlighted in Saturday’s post, the team has performed even better away from home, ranking 1st in defensive efficiency (0.951), 2nd in scoring defense (64.2 PPGA) and 5th in opponent field-goal percentage (38.8%). That all makes for absolute nightmare fuel for a shorthanded Ducks offense that ranks just  155th in offensive efficiency (1.066), 174th in scoring (75.2 PPG), 203rd in three-point shooting (33.5%) and 239th in field-goal percentage (43.2%) while averaging just 62.7 points on 38.7% shooting (26.8% from the perimeter) over its last three contests. \n\nOn the other end of the floor, the offensive emergence of sophomore guard Jeremy Fears Jr. should help the Spartans stay hot.\n\nThus far, the team ranks 60th in offensive efficiency (1.133) 83rd in field-goal percentage (46.8%), 99th in three-point shooting (35.3%) and 100th in scoring (79.1 PPG). Although known mostly for his knack for distributing the ball—he ranks 2nd nationally in assists (8.6 per game)—Fears has scored almost at will as of late, averaging 17.8 points over his last six outings. That added firepower should help Michigan State expose a reeling Oregon defense that enters Tuesday night’s matchup ranked 120th in opponent field-goal percentage (43.4%), 158th in opponent three-point shooting (33.4%), 173rd in scoring defense (74.6 PPGA) and 191st in defensive efficiency (1.058). Those numbers have only free-fallen over the team’s last four games, dropping to 82.8 PPGA on 47.8% shooting (41.6% from deep). \n\nLook for the battle on the glass to once again play a crucial role.\n\nIf the Ducks have one strength, it’s their ability to grab offensive rebounds, ranking 27th in the category (11.5 per game). Unfortunately, limiting such opportunities happens to be an area where the Spartans excel. On the season, the team ranks 1st in opponent offensive rebounding (6.2), 1st in opponent offensive rebounding percentage (18.5%), 1st in defensive rebounding percentage (81.5%) and 10th in defensive rebounding (27.2). It’s actually Michigan State which should have the advantage in the category, as the team ranks 8th in offensive rebounding percentage (38.3%) and 15th in offensive rebounding (11.9) as opposed to Oregon’s rankings of 164th in opponent offensive rebounding (9.0) and 181st in defensive rebounding (22.4%). \n\nHowever, it will be the fast break that dooms the hosts.\n\nIt’s no secret that the Spartans love to play fast. So it comes as no surprise that the team is quite elite when it comes to fast break points, ranking 8th in the category (16.9 PPG; 98th percentile). On the other hand, this is yet another area of concern for the Ducks, as the team has ranked just 232nd in fast break points allowed (10.9 PPG; 37th percentile). \n\nAnd if you’re weary of the large spread, don’t be.\n\nOn the year, Michigan State has squared off with seven opponents outside of the Top 100 in NET rating—Oregon ranks 101st. Not only is the team 7-0 with an average margin of victory of 20.0 points in those contests, but each of those victories have come by nine or more points. That includes all but two coming by 17 or more points. \n\nIn what should be yet another home road contest, trust Sparty to get the job done by 15+. \n\nBOL if tailing, and as always, please do so responsibly. One bet should not have you crashing out all over Reddit.",

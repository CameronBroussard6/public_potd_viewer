The 49ers offense has really been clicking recently and it’s going to make it a challenge even for the difficult Seahawks defense. Since the Seahawks bye in week 8, Darnold has been over this line in 6 of 9 games.\n\nAs good as the offense of the 49ers has been, their defense, specifically the pass rush, has been equally as bad. Caleb hit 330 yards and Rivers hit 277 yards in their last 2 games. Even Cam Ward, who only threw for 170, was able to score 24 points against this team.\n\n\nGood Luck!",

Considering they beat third-placed Aston Villa in a dominant 4-1 fashion on the weekend we ride the good form into this game. I've held off a bit on overloading Arsenal selections but I see the front line clicking a lot better with Oodegard slowly sliding back into form again. Zubimendi allows Odegard to be more free-flowing attacking-wise, and if it's not working a slight reverse.\n\nUsually Arsenal are bit more pragmatic away from home but that was down to the injuries to Saliba and Gabriel, when you want to dominate possession and put pressure on an opponent away from home those 2 are equally as important as any forward as they collect and redistribute to continue play.\n\nArsenal have not hit this line for 3 games straight and now with an away fixture against one of the worst teams in the league in form - I see them going for another goal drive to seperate themselves from City even more\n\n**Expecting 6 SOT tomorrow, BOL.**",

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 6-21-3 *I stay winless in the new year. In the usual fashion, I managed to identify another freak match that saw a very early red card for the team I backed, and that pretty much sealed their fate. They also nearly conceded from the halfway line. We move though, and today we head over to an equally as exciting matchup that's bound to throw some fun our way (but most importantly, a win). I've been eyeing this match since before the new year and I truly believe I'm ending my winless streak today*\n\n**Last Five:** ❌❌❌❌❌\n\n**Event:** LaLiga, RCD Espanyol v FC Barcelona, 3:00 pm EST\n\n**POTD:** RCD Espanyol +1.0, +1.5 Asian Handicap -115, 2 units\n\n**Write Up:** It's safe to say Espanyol have been one of the surprise packages in the Spanish league, perhaps the whole of Europe. After finishing 14th last year in their regular midtable languishing season, they've made significant strides, collecting 10 wins, three draws and just four defeats from 17 matches. Their recent form has been outstanding, with **five consecutive league victories** over Sevilla, Celta Vigo, Rayo Vallecano, Getafe and Athletic Bilbao (all very respectable sides). Perhaps even more impressive are their **home performances** as Espanyol have taken **19 points from the possible 27** at their ground.\n\nNow take into consideration this is a Catalan derby and Espanyol REALLY don't like Barcelona. They're always ready to turn up and despite the fact their *recent H2H has been disappointing,* they **don't usually get blown out by the paper favourites**, notching up a respectable amount of draws. While it’s easy to see Barcelona as the favourite based on table position and firepower, there’s value in backing Espanyol to avoid a heavier defeat. First off, Espanyol enter this match with confidence and momentum. As I said, they’ve won **five LaLiga matches in a row**, a run that highlights how well Manolo Gonzalez’s side are playing, especially considering none of the teams they beat in that stretch are pushovers. At home, Espanyol’s record looks even stronger. They’ve taken points in **five of their last six matches at RCDE Stadium** and kept multiple clean sheets there this season. That defensive resilience matters when taking an Asian Handicap, where even a narrow defeat still yields a winning bet and I think that's a smart play to take today. **Espanyol are good at grinding out results** when needed, so that also gives me confidence heading into this.\n\nMeanwhile, Barcelona’s away form isn’t as bulletproof as the headlines suggest. Though they’re top of LaLiga and score plenty of goals, their away matches often involve **multiple goals conceded,** with **Barcelona averaging nearly 2 goals conceded per away game** this season thanks to their **ridiculously high, dysfunctional defensive line.** This goal conceded number is far higher than the elite visitors normally allow and it's why I truly believe Espanyol can stay in the game longer than the odds imply.\n\nFinally, the rivalry cannot be underestimated. Espanyol historically rise to big occasions in front of their diehard fans, and with the +1.0, +1.5 line, I'm essentially backing them to stay competitive even if Barcelona edge it. Besides (and that's a small consideration that hasn't really influenced my decision behind this bet by a great deal, but still made me even more sure of it), this is **the first LaLiga match after the holidays** and players like **Lamine Yamal** are for sure going to be feeling the effects of all the partying. On the other side, the Espanyol players probably felt like they could have an edge if they just stayed disciplined during the holidays - I'm sure the management would've made that known. The underdog is always going to try to take such things into consideration to level the playing field in one way, because let's face it, technique wise, they're not touching the Blaugrana.\n\nI also like the BTTS Yes angle, as well as an Under 2.5 goals line *(feeling like Espanyol are going to keep Barcelona relatively quiet),* but we're just going to focus on the match result. All in all, fading Barcelona when I really need a sure win perhaps sounds counterintuitive, but if I win, I want to do it in style (and I do believe in the pick I've made, that goes without saying). We've waited far too long for my win, just to achieve it by betting on some heavyweights to score more than 0.5 goals and have more than 4 corners against a relegation threatened side or something. BOL whether you tail or fade, let's enjoy this heated derby, which is for sure going to be even crazier now that I've placed a bet on it ☘️🫡",

In Week 16 against the Panthers, Egbuka reached 40 receiving yards despite having only 1 reception. He has reached 15+ receiving yards in every game this season despite his downfall. \n\n**Rachaad White:** Ever Since Bucky Irving has taken over for RB, Rachaad has been making more use of his carries, averaging 8.46 yard per carry. White has also hit this mark in every game this season, even after his usage declined. In Week 16 against the Panthers, Rachaad White rushed for 45 yards, with a long rush of 39 yards. The Panthers' defense this season allows 4.48 yards per carry to opposing RB's this season. With Rachaad now averaging 4.2 carries per game, I have no doubt he will reach this mark.",

He is the Bucs backup RB, and has played roughly 50% of the snaps all season. In the Bucs last game vs the Panthers, they ran the ball 33 times. Despite the loss, coach Todd Bowles defended the Bucs’ run-heavy game plan against Carolina, saying they beat the Panthers last year with 41 and 38 rushes. “We did everything we wanted to do.” Bucs OC Josh Grizzard says that \"Rachaad White has been “even keel” and has taken the opportunities he’s been given very well. He says that his ability to blitz pickup makes him a true three-down back.\" I expect the Bucs to run the ball at least 25+ times tomorrow, and if so Rachaad should get at least 3+ carries. In 6/16 games he has a carry of 12+ yards, and in 14/16 he has a carry of 7+ yards. This bet very well could cash on 1-2 rushes, but I do expect the Bucs to run the ball a ton tomorrow and that gives plenty of carry attempts for Rachaad White. BOL",

First of all, the under 37.5 bet means everything from 37 and below is considered a win for this bet. 38 and above means a loss. \n\nTo me, the total of the 180s on here feels off. If we compare it to yesterday's matches; Littler’s match had 14 180s while playing 7 sets. Van Veen's match had 25 180s while playing 9 sets. Due to this 37 180s at most already feels quite high. Keep in mind it’s first to 7 sets to win, compared to first to 6 sets yesterday.\n\nIf we compare it with the finals of the previous years, we see:\n\n2025: 10 sets, 25 180s (Littler vs van Gerwen)\n\n2024: 11 sets, 36 180s (Littler vs Humphries)\n\n2023: 11 sets, 37 180s (Smith vs van Gerwen)\n\n2022: 12 sets, 41 180s (Smith vs Wright)\n\n2021: 10 sets, 23 180s (Anderson vs Price, covid year)\n\nI can keep it going but in 2020 it didn’t hit either. \n\nWe can conclude that this bet only went over the total of 37.5 once in the past years.

The pick today is Arkansas to win outright against the Volunteers. Oh man, I love me some John Calipari. He puts his players in the right position to succeed and stand out for the NBA scouts. And I’m sure his players are fired up after he stood up against the weird NCAA/NBA transfer situation going on. These are the types of games John has to win to keep his recruiting alive, I believe in him fully. \n\nArkansas comes into this with a 8-0 record at home this season with two wins against ranked opponents (Texas Tech and Louisville). They have also played stiff competition all year with quality losses to Duke, Houston and Michigan State. They will be more prepared and mentally tougher than Tennessee in this matchup. I’ve been watching a lot of Arkansas basketball and they have two absolute studs on their team. Brazile and Acuff Jr have been a deadly duo heading into conference play and the leadership they provide will only intensify as the season progresses. Not much stats on this one as these two teams matchup pretty evenly. I just believe Arkansas is the better coached and more mature team coming into this coin flip game.

They did play a 1-0 vs Nasaf Qarshi but that was an AFC Champion's League game and they shot 19 times while Nasaf shot 16 times so there was plenty of attacking even though the shots were not converted.  \nAl Taawoun achieved these defensive numbers vs mostly mid/lower table teams but they did score vs Qadsiah and NEOM who are both good teams and they are on a pretty good run. If we take a look at their whole season in the Saudi League, Al Ittihad have 22-16 goal difference while Al Taawoun have 27-13 in 11 games. This paints a completely different picture.\n\nI think the odds overvalue the defensive aspect of the teams' recent games, especially for Al Ittihad. They are good defensively but I expect both teams to push and score goals. Al Ittihad want to climb back up the table where they feel they belong and I expect them to score first but Al Taawon is fighting to keep their 3rd place. I think both teams' offensive power can overwhelm the defenses.\n\nThis is a higher risk pick anyway, so take that into account.\n\nKeep in my mind I'm a random nobody from reddit, so tail with caution.

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 18-16-5 (Avg Odds +128)\n\n**Previous Pick:** Milan ML + Pulisic 1+ SoT (+100) ✅️\n\n**Today's Event:** English Premier League (Soccer) | Wolves vs West Ham (7:00 AM PST)\n\n**Pick:** Jarrod Bowen 1+ SOT and West Ham DC (+124) 1 unit to win 1.24 units\n\n**Write Up:** The Milan game played out about as expected, low scoring but ultimately with Milan coming through. Despite Pulisic not starting, he came through with a SOT anyway after he subbed on around the 78' mark. Great plus money cash to start the weekend!\n\nEPL is back today and we've got the game of the week here as 20th (last) place Wolves host 18th place West Ham. Let's be honest and get out there that both of these teams stink. Wolves are historically bad, as they may be looking at the fewest points ever by an EPL team. West Ham have been spotty, but I think they are a better team than their record states and have shown signs of life. \n\nBowen is the best attacking player for West Ham, the game goes through him. He has 6 of the club's 20 goals this season (30%) and has been in great form lately, scoring in 3 of his last 5 matches. He also has 8 SOTs in his last 6 matches, only failing to land an SOT in one of these games against Man City. I love the odds we're getting for Bowen here. \n\nLets talk about Wolves. They are winless this season, going 0-3-16 so far. They lost at home to Burnley (19th place team), at home to Forest (17th place team) and at home to Leeds (16th place team) just to name a few notable results. They are on track to earn 6 total points this season at the halfway point, which would be firmly the worst EPL season ever, with the current honor of that award is held by Derby County with 11 points. Their stats back up their record, attacking wise they have the fewest SOTs (53) fewest goals scored (10 - the 2nd fewest is 18), fewest shots, fewest goals/shot, we could go on. Defensively, they've conceded the 2nd most goals (36) and 3rd most SOTs (90).\n\nWest Ham are not a great team and do not have the best defensive record themselves, but they really need a win here to start to work out of the relegation zone. This is a team they need to beat, and I suspect Bowen will take it on himself to make that happen. This pick is more about fading the Wolves than anything, but I do think West Ham are a much better team. \n\nBOL and happy Saturday!",

      "text": "Last 5 > WWLWW // Profit: €1,517.80\n\nAston Villa @ 1.79 - €280.00\n\nThis one should be self explanatory. 3rd placed Aston Villa against 17th placed Forest. When talking about home form Villa are one of the best with a 7-1-1 record. Away from home Forest are 2-2-5 and coming into this game they are on a streak of 2 losses away from home and 3 losses overall. Villa on the other hand have won their last 5 home games but just came from a defeat against Arsenal.\n\nLet me say it one more time again, fuck Sean Dyche. I hated how he played at Burnley and I will never rate him as manager. And it shows, Emery is 6-1-1 in managerial H2H while Villa are also 6-2-2 in the club H2H. At home Villa are on a streak of 5 home wins against Forest.",

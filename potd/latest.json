Dallas gives up the 3rd most receptions to TE’s this season. 2nd string QB Jacoby Bassett is under center for the Cardinals and Bassett’s primary/favorite target when he plays has been McBride. In the two games Bassett has started, McBride finished with 13 and 11 receptions. With that being said, I love the chances of him grabbing at least 5 receptions tonight. For the NBA leg, Jalen Brunson has eclipsed 33.5 PRA’s in  5/6 games this season. Brunson has a favorable matchup tonight as he faces a Washington Wizards who are 27th out of 30 teams vs the point guard position this season. Brunson’s usage rate has also seen an increase this season from last. There is a blow out possibility as the Knicks are heavily favored however taking all these variables into account, I still love this play. With that being said… \n\n👇\n\nTake Trey McBride over 4.5 receptions + Jalen Brunson over 33.5 PRA’s tonight!",

      "text": "**Record: 1-1 (+0.85 u)**\n\n**Previous Pick: ❌ Jaxon Smith-Njigba ATTD (-115)**\n\n**Recap:** Sam Darnold shredded the Commanders secondary on Sunday night. He went 21 for 24 with 330 yards and four TDs winning 38 - 14. The Seahawks jumped out to a 31-7 halftime lead, with Darnold perfect on his first 17 throws.   \n  \nJaxon Smith-Njigba posted another monster line: 8 rec for 129 yards. That tied a franchise record with his 6th 100 yard game this season.   \n  \nWhat held JSN out of the end zone? Washington's D keyed on him hard. They doubled him often in the slot and red zone. They forced Darnold to look elsewhere for easy scores; Horton, Arroyo, and White all worked in single coverage or bunches that defenses vacated to shadow JSN.   \n  \nSeattle's scheme under Kubiak leaned on those mismatches, and JSN drew the extra eyes. He still led the team in targets and yards, but the TDs went to the open guys. Solid night overall, just no spike for the league's yardage king.\n\n**Event: NFL: Cardinals @ Cowboys 8:15pm EST**\n\n**POTD: Dak Prescott: OVER 25.5 Pass Completions (-118) 1.18u to win 1u**\n\n* Arizona’s scheme, under Gannon, focuses on stopping the big plays. They use **zone coverage on 75% of their snaps**. More telling, they use **Cover 4 at a league-high rate (29.5%)**. \n* Dak’s **Average Depth of Target against zone is only 6.84 yards**. He is not forcing the ball. He will take the short, easy completions.\n* Dak ranks **1st in the NFL** with a **77.5% completion rate** against zone. He also has a **113.3 rating (2nd) with 10 TDs**. His **catchable pass rate against zone is 79.7%** (8th in the league).\n* Against Arizona’s fave coverage, Dak averages **9.1 yards per pass attempt** **(6th) vs. Cover 4**.\n* Dak's **Completion Percentage Over Expectation (CPOE) is +6.3%**. This ranks 3rd among all QBs.\n* Cardinals rank **25th in pressure rate and 28th in sack rate**. Dak will have a clean pocket to scan the field and find the open man, when throwing from a clean pocket Dak ranks **7th amongst QBs with a 73% Completion Percentag**e.\n* The Cowboys are **1st in the NFL in passing plays of 30-plus yards with 13** and **The Cowboys are 1st in passing plays allowed of 30-plus yards with 15**. I predict a game with high explosive play potential.\n* On the Road Dak had his 3 worst games of the season. In his 3 home games, he averaged 275 passing yards and 2.67 TDs per game.\n* The Cowboys have scored on **58.3% of their drives at home (2nd)**. Their high implied team total (28.5) and projects a potential shootout, given **Dallas's 31st-ranked D**.\n* Arizona allows an average of **24.14 completions per game**. This number was set by a weak slate of QBs (Spencer Rattler, Cam Ward, Mac Jones, Bryce Young). Dak Prescott is in a different class. He ranks **1st in the NFL in QBR (79.5)**",

McCarthy under 30.5 passing attempts (-105). 💰\n\nWriteup: Well that’s not at all how I thought JJ would get to 21-25 pass attempts but we’ll take it!\n\nToday’s POTD: 🏈 Zonovan “Bam” Knight over 48.5 rushing yards (-112). \n\nGame starts at 8:15pm EST. Bet 2.25u\n\nWriteup: At work so I’ll get to the point. No starting running back for a competent team should only be projected 48.5 rushing yards against the Cowboys. The Cowboys are 31st in run defense success rate, and multiple RBs have gone for 100+ yards against them. With Jacoby Brissett at QB now for the Cardinals, I think this helps all offensive players and the defense will have to better prepare against the passing attack, thus opening holes for run opportunities. Bam Knight got 14 carries last week for 57 yards against a much better Packers defense, so I expect Bam to do as well or better tonight and get over 48.5 rushing yards.\n\nRemember to only bet what you can afford, and BOL!",

      "text": "Record: 0-0\n\nNet Units: 0.00\n\nNCAAB // Arizona vs Florida\n\n**Pick: Arizona ML 1u (+146 on FanDuel)**\n\nAn early clash of two legitimate final four contenders. This one is taking place in Vegas at an arena that is home away from home for the Wildcats, they are 9-2 playing there and it has been dubbed \"McKale North\". It will be a packed house skewed heavily in Arizona's favor.\n\nThis could provide problematic for Florida as they are coming in losing their 3 primary guards in all world player Walter Clayton Jr (18.3ppg), Alijah Martin (14.4ppg), and Will Richard (13.3ppg). While they have reloaded with talented guards, they have not been in the types of environments that they will experience tonight, and I believe it will take a little time for them to gel.\n\nMeanwhile Arizona returns an experienced senior guard in Jaden Bradley and replaces Caleb Love, which while he was exciting to watch at times and tore up last year's NCAA tournament, he could be inconsistent. I actually think incoming \"freshman\"...he's 20 years old...Brayden Burries will end up being a better player than Caleb Love in the long run.\n\nI fully expect Arizona to dominate the glass in this game; they have some freaks on their roster including incoming freshman Koa Peat. The son of former NFL offensive lineman Todd Peat, Koa is 6-foot-8, 235 pounds and knows how to use his body. He broke his shooting hand in his high school playoffs and kept playing. With a broken right hand, Peat led Perry High School to its fourth consecutive Arizona state championship, scoring 20 points in the championship game. Forward Tobe Awaka is back for his senior season as well, 6'8\", 250 pounds, rebounding machine. Last year he averaged 7.8 rebounds a game in only 19.5 minutes. Add in a 7'2\" center Motiejus Krivas, while still a bit of a question mark, I just don't see Arizona not winning most of the battles down low.\n\nArizona has the more experienced guard play, should dominate the post, brings in the #2 recruiting class this year, and hasn't lost a season opener since 2006. I expect a good game, but one that Arizona pulls out and gives them some momentum heading into the absolute grinder of a non con they have this year.",

Their recent matches show plenty of attacking intent — averaging 1.35 xG For across the last five games — and they tend to open up in transitions, especially at home.\n\nAntalyaspor come into this one with clear defensive problems. They’ve conceded an average of 1.52 xG Against over their last five, including tough road trips to Fenerbahçe and Gaziantep. Even adjusting for opponent strength, they still allow space in wide areas and struggle to defend crosses and second balls.\n\nEyüpspor should find chances here, and Antalya’s counter-attacking setup means they’ll get their own looks as well. With both sides averaging a combined 4.6 total xG activity in recent weeks, this line at 1.91 looks a touch short — but still playable given the current market.\n\nIf the expected flow holds, we should see an open game with several good scoring chances from both ends.\n\nBOL!",

After yesterday where I flat out predicted the wrong team to control the game, i’m hoping to get back in a big way tonight. Arizonas pass defense all and all has been a step of from what it had been years prior. However the volume they give up is laughable considering the offense they are going up against tonight. Prescott’s season average is 258.6 yards, but he’s gone OVER 260 in 5/7 home games and faces an ARI defense allowing the 10th most pass attempts this season (34.6 Opp Passes/Game). While allowing 199.9 pass yards a game and playing offenses worth noting (colts, packers) closely and under 250 yards passing. With that being said, they haven’t played a passing attack like the cowboys. But with the Cowboys at home, and them coming off a rough game in Denver, I see a big comeback week for them. \n\nAs for Williams, it’s not to be overthought. He has scored in all but 2 games (8 rushing td this season). The Cardinals defense has also allowed a rushing touchdown in nearly every outing this season, I think Williams should be an easy lock to power into the end zone tonight.\n\nTail or fade, BOL!!!",

Now averaging 10.6 minutes in 1st quarters with 2/4 of those being full 12 minutes since Edwards got injured. I still feel 8.5 minutes is his minimum, likely to get 9. His attempts and make stats have been good in 1st quarters prior to last match. While he was averaging 37 MPG prior to last game, he did foul out with 32 minutes so may even be a bit more rested and have more energy in his legs to shoot - potentially? Might be a bit square but rather less total minutes than more from a last game. \n\nThe main reason I like this still - the Nets suck. Only the Wizards concede more PPG. The Nets concede on average 36.5 points per first quarter - the 2nd worst is Detroit with 33.3 (for context, this gap of 3.2 is the same as Detroit to Memphis ranked 15th). So McDaniels should get at least 1-2 extra opportunities to score. Miller, Bridges, Johnson & Oubre have all scored well v Brooklyn as similar SF positions to McDaniels. \n\nAs with the last few days, 1st quarter bets are streaky and he showed this last game shooting season low attempts despite good minutes. Don’t think that will be a trend though, just an outlier - but if tailing, choose unit size responsibly.",

Let's keep going.\n\n**Today's Pick:** ***Mjallby to win(1.53) + Hammarby or Draw(1.40) @ 2.14 -- 2 units***\n\n**Write up:**\n\nA Swedish double on this Monday with the top two clubs in the country included. Back to 2 units on the Monday as always. This parlay is a bit risky because of the fact that both the teams that we are backing are cemented in 1st and 2nd. Hence why we are taking it a bit more safe on Hammarby.\n\n**Varnamo v Mjallby**\n\nMjallby are already champions of Sweden, which is exactly where the odds come from. I reckon the players want to end this record season with 2 more wins from both remaining games. Varnamo is bottom of the league and also cemented in its place. They are relegated and simply not good enough for this league. I can let loose loads of stats here but Mjallby's entire season has been outstanding, with only a single loss in 28 games. Thats about the only stat you need.\n\n**Degerfors v Hammarby**\n\nNow this game is more tricky in my opinion and in this case the odds for the favorite winning are high(2.20) because their opponent is still fighting to get out of a relegation spot. Whereas Hammarby are safely second. Now Hammarby is having a very good season but because of this fact I've put them on a double chance pick which is a little bit more safe. Still a good odd here in my opinion(1.40).\n\n**Best of luck if tailing!** 🍀\n\n**PS:** If you want you can check my record and units won on [https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/OliveCritical5134-qXXxJZ](https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/OliveCritical5134-qXXxJZ)",

He’ll always eat in a Cowboys offense that is first in passing yards per game, and I expect no different here. Arizona’s defense has been mediocre at best, giving up the ninth most passing yards per game and ranking 20th in EPA per pass play. Arizona’s Will Johnson is questionable for the game, which weakens Arizona’s secondary even more. Lamb is explosive and Arizona has given up some big plays to opposing WR1s (36 to JSN, 40 to McMillan, 47 to Ridley, which makes Lamb over on 25.5 longest reception an interesting play too). Lamb has gotten 8+ targets in every game, so combining that volume and YAC potential, Lamb is a good bet to clear 70 yards. I also like Dak to clear 225 passing yards here. He’s cleared this line in all but 2 games (loss to PHI and DEN). Dak will have plenty of time to throw, as Dallas has the 2nd lowest sack rate against Arizona’s defense that is 27th in sack rate. The gamescript should be fine for passing, with Arizona’s offense led by Jacoby Brissett yielding decent results against the Colts and Packers and the spread set around 3 - I wouldn’t worry too much about blowout potential, and even so, a blowout would likely be due to Dak torching Arizona through the air (Dak still cleared 225 handily in DAL blowout wins over NYJ and WAS). Arizona guards the run fairly well, at ninth best in EPA per play against the run. There’s a lot of passing/receiving props that I could opt for here, but I think this one is the safest and best value for money. BOL and only bet what you can afford to lose.",

Thus the 5 unit play vs my typical 3\n\nThe Cardinals will match up against the Cowboys on Monday Night Football in Arlington. While the Cowboys have one of the best offenses in the league, they also have one of the worst defenses which has led to shoutouts. I obviously think this only tees this bet even more, especially given his recent connection with Jacoby Brissett. Since Brissett took over at quarterback, Jones has seen a noticeable uptick in production. Over the last three games, he’s posted 25 yards against San Francisco on 2 catches, 79 yards versus Indianapolis on 5 catches, and 67 yards against Green Bay on 2 catches. He’s averaging 15.3 yards per catch on the season. With 12 catches for 183 yards through seven games, Jones has cleared the 1.5 receptions in all four of the last four outings. Not to mention, all of these teams have been defenses than the cowboys. \n\nDallas has struggled defensively in recent weeks, particularly in the secondary. Injuries to key players like Trevon Diggs and Donovan Wilson have opened up passing lanes, and the Cowboys have allowed multiple receivers to post chunk gains in each of their last three games. They rank in the bottom third of the league in yards per completion allowed and have given up explosive plays to slot and boundary receivers alike. Not to forget, Zay holds the NCAA D1 receptions records from his senior season at East Carolina University proving his ability. I expect Arizona to trail for the full game, which should lead to more passing volume. Even if Dallas turns this game on its head, I would expect to see Zay out there get reps. \n\nPrediction: Zay Jones 4 catches 51 yards",

One thing nobody is doubting is that best duo in football may just be Lamb and Pickens. I went back and forth but finally just said why not both. Even in Denver when Dak had one of his lowest passing games with a 188 yds, these two still covered the lines were working with. Lambs last 4 games(injured for 1 game) he has gone over a 100 yds receiving in everyone except for last week in Denver where he finished with 74 yds 7 receptions out of the 10 targets. Pickens last 5 games he has gone over 50 yds in every game with his highest yds at 168 and his lowest against the jets for 57 yds.\n\nIt appears that both receivers get a slight boost of playing better at home with Pickens having 134 and 82 yds at home, and Lamb having 112 and 100 yd games at home.\n\nDak also seems to pass better at home throwing for 319 vs packers defense at home and 264 against commanders.\n\nAll in all there should be plenty of receiving yds for Pickens and lamb to have big days and both cover the combined 115 yds needed.

The Cowboys come into this one 3-4-1 with wins over the Giants, Jets and Commanders with a tie against the Packers and losses to the Eagles, Bears, Panthers and Broncos. The Cardinals roll into this one with a 2-5 record with wins over the Saints and Panthers and losses to the 49ers, Seahawks, Colts, Packers and they somehow lost to the Titans giving them their sole win and probably only win of the year. Injuries have hurt this Cardinals team as they are expected to start backup quarterback Jacoby Brissett and have lost runningbacks James Conner and Trey Benson so their run game has struggled in the past couple weeks without those guys. My key factor in this one is that the Cowboys have the best rated pass offense in the league averaging 271 passing yards per game and they face off against a Cardinals pass defense that ranks 21st in the league so I think Dak Prescott will be able to carve up this Cardinals secondary which will open up opportunities for Javonte Williams in the run game.\n\nPrediction: 33-27 Cowboys\n\nLast pick:🏈Chargers -9💩Titans cover without a single touchdown on offense.\n\nBest of luck to everyone tailing and remember to bet responsibly!

      "text": "**POTD Record 39-35-1**\n\nEasy easy winner. Should have expressed in my post that this was my biggest bet of the year so far. I just did not understand how Philly was on -5.5. This game was over at half time.\n\nAs much as I want to run it back attacking BKN, I see another game that is almost identical to my last play. Targeting another team that I think really stinks.\n\n**Bucks -5.5**\n\nI am not going to lie, I think I have been looking for a game to target the bucks after making them my play against GSW a few games back, where Giannis got ruled out (after post made), and RYAN ROLLINS went the fuck off. I liked this bucks team going into the season, and trust me I did not factor this guy into the equation at all, however now I for sure am.\n\nThis Buck’s team has a shot to win the East this season, and I truly think Giannis is motived to play meaningful basketball late into the season. Games like this are key to run up the score, rest the guys in the 4^(th). If you have not noticed already, one of my main angles in betting NBA is targeting bad teams in bad spots and in bad matchups. Not always the case, however this game just sticks out to me. Indy, is IMO one of the bottom 2-3 teams in the league this season\n\nLook, I love what they did against GSW the other night, and a big fan of the underdog energy. I respect teams that are taped together at the guard spots and still fighting. I get it. Indiana is in full “nobody believes in us” mode right now, and usually a team I am pulling for, but not one I am putting my money on. Let’s be serious, Indy’s missing so many players…. They’re basically running an NBA game without an NBA backcourt. Siakam is balling out, but outside of him, nothing impresses me especially with Mathurin out.\n\nMeanwhile Giannis is dominating, averaging 34/13/7. Probable to play tomorrow, which I hope doesn’t happen (made bucks POTD the other night prior to Giannis being ruled out. Still won bcz my new favorite player ROLLINS). The Bucks are putting up 123+ a night. Top five in the league in scoring and top five in made threes (15.5 per). The Pacers are scoring 112 a night, and that’s with Pascal Siakam doing everything, including bringing the ball up and pretending to be a point guard. That 11-point per-game gap from avg ppg, and we are getting this at -5.5.\n\nCan Indiana hang on the glass? Yeah. They rebound like crazy, and Milwaukee’s actually been soft on the boards to start the year and are losing the rebounding battle so far this season (avg 40rbs & give up 44rbs). That’s the only thing that scares me, the ugly, grindy, foul-heavy version of this where we’re sitting at Bucks +4 with two minutes left and sweating free throws.\n\nBut if this game even halfway opens up? If pace gets normal? Milwaukee is just way more talented, way healthier where it matters, and way more organized offensively. Indiana doesn’t have the guards to actually trade buckets in the halfcourt with a team that’s throwing Giannis (AND ROLLINS) at you plus hitting 15+ threes a night.

I expect him to be more aggressive on the glass, and this contest is expected to be a high pace, high scoring and relatively close game. All of these work in favor of the Bucks big man getting over this modest total. The Pacers give us the 4^(th) highest rebounds to Centers, and in all their games so far, the big men have exceeded their respective rebound lines, which is not a surprise since the tallest Pacer is 6'9 (Myles is 6'11 for comparison).",

      "text": "Record: 154-135, -3.51 units\n\nLast Pick: Henry Bernet ML vs Thiago Tirante (+172, 1 unit): Win\n\nTennis | Knoxville Challenger | 2:30 PM EST (estimated)\n\nToday's Pick: Antoine Ghibaudo vs Saba Purtseladze | **Ghibaudo ML at -185. 1 unit.** \n\nWrite-up: Bernet closed at +128, so we got some solid value on that pick. He ended up playing a great match to win in straight-sets and move one step closer to qualifying. I wanted to back him again against Jan-Lennard Struff, but the odds honestly seemed pretty fair (he ended up losing but narrowly covering the spread). \n\nAntoine Ghibaudo comes into the Knoxville Challenger, which is held at the University of Tennessee's indoor venue, ready to make an impact. Ghibaudo plays his best tennis on fast courts. In July of this year at the grass-court Hall of Fame Open, he made an amazing run from qualifying to the quarterfinals, where he put in an admirable effort against one of the most experienced grass-courters out there in Adrian Mannarino. More recently, he performed quite well at the indoor challengers in Lincoln and Sioux Falls, making the semis of the latter event with a win over Martin Damm. In contrast, Purtseladze is in extremely rough form this year. He's only had one good event all year, a Challenger title in his home country, and has struggled to find wins since. He had some injury issues starting in September, as he skipped most of the month and then was forced to withdraw from two different events in October. He did manage to score a win over Max Wiskandt last week in Charlottesville before getting absolutely crushed by Rafa Jodar, but that win (9/9 BPs saved, 6.79 performance rating) wasn't overly convincing. Saba was also priced at 3.50 in that match, and I don't see why his odds should be so much lower here - Wiskandt isn't a bad player, but he hasn't exactly been lighting it up this year. \n\nOverall, I feel that Ghibaudo has the more dynamic and aggressive game right now. Purtseladze does possess a big, heavy serve, but he's been looking a bit flat-footed recently, and has a bit of a weakness of the backhand wing. Ghibaudo's backhand is actually one of his stronger attributes, and so I feel that he can capitalize on that. I will say that I wouldn't take this past around -190, as these odds aren't quite as good as they were at opening (where this would have been a 2-unit play). Nevertheless, I believe that there is still enough value left to play this. \n\nNote: The [POTD Capper Tracker](https://potd.lol), which you may remember from its Google Sheet days, is finally back in a cleaner, more robust website format!

My best sport by far, and what better way than to have my second 2U pick since being on POTD (first one was rockets -15 last week and they won by 30). I love love love a good spot against the defending national champ in college basketball. I mean the public is gonna be all over Florida on the short spread of 3.5 (yes I bought to 4.5, sue me motherfucker). Look, this Florida team is going to have growing pains to begin, this is a completely new roster and they’re going to be traveling way out west to a place that’s very familiar to the wildcats, Las Vegas. Arizona fans are known for traveling well and the environment in T-Mobile Arena will be a home court feeling for UA in what is expected to be a sold out crowd. Arizona will be fully loaded again with four key returners in Jaden Badley, Tobe Awaka, Anthony Dell’Orso and Motiejus Krivas. Plus, Lloyd and his staff signed the No. 2 recruiting class according to 24/7 Sports. This is an early season game and guard play matters a lot, and veteran guard Jaden Bradley should be able to do enough to help will this team to a possible win. I truly do think this spread is a bit large even at 3.5, but I’m smashing a two unit spot so I wanted to give myself another leg with 4.5. Its been a very fun first week on POTD, I’m not gonna sit here and complain about a 5-2 record at all (although 6-1 would’ve been fucking sweet) and once again I’m blessed to be able to write another one for yall again… this is going to cash, and let’s get back on track fellas, cheers 🍻",

However there was a fair wait before the second goal which came in the 86th minute. \n\nHelsingor scored late into injury time. \n\n2-1 win. Happy days for us \n\nToday's Pick:  Mjallby to win at Varnamo and Under 3.5 total goals. 3u @ 2.60\n\nPick: I normally wouldn't go this high price-wise (if you want to be safer, you can just back the ML at about 1.50). \n\nMjallby have already won the league, and Varnamo are already relegated. \n\nSo in a way, neither have too much jeopardy in this game. \n\nIn their last game, Mjallby showed that they're not taking the rest of the season off. They copped an early goal last matchday and fought back to win 2-1. Plenty of teams would just half-ass that game... And tbh, not many would blame them. \n\nMjallby have been great away from home with a 11-2-1 record on the road. Well.... They've got the highest points total in league history, they've obviously been good.\n\nHowever, in those 14 games away from home only three of them have gone over the 3.5 goal line, and the last of those was early August. The other two were within their first 4 away games. \n\nEven in their home games, only two of those have cleared 3.5 goals. \n\nSo most of their wins haven't been complete goal-fests... Even against the bottom teams.  \n\nThis game they travel to last place Varnamo who have been dire this season. \n\nFor a team who are dead last, only having a -9 goal difference at home is somewhat tight. They've had a lot of draws at home which helps with this. \n\nOnly about 50% of Varnamo gone games have gone over the 3.5 goal t\n\nI think Mjallby win this, and I cant see them piling on the score. \n\nAgain, if you're after that extra safety, there's probably safer options in this match like just going the win. But for me the juice is worth the squeeze.",

Trey McBride enters this Monday night matchup on an absolute tear, having scored 2 TDs against the Packers and another vs the Colts. Even following Kyler Murray’s injury and Jacoby Brissett taking the reins of the Arizona offense, McBride has remained a focal point. And if the Cardinals want any shot at pulling off this upset, they’ve gotta feed him the ball.\n\nBesides momentum, another factor on our side is the defense McBride will be facing. Dallas LOVES to give up points, and in every game this season their opponents have put up at least 20. I expect the Cowboys to win a close shootout, but look for McBride to find pay dirt.

Hammarby, meanwhile, are in fine form offensively with an average of roughly 2.5 goals in their last six matches and over 2.5 goals seen in five of those. Tactical setups point to a high-intensity game: Degerfors will likely go with a 4-3-3 or 4-4-2 trying to be proactive, while Hammarby favour a pressing 4-3-3 with width and attacking full-backs. With both teams motivated—Degerfors needing points and Hammarby maintaining attacking momentum—the conditions strongly suggest a match with at least three goals.",

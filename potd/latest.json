      "text": "Record: 0-0-1 (-2 und)\n\n- Tournament: Premier League\n- Event: Crystal Palace vs. Burnley\n- Pick: Crystal Palace -1.0 Asian Handicap\n- Odd: @1.88 (Bet365) | 2und\n\n*Pick written in Spanish. Translated with AI. Please understand.*\n\nLore:\nWe are heading to Selhurst Park for this Matchday 26 Premier League clash between Crystal Palace and Burnley. What we are looking for with this -1.0 Asian Handicap is a comfortable victory for \"The Eagles\"; if they win by a single goal, the bet is pushed (refunded), but if they manage to win by two or more, we secure the green.\n\nI really like this pick because Oliver Glasner’s Palace side is coming in with high confidence after raiding the Amex Stadium and defeating Brighton (0-1). Although the absences of Mateta and Nketiah might seem significant, the team has found interesting offensive fluidity through Ismaila Sarr and the winter arrival of Brennan Johnson (£35M signing). The stats don't lie: Palace is averaging an xG of 1.58 per 90 minutes, a figure much higher than what their current goal record reflects, indicating they are generating far more than they are finishing. Against the league's worst defense, their clinical edge should sharpen up.\n\nWhen looking at Burnley, the outlook is bleak. Scott Parker’s side is in freefall: they haven't won in their last 16 Premier League matches and have conceded 49 goals in 25 matchdays (an average of 1.96 goals conceded per game). As visitors, their performance plummets drastically, having earned just 5 points out of a possible 36 away from home. Their xGA (Expected Goals Against) is among the highest in the competition, conceding a massive amount of shots on target per match.\n\nTactically, Palace has consolidated a solid block with Lacroix and Richards, allowing Daniel Muñoz (who already scored against Burnley in the reverse fixture) to push forward with total freedom. With a Burnley side averaging just 0.83 xG per game and missing key players like Josh Cullen and Amdouni, I find it very difficult for them to trouble Dean Henderson. The physical superiority in both boxes and the current dynamics of both sides make this -1.0 line hold tremendous value.\n\n*Did you win some money?

Great, sweat free win from our consistent money maker. Not much more needs saying, let's go streaking. \n\nToday we're backing Jorgen Strand Larsen, the 2nd most prolific Norwegian striker currently in the EPL. Having recently joined palace from Wolves, he looked good in his first match at Brighton - landing 2 SOTs on 3 shots. He notably also hit 2 SOTs against Burnley earlier in the season while he was with wolves, who provided much less attacking threat and service options than the Palace wingers will. \n\nLets talk Burnley. I love to target players facing Burnley since they concede the most SOTs in the EPL, and it's still not close. They average 6 SOTs conceded per match, there is only one other team that averages more than 5 SOTs per match and thats West Ham. Burnley recently conceded 11 SOTs away to Liverpool, including 2 on 6 shots to their center forward Ekitike. And right before that they conceded 7 SOTs on 8 shots to to Man U's Sesko.\n\nThe numbers are there with both teams for this play to hit, we just need Strand Larsen to show up to play and convert his chances. BOL and have a great Wednesday!",

A close 1-point win does nothing for them they would still be eliminated. That means they will be pushing for points until the final buzzer, which makes covering -2.5 much safer than usual.\n\n​To hit that number, they have loaded up specifically for this do-or-die game. Even without RHJ, they brought in the Gilas legend Justin Brownlee, high-IQ playmaker Jason Brickman, and the big man Cady Lalanne to run the show.\n\n​Ryukyu has zero film on this lineup. While they are preparing for the Meralco, they are walking into a trap against a bigger, smarter roster that they haven't scouted. Plus, Ryukyu is basically safe for the playoffs as long as they don't get blown out, so they have zero incentive to fight for a win if they are down late.\n\n​We are backing the desperate home team to hit their number.

Today, going for a parlay, so staking half a unit.\n\nLeg 1 - Wolves have had >2.5 corners in their last 5 matches & in 8 of 10 last matches. They are playing a more attacking game & have hit this even against teams in the top half of the table. Expect to see it hit here, unless Wolves try to play for a safe 1 point.\n\nLeg 2 - Harry Wilson has been sensational for Fulham this season and has netted eight goals across his 22 starts in the Premier League. He’s achieved this goal tally from 53 shots, working out to an average of 2.56 shots per 90. Wilson has had 2+ shots in four of his last five Premier League appearances, one of these matches saw him have eight shots which highlights the kind of shot volume we could see from Wilson in this clash. The only risk here would be if Jimenez gets all the shots today, which does sometime happen when i do these player props.\n\nHope we get the W & BoL",

Historical data, combined with each side’s current season profile, points strongly in that direction.\n\nHead-to-head meetings between these teams have regularly produced goals, with the average comfortably above three goals per match in recent seasons. Clean sheets are rare in this fixture, and scorelines such as 2–1, 3–1, and 2–2 have been common, reinforcing the idea that both attacks tend to break through while neither defense fully shuts the game down.\n\nSt. Gallen’s matches this season have been among the most goal-heavy in the league, with nearly 80% finishing over 2.5 goals. They score consistently but also concede at a high rate, resulting in a strong run of both teams scoring in their recent games. This combination naturally pushes their matches toward higher totals rather than controlled, low-scoring outcomes.\n\nYoung Boys show a similar pattern. Over 80% of their league matches have gone over 2.5 goals, driven by a potent attack and a defense that has conceded in most recent fixtures. While they remain one of the league’s strongest sides offensively, they rarely keep opponents off the scoresheet, especially in faster-paced matches.\n\nTaken together, the goal-heavy history between these teams, their season-long over 2.5 trends, and their attacking styles all support an open game script. Rather than an isolated angle, the data consistently suggests a match where both sides find the net and the total goal count pushes beyond 2.5.",

China play Great Britain, both very experienced teams but China is often overlooked as they don't play in as many high profile events. These two teams have played six times and China has covered +5.5 in every game, including two wins. Find a +5.5 out there and hammer it.",

That boy is going right to the very top. I’ll be tracking my bets per tournament for full clarity from now on and will be making a spreadsheet for this at some point (I also had a write-up for yesterday that I forgot to post).\n\nI don’t really know why Tiafoe is an underdog here. Should be pick’em odds in my opinion so I see quite a bit of value. We have a match-up between two Americans who showed promise at some point but have become pretty regular tour players. Tiafoe had a pretty bad season last year, falling to his ranking of 30 before cutting his season short in Shanghai and overhauling his coaching team. He’s had a pretty standard start to the year losing to better players in the form of Medvedev in R2 Brisbane and De Minaur in R3 Melbourne and defeating worse players than him. Foe won his opening round against Atmane and really stepped it up after dropping the first set to a tricky opponent to face in these conditions. Korda as usual had a stop-start season in 2025 due to injuries and is currently ranked 53rd. I would consider the start to his season to be on the worse side compared to Tiafoe, he did well to reach the QF’s in Brisbane before losing to Michelsen but followed this up with a tragic loss against a severely hampered Kokkinakis in Adelaide and was dumped out of the AO in the first round to Columbia student Zheng. Sebi did then drop to challenger level as the top seed where he reached the final but honestly his level was pretty average throughout, eventually losing to Svajda in straights. He opened his Dallas campaign with a solid revenge win over Zheng. \n\nThe conditions in Dallas are on the faster side of indoor tournaments. Tiafoe’s biggest weapon is serve + forehand combination which should work well in this match with how fast the courts are. Both players are good servers and mediocre returners but I feel like Frances will have more looks on return compared to Sebi. There won’t be too many rallies and Tiafoe is better at finishing points early compared to Korda who prefers rhythm. Therefore I believe the higher ranked American will take initiative in rallies more often than his opponent as the game goes on and expose Korda’s movement (or lack of). Whilst Korda has the advantage from the baseline especially on the backhand side being arguably the cleanest hitter out there, Tiafoe’s game has a higher ceiling in these conditions through being the more aggressive player and will be looking to take it more to his opponent on return rather than the other way around. Without the patterns that Sebastian loves to implement due to the court speed I expect Tiafoe’s athleticism and flair to allow him to prevail in this match-up. With regard to H2H Tiafoe leads 4-3. Foe won their only encounter last year when he reached the French Open quarters winning the match in straight sets. Korda has won their last two hard courts encounters but are still level 2-2 overall, though Frances won their only indoor match in 2018 in three sets. So not much to split the two, I also like the over games and I see Tiafoe prevailing in three sets. Anyhow in my mind he shouldn’t be the underdog as he has the bigger weapons in this match-up (though his level is less stable than Korda’s so do keep that in mind). BOL !",

I’m in it for the long game, and that’s the type of play I want to be investing in. \n\nOlaf Pieczkowski is a 21-year-old player who has been actively competing on the pro tour for a few years, but committed to LSU to play college tennis this season. It's not as if Pieczkowski was performing poorly, as he already holds one pro title in singles and two in doubles, but college is becoming a more and more common option for established ITF/CH level pros looking to break though. Among the reasons for this are that a college tennis scholarship offers free training, coaching, and competition opportunities, allowing players to focus their energy on improving their game rather than just getting by. There are also ample opportunities to play pro tennis on the side, such as this event, which is actually held in Baton Rouge on LSU's home courts. In this type of setting, home players obviously get a boost from familiarity with the courts and crowd support, and we've already seen that play out here. Not only did Pieczkowski score a dominant 6-0, 6-0 win over Noah Schacter in Round 1 (7.72/10 performance), his teammates (Arutiunian, Kohlmann de Freitas, Loncarevic, Markovic, and Stirbu) have mostly outperformed expectations, with several winning qualifying matches as an underdog. But Pieczkowski is the top dog in this crop, and should have coaching staff in his corner for his R2 encounter with Quinn Vandecasteele. \n\nVandecasteele is no scrub, and just achieved a career-best result in Cleveland by making the semifinals from qualifying. However, this is a bit of a quick turnaround, and his performance against Forbes in R1 (6.38) wasn't overly convincing. Overall, I think Quinn is going to need to play some really precise offense to get through this one. His biggest weapon is usually his serve, but Pieczkowski was returning well in R1. He doesn't have a super powerful baseline game, but does like to float into the net when he gets the upper hand. However, he's going to need to be careful, because Olaf can pull off some really nice passing shots. In general, Pieczkowski just looked much more comfortable in these conditions, while Vandecasteele saw a lot of his balls flying long, and never looked fully in control. I don't see any reason for Pieczkowski to be the underdog here, and I might peg him as a very slight favorite considering the circumstances. As a result, I like him at plus money.",

So far the playoffs results have left some serious doubts about that, as TES and IG from the top group both struggled against lower tier teams with TES barely surviving in a 5 game win against WE, and IG losing outright 3-1 as solid favorites. OMG are coming off some really good form ever since swapping out their jungler for re0 and beat EDG yesterday who were big -500 favorites in a 3-1 upset.\n* This is the final b05 to determine who makes the top group, both teams will be leaving everything on the line here. On one hand, I am a big IG fan and love Rookie he is my all time favorite player, on the other they look awful this split. However, I think this matchup should be significantly better for IG then the NIP matchup on paper, they have much better win cons imo, a better bot matchup, a better top matchup, and a winning mid matchup with Rookie>haichao who has always done historically very well against Haichao in the h2h. Re0 has also been getting away with invading and playing relatively disrespectfully quite a bit against EDG, however I don't think he can get away with the same things against Wei.\n* This pick is mainly banking on IG to win Map 1, their are some small cases this pick can miss if IG lose the map, but in general this will normally line up with the overall map winner. \n* With the above point, their are two reasons why I really like this line despite IG shaky form, IG are close to -200 favorites to win the map, while you are getting this line at -122, Starry is 0/9 hitrate in map losses this split so far averaging 2.11 kills per map loss overall. In map wins he has gone over in 5/9 of the match wins this split, but still gives 4/9 wins where he went under this line\n* OMG are also averaging the least kills in map losses of any team in the entire LPL at just 5.8 kills per map loss, meaning even if rounding this up to \\~6 kills per map loss, Starry would need to pick up \\~83% of them in a map loss on that trajectory while currently only averaging a 30.6% kill share for LNG\n* Think despite IG's struggles, tons of advantages coming in, they got a full day rest to scout an entire b05 from OMG coming in, they are higher seed and get draft advantage in the b05, they are the more experienced players and have clear advantages in individual players in the matchup.

Hurkacz had a pretty lengthy time off last year due to injury and he is still yet to have multiple impressive showings in a tournament. I think Bublik will come out and move Hubie all over the court as well as serve well.\n\n[PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/micahpugh?locale.x=en_US)\n\n[Venmo](https://venmo.com/u/Micah-Pugh)",

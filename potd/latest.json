With him out, Walker will definitely be getting many looks on designed passes and check downs. \n\nNew England has some phenomenal talent at LB who will be watching for these, but Seattle has too many weapons at WR to always dedicate personnel to preventing a RB from catching a check down or screen pass. \n\nI know teams try to break away from tendencies on games like this, but I can't imagine Seattle deviating that much from history. If anything they'll have more designed passes to slow down the NE pass rush. \n\nKenneth Walker over 2.5 receptions ",

      "text": "__POTD Record:__ 73-41-1 (+62.9u)\n\n__Previous Pick:__ [❌ D Daniels o13.5 rebs/asts (-110), 3.3u](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/s/DIwum3O4vH)\n\n__Event:__ NFL: Seahawks vs Patriots 6:30pm EST\n\n__POTD:__ Parlay: Seahawks ML & u54.5 points (-125), 3.75u\n\n__Write Up:__ Super Bowl LX is here. We have one of the most unlikely matchup outcomes of a Super Bowl we’ve ever seen, from a preseason odds perspective. Both of these teams were +6000 or higher to win the Super Bowl preseason. There are multiple story lines in this one, but we have the youngest QB to reach the Superbowl since the 1984 season in Drake Maye (23 years old). He’s facing a QB in San Darnold who was the No. 3 overall pick & castoff by Jets, then the Panthers, then signed with the 49ers to backup Purdy, then signed with the Seahawks to go on & win the 1 seed, with a 30-7 record over the last 2 years (best in the NFL), & now he is 1 win away from a Superbowl. The other big storyline is we are finally getting a rematch of Super Bowl 49 & the Malcolm Butler interception at the goal line game, when the Seahawks could’ve ran the ball with Marshawn Lynch who had 102 yards that game & was a beast on the goal line. Both teams are entering this matchup with the same regular season record at 14-3. Neither team lost by 8+ points this season. These teams faced 7 common opponents this year: Titans, Steelers, Bucs, Saints, Texans, Panthers, & Falcons. Both went 6-1 vs these teams, but Seattle had a +101 point differential compared to the Pats +64. On offense, Seattle averaged 5.9 yards/play (6th), with a 44% success rate (8th), ranking 2nd in points per game (29.2 ppg). However, they’ve they’ve averaged 36.0 ppg in the playoffs. Seattle leads the NFL in passing plays gaining 10+ yards (33.2%) & rank 6th in points per drive on offense (2.44). __To put the Seahawks season into perspective using DVOA, a stat that compares teams across multiple eras to the league average adjusting for strength of schedule, the Seahawks are 7th best of all time.__ On the other side you have __a Pats team that faced the 3rd easiest schedule by DVOA for any team to make the Superbowl.__ Going 14-3 in the season after a 4-13 record in 2024, the Pats are the 1st team to ever make the Super Bowl after losing 13+ games the previous year. __In the regular season the Pats averaged 2.60 points per drive (4th), 6.2 yards per play (2nd) & had a 46% success rate (4th). They had a gain of 10+ yards on 22.5% of their offensive plays & 20+ yards on 8.1%, both the highest rates in the league. In their 3 playoff games, they only averaged 1.24 points per drive (12th/14 playoff teams), 4.3 yards per play & 33.3% success rate. They only had a gain of 10+ yards on 14.1% of plays & 20+ yards on 6.3%.\nThe two lowest success rates for New England on offense this season have come over their last 2 games. __The Pats have averaged 18.0 ppg in the postseason, the fewest for any team to make the Super Bowl since 1979. They put up just -0.13 EPA/play on offense.__ But they did become first team to make a Super Bowl against 3 Top-5 defenses in the postseason. They will play their 4th straight in the Seahawks. Seattle ranks 2nd in DEF EPA/game (7.6). They are 4th in DEF success rate (61.6%), ranking 1st in yards allowed per rushing play (3.8 yards) & 4th in yards allowed per passing play (5.3 yards). Seattle has allowed 1.49 points per drive (3rd) & a TD on a league low 15.3% of possessions. The Seahawks allowed 400 yards of offense only 3 times this season. Their 17.1 points allowed per game ranks 1st in the NFL. But the Pats D has also been phenomenal.\n\nThe Pats allowed just 17.3 points per game (2nd behind Seattle), were 7th in yards per play allowed (4.9) & 3rd in points allowed per drive (1.60). They’ve allowed just 26 points these playoffs, 2nd fewest all time through 3 playoff games for a team entering Superbowl. If you are going to have success against this Seattle offense, you have to find a way to eliminate the ground game & force Darnold to pass. If you can force Seattle out of its play-action passing game, that's where teams have had more success. On PA Darnold averages 11.0 yards/pass (2nd) with a league-high 16.1 yards per completion & a 10.1% TD rate (2nd). On non PA passes, those numbers drop to 7.5 yards per pass, 11.1 yards per completion (13th) & a 3.7% TD rate (29th). The Pats have 2 elite DT’s in Williams & Barmore who will be facing an incredibly shaky RG in Bradford & LG in Wilson. On the ground, I don’t expect any real success for Walker The Patriots, at full health were 4th in EPA/Rush at -0.137 prior to(Wk1-10), & have been even better in their last 4 games (-0.304 EPA/Rush). They’ve also been great vs zone rushing schemes & outside runs. Seattle was 4th in zone rushing %, & Walker 9th in NFL in outside attempts. The Pats allow 2.93 YPC to zone runs (1st) & 4.17 YPC to outside runs (4th) in games where Williams & Spillane were both active. Quick pressures allowed by LT Will Campbell & collapsed pockets could lead to drive-ending sacks for Seattle, while bad rushing matchups could mean red zone drives stall out & turn into field goals. When Seattle has taken a sack on a possession this season, they have averaged 0.97 points per drive (19th) compared to 2.70 points per drive without a sack taken (6th). When seeing quick pressure (his air net yards per pass drops from 3rd -> 29th). The Pats have brought quick pressure at a 19% rate, which is well above the league average. But Darnold has done an excellent job closing out the season by minimizing mistakes. After a 3.7% interception rate through Week 11 (2nd worst in the NFL), he has a 1.6% interception rate over his past 9 games (6th). OC Klint Kubiak decided to switch to a shorter passing game, with opponents playing more zone coverage to limit Seattle’s downfield passing attack, Over that nine-game span, Darnold is averaging 6.8 air yards per attempt (22nd) with just 29.5% of his passes traveling 10+ yards (25th), & 7.4% 20+ yards downfield (28th). Before that, Darnold was averaging 9.0 air yards per pass (3rd), with 39% of his passes going 10+ yards (4th) & 14.7% of his throws 20+ yards (5th). But he’ll have a tough task vs a Pats defense that is 4th in the NFL in defensive EPA/pass since Week 11. They’ve allowed the 4th fewest YPG since Wk11), yet also lock down the slot (2nd fewest YPG). They’ll most likely run a ton of 2-high looks. They’ve run 2 high at a +59% rate in each of their last 2 games, while the Seahawks offense sees 2 high at a top 10 rate. Darnold drops off notably against 2 high (7.54 -> 6.56 air net yards per pass). I expect this to be a slower more methodical game by these offenses. Both these teams play slowly. Both offenses average 30.6 seconds per play, ranking 28th in the NFL.\n\nDefensively, both of these teams are top 5 in EPA/Play on the year. Seattle has the edge in pretty much every facet. I think they win in a lower scoring game.\n\n__Seattle ML & u54.5 Total Points__\n\nAppreciate the love!

Washington averages 112 points per game, Miami gives up 117. Those averages alone favor the over. Miami like to play extremely fast, 1st in the league in pace while Washington like to play fast as well, ranking 9th in pace. Expect both these teams to run up the points today. Line movement has moved in favor of the over. Game starts in 1 hour.\n\n👇\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ruimvoo59big1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=74917891c39880850eb6f90a1df5f9cdf312e31d",

      "text": "Previous Play Recap:\n\nHouston -1 (-110) ✅\n\nHouston wins 77–66 and controlled the game statistically — holding BYU (an 86+ PPG offense) to just 66 points, 39.6% shooting, and a season-low scoring output. Houston also shot 47.5%, won the glass 40–36, and had a 30–24 edge in paint points. Defense and rebounding dictated the game exactly as projected.\n\nRecord: 1–2\n\nNet Units: -1.36u\n\nROI: -30%\n\n**Pick**: Rashid Shaheed OVER 30.5 Rushing + Receiving Yards (+100)\n\nUnits: 1.25u\n\nWrite-Up:\n\nThis number is still light for Shaheed’s usage profile. Since being added, Seattle has manufactured touches for him whether it be pre snap motion, screens, and vertical shots designed to create space. He doesn’t need volume; he needs one or two efficient touches.\n\nFrom a matchup standpoint, New England has shown vulnerability to secondary and slot-type receivers. They’ve allowed explosive games to complementary pass catchers and gadget usage out of motion.\n\nPatriots sit middle-to-lower tier vs slot/secondary receiver production overall, allowing consistent yardage to wideouts outside true WR1 matchups.\n\n30.5 yards is essentially one designed touch + one reception, or a single explosive play — both realistic given role and matchup. At plus money, this is a numbers play.",

Brook Lopez and John Collins are not nearly as good as Gobert in terms of rebounding. The Clippers are giving up a lot of offensive rebounds, an area where Gobert thrives. He ranks top 10 all season in offensive rebounds, averaging around 4. Cardwell from the Kings just got 14 boards, and Jarrett Allen got 11. The Clippers are ranking bottom 10 in the league in rebounds allowed to Centers aswell. This looks like another Donovan Clingan situation, where he grabbed 17 & 19 boards against the Grizzlies, who didn't have a center and were gifted a low line.",

Manchester City over 4.5 shots on target is priced below their season-long average of around 5 SOT per game, so the line is structurally low. With Arsenal leading the title race and a late slip at Spurs last week, City have to push for control rather than manage the game. The lineup confirms attacking intent with Omar Marmoush starting (big plus sign imo), plus Phil Foden and an in-form Antoine Semenyo driving shot volume with of course the seasons top goal scorer Haaland. Crucially, this bet is not result- or goal-dependent; it’s purely about sustained shooting pressure.\n\nUnits: 3",

Past encounters at Anfield don't matter - it is completely new teams in front of us. Liverpool does not resemble their last season's title winning squad at all, and arguably Manchester City is even more different with 10+ new names and another 500 millions spent.\n\nLiverpool won 4:1 against Newcastle in the previous round but guess what - City steamed Newcastle 2 times inside couple of weeks in probably the only chance for the Newcastle to win the trophy this season (Carabao Cup).\n\nManchester City are still in the EPL title hunt, Arsenal is only 2 games away. (if City wins today)  \nGuardiola will be tremendously motivated for this match at Anfield to improve on his stats at this historic ground. Haaland is dry for ages now and you can count on him to perform today.\n\nRegarding form, aside from aforementioned results against Newcastle, City was in its way to win comfortably away at Tottenham and then a combination of very poor officiating and inexplicable circumstances resulted in a draw.\n\nI'm taking Manchester City to not lose today, 2X @ 1.729 odds is great opportunity.",

Coming into this event, Czechia were 3-2 against intermediate level teams like Italy, they are a better team than their place in the standings would indicate and this line is also partially an overreaction to that.

      "text": "Record: 5–2\n\nLast 10: 5-2\n\nLast pick: American @ Navy Under 134.5\n\nResult: LOSS ❌(155 points)\n\nThis was a rough loss. It missed for a clean (and instructive) reason — not pace, but efficiency. \n\nNavy shot lights-out (56% overall, 46% from three) and lived at the free-throw line, adding 29 attempts without needing extra possessions. \n\nAmerican also contributed enough offensively to keep the total afloat instead of collapsing. The game felt slow throughout, but when hot shooting and foul points show up together, an under can lose without anything “breaking.” This was a classic right-tail efficiency spike.\n\n⸻\n\nToday’s Pick\n\nCollege Basketball | NCAA Men’s\nUNC Greensboro @ Furman\nSaturday | 1:00 PM\n\nPick: Furman -12.5\n\nOdds: -115 (DraftKings)\n\nWrite-Up:\n\nThis is a spot where the spread tells a story, and it’s not as aggressive as the matchup might suggest at first glance. Furman already went on the road and won this matchup by 23, yet the number is sitting at -12.5 at home. \n\nThat usually signals that the book expects a calmer, more controlled game flow rather than a repeat blowout — slower tempo, fewer possessions, and less urgency from the underdog. When totals are lower and pace is suppressed, spreads naturally compress, even when one team is clearly better.\n\nThat said, Furman is the kind of favorite that can still cover in that environment. They don’t rely on transition runs or shooting flurries to separate. Their edge shows up possession by possession — cleaner execution, fewer empty trips, and the ability to keep scoring even when the game slows. UNCG doesn’t have the offensive profile to flip tempo or force Furman into uncomfortable shots, which makes it hard for them to hang around for 40 minutes.\n\nThe risk, as always with double-digit spreads, is game state. If Furman builds a lead and the game turns into a long, uneventful second half, you’re vulnerable to late stagnation. But unlike some favorites, Furman tends to keep playing through their offense rather than bleeding the clock excessively. If this game follows its most common path — controlled pace, steady execution, no chaos — Furman covering -12.5 is very much in play.\n\nBest of luck!\n\n⸻\n\nEDIT: If you find value in my analysis, contributions are appreciated: [https://cash.app/$KindlyQuantifying](https://cash.app/$KindlyQuantifying)",

Greater place to start, THE SUPERBOWL. While dumb money will be backing crazy prop multis, the length of the anthem and the colour of the Gatorade you intelligent bettor can do better. For me the POTD is 1st half UNDER. This was my pick two weeks ago and it hasn't changed. Both teams are defence minded especially in post season. We saw the high calibre defence Seahawks go first half under against the league highest scoring la rams. Neither team will want to make early mistakes or concessions. Not that it matters but I expect more points second half and I know some books have that market.\n\n\nIf you can get 1.90 for 22.5 or key number 21.5 - I'd take it but no lower than 21.5 first half under.

Ajax are one of the most attack-minded teams in the Eredivisie, averaging close to 2 goals scored per game, but defensively they’ve been far from reliable, conceding in the majority of their league matches this season. BTTS has landed in around 65–70% of Ajax games, especially against top-half opposition. AZ Alkmaar are strong offensively themselves, scoring in over 80% of their league matches, and rarely sit deep against Ajax, which usually creates an open, end-to-end game. With both sides preferring proactive football, goals at both ends look very likely.\n\nBayern Munich to Win vs Hoffenheim\nBayern to win is supported by clear quality and consistency edges. Bayern sit at or near the top of the Bundesliga, averaging 2.7+ goals per match, and have one of the strongest home records in Germany, winning the vast majority of league games at the Allianz Arena. Hoffenheim tend to struggle against elite sides, especially away, and have conceded 1.5+ goals per game this season. Bayern dropped points in the last two matches in the league so I don’t see any other result happening here today.\n\nBOL",

He’s currently on a tear, averaging 8.0 RPG over his last 10.\n\nEvidence 2: The Injury Glitch: Jayson Tatum is OUT (Achilles). Without Tatum, Jaylen’s rebounding volume increases to fill the wing void. More importantly, the Knicks' Karl-Anthony Towns and Josh Hart are Questionable—if they sit or are limited, the Knicks lose their top two glass-cleaners (Towns leads the NBA in RPG).\n\nEvidence 3: Jaylen is a home-court hunter. He’s averaging 8.5 rebounds at the TD Garden over the last two months.\n\nScenario Playbook\n\nScenario A (The Ideal): Knicks struggle with shooting efficiency due to a lack of KAT’s spacing. Long misses fly toward the wings where Jaylen tracks them down. He hits 7 boards by the 3rd quarter.\n\nScenario B (The Grind): Physical Atlantic Division battle. Lots of interior clanking. Jaylen out-muscles the smaller Knicks wings to secure high-traffic boards.\n\nScenario C (The Outside Influences): Knicks play \"small-ball\" to keep up with Boston's pace. Jaylen becomes the biggest athlete on the floor, feasting on the defensive glass.\n\nScenario D (The White Flag 🏳️) Boston blows them out early. Jaylen grabs 7 rebounds in 25 minutes of work before hitting the bench to rest for the Super Bowl.\n\nScenario E (Cold Night): Jaylen gets in early foul trouble or the ball simply bounces to the other side of the rim 10 times in a row.\n\nScenario Proof: Brown has recorded at least 7 rebounds in 14 consecutive games where he played at least 30 minutes. Even with minor hamstring/knee soreness, his \"floor\" has consistently stayed above this 6.5 line.",

I think the Seahawks have big edge in offensive production in this one as Sam Darnold has turned off the turnover problem he had in the regular season and he has been extremely efficient in the playoffs throwing for 350 yards, 3 touchdowns and no turnovers in his last game against the Rams. Kenneth Walker has been having an amazing postseason as well, in his two games he has tallied 4 rushing touchdowns and he has been effective catching ball as he is averaging 11 and a half yards per reception in the playoffs. And then you have JSN, this dude is gonna be a huge problem for the Patriots. 153 receiving yards and a touchdown in his last game against the Rams and the leagues offensive player of the year has been a headache to defenses all year long and I think he has another amazing game in this one. These Seahawks are also paired with an amazing defense as they finished the regular season with the number one scoring defense in the league allowing only 17 points per game and their rush defense finished 3rd in yards allowed per game so I think they will do a good job slowing down TreVeyon Henderson and Rhamondre Stevenson and forcing the Patriots into predictable passing situations. Lastly, the Seahawks have an edge in special teams as Myers is a more accurate kicker and Rasheed Shaheed is one of the most dynamic punt and kick returners in the league. With all of this in mind I dont see the Seahawks winning this game by less than a field goal.\n\nPrediction: 27-20 Seahawks\n\nLast pick:🏀SIU Edwardsville +13/Nevada +12💰SIUE with an outright win and Nevada with a close overtime game, love to see it!!\n\nBest of luck to everyone tailing and remember to bet responsibly!

He had 8 FGAs with 4 makes; 2 of the misses were tip-putbacks (don't know if that's the actual word). The thing is, there really isn't a need for him to hunt for shots. The Celtics offense was already second in offensive rating.  \nAt the time of this write-up, the Knicks have listed Miles McBride out and Anunoby, Hart, and Towns as questionable. Miles McBride is a pretty big piece of the team, so I think this is worth noting. The other three Knicks will probably play if I had to guess. Anunoby has a sore toe; Hart has a sore ankle; and Towns got that cut above his eye from the game against the Nuggets. Towns came back to finish the game and shot 0/3 from three after starting the game hot. This same injury made him miss a game against the Pistons which I feel like should be a must play game if a player is able. My guess would be that his eye is still be bothering him.  \nA 3.5 spread just doesn't feel right to me. If the Knicks were completely healthy, sure. But they aren't, and the Celtics just got a huge upgrade.",

EMBIID o7.5 1Q pts  (+230, HRB)\n\nRISK: 2 UNITS RESULT- WON\n\nRECAP: For once, this one went exactly as I had called it with Maxey dishing out a lot of dimes, but barely taking any shots & only making a couple of them to finish with his lowest point total in the first half (4pts) all year & never even reached 20 total points for the game. Meanwhile, his teammate Embiid through the doors off the first quarter total of over 7.5 points, finishing with 18 in the first quarter and over 30 for the game. Nice to see I get it right every once in awhile....\n\nTODAY'S POTD - 630PM (NFL SUPER BOWL) - SEA vs N.E. - G. Holani o1.5 rec eptions (-140, Hard Rock Bet) RISK/WAGER AMOUNT: 5u\n\nREASONING/PROJ. ANALYSIS:\n\nAs I writie this up, I can already hear some of y'all saying \"WHO\", some more of y'all saying \"WHAT\" & the remainder of y'all saying something far less \"PG-Rated\", but HEAR ME OUT as I truly believe it is one of the picks surest to cash out & likely even be doubled by the end of the game. So, let's get into why this is my favorite pick on the board. While Kenneth Walker III is Seattle's primary rushing back & a threat which N.E. has already admitted to primarily be targeting to stop, it was Zack Charbonnet who was the back that handled the majority of the check down, dump offs & designed screen passes throughout the season until his injury a few weeks back sidelined him for the rest of this year. The next man up was 3rd string running (and primarily a blocking) back George Holani. In Charbonnet's absence, Holani ( in his first real action) saw four targets last week & reeled in three of those for receptions totalling 27 yards. Now, Holani has had two additional weeks to practice & gel with the 1st team for the 1st time this year, and I can only imagine that this usage will continue if not increase, as it was not only quite the successful undertaking (vs the Rams), but it's also a scheme (& one which is using a player) which New England will find minimal footage on as their coaching staff studies every play Seattle has done throughout this year in preparation for the big game. Additionally, all of the extraneous factors work in favor of this being the case. For example, Holani that's primarily enter the game just to be an additional blocker for D'Arnold, and with N.E's blitz heavy defensive packages, Seattle should find ample opportunities for short passes to Holani after he breaks off his block of the extra New England defender & heads off toward the sideline totally uncovered. Furthermore, with D'Arnold having the arguably better team, on both offense and defense, it will be most critical not for him to necessarily win the game, but rather just to limit or abstain from making any of his mistakes such as turning the ball over by being intercepted or fumbling the ball just as he has done for the past three weeks, and it's now Holani, in for Charbonnet (& on at least 80% of the passing downs) who will now become the one who offers D'Arnold BOTH the surest hands & the safest short play option & by taking the reception tally  instead of the total receiving yards, we don't even have to worry about whether he makes any moves after the catch, but rather we can be near certain that there will be, at very least, three to six planned &/o runplanned  passes headed his way tomorrow, & with a 75% reception rate in his first ever real action as part of Seattle's offensive scheme, I would imagine the Seahawks & D'Arnold have plenty of confidence in Holani being able to fulfill that prophecy!!!!\n\nNOW LET'S GO CASH THIS SHYTE OUT!!!\n\nOTHER NOTABLE CONSIDERATIONS (Not part of my P.O.T.D., but just for your perusal...\n\n\\*\\*D. Maye Longest Rush o13.5 yds (-115) \\*\\*Seattle -2.5\n\nFavorite +$odds single bet longshots: \\*\\*D.Lawrence o0.5sacks (+110) \\*\\*B. Murphy II o0.5 sacks (+195)\n\n(For the past 3 wks, I've hit on plays identifying which defensive player get in on the Drake Maye sack-a-thon which has been in effect 47 times in the regular season & 15 more times in this post season (5x per game). Last time it was Zack Allen at +165 who got him 20 minutes into the game. This time, I take two; the hard charging  long-arned veteran Lawrence & the DT facing N.E.'s weakest link in their offensive line rookie back-uo Jared Wilson who is not only covering  Drake Mayes blind side, but well there's also let somebody through week after week). Murphy will be his assignment this week!!!. GOOD LUCK & BEST TO ANY/ALL THOSE WHO TAIL!!!\n\nNOW...Let's go cash this shyte out!!!!!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hn7bfu92p7ig1.jpeg?width=991&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0902b22ecea58396fadb308b2decc50456bda19",

They’ve looked like a team that knows exactly how they want to play the game. Strong early setups, clear mid-game plans, and decisive calls once they get a lead. Even when games get messy, they don’t panic, which is huge in a best-of setting.\n\nVitality, on the other hand, have struggled with consistency. They tend to give away too much early pressure and often rely on opponents making mistakes rather than forcing plays themselves. Against a team like Los Ratones, that’s a problem. Ratones are comfortable punishing overextensions and snowballing small advantages into wins.\n\nAnother key factor is drafting and game identity. Los Ratones usually draft comps that are straightforward to execute and fit their players well, while Vitality have shown some questionable drafts that leave them scaling without control. If Los Ratones get even a slight draft edge, they’re very good at converting that into tempo and objective control.\n\nOverall, this matchup favors the cleaner, more disciplined team and right now, that’s Los Ratones. If they play their standard game and don’t overcomplicate things, they should be in control for most of the series.",

Either Sam Darnold plays the way he’s been playing, in which he’ll absolutely deserve the MVP, or he’ll start seeing ghosts again, in which case the Seahawks won’t even win the game. The only way I see JSN winning MVP is if Darnold turns the ball over more than once and JSN accounts for a huge percentage of the receiving yards and touchdowns, but again, if that’s the case, I don’t see Seattle winning. Given Darnold just had his best game of his career on the biggest stage last game, I like the former.\n\nNow that we’ve established this, our bet essentially becomes Seahawks ML with better odds. I like for this to be a defensive battle, and given that the Patriots OLine has been shaky and Drake Maye quietly has not been good this postseason, Seahawks should come out on top. Even with a defensive battle, Darnold has too many weapons at his disposable and has been playing too well to lose, or win and not earn MVP.\n\nRemember to only bet what you can afford to lose, and BOL!",

League model putting this at 76% chance of hitting at +140 money, meaning it is incredible value/ROI play\n\n***Baus U 2.5 Kills Map 1 (-182)*** (Teams: Vitality vs. Los Ratones)\n\n* Baus is averaging 1.1 kills per map as top laner despite having a 50% winrate, 10th/10 top laners in the league. Baus is averaging a horrendous, -1037 XP at 15 min, and a -933 gold differential at 15 min, by far the worst metrics in the league, on top of this, teams will ban his sion every game, so he is left picking stuff he isn't nearly as comfortable on. So far this split he has a 1/10 hitrate in maps, with a 0/5 hitrate in losses averaging 0.8 kills per map loss. Vitality are -154 favorites and I think this is a bad matchup for the rats as much as I am rooting for them. I think this line is a near guarantee in map losses, and a <75% chance in map wins. Baus actually played a great lane today, got his gragas, arguably his second best champ outside of sion which he will never get,\n* For my money, **Naak Nako (Vitality top) has been the best top laner of the tournament** so far to my eye test. Naak Nako is averaging **the best GD/15, XP/15 and 3rd best CSD/15, all categories Baus is last it.** Also they should ban Sion + Gragas as Baus has looked significantly worse off of these two and has had two very strong gragas games and force him back on the things he struggles on. Naak Nako leads the LEC for top laners in solo kills with 6, this is a disaster matchup can't stress it enough\n* Lifetime Baus has a 1/27 hitrate in map losses, this is gonna be his hardest lane yet imo, I think today SK showed what NOT to do against Ratones, by picking a tank top laner and not punsihing Baus, expecting this to change tomorrow and Naak Nako and Vitality to play heavily thru top, if Ratones will win, it will be because of Nemesis/Crownie as most of their wins have been, think Vitality will stomp Ratones\n\n***Wunder U 4.5 Kills Map 1 (-182)*** (Teams: SK Gaming vs. Shifters)\n\n* The model didn't see the vision on this line at first until I fed it more data, this is why stats without context arent' always good. Wunder is leading all top laners in kills at 3.5 kills per map, and has had the second best laning stats in the LEC, despite this, a 4.5 kill line for any top laner is absolute insanity which I will break down a bit more below. As for Wunder though, his kill average is driven way up by two double digit kill games, with 10 kills on Kennen and 11 kills on Rumble. Despite this inflated line, Wunder is averaging just 3.5 kills per map this split, this is the highest, with only 3/12 top laners in the LEC averaging < 3 kills per map\n* Wunder took 2025 off, but for extra data, can go back to 2024, Wunder averaged 1.9 kills in 45 maps played, with a 40% winrate overall. During this time, Wunder had a 0/27 hitrate in map losses, and a 1/18 hitrate in map wins. Giving him a combined 1/45 hitrate in 2024, and a 0/7 hitrate in map losses this split and 2/3 hitrate in wins. Combined 3/55 hitrate last 2 years, and 0/34 in map losses\n* For top lane kill averages, in the 4 major regions for league, there are 44 top laners, only 1/44 top laners is averaging 4.5 kills (Kiin, with a 100% winrate), only 1 other is averaging 4 kills, 42/44 top laners are averaging <4 kills, 34/44 top laners are averaging kills, on top of this, a portion of top lane meta right now is tanks, if any tank is locked in, this line is a near guaranteed under off the bat, no matter win or loss. Ksante is a tank with a bit more kill threat, rumble is a kill threat, then Sion is third who is another tank meaning 2/3 of the most played top laners are tanks, in total so far in LEC, tanks have made up \\~42% of top laners picked this split so far\n* SK are eliminated from playoffs, Shifters are technically still in all tho the road is hard. I favor them in this matchup, think bot matchup in particular is very favorable",

Real Madrid really don't enjoy playing at the Mestalla, having **won just one out of their last three games** there. Not only that, but they're **missing so many key players** for today's matchup. **Vinicius, Rodrygo and Bellingham are all out.** Madrid keep playing very stiff, uncreative football, **needing a 100th minute penalty to bail them out against Rayo.** Valencia aren't exactly a powerhouse, but they have enough quality about them to shut out the guests today.\n\nValencia's LaLiga form is nothing to write home about, but they've seen an uptick in the recent results with **two wins in their last three outings.** I think everything points towards a draw here, but just in case Real Madrid pull off some weird 90th minute VAR assisted magic, I'm going with the +0.5, +1.0 AH. The odds are just too good to pass up on. BTTS Yes seems like a good option too as I just can't see Mbappe not finding the back of the net here.

For those eight games, they are averaging 154 rushing yards per game. Vrabel wants to control the clock. Stevenson and Maye have showed this playoff that they can be relied on to run, so why not take one of their player props? Henderson has the home run potential as he may be the fastest player on the field (hit over 22 mph on multiple runs this year). I can see the Seahawks stuffing the box against the Patriots. Henderson has been a non-factor in the playoffs, making him an intriguing play for the Super Bowl (especially if he gets good yards on his first few touches). Seahawks allow 92 yards a game against the run, which ranks very high in the league. I’m just betting that the game stays close enough that Vrabel calls a few extra run plays and they can get those 17 extra yards.",

Heroic is fielding a 16-year-old rookie, TaiLung, who looked fine against a lower-tier team, but today he has to lane against bzm, one of the best midlaners in the world. In a high-pressure elimination series, Tundra’s veteran squad is going to target the rookie, pressure him early, and force him to crumble.\n\nOn top of the skill gap, Tundra has a massive tactical advantage. While Heroic was scrapping for their lives against Rekonix and showing all their strategies, Tundra was resting and watching their games. They already beat Heroic comfortably in the Group Stage earlier this week, proving that Tundra's disciplined, suffocating playstyle is the perfect counter to Heroic's chaotic brawling.\n\nWe are backing the more disciplined team to handle business again.

Silkeborg coach Kent Nielsen has openly highlighted the team’s many “offensive essences” in his pre-match press build-up, naming several attacking profiles and making it clear that Silkeborg intend to play proactively at home despite their defensive issues this season. With Silkeborg needing points to stay clear of the relegation battle, a passive setup is unlikely. From Viborg’s side, motivation is just as strong: they sit only two points from the Top 6 and face a brutal upcoming schedule, making this a game where they must push for a win. Tactically, the matchup favors Viborg scoring multiple times. Silkeborg’s possession-based 4-3-3/4-2-3-1 under Nielsen involves high full-backs and aggressive positioning between the lines, a structure that has repeatedly left space in transition. Viborg are well suited to exploit this, sitting compact before attacking vertically through quick combinations and wide overloads into the channels behind Silkeborg’s advanced defenders. With Silkeborg unlikely to abandon their proactive style and Viborg confident after a strong winter and positive test matches, the tactical and motivational setup strongly supports Viborg scoring two or more goals, making Over 1.50 goals a compelling angle.\n\n",

Bublik got an easy 6-0, 6-3 win to start, and later in the day Gojo finished things off after moving from -364 to -453 pre-match. \n\nToday, I'm fading the 18-year-old local talent Mees Rottgering in a situation where I see him being overmatched. Rottgering did really well to get past Kyrian Jacquet after being bageled in the first set, but his performance rating came in at just 6.31/10. Roberto Carballes Baena may not be a natural hard-court player, but he does have experience in all conditions, and he already scored a nice win over Pablo Carreño Busta with a 7.16/10. Another factor to consider is that Jacquet was a much bigger favorite than RCB is here, even though I don't see a huge level gap between them. Even if Rottgering has a strong serve and overall game for his age, he still doesn't feel fully developed as a player, and I don't think that's going to cut it against someone like RCB. These courts are indoors, but they don't play lightning-fast, and that works to the benefit of the more consistent Spaniard.",

So there is no push/void here. The second point is the odds being really weird here. Feyenoord have a huge motivation to win this game, sure it’s an away game. They are aiming for second place on the table, which gives direct Champions League placement. Utrecht on the other hand, seems to sit safe from relegation so far. The thing is that Feyenoord won the last two away games vs Utrecht and this handicap hit. Another weird thing here is the fact that the odds are so high for Feyenoord just to win at 2,17 (time of writing). That’s just ridiculous in my opinion. Either they know something which we don’t or they completely misplaced the odds. I’m thinking the latter and I’ll gladly take those 4,2 odds with a handicap on. \n\n\n\nNot much to say besides Feyenoord being the stronger team here and having the potential to completely outplay their opponents in this league. The exceptions are of course PSV and Ajax, who usually finish on the top every year. Handicap results here are quite common just like in the Portuguese league, where a gap between the top and the rest seems to remain.\n\n\n\nI’m trying to keep track of the results in all the top leagues. I had way too many games to pick from Sunday, and honestly almost got a headache from trying to choose one. My goal is to have something around the 3x odds barrier or higher.

[First Ken Walker Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/comments/1qm1kn8/comment/o1k3bmf/?context=3&utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\nHere are a few more:\n\n* Patriots defense regularly gives up yards to running backs in the flat because they have successfully contained them limiting yards after the catch.\n* Since week 16, Seahawks’ running backs averaging 54 receiving yards per game.\n* The Seahawks rank #2 in running back target teams in the NFL ahead of the Detroit Lions and just behind the Atlanta Falcons.\n* Sam Darnold has been targeting his RB’s on early downs to pick up short yardage, and allow more discretion on 2^(nd) and 3^(rd) downs to target downfield receivers. This may hold especially true with the Patriot’s defensive that will most definitely be pressuring Darnold all day.\n\n**Edit:**  Lowered the odds since most folks cant get this prop anymore.\n\n**Comment:**  So just for clarity, I have been getting asked to post all my SB bets which I will not do.  My advice has been take the player prop Overs that you like, and then everything else is an Under.  This is the SB.  Not everyone can have a great game.  Last year, the game went way over on points with 61, yet most player props went Under, starting with Saquon.  This is the case in most SB's and  this one should be no exception.",

He has really hit his stride since joining City and has had great link up play with Haaland. I'm again buying down the juice of just ATGS, even though I think that to be the most likely cash, because I think he may wind up in a position to provide an assist to Haaland. Semenyo also scored 2 goals at Anfield earlier in the season while he was still with Bournemouth, so he knows how to beat this Liverpool defense on the road. \n\nBOL and happy Sunday!",

To start of I really like Vanderbilt (8-2) at home in this one over Kentucky (5-5) as Vanderbilt has not dropped a game at home so far this year and they are coming off a weeks rest coming off the bye week. Vanderbilts two losses this year have came against ranked teams on the road in Alabama and Texas. This Vanderbilt offense ranks 9th in the nation in scoring averaging over 38 points per game with a balanced rushing and passing attack. Kentucky has struggled on the road this year with only one road win and they have failed to score over 14 points on the road this year. Kentucky also does not play well against good competition as they are 0-4 against ranked opponents and 0-5 against power 5 opponents at .500 or better. I think this Vandy defense matches up well against this Kentucky offense as the Wildcats lean into their run game and the Vandy defense is a good rush defense ranking 24th out of 136 so I think they will be able to minimize yards on first down runs and force the Wildcats into predictable passing situations. I also like Texas (7-3) over Arkansas (2-8) as I think the Longhorns bounce back at home after a tough road loss against Georgia. Texas also has not lost on their home field this year and this Arkansas team they face off against has not won a road game or have beaten a single power 5 opponent this year. Arkansas has the worst defense in the SEC this year ranking in the 100s in passing yards allowed, rush yards allowed and points allowed so I dont think the Longhorns will have a problem moving the ball in this one. But on the flip side this Texas defense is a very good one as they excel in stopping the run as they are 6th in the nation in rushing defense only allowing 80 rush yards per game and 18 points per game. Arkansas has also struggled in the pass game recently failing to record 200 passing yards in their past 2 games and throwing for 5 interceptions in the past 3 games. With all of this being said I think Vandy and Texas both cruise to home wins this Saturday afternoon.\n\nPrediction: 34-27 Vandy, 30-23 Texas\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vge8wy1olq2g1.jpeg?width=1099&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=96cc4e5de7a81bd0a2f2fc1053fadeb1d1ac7d3f",

Today, I am tipping Wanderers to break their slump and get their first win of the season. Having lost a bunch of attacking threat over the offseason, they have been slow to get going with only two goals scored, but have been reasonably solid at the back despite conceding in each game. They are broadly conceding to low quality chances and not conceding many good ones, and the Mariners have struggled to create much of note most weeks - scoring only against Newcastle (worst defence in the league), Perth (second worst defence in the league, and Wellington (equal fourth worst). I think they will struggle to break Wanderers down here, while the hosts will at least grab one or two. Not gonna be a thrashing, but think it will be comfortable for Wanderers.",

Denmark takes on Poland and my power rankings have Denmark quite a bit higher. Denmark leads the career head-to-head 2-1, including a 8-5 win last year at this event. Schmidt likes to be aggressive without hammer and Stych gives up steals at a higher rate so I expect Denmark to get a couple steals in this one.",

His opponent, despite his Russian sounding name, is actually born and raised in Austria. Naurdiev is weak off his back and prone to being controlled. He has given up takedowns in all of his UFC losses and here he is coming up against an elite grappler in Loder, a former NCAA Div 1 All-American. Loder is always at risk of getting clipped on the feet but he's an intelligent fighter I expect him to work his takedowns asap and control Naurdiev on the mat. Give me Loder to win, probably through a control-based decision or an opportunistic sub if Naurdiev makes a mistake on the mat.",

Recife went 1-0 up early which set up a big shock and went 1-0 up in corners before a first red card was shown to the underdogs. Obviously at that point Flamengo piled pressure and equalised but nevertheless the count was 3-0 which 90% of the time would lead to the play winning. But ANOTHER red card was handed to Recife which made it mission impossible for this play to win despite them leading corners 4-3 at the half. I can’t explain how rare (and suspicious) a double red is in a first half and no surprises that Flamengo then took control of the game, winning 5-1 and 15 to 4 corners with 90% 2H possession. Can’t fault the maths despite the losing streak but I’ll make sure to avoid leagues with severe accusations of corruption which is my bad for tipping.\n\nI’ve been very impressed by Brentford this season - whom I’d expected to be in a relegation battle before the season started. They finished 10th last year but having sold their best players in Mbeumo, Wissa, Nørgaard, losing manager Tom Frank and not really replacing them I, just like many, was expecting a huge fall-off. I’ve got to commend set-piece coach Keith Andrews for his work at the Bees who may be 12th but have picked up some huge wins against Newcastle, Liverpool, United, Villa amongst other great results. Brighton have similarly had some really solid results currently sitting a spot above Brentford with wins over Newcastle, Chelsea and City. Hürzeler has done a really good job with the Seagulls since taking over last season, playing some nice direct football and I do expect them to be fighting for the European spots this season.\n\nBrighton has averaged 3.9 corners won and 4.6 conceded over their last 20 at the Amex whilst Brentford has won 4.9 and conceded 6.2 on the road in the same time period. Also using more recent stats to reflect the current forms of the teams I get an expected 4.6 corners for the Seagulls and 4.9 for the Bees. That gives this play a 72% chance of winning. I must warn though that this play lost by a corner in last year’s fixture but am not fussed about it considering it was 11 months ago. Brentford have covered the line in 12/15 away (+ L5) and Brighton’s opponents in 12/15 at home (+ L7) so I love this spot. BOL !\n\nI’m raising money for Movember, ALL proceeds will be going to a good cause. Donations aren’t expected but very much appreciated so if you have profited from my picks please do consider donating, a little goes a long way.

Last 11 games of Newcastle had over 1.5 goals while last 22 of 24 games there's been over 1.5 goals in City matches. With City's quality and Erling Haaland leading the line, they should score at least once or twice, and even if they don't win comfortably, a 1-1 draw or 2-1 win both cover this bet perfectly, making it a safer option than just backing City to win outright.\n\nIf you found these picks helpful, tips or donations are greatly appreciated as they support the time and effort I put into creating them: [buy me a beer🍻](https://buymeacoffee.com/hercules.son.of.zeus)",

This is a great spot for the Hawkeyes playing their final home game of the season at Kinnick in what will turn into a night game on senior night. \n\nIowa is 8-1 this season ATTS against Division 1 opponents. They keep games extremely tight against top level competition, and blow the doors off of lesser opponents. This is the first time all season that they’ve been favored by double digits against a P4 opponent, and with an average win margin of 28 against non ranked opponents, this game will follow the same story against Michigan State.\n\nIowa has finally unlocked a bit of a passing game from Mark Gronowski, and their OC Tim Lester does an extremely good job horizontally attacking the field. This team has gotten better and better in every facet week by week. \n\nThe only way to beat Iowa is to be truly elite. USC has Lemon and Lane, and were just chucking up 50/50 balls to them, in which they went 8/10. Both receivers are likely to be first round picks in this years NFL draft, and they used them to barely squeak out a win against Iowa. Oregon used their #1 nationally rushing offense and elite heisman caliber QB to squeak out of Iowa City with a win. Indiana used their Heisman front runner QB to barely squeak out of Iowa City with a win. Iowa State threw the ball to their 6’8 tight ends and got a few really good bounces to win in a rivalry game.\n\nRutgers lost by 10 points to Iowa but was able to keep the game competitive by throwing to their elite WR’s who will be 1st or 2nd round draft picks.\n\nIn games where teams don’t truly have a nationally elite threat, Iowa steps on their neck like they did against Minnesota, winning 41-3, against Wisconsin winning 37-0. \n\nMichigan State’s offense ranks 65th in the country per PFF, and their defense ranks 115th in the country. Michigan State is They’re banged up at the QB position, potentially having to turn to their third string freshman QB if Chiles or Milijovic aren’t ready to go. The last place I want to be when making my first collegiate start is Iowa City in November against a Phil Parker defense. Michigan State is 0-7 in conference play, having gotten spanked by every team in the Big 10 by a minimum of 10 points, with the exception being Minnesota, where they only lost by 3.\n\nMichigan State has one of the most abysmal O-lines in the country, ranking 121st at pass blocking. Iowa has one of the best pass rushes in the country, ranking 9th. If Iowa can get them behind the sticks with a sack, there’s very little chance of Michigan State getting anything going to advance the drive.\n\nIowa has gone through a gauntlet of top ranked opponents in the past 3 weeks, and will look to enforce their will against a dog shit Michigan State team on senior night. This is one of the only times I’ve felt Iowa will come into a game explicitly looking to run up the score and excite the fans. Good luck!",

McGinn had two great chances, one shot bent literally inches over and outside the post and the 2nd was a rocket into the crowd that took an unlucky block by a defender. At least it was a super fun game to watch as expected. We move on. \n\nPremier League is back after the international break, and we've got a great slate this weekend! Today we're naturally back in England as 17th place Burnley hosts 3rd place Chelsea in the early early window. And we are running back our very first POTD and backing Enzo Fernandez for 1+ shot on target. Chelsea will want and expect a decisive win here to collect all 3 points and continue their promising start to the season, whereas Burnley are fighting to stay above the relegation zone. \n\nI was honestly shocked to see this line so high. Enzo has hit at least one SOT in his last 5/5 EPL matches and now 7 of 8 in all comps since Palmer has been out. Palmer is training again, but still out for this match per coach. Enzo did pick up an injury before the international break, but is fully recovered and available according to coach Maresca. There is a non-zero chance he does not start, but I still like thisnif he comes on as a sub. **You may want to wait for lineups an hour before gametime if you are worried about this.** I'll be asleep until kickoff, so I'm taking it now. \n\nThe same data still applies from my last post - Enzo is the team captain, the likely penalty taker, and loves to shoot (free kicks, outside the box, headers in the box, etc). Burnley hold more possession than you'd expect a bottom 5 team to, but they also give up a lot of shots - 15 (7 SOT) to Wolves, 12 (8) to Arsenal, and 15 (6) to West Ham over their last 3. \n\nWe cashed this at -110 a few weeks ago, hoping we can run it back for even money. BOL and have a great weekend!",

They completely shut down the Bills offense and allowed only 3 points in the second half. This one came down to the wire and I loved watching this game!\n\nToday's POTD 11/22/25: Total match points U42.5 (-105 Bet365)\n\nEvent: Missouri @ Oklahoma 10:00MST\n\nWrite up: This week Missouri will be visiting Oklahoma in what I predict to be a close and low scoring affair between a lackluster Sooners offense and a run first Tiger's team. Missouri has been living and dying on the run this year and ranks top 15 in every major rushing category this season. However, they will be going up against a very tough and stingy Oklahoma rush defense. The Sooners defense has allowed only 82 yards per game and a very strict 2.5 yards per carry this season and I believe they will prove to be a very difficult obstacle for Missouri's fairly one dimensional offensive attack. Although Missouri has done very well vs. the under, out of their two away games this year, they both have hit the under. There's not much to be said about the Sooners on the other side of the ball. The offense has been a very lackluster part of the team and Mateer hasn't been playing well since his injuring his hand against Auburn earlier this season. Not to mention, Missouri's defense hasn't been great by any stretch of the word but they have been very competent against the run and pass and they tackle incredibly well with a 90% tackle success rate that's good enough to be ranked 4th in the nation. I don't trust Oklahoma to be able to keep the scoring consistent as they have hit the under in 4 of their last 5 games and I don't forsee much of a turn around moving into this game.\n\nTail or fade BOL to everyone and cheers! 🍻",

All bet worthy but pick of the bunch is New Zealand -28.5 v Wales.\n\nNow worth noting New Zealand have rotated after defeat to England last week but their side still possesses quality wales can only dream of. That added to the fact wales have lost 2/3 of their best players , it isn’t looking good.\n\nThis line is fairly aggressive but it could get silly in Cardiff. Wales did scrape past Japan last week by 2 points , but that ended a 10 match home defeat record and was only their 2nd win in 20 games - the other of which also coming vs Japan.\n\nNew Zealand will want to round of their tour of the northern hemisphere in the only way they know how and that is in style. \n\nI won’t be suprised to see them put 50+ points on the board and crushing this developing Welsh side.\n\nLet’s hope I’m right as 3 units.\n\nBOL to those tailing — see you on the other side 🫡🫡🫡",

Here’s my next pick: Utah Mammoth Money Line -1.55 ; I’m once again looking at the Utah Mammoth as they are coming off their win the other night, bringing them to a 3 game win streak (undefeated in 2026!!) and are 4th in a stacked Central division. Columbus are playing a back to back, which they were defeated 0-4 by the Avalanche and are still last in the Metro division now having lost their last 4 games. Back to backs are always challenging for any team but Columbus has particularly been bad with this in the past and Utah will be looking to take advantage of that as they are now in the second wild card spot which they will look to keep by beating a team that is on the decline. Best of luck to those tailing!",

GWEN’S GIRL $2.15             \n**Write Up:** Apologies for this tip going up so close to jump, I’m really hungover this morning so only recently woke up ahahah.    \n    \nAnyways onto our pick for today, GWEN’S GIRL has begun its preparation this time in with back to back 2nd’s. The most recent run is the one I want to focus in on as it was ultra impressive and the form out of the race makes this an auto bet. The winner of that race has run again and won a high class Saturday race worth $150k, beating a few spruiked horses in the process.    \n    \nIn our race against said horse we were quickly away, however the jockey elected not to cross and we sat outside the leader; coming around the home turn we swung really awkwardly due to the tight track and ended up near the middle of the track, costing us the race. Today we get a bigger track, and a key jockey change with a great front running jock booked. I expect us to go straight to the front and attempt to keep running the whole way.    \n    \nNow we do have a threat in the favourite, MEET ME HALFWAY, who will be having its second start here. I expect it gets a perfect run on our back, but I’m hoping we can slip away around the turn and hold on. It is worth nothing that a horse beat it last start who had run 22 times before without winning, and who has subsequently run twice and finished 9th and 10th, so I’m not liking the form. GL",

By effectively neutralizing the Bills' ground game, Jacksonville can force the game into the hands of Josh Allen, who has historically struggled in this environment.\n\nFurthermore, the situational and health advantages lean heavily toward the home team. History is not on Buffalo's side in this scenario, as the Bills have lost eight consecutive road playoff games dating back to 1992, and head coach Sean McDermott remains winless (0-5) on the road in the postseason. This includes a previous wild-card loss in Jacksonville. While Josh Allen is dealing with a sore foot, the Bills' roster is significantly more depleted, with key defensive starters like linebacker Terrel Bernard and cornerback Maxwell Hairston already ruled out. With Jacksonville boasting a 7-2 home record and a healthy roster peaking at the right time, taking them as a slight underdog or on the moneyline offers excellent value against a Buffalo team that has struggled with consistency and health away from home.\n\nBOL if tailing, feel free to send a little love my way <3\n\nPaypal Link for  tips: \n\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/15WqXqliqJLfcYklFr8qcXC6RpYqnIdY91mB6jFzNGhs/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15WqXqliqJLfcYklFr8qcXC6RpYqnIdY91mB6jFzNGhs/edit?usp=sharing)",

Such is life. Well, back to it then.\n\n**Write Up:** This is more of a gut pick than anything else, and there are plenty of reasons not to like it, not the least of which is that *Vegas has won their last 10 matchups against San Jose*, the 2nd longest active winning streak vs. a franchise (the longest is Nashville, also vs. the Sharks), so by all means fade me, but I have this feeling that's about to change. Check it out.\n\n1. Both teams will be on back-to-backs, with the Sharks pulling out a 5-4 OT win after erasing 2 2-goal deficits and tying the game in the 3rd with 5 minutes remaining, a big morale boost for sure. Vegas will be coming off an as-of-yet unknown result because their game doesn't start for another hour..see where I'm going here? \n\n2. Sharks are at home for both, where they're 13-8-3, and they'll be sleeping in their own beds, whereas Vegas playing away, where they're 10-5-6, and will be traveling from home after a game that wraps less than 20 hours before this game starts...see where I'm going here???\n\n3. Vegas won their last 2 (or 3, depending on tonight), but prior to that they lost 8 of 9. SJ are on a 3-game win streak and won 6 of their last 7. So they're trending in different directions.\n\n4. SJ started Nedeljkovic (7-8-2) today, meaning Askarov (16-10-1) starts tomorrow. They're also likely getting 1st-unit PP and top-4 D-man John Klingberg back tomorrow. Vegas, however, is in a bad way, goalie-wise. Newest Golden Knight and presumed r\\*pist Carter Hart is week-to-week, and Adin Hill, last year's primary starter, is going to be reevaluated Tuesday. They start Schmid (12-4-5) tonight, meaning they probably start 4th-string Lindblom (1-4-2) tomorrow, unless they go back to Schmid who will therefore be playing 2 games in less than 24-hours. Not great.\n\n5. So far this season, SJ has had the 5th-hardest schedule vs. Vegas who've had the 6th-easiest. \n\nAs I said, there are still plenty of reasons not to like this pick: Vegas leads the division, has better overall stats and, as I said, has had SJ's number for a while, but there's a reason there is only 1 longer active streak between teams, and I'm calling it now, this one is breaking tomorrow!\n\n**Prop Bonus:** I mean, Macklin Celebrini? Kind of a no-doubter there. He cashed us today on 4-SOG (thanks lordestros!) and is on a 13-game, 27-point streak (9G 18A), over 2PPG in that span. On the other side, Mark Stone has points in his last 6 (6G 2A) \n\n**BoL and play responsibly. Comment if you tail or fade if that's your thing, or don't, I'm not your mom.**",

Wow.\n\nToday’s POTD: 🏈 Jaguars ML (-115) \n\nGame starts at 1pm EST. Bet 2u\n\nWriteup: This is gonna be a fun one. The Buffalo Bills are taking on the Jacksonville Jaguars for the first game tomorrow. I would not be surprised if the winner of this game goes to the Super Bowl, but I’m giving the edge to the Jags in this one.\n\nThe Jags have won 8 straight games and have the highest point differential over those games. They are arguably the hottest team in football right now. They were originally underdogs in this one, but the line has shifted to favor the Jags. Quarterback Trevor Lawrence is looking like his former Clemson self and is playing the best professional ball of his career. He also has a supporting cast around him that has been far better than anyone could have guessed, especially considering both Brian Thomas Jr and Travis Hunter did not pan out like they thought they would. If that wasn’t enough, on defense, the Jags sport the best rush defense in the league. \n\nThe Jags will be facing a Bills team that, quite frankly, looks the worst they have entering the playoffs in 5 years. Quarterback Josh Allen is absolutely elite, and running back James Cook is having another fantastic year, but the rest of the team is not where they need to be to make a run in the postseason. Allen has not had a high-tier receiving option all season, but he has been able to make do. The biggest problem is the Bills defense. Their run defense hasn’t been able to stop anyone all season, and Jags running back Travis Etienne should have no issues getting yards on the ground and in the air. \n\nThere’s also the question of Josh Allen’s health. He has been dealing with a foot injury and has gotten X-rays 2 different times over the last few weeks. He’ll play and look like himself, but just something to keep in mind.\n\nThe best part, and quite frankly the only real effective part, of the Bills offense is the run game. Unfortunately for them, the Jags have stopped every single running back this season from having over 75 rushing yards. On the other side, the Jags offense should be able to gouge the Bills rush defense for good yardage, thus opening up passing lanes later. I’ll take the Bills QB and RB over the Jags, but the rest of the Bills team is so much weaker that it takes away from how good they are. Give me the hotter of the two teams to come out with the win.\n\nRemember to only bet what you can afford to lose, and BOL!",

Had they looked a little better and lost, this would’ve been closer to 3. I expect Mike Shanahan to have a good game plan and be able to put some points up. Before last week, they had put up 37, 48, and 42 points after their week 14 bye. \n\nThe Eagles offense is still a hot and cold one. The inconsistency they’ve had throughout the season makes me nervous for them, especially as 6 point favorites in a playoff game. Their team total of 25 points feels high to me, even going up against a pretty banged up 49ers defense.\n\nGood Luck!",

They were able to rest their starters early, so they’re coming into this final way fresher. Madrid looked heavy in their semi-final, and I think that fatigue catches up to them today.

Wrong half. Sacred Heart sailed past 32 points and made me look like the idiot that I am. Then, they got entirely shut down in the second stanza, scoring just 28 points en route to a loss. Meanwhile, my two losses are both NCAA first-half unders, so let's try to lose a different way today. Back to the NBA for a player prop.*  \n  \nThe Orlando Magic are hurting, and Anthony Black has been asked to step up. Boy, has he. Over his last 10 games, he's averaging 20.3 points on 15.7 field goal attempts. He's been efficient, making 49% from deep and 46% overall, despite the increased usage. Meanwhile, New Orleans is giving up 24.3 points to the primary ball handler, which puts them in 23rd in the Association. Black's 6-foot-7 frame is going to be a problem for New Orleans. The Pelicans are already without their best stopper (Herb Jones), an important perimeter defender (Jose Alvarado), and has Saddiq Bey listed as a game-time-decision. Guards Jordan Poole (6-foot-4) and and Jeremiah Fears (6-foot-3) are not known for their lockdown defenses, and that's putting it lightly. I like Black's chances to go inside and get fouled or shoot over either of them. New Orleans' Top 10 pace should afford Black and the Magic extra possessions. Oh, and in the last month of play, opposing guards have gone over assists in 70 percent of their games. It's enough to consider sprinkling a little on assists or PA combo. But it tells me that point guards are having their way on the attack. As an aside, this feels like a must-win game for the Magic who are in an absolute battle with the Miami Heat for control of the Southeast Division. The Magic are 2-3 over the last five games, but 12-6 at home. Look to Black to help them get to 13-6. He'll get minutes, even with Moe Wagner returning (but on a likely minutes restriction). \n\nGood luck and Godspeed!",

New Jags head coach Liam Cohen turned this franchise around. Since their Week 8 bye, the Jags are 9-1, winning 8 straight games with a league leading +153 point differential over that span. The next closest team over that run is at +97. Jacksonville has scored 2.83 points per drive over that streak, 4th in the NFL. The key to their success has been phenomenal play by QB Trevor Lawrence. TLaw had his third 4,000 yard passing season in the past 4 seasons, setting career highs for passing TD’s (29), rushing yards (359), & rushing TD’s (nine). TLaw has thrown for 10+ yards on 31.4% of his passing plays since Week 9 (3rd). He’ll now face a Playoff experienced Bills team that made the playoffs 7 straight seasons in a row. The Bills have been the best team in the league at running the football this season. RB James Cook led the league in rushing yards this season averaging 95.4 yards per game & ranked 1st in expected points added (EPA) per rush (0.08). The Buffalo Bills had the most rush attempts this season & ranked 28th in pass rate compared to expectations (-3%). The problem with that strategy in this game is, the Jags have the best run defense in the league. The Jags allowed the fewest rushing yards per game (85.6), ranked 5th in yards per carry allowed (3.94), & 2nd in explosive run rate (2.7%) allowed. They haven’t allowed a RB to run for 75+ yards this season & faced some elite talent in CMC, Jonathon Taylor twice, etc. Opponents passed on the Jags at the 2nd highest rate over expectations (+4.4%). The good news for the Bills is, QB Josh Allen has once again been one of the best QB’s in the league this season.\n\nJosh Allen had another stellar year, setting career highs in completion rate (69.3%, 4th in NFL) & yards per pass attempt (8.0, 5th in NFL). He led Buffalo to have a 46.7% success rate on passing plays, 7th in the NFL. Since the start of 2024, the Bills have the highest EPA per dropback. Against a pass funnel defense that allows the fewest rushes in the league, the Bills are going to let Allen air it out. A huge part of Allen’s efficiency through the air this season has been Tight End Dalton Kincaid. Kincaid ranked #1 out of ALL pass catchers in the league in EPA/target. His 79.6% catch rate was the 4th highest in the league. He wasone of just 4 TE’s with multiple 100+ yard receiving games this season. Among the 29 tight ends with at least 49 targets in 2025, Dalton Kincaid ranked #1 in yards per catch (14.6), average depth of target (9.5 yards), yards per route run (2.79), yards after the catch per reception (6.7), & passer rating when targeted (149.2). He did all of that while playing injured & missing 5 games. Kincaid set a career high in TD passes (5) & receiving yards per game (47.6). The Bills’ offensive success this season has been directory correlated to having Kincaid on the field and producing. The Bills 2025 splits with/without Kincaid:\n\n__Points per game:__\n\nWith:  32\n\nWithout:  21\n\n__Josh Allen TD/INT ratio:__\n\nWith (on field):  19 TD’s - 3 INT’s\n\nWithout: 7 TD’s - 6 INT’s\n\n__Allen’s passer rating:__\n\nWith (on field): 111.77\n\nWithout: 81.9\n\n__Record:__\n\nWith:  9-2\n\nWithout:  2-3\n\nThe Bills coaches understand Kincaid’s importance & reduced his playing time down the stretch this season, to keep him healthy for the playoffs. In his first five games of the season, Kincaid averaged 49.1% of the team’s offensive snaps and the Bills record was 4-1. In those games, he averaged 57.4 yards per game on four receptions with a catch percentage of 83.3%. When Kincaid returned from injury in Week 14, his playing time was decreased to just 30.3% of the team’s offensive snaps with only 2.5 receptions per game & 30.8 receiving yards. Kincaid sat out Week 17, then last week he only played 10 snaps, he still managed to catch 3 passes for 48 yards. Head coach Sean McDermott said after wards: I thought it was important that we got him going a little bit. Not too much to where he was too sore to come back and practice,” McDermott said. “So just some momentum, some wind at his back here.” It was clear they were getting him ready for the playoffs & he’ll have the freshest legs of anyone on the field in this game. Over the prior 2 seasons, Kincaid regularly saw 60-70% snap shares & route shares north of 80%. This season when Kincaid has played +50% of snaps he has had at least 48 yards every game, averaging 5 catches for 74 yards, including a 100 yard game. Now he faces a Jags defense that to Tight Ends this season have allowed the 2nd most targets per game (8.7), 6th most catches (6.1 per game), 61 receiving yards per game (9th most), & 8 TD’s (9th most). Jacksonville deploys zone coverage on 78.6% of their defensive snaps, 5th most in the league. Only running man coverage on just 17.6% of snaps. Kincaid has been the Bills zone buster all season, ranking 2nd best among all pass catches in yards per route run vs. zones (3.91). Josh Allen has targeted Kincaid on a team high 30% of his routes vs. zone coverage. His 93.33% catch rate vs zone is the highest in the league amongst pass catchers with 100+ routes ran vs zone. He’s has 410 receiving yards vs zone compared to Dawson Knox’s 341 yards, & he has ran 70 less routes vs Zone coverage. As for the Jags pass defense they have good metrics, but they also faced the 2nd easiest slate of passing opponents this season. Their defensive line has been below average with a 36.2% pressure rate (19th) & at the bottom of the league with a 4.8% sack rate (30th). The Bills also have had to play from behind a ton this season. In the 1st half of games, the Bills had a -11 point differential compared to a +127 in the 2nd half. They trailed by 10+ points at halftime 5 times this year. The other 6 AFC playoff teams trailed by 10+ points 5 times at half combined. Meanwhile the Jags ranked 4th in 1st half points scored & 3rd in 1st half point differential. Additionally, the Jags revved up the pass towards the end of the season. Since Week 14, they ranked 1st in pass rate over expected (+8.6%). The Jags veraged 27.9 points per game (6th) & scored on 51% of their possessions since Week 9 (2nd). This should force Allen to have to air it out, you could make the argument that Kincaid is the best receiver that Josh Allen. It helps that Bills WR Joshua Palmer has been ruled out as well.\n\nI wouldn’t be surprised if this hits in the 1st half.\n\n__Dalton Kincaid o40.5 receiving yards__\n\nAppreciate the love!

They shoot a lot but are struggling to put it in the net. Their goalies can't buy a save and the Devils are on the freefall ever since the Quinn Hughes trade rumors spread which a lot of veterans didn't like hearing about especially with them being used as the trade pieces. They even announced today that Dougie Hamilton (top 2 defenseman on their team) is now healthy scratched to be traded so the vibes are really not good right now. They are on a 3 game losing streak and things are not going better on the road having lost 4 out of their last 5 away games. They also struggle against the Jets having lost their last 2 games against them (6-1 and 4-0).\n\nJets aren't doing so great but they won their last game so they come with some momentum. What makes me confident with the Jets ML though is that in their last 10 games at home they have scored 3 goals or more 8 times which should be useful against a Devils team that struggles to score even 2 goals right now. Expecting Connor Hellebuyck to be starting for the Jets as he has an 8-1-1 record with a goals against average of 1.89 and a save percentage of .942 in his last 10 games versus the Devils.\n\nBOL!",

They do say a broken clock is still right twice a day though, and that was perhaps the second right guess? Who knows, but I for sure am aiming for three in a row. I really like the look of today's pick so let's skip the waffle and get right into one of the most exciting matchups in club football*\n\n**Last Five:**  ❌❌❌✅✅\n\n**Event:** Spanish Super Cup, FC Barcelona v Real Madrid, 2:00 pm EST\n\n**POTD:** Real Madrid 0.0 +0.5 Asian Handicap, +108, 3 units\n\n**Write Up:** Yeah, maybe I still haven't learned my lesson, but I do think it's all going to come crashing down for Barcelona today. Real Madrid are going to want to prove a point after being embarrassed in last season's Clasicos and they're for sure coming out swinging. They already beat Barcelona 2-1 earlier in the season and I felt the scoreline even flattered Barcelona a bit. Madrid's attack is going to run riot - I think Barca's ridiculous high line just isn't prepared to deal with something as fast and technical, and Joan Garcia can't keep bailing them out. They'll be 2 goals down before they know it.\n\nSecuring a small profit even in case of a draw at these odds is just value I can't overlook. The confidence is high after back to back wins and I think now's a great moment to fade Barcelona again so I'm going in with 3 units. If you want to take the BTTS Yes and Over 3.5 goals angle, I don't mind those either.

      "text": "Record:4-3\n\nLast pick: Suns -4.5 over Grizzlies, easy win\n\nEvent: Bills @ Jags\n\nPick: Dawson Knox over 20.5 receiving yards \n\nWrite Up: This one is pretty simple. Firstly, Knox has hit this over in 8 out of the last 10. Second, the Jags don't have a good pass defense, so I expect the Bills to be slinging it. Thirdly the Jags have the best run defense in the league, so once again, I expect the Bills to throw more than their average. \n\n\n\n\nVegas expects over 50 points in this game, and that means a lot of yards. Knox had a slow start to the season, so his season average is low, which is why I think this line is lower than it should be. He's averaging over 30 yards per game in the last 10 games without a lot of variation, so he should be able to continue that in a high scoring high yardage game against a bad pass defense. ",

Match went about as expected, with the big names coming on in the 2nd half to help pull away. Fun fact, we've yet to lose a POTD play with odds less than +100. Great to be back in the wim column to start the weekend! \n\nMore FA cup action today and I'm targeting another EPL side against a Championship side as West Ham host Queen's Park Rangers (QPR). West Ham are firmly in the relegation zone at 18th in the Premier League, and they burned us a few matches ago when they got trounced by Wolves. But to me, this is their chance to right the ship. They need a win badly, in any competition, and this is a prime time to do it. They get a week off after this match, so i expect them to come out with a strong team and take out some frustration on QPR. \n\nQPR are in the packed middle of the table in the Championship (England's 2nd tier), but are only 3 points off from the playoff spots for promotion. They have the top 3 highest scoring games in the Championship, as their games average 3 goals/match. With that, they concede the 2nd most goals in the Championship behind relegation bound Sheffield. Because of that, we've seen some lineup changes for these mid pack championship teams eyeing a promotion spot - they are not prioritizing the FA cup as heavily. I do not expect them to rollover by any means, but I do expect them to lose. \n\nNot to be dramatic, but if West Ham don't grab a win here in front of the home crowd, against a team a division below them - their already bleak season will look pretty dire. This is their chance to right the ship and build some momentum to take to the EPL next weekend. This is obviously a risky play and definitely feel free to sit this out if you're weary of West Ham. \n\nBOL and have a great Sunday!",

Normally I lean towards Unders on props but playoffs are a different animal.  Both are situational depending on how I believe the games will play out.  \n\nIn the case of QB rushing yards, we see year after year even those QB’s that never run, will do so out of desperation in a loser go-home scenario.  Brady, Manning, even Marino, characterized as statues in the pocket have gotten most of their rushing yard stats during the playoffs. I look for QB’s with a low rushing yard total offered.  In the case of tight-ends, this is where they shine the most and become key receivers in difficult situations.  Gronk, Kelce, Gonzalez, are examples of legacy favorite targets for QB’s in big games.  This year should be no different for both prop types. \n\nI was looking at the Over on receptions for Kincaid, currently at 3.5 and at plus money which seemed more than fair.  However, when looking at the data there was a lack of consistency as he barely hits this mark in half of his games.  Then I stumbled upon the Betting Pros who have that same prop recommended as a 5 star play with a +27% EV. (I have placed this bet as well)  It seemed as I was still missing something here.  So being OCD, I scoured every bit of data on Kincaid on the internet.  Then, bingo!  I found a more compelling stat driven bet thanks to the folks at Sharp Football.\n\nWorth mentioning as a preamble is that in week 16 Dalton kincaid picked up an injury against the Browns in a game where he had 0 catches on 1 target. Then he missed the following game against the Eagles in week 17 due to the injury.  But came back last week (week 18) against the Jets where he had 3 catches for 48 yards with a long of 26. \n\nBulletpoints are in order:\n\n* Dalton Kincaid (DK) has played in 12 games this season and has a catch of at least 18 yards in 11 of them.  (week 16 vs Browns is the exception)\n* He also has a 20+ yard reception in 10 of 12 games.\n* His long receptions this year per game are: 22 18 20 28 23 23 47 20 20 24 0 26\n* Kincaid leads the NFL in tight-ends with the highest average in yards per catch.\n* If his projected over 3.5 receptions with a 5 star recommendation comes to fruition, I am confident that at least one will be for over 19 yards.\n* There is a case to be made that Jacksonville’s pass defense has not faced many elite QB’s of Josh Allen’s caliber as they have had the 6^(th) easiest schedule this season.\n* Jacksonvile is 29^(th) conceding receptions to tight ends.\n* Jacksonville has the #1 ranked rush defense in the NFL.  \n* The premise for this match is that as much as Buffalo would like to run the ball in Jacksonville, they will most likely be forced to throw the ball more than usual.  \n* The Jaguars have only lost 2 home matches this season, against the Rams and Seahawks, perhaps the 2 best teams in the league. \n* Neither the Rams nor Seahawks were able to rush rush for more than 90 yards in Jacksonville.  Buffalo will most likely fail to do so as well and be forced to pass.\n\nKincaid should get his share of targets and if he has been as dependable as his numbers suggest in every game he has played healthy, then another long catch of over 18 yards is not out of the question.",

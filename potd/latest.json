We move\n\nCavs are on 2nd night of B2B after playing last night against the Spurs where Garland didn’t play, expecting a couple of guys to get ruled out today and Garland to play in this one. Merill & Allen are already out, over in 3/4 games without them this season avg 16.3 RA’s. Wouldn’t get too surprised if Donovan Mitchell sits but wouldn’t bank on it, Lonzo should sit as he hasn’t played any back to back games this season, over in 3/3 without Lonzo this season avg 10.3 RA’s on 19 RA chances.\n\nHas had great success against GSW where he’s gone over in 4/4 games last three seasons H2H avg 10 RA with 16+ potentials in every game. \n\nShould be fresh and ready to play here against a side he’s done great against previously, not the best and not a bad matchup either but with a couple of guys ruled out I’m expecting this line to go higher. \n\n6.5 assists is a good alt if you can’t get this line.",

The defensive structure was solid throughout, the energy was there from the first minute, and once Lille got in front they managed the tempo extremely well. Marseille pushed late but struggled to create clear chances. This played out exactly as expected from a situational and structural standpoint. Good bounce-back win.\n\n---\n\n**Event: PSG vs Rennes – Ligue 1**\n\n**POTD: Under 3.5 Goals (1.85) – 5 units**\n\nWrite Up:\nPSG is once again the public favorite here, but this matchup against Rennes tends to be played at a much more controlled pace than most expect. Rennes usually sits deep, stays compact, and looks to frustrate rather than engage in open attacking football.\n\nFrom an eye-test perspective, PSG has been managing games more than blowing teams out in these types of spots, especially against disciplined defensive opponents. Rennes’ structure limits space between the lines and makes it difficult to create high-volume scoring chances.\n\nWith the Under 3.5, we are covered on most realistic scorelines in this matchup. We only lose if the game completely opens up into a shootout, which statistically and tactically is unlikely here. Given the tempo, the matchup, and the stakes, I see strong situational value on a controlled, low-to-mid scoring game.\n\nBest of luck to everyone riding, and as always, please gamble responsibly and only wager what you can afford to lose.",

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 1-1 / +0.62 Units  \n**Last Pick:** German Bundesliga - Mainz vs. M’gladbach ML @ 2.62 - 1 Unit ✅  \nGladbach had plenty of chances, especially Castrop, who missed two 1v1s against the keeper. The scoreline makes the match look closer than it actually was.\n\n**POTD:** Serie A -Sassuolo ML vs. Fiorentina @ 3.00 -1 Unit\n\nThis one is more of a bold pick. I’m purely taking the value here. In previous seasons, backing Fiorentina ML would’ve been the obvious choice. But their current form is atrocious: they’re second to last with just 6 points, scoring only 10 goals while conceding 21. They don’t have a bad squad, but nothing is clicking.\n\nMeanwhile, Sassuolo sit comfortably in 10th place and are having a solid season by their standards-16 goals scored and 16 conceded. The H2H has generally been close, except for their last meeting. I’m taking a shot here because Fiorentina are in the worst shape they’ve been in for a long time, and Sassuolo are at home. That’s why I see value in this pick.\n\nTail or don’t tail-BOL!",

We move. \n\nToday’s Pick: I got this one turning into sort of a grind. GCU already has a middle of the pack tempo and add that to the fact that OSU forces long possessions is a great recipe for an under. I just don’t think there will be enough possessions to get over 154.5. The three ball also doesn’t worry me since neither team shoots much and when they do, they’re not making many. OSU hits them at a 32% clip and GCU at a 29% clip. I think OSU has a legit defense and while I don’t believe the GCU defense is top 50 (per KenPom), if they are even close to that, this game should fly under. Let’s get on board with my first win today!",

      "text": "**Record:** 0-0\n\n**Last:** \n\n**POTD:** Merab Dvalishvili ML + Alexandre Pantoja ML (Parlay)\n\n**Event/Start Time:** UFC 323 - 10:00 PM ET\n\n**Odds:** \\-130 \n\n**Units:** 3U\n\n**Reasoning:** First pick, feel really good about this one.  \nMerab has been unstoppable. Hasn't lost since 2018. He's nicknamed \"The Machine\" for a reason. He just wears his opponents down through relentless wrestling and a combination of unnatural cardio. He is unstoppable at bantamweight, and Yan simply doesn't have the skills or physicality to beat Merab. Like a lot of recent championship matchups in the UFC, we see here a fighter with the ground game advantage vs a fighter with the striking advantage. The overwhelming trend we see is that the fighters with the upper hand on the ground dominate. Just look at all the recent matchups. Hooker vs Arman, JDM vs Islam, Pereira vs Ankalaev, Khamzat vs DDP. Tonight's main event will be no different. Oh, did I also mention that these two fought before in 2023? Merab won a unanimous decision. Expect that again tonight.\n\n  \nNow onto Pantoja. If you thought Merab was unstoppable at Bantamweight, he's nothing compared to Pantoja at Flyweight. He is THE most underrated champ in the UFC right now. Pantoja has essentially cleared out the division, and while Van is talented, he's just not enough for Pantoja. Pantoja and Merab have strikingly similar styles. Like Merab, Alexandre \"The Cannibal\" Pantoja wears down his opponents, and as soon as he sees an opportunity, he strikes. Van is a crowd-pleasing, exciting striker, riding on a wonderful story to the title, but he is about to learn there are levels to this sport. No one Van has faced thus far has been close to Pantoja's level of MMA skill. Pantoja is used to dealing with dangerous, fiery strikers, and time after time, we hear Bruce Buffer announce \"AND STILL.\" We will get two of those tonight. \n\nBOL",

      "text": "POTD Record 3-2\n\nToronto Maple Leafs vs Montreal Canadiens at 7:00pm EST (NHL/Hockey)\nOver 5.5 goals (-175)\n\nThis season both games have went over that line and i'm not expecting this to change tonight. Both teams score a lot of goals and they give up a lot of goals.\n\nLeafs score 3.48 goals on average this season. (4th in the NHL) \nLeafs give up 3.37 goals on average this season. (7th in the NHL)\n\nCanadiens score 3.31 goals on average this season. (6th in the NHL)\nCanadiens give up 3.54 goals on average this season.  (2nd in the NHL)\n \nWhile the stats do help, what makes me confident in this pick is that the Leafs lost Joseph Woll in their last game to a lower body injury which means they don't have their #1 and #2 goalie. Hildeby will be starting and although his stats are not bad at all, he only played 13 games in the NHL and he is 1-2 when starting in net this season. For the Canadiens it doesn't matter who starts really, both goalies give up 3+ goals on average this season. If it's Montembeault, he has the worst stats of a #1 goalie in the NHL (.861 save percentage which is dead last and 3.61 goals allowed on average this season). If it's Dobes, which I think will be as he won the last game for Montreal, he gives up 3.11 goals on average and has a .892 save percentage which is not good for a NHL goalie.\n\nAnd although their goalies are struggling, another reason why I feel confident with the over 5.5 is because both teams have a lot of difficulties defending in their own end and they usually give up grade A scoring chances to their opponents which makes it difficult for their goalies to stop them.\n\nIn other words, this should be a goal festival between these two division rivals or one team is gonna get dominated by the other (their last 2 games this season went 5-2 Toronto and then 5-2 Montreal).\n\nBOL!",

      "text": "**POTD Record (2025-26 Season): 2-1**\n\n**History:** Been off for a while, but we back. Gonna be trying my luck at a $400-$10000 challenge (my unit size is $400), aiming for five straight wins to get to that magic $10k mark. Switching it up a bit this time - I'm a massive Pels fan (tough life trust me), and I know this team inside out, so for this run I’m only betting on Pelicans games. Hopefully we nail the five wins straight off the bat, but either way I’m grinding until we hit that $10k.\n\n**Win Streak**: ❌ ✅ ✅\n\nSuper happy with this read, went exactly as predicted. Onto the next one.\n\n**Wager:** $1596 (Day 3)\n\n**Pick:** New Orleans Pelicans v Brooklyn Nets | Jeremiah Fears O 19.5 Points and Assists @ 1.86\n\nSince Zion went out, Fears has been extremely aggressive and has essentially stepped into the secondary scoring role behind Trey.  Pels clearly trust him to push the pace, and after almost any made basket he’ll sprint the floor for a transition layup, and he converts those at a high rate. Ideal matchup too, Nets are bottom five in transition points allowed, which fits perfectly with his playstyle.\n\nHe also tends to come out firing in the first quarter, so hopefully he sets the tone early. I did look at Fears O3.5 first-quarter points, but I might save that prop for next game.\n\nAcross his last three games without Zion, he’s averaging 20.6 points on 14.7 FGA, so the volume is clearly there. His three-point shooting has improved as well, and with Trey likely drawing doubles, Fears should see even more clean three point looks going forward. Books feel a touch behind on this.\n\nMatchup-wise, the Nets have been leaking points to point guards recently: Keyonte George 29 points, Josh Giddey 28 points, LaMelo Ball 12 points (on a really poor shooting night). Brooklyn are also among the worst in the league in both points allowed and opponent 3-pt percentage, so there’s real upside for Fears to add a couple threes on top of his usual transition buckets.\n\nFor assists, Fears has become the main driver of the offence. With his usage increasing, his distribution has naturally jumped, and he’s averaging 4.7 assists in his last three without Zion even tho the team has actually been shooting threes poorly, so there's only upside. Matchup helps too, as in their last three games the Nets have bled assists to PGs - George: 10 assists, Giddey: 11 assists, LaMelo: 14 assists\n\nOverall, projecting a big Fears game with both scoring and playmaking upside. As a little bonus look, Fears O3.5 first-quarter points.\n\nBOL if tailing!",

This Texas Tech team is a wagon and I believe they have a serious chance of winning the national championship this year as they are undefeated 10-0 when quarterback Behren Morton starts under center with their only loss coming when he was out due to injury. Their high powered offense is one of the best in nation and in terms of scoring they are ranked 3rd nationally with over 43 points scored per game. They are also paired with a damn good defense. This Red Raiders defense is excellent against the rush, so much so they have the nations number one ranked rush defense allowing less than 70 rushing yards per game. They also rank 3rd nationally in points allowed per game allowing just 11 points on defense per contest. This Red Raiders squad is a complete package and we saw this earlier in the year when they faced off against these same BYU Cougars winning that game in convincing fashion 29-7. I also like the Virginia Cavaliers to defeat the Duke Blue Devils for the second time this year. Virginia went on the road and handed Duke a 34-17 loss and when I went back and rewatched that game a couple things stood out to me. Even when Duke stacked the box, they simply could not stop the run. Runningback J’Mari Taylor rushed for 133 yards and 2 touchdowns and the team as a whole rushed for 225 yards. Also this Duke secondary did not have an answer for wide receiver Trell Harris as he recorded 161 receiving yards and found his way into the endzone. The final score of 34-17 makes it seem like it was kind of a close game but it really wasnt. Virginia manhandled Duke on the line of scrimmage and this game was 31-3 in the third quarter before the Cavaliers put in some of their backups. I expect history to repeat itself in this one and Virginia to be crowned as champions of the ACC.\n\nPrediction: 30-20 Texas Tech, 31-23 Virginia\n\nLast pick:🏈Boise State -3💰Both sides of the ball looked really solid from Boise there. Nice cash congrats if you tailed!\n\nBest of luck to everyone tailing and remember to bet responsibly and lets keep this conference championship weekend momentum rolling!!🍀💜🐉\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zwfiqyatmi5g1.jpeg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1199f1db5fda2d960d0f37356a60910703ee90d4",

      "text": "POTD RECORD: 2-3 ❌✅❌❌✅\nNET UNITS : -1.1U\n\nPrevious pick : Abu Dhabi T20 - Match sixes over 16.5 ❌\n\nI have to admit my analysis wasn't spot on as the pitch played very much in the slower side and batsmen couldn't go for big hits. In the end, we lost by 2 sixes. We move on\n\nToday's Pick : Cricket - India vs SA - Match sixes over 15.5 @1.9  2U\n\nWrite up : \n\nSeries decided today. It's been high scoring matches in the last 2 matches and I expect the same here in Vizag. Vizag venue is known for dishing out batting friendly pitches. Women's World Cup matches saw some of the flattest pitches ( Australia W chasing 300+ , England W chasing 180 in 30 overs) . The venue doesn't get many international matches on the Mens side and hence it would be ideal for them to make another flat one to attract more crowd( if Virat and Rohit aren't enough already to make it houseful)\n\nThe sixes line cleared in the last 2 matches and I'm fairly confident to get this done as well. Plenty of six hitting ability in both sides. Players who aren't known for exclusive six hitting have also joined the party ( Gaikwad, Kohli). Jaiswal is yet to perform well and he will be under pressure to perform as this will be his last opportunity before Gill replacing him. \n\nSouth Africa have definitely exceeded expectations in the series and have come close to winning 2 matches. Their batting depth is something they've been focusing on its paying off this series. Markram, Brevis, Bosch, Jansen are the usual suspects again.\n\nMy first 2U bet here. Good luck 🤞🏻",

I have faith in this defense that’s given up just under 8 ppg this season, and only once have they given up more than 2 scores, a game in which they gave up 16. \n\nOn the other side, I actually do think Indiana is solid and well coached, but until anyone in CFB proves that they’re in the same atmosphere as OSU, it’s going to be a you’ve got to prove it to be type of deal with just about anyone Ohio State runs into this postseason. Too much speed & skill on the outside and players and coaches who have been there and done that. \n\nTwo of the sports best, most balanced in a year where the top 8 isn’t nearly as potent as years past. I’ll take OSU 31-17 in a game that’s close in the first half, but controlled all the way through by the Buckeyes. \n\nGood luck if tailing, CFB was my money maker last year, first post since my bad run at the end of baseball season. \n\n(Personally laddering OSU -2.5 all the way up to -16.5, and Indiana Team Total Under 24.5 all the way down to Under 10.5, bet at your own risk)",

Chris Duncan owns a tight, aggressive guillotine that he’s shown he can latch onto the moment opponents shoot sloppy entries. On the other side, Terrance McKinney has multiple first-round submission wins and consistently forces fast grappling scrambles early in fights.\nThis matchup sets up perfectly for a tap: McKinney comes out explosive and chaotic, which either gets him top control opportunities or puts him directly into danger if Duncan times a counter choke. Neither guy is known for slow, methodical pacing. The early exchanges should be wild, and with two proven submission threats, I see this fight hitting the mat and ending with someone getting caught inside the first two rounds.\nPick: Fight Ends by Submission (+130) – 2U",

We will not lose three in a row\n\nEvent: Duke @ MSU (NCAAB) (11am central)\n\nPOTD: Michigan State ML (+100) (1U)\n\nWrite up:\n\nIn what is shaping up to be the biggest game the Breslin Center has hosted in the last decade, Michigan State moneyline stands out as a strong even money play against Duke. The Breslin has been one of the most intimidating home environments in college basketball, and with an undefeated 8–0 MSU team hosting a top‑10 Duke squad, the atmosphere will be volcanic — the kind of edge that analytics never fully capture but bettors should never ignore. MSU’s physicality and frontcourt depth give them a real blueprint to challenge Duke star Cam Boozer, who enters averaging 23.6 points per game on 56.2% shooting. The Spartans counter with Jaxon Kohler, their leading scorer at 14.3 points per game on 52.5% shooting, and a team rebounding rate ranking first in the nation at 59%. Duke is 20th in the nation. MSU is proving they have the size and toughness to battle inside. Combine that with Tom Izzo’s 744 career wins and his unmatched preparation in marquee matchups, and MSU’s blend of experience, physicality, and home‑court firepower makes their even‑money line a compelling and analytically supported bet heading into this Breslin Center showdown. \nLet’s get back on track, as always, cheers 🍻",

Both teams have the quality to break through each other's defenses because Frankfurt will not sit back defensively away from home and will try to win the match, meaning Leipzig's attack will find space and Frankfurt's attack will create chances as well. Leipzig have been in excellent form winning most of their home games and Frankfurt have scored against even tough opponents, so expecting both teams to score is very realistic and has happened in most recent meetings between these two clubs. The over 2.5 goals requirement is almost guaranteed because this is an open attacking match where both Leipzig and Frankfurt will try to win. \n\nIf you found these picks helpful, tips or donations are greatly appreciated as they support the time and effort I put into creating them: [buy me a beer🍻](https://buymeacoffee.com/hercules.son.of.zeus)",

They have already beaten this Georgia team earlier in the season in a close game, away in Athens and I'm predicting this one to be a very close one as well. Both teams rank very similarly in offensive and defensive numbers this season, with the exception of the Bulldogs having an elite top 10 run defense. Even then, the Crimson Tide is more known for their passing game and I don't believe the run game to be much of a factor for them coming into this game. Alabama is 8-3-1 against the spread this season and are 9-0 in their last 9 SEC championship appearances. This game has all the makings for a down to the wire finish in what feels like a coin flip matchup.\n\nWith my second leg I have Indiana covering within 10.5 points in this clash between the 1st and 2nd ranked teams in the nation, with what really feels like a pick em matchup. This matchup features the nation's best scoring defense (7.8 PPG allowed) against the second best scoring offenses (44.3 PPG). While the Buckeyes are favored and have a 30-game winning streak against Indiana, the Hoosiers have an elite rushing attack and I believe they can control the clock and keep the Buckeyes offense off the field to keep this game within striking distance. So far this season Indiana has performed well against the spread with a 7-5 record and I believe they will be able to cover this line as well at a neutral site that is one hour north of their home stadium in Bloomington.\n\nTail or fade BOL to everyone and cheers! 🍻",

Lets start with the first one, Stuttgart and Bayern. The monsters from Münich are very good this season, but they have not been flawless. They have conceeded in all of their last 6. They have cleared the O2.5 line in every single game this season except for one, which finished 2-0. Meanwhile Stuttgart have scored in every single home game this season and have hit O2.5 in 13 of the last 13 H2H with bayern. Next up we have a similar story in Barca. They are looking excelent this season, with an insane attack but also a subpar defense. They have conceeded in every single away game except for their first against mallorca this season, and scored in all of them except the one at Stamford Bridge. Betis have scored in all but 1 home game the whole season and we expect a lot of goals here. Barca has covered O2.5 in 17 straight games and i dont see it stopping today. Lock these plays in and lets cash together.\n\nBOL and gamble responsibly",

      "text": "POTD Record: 2 - 1\n\nPrev Pick : Iona -2.5 @1.8 1u to win 0.8u ❌\n\nNet Profit : +0.8\n\nEvent: NCAAB | Iowa State @ Purdue | 12.00PM EST\n\nPOTD: Over 150.5 @1.8 1u to win 0.8u\n\nWrite Up:\n\n\nim on the OVER 150.5 in Purdue vs iowa State, and it makes way too much sense when you look at how these two teams actually play. Purdue’s offense is one of the cleanest in the country efficient, well-spaced, and always generating high-quality shots inside or kick-outs. They’re averaging high-80s because they don’t waste possessions, and against Iowa State’s pace they’re going to get even more opportunities than usual. Iowa State doesn’t exactly slow the game down either. They’re sitting in the mid-90s per game because they run, attack early in the clock, and force a tempo that most teams struggle to match. Add that to Purdue’s tendency to play up to the pace of aggressive teams, and you suddenly have a game that’s naturally trending toward the mid-150s without either team needing an outlier shooting night.\n\nThis matchup isn’t about whether one side clamps the other it’s about two high-powered offenses trading efficient possessions, fueled by tempo and ball movement.",

      "text": "**Record:** 30-16-1 (+12.43u) \n\n**Last:** (CBB) Tennessee -6.5 (1u) - L\n\n**POTD:** No. 2 Arizona (-7.5) vs No. 20 Auburn\n\n**Start Time:** 10:00 PM ET (ESPN)\n\n**Odds:** -120 (FanDuel)\n\n**Units:** 1U\n\n**Reasoning:** You’d be hard-pressed to find a team with a better resume thus far than Arizona.\n\nAfter opening the season with an impressive 93-87 victory over then-No. 3 Florida, the Wildcats (7-0) also added wins over then-No. 3 UConn (71-67) and then-No. 15 UCLA (69-65). The team was just as impressive in its other four outings, winning by an average margin of 32 points. \n\nConversely, results have been all over the map for Auburn to start the season.\n\nThe Tigers (7-2) opened the season with a scare against Bethune-Cookman, needing overtime to escape with a 95-90 victory as a 24.5-point favorite. The team rebounded to taken then-No. 1 Houston to the wire in a 73-72 loss before getting flat-out embarrassed against then-No. 7 Michigan, 102-72. Since then, Auburn has seemingly turned things around, shooting 60.8% from the field (56.7% from three-point range) over its last three halves, including a 55-point second half to knock off then-No. 14 St. John’s 85-74. \n\nHowever, don’t expect that offensive prowess to continue Saturday night.\n\nDespite ranking quite impressively thus far—27th in offensive efficiency (1.195), 35th in scoring 87.9 PPG), 43rd in field-goal percentage (49.2%) and 121st in three-point shooting (35.1%)—the Tigers have only faced two defensive units that rank Top 75 in defensive efficiency. In those two games (Houston, Michigan), the team shot a combined 44-of-120 from the field (36.7%). Look for it to be another frustrating shooting night against a stifling Arizona defensive unit that ranks 24th in defensive efficiency (0.908), 41st in scoring defense (67.0 PPGA), 56th in opponent field-goal percentage (40.5%) and 168th in opponent three-point shooting (32.7%). \n\nOn the other end of the floor, look for the Wildcats offense to take whatever it wants.\n\nThrough seven games, the unit ranks 12th in field-goal percentage (51.8%), 33rd in offensive efficiency (1.183), 37th in scoring (87.3 PPG) and 64th in three-point shooting (37.2%). That could be a cause for concern for an Auburn defensive unit that ranks just 131st in defensive efficiency (1.012) while also ranking 79th in opponent field-goal percentage (41.5%), 153rd in opponent three-point shooting (32.4%) and 167th in scoring defense (74.4 PPGA). Look for the Wildcats to take advantage on the break, where they rank 27th in fast break points (16.3 PPG; 93rd percentile) while the Tigers rank just 202nd in opponent fast break points (11.1 PPG; 45th percentile). \n\nThe battle on the glass should prove to be a major X factor in this one.\n\nArizona dominates the boards on both ends of the floor, ranking 15th in total rebounding (42.6 per game), 20th in offensive rebounding (12.6) and 26th in defensive rebounding (27.0) while ranking 3rd in opponent defensive rebounding (17.1), 15th in opponent total rebounding (29.7) and 90th in opponent offensive rebounding (8.1). Meanwhile, Auburn ranks 46th in offensive rebounding (23.9), 58th in total rebounding (39.3) and 112th in defensive rebounding (23.9) while ranking 52nd in opponent defensive rebounding (19.9), 105th in opponent total rebounding (33.7) and 243rd in opponent offensive rebounding (9.8). To add insult to injury, the Tigers struggle to defend the paint, ranking 144th in points in the paint allowed (30.9 PPG; 61st percentile). That will be a major issue against a Wildcats offense that ranks 3rd in the category (46.6 PPG, 99th percentile). \n\nTaking care of the ball will also be crucial for Arizona.\n\nThus far, the team has struggled to play clean basketball, ranking 192nd in turnovers per possession (17.4%), 199th in opponent steals (7.0 per game) and 224th in turnovers (12.9). Although Auburn ranks 51st in steals (8.6), the team only ranks 122nd in turnovers forced (13.2) and 136th in turnovers forced per possession (18.0%). This could go a long way in deciding if the Wildcats can cover the number. \n\nTrust Arizona to show out in front of the home crowd.\n\nBOL if tailing, and as always please do so responsibly. One bet should NOT lead to a crash out.",

I believe St. Bonaventure is MILES better than UB, but because of the rivalry and them being on the road, I believe this is why the line is lower than it should be \n\n• Buffalo have 3 guys, Freitag being their #1, the Wisconsin transfer - if Bonaventure can hold him to less than 20 points, I believe they have a big chance of winning\n\n\n• Bonaventure is deep, playing around 8-10 per game - the bench guys have come up clutch for them when they needed too, and their bench is pretty darn good for being a mid-major program - between Buddy Simmons, Frank Mitchell, Lonati, Charles, Big Joe, and Marshall, Bonaventure have the weapons to beat up on Buffalo\n\n\n* I do not see anyone stopping Bonaventure's big, Frank Mitchell, and if they do, Bonaventure has enough fire power around him to win them the game - if Bonaventure can slow Buffalo's scorer's down just a touch, they will roll\n* The model is projecting Texas Tech to cover, so I added them as the ML 2nd leg - Bonaventure is only -4 favorites so their ML should be in the 200's something\n\nLet's keep rolling.\n\nBOL!\n\n**POTD: CBB St. Bonaventure ML vs. Buffalo / CFB Texas Tech ML vs. BYU (2.50$ TO WIN 1.85$)**\n\nTips are greatly appreciated.

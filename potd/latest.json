The Youth Leagues usually see & ton of goals. Benfica usually scores a lot of goals in all their matches & are heavy favorites vs Slavia, who concede a lot while on the road. Tottenham games have also seen lot of goals & though the odds favor Betis, i think both sides are quite equal & we may see a 4-5 goal affair. Truthfully, I wanted to put up a 3.5 goal line, but my luck is pretty bad recently, so going with over 3 asian line for both.\n\nHope we get the W & BoL",

Busy life and I do want to keep posting only thought out picks in POTD.\n\nLast pick was a very solid win. Mallorca Sevilla both scored in the first half. Sweat free, just like I like them.\n\nLet's keep riding the momentum.\n\n**Write Up:**\n\nA sweat-free bet. Let’s follow that with another one. I’ve had success in the Coupe de France before, the aim is to keep that going. And this match is perfect for it.\n\nLyon are the in-form team right now. The last time that they’ve not won is on December 7th. 10 straight wins in the league, the cup and in Europe.\n\nIn the meanwhile, Laval lost all league games since their last win on the 25th of November\n\nThey did win 3 cup games vs Saint-Pauloise(6th tier), Guingamp (League 2, won 1-0 in the 94th minute with their only shot on target but Guingamp were dominating) and Istres (4th tier).\n\nLaval had a relatively easy (and lucky) road to get to the round of 16 but that ends today.\n\nTheir away record is 3-4-4 in the league. Winning against the #14, #15 and #16 home teams in the league. Losing to the #2, #5, #11 and #12.\n\nYou can probably see where this is going.\n\nLyon are 8-0-2 at home in 1 division higher than Laval are playing in. Losing only to PSG (#1 away) and Toulouse (#5 away).\n\nLyon are bound to dominate here. With PSG out of the competition and managing top 8 in Europe for an easier schedule they will want to get a relatively easy victory.\n\nI expect them to win at least by 2 goals and am hoping for 3+. The -2 AH line is perfect for this spot and the odds are immense for what I am expecting.\n\nFade or tail, BOL!",

Hence, they offset one another. \n\nHowever, on the last 5 games, the Spurs are ranked 5th against OKC’s 10th position in Net Adjusted Efficiency. To add, the Spurs are more consistent compared to OKC in trying to sustain this data. \n\nLastly, the Spurs lost on the ROAD to OKC the last time they met, which will be an added fuel for them to get their lick back. I also expect the fans to jam-pack this game, which will only further help us. \n\nLet’s get this bag!!!",

Machac however has beaten far more impressive opponents in the same tourney, beating Dimitrov, Tsisipas, and taking Musetti to 5 who was about to beat Djokovic before he retired. While Gea's serve is really strong Machac is a good baseline returner and over the course of the match he will break Gea and will steamroll through. \n\nBOL!",

I know the Oilers played yesterday but in his last back-to-back game, Walman got 3 shots. Combine this with the Flames being top 10 in the league this season for shots allowed and this looks like a great game for Walman to go for a 12th game in a row with 2 shots! Oilers in their last 10 games vs the Flames also have on average 32 shots so I expect plenty of opportunities for him to shoot!\n\nBOL!",

But Coyote doesn't stay down. We pivot to the two most dominant \"future\" stars on the board.\n\nReasoning: We are looking for the \"Inevitable\" scenario. Boston is playing their second game of a back-to-back, and tired legs usually result in short jumpers. Houston is the #1 offensive rebounding team in the NBA, and Şengün is the anchor. Even with Kevin Durant (ankle) and Fred VanVleet (ACL) out, Şengün’s usage is at an all-time high. He just grabbed 16 boards last game; the momentum is essentially a freight train.\n\nScenario A (The Ideal): Boston settles for perimeter shots due to fatigue. Şengün cleans up the glass on the defensive end and feasts on second-chance opportunities against a Boston frontcourt that lacks a traditional 7-foot bruiser with Jayson Tatum out. He hits 11 rebounds by the end of the 3rd quarter.\n\nScenario B (The Grind): The refs (like Scott Foster or Tony Brothers) call a tight game, slowing the pace to a crawl. Houston runs every play through Şengün in the post. The missed free throws and slow-developing plays keep him parked in the paint, allowing him to grab \"easy\" boards off the rim.\n\nScenario C (The Trade Deadline Chaos): With trade rumors swirling (Harden, Giannis, etc.), the energy on the court is erratic. Rotations tighten. Şengün, being the franchise cornerstone, stays on the floor for 35+ minutes regardless of the score, simply out-working the bench players.\n\nScenario D (The White Flag 🏳️): Boston blows Houston out early. However, unlike Josh Hart (who gets pulled for rest), Şengün often stays in during blowouts to anchor the young lineup. He stat-pads 3-4 \"garbage time\" rebounds against Boston’s deep bench to clear the 10.5 line.\n\nScenario E (Cold Night): Both teams shoot under 40% from the field. This creates an \"infinite\" supply of rebounds. Even if Şengün struggles to score, the sheer volume of misses makes 11 rebounds statistically inevitable.\n\nScenario Proof: Şengün has averaged 11.4 rebounds over his last 5 games. Historically, he has a massive ceiling against Boston (once putting up 12 boards against them). With Boston's interior defense weakened by the schedule and Houston’s #1 ranking in O-REB, he doesn't need to \"play well\" to hit this; he just needs to stand near the basket.",

Onto the next one we have the Chicago Blackhawks coming to Columbus to play the Blue Jackets. In net for the Blue Jackets is Jet Greaves who has been doing great this season. Jet Greaves has a save percentage of .908 and a 2.67 goals against average. On the other side, Spencer Knight is in net for the Blackhawks and he has been good every year but this year has been especially good. This season, Spencer Knight has a .909 save percentage and a 2.61 goals against average. The Blue Jackets are a pretty unimpressive team on offense, they rank 17th in goals while being 4th in shots. They don’t really have any guys who have a great shot to score goals at a high percentage of their shots. On the flip side, the Blackhawks are one of the worst offensively this season, ranking 26th in goals and dead last in shots on goal at 32nd. With the Blackhawks being one of the worst offensive teams and facing a breakout year in Jet Greaves, and then the Blue Jackets who can’t capitalize on their shots on goal, facing a great goalie in Spencer Knight, this will be a matchup with great goalies not having threatening shots on them. They will both be able to save the weak shot attempts and have a low scoring affair.\n\nTake The Under 6.5 Goals!",

They are linemates so the reasoning is very simple. The line of Buch, Neighbors, and Kyrou has been really impressive and a recent development. Robert Thomas got hurt and the blues were lacking centers and so they put Buchnevich at center and he has been vocal, active and driving the team forward. Neighbors got moved to Buch’s wing spot and provides strength and grit that the line needed so that when they do a dump and chase, they can actually gain and retain possession, while also having enough skill for the line to make the line productive.

They've been averaging around 28.5 SOGs per game and are going up against the worst defense in the league. Marner has had a high shot volume over the past 5 games easily surpassing 3 SOGs.\n\nNow he is known as a playmaker passer, but that was back on the Leafs. On his current line-up he is the best talent on the ice for making a shot when they are out. Marner is on a 3 goal streak and the other primary shooter Dorofeyev has only 2 SOGs in the last 3 games. Bruce Cassidy needs a freaking win here, I think Cassidy will tell Marner to not pass but rather get that puck in the net, clearly he has the ability in the last week.\n\nMarner will get about 20 minutes on the ice, and will be involved in both the PP & PK units. which the Canucks averaging about 3.7 penalties a game. We can expect some SOGs from both sides of that equation.\n\nAdditionally, Marner is sitting at 797 career points, the boy wants 4 more points. I'm sure his team will be supporting this push and perhaps his last 5 games having higher than average SOGs support this thesis.\n\nTomorrow will be the 2nd to last game before the Olympic break, on a 5 game losing streak against the worst team in the league. Expect an aggressive game, high event game.\n\nLet's go Mitchell Marner 3+ SOGs!\n\n\\--------------------------------------------\n\nBig win from William Nylander who secured 3 SOGs within the first 30 minutes of play!

The Utah Jazz made a trade early in the day and used seven players against Indiana. So how does Isaiah Collier respond? He set a Jazz single-game assists record for a player not named John Stockton (22) and added 17 points (and just two turnovers!) in 48 minutes. FWIW his previous career high was 37 minutes. He did exactly what I thought he would. He missed all three of his 3-point attempts but got to the free-throw line a team-high eight times. His shooting from the stripe (and floor) was pretty bad, but no matter. When you've only got seven guys, you're gonna chuck the rock. Oh, and Utah won 131-122. Onward.*\n\n**Today's reasoning:** When UNC Asheville and USC Upstate get together, defense often goes missing for long stretches of time. These teams just combined for 152 points on Jan. 21. What's changed in 13 days? OK, sure... USC Upstate scored 65 points in back-to-back games, which is admittedly 10 points lower than their season average. UNC Asheville scored 69 points against a Gardner-Webb team that turns every game ugly and 71 points at perennial nemesis Winthrop. The 70 point average since Jan. 21 is four points lower than *their* season average. But there are no injuries that I am aware of. So why pick this pairing of 10-13 teams to rekindle their offenses today?\n\nBecause they've cleared 140.5 in five straight head-to-head matchups, and 7 of the last 10 meetings. Better yet, they've cleared 140.5 in 7 of the last 9 games played in Asheville. Against all competition, UNCA has combined to clear 140.5 in 7 of 12 home games this season. In conference play, the Bulldogs are 6-3 to the over. Against USC Upstate specifically, UNCA has averaged 79.6 points over the last 10 meetings and has cleared 80 as a team in four of the last five (83, 92, 93, 95).\n\nMeanwhile, USC Upstate is averaging 75.4 points over its last five games against UNCA, including 85- and 92-point outings last season, when UNCA had a much better team. Both KenPom and BartTorvik are projecting totals just over 140.5, so buyer better beware. But I like this matchup as an offensive get-right game for both sides. UNCA averages 2.3 more points per game at home, which is to be expected. If the Bulldogs hit their usual 75 in front of a friendly Kimmel Arena crowd, all USC Upstate needs is 66 points. That's actually two points less than what UNCA usually allows at home. But the Spartans have gone for at least 64 in four of their last five games in Asheville. And get this, USC Upstate is averaging 11 more points on the road against conference opponents than at home (74.3 vs. 63.3). What an incredible split. In their last five road games overall, they've notched 65, 69, 86 (OT), 77, and 65 - 72.4 average.\n\nUSC Upstate likes to push the pace, and they've been more efficient with it on the road for whatever reason. KenPom puts their adjusted tempo at 155. On the road, as an underdog, I wanna see them gunning. Both teams' defensive ratings are in the 210s. UNCA has the second-best 3-point field goal percentage in the Big South Conference (36.1). Both sides are middle of the pack for guarding the deep ball. That tells me that we could see some offensive spurts thanks to outside shooting. In Jan. 21 game, they combined for 36 takes from range, and both made right at their season average.\n\nMy thesis: I look to UNCA to flirt with dropping another 80 on USC Upstate. I also look for the Spartans to push the ball and play to their conference road game average (74) and/or L5 average against UNCA (75). That totals 154/155, easily more than the line for today, and a basket better than they played on Jan. 21 - which did not feature any outlier offensive shooting performance. Even if UNCA scores just a typical 75 at home, all we need is 66 from USC Upstate. The current spread is 6.5. That implies that USC Upstate will get 68, 69. This might be tight, but I like my chances with two teams looking for offensive answers on their buildup to a one-bid conference tournament.\n\nGood luck and Godspeed!\n\nPOTD tracker: https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/Seventh__Place-z37cn7\n\nIf I've made you a few bucks through fades, it's just gonna ask you a few questions: https://buymeacoffee.com/seventh__place",

Bet 2.5u\n\nWriteup: Let’s start with Duquesne. They go up against a 20-2 George Mason team with a top 30 quality of record and are ranked top 75 in the league. Beyond this, I don’t see why Duquesne shouldn’t have a chance to get an upset victory. Their offense vs the GM defense is about as even as they come, and while I would give an advantage to the GM offense, I like Duquesne to rebound effectively and create some turnovers as well. Additionally, Duquesne should have an offensive advantage with shot around the rim, and GM likes to prevent the 3 ball and is a bit softer down low. This is another game where we back the underdog with a polar opposite play style to the favorite. GM’s pace of play is 335th, whereas Duquesne’s is 63rd. Add on top of this that GM has been very inconsistent, plays some of their worst ball at home, and have not had a convincing win in a month, I think Duquesne has a shot to win on the road. We’ll take them to cover by +13.5.\n\nNext is San Francisco vs Loyola Marymount. The big driving factors for me here are defense, momentum, and 3-point shooting, with a few smaller factors on top. San Fran has a defense efficiency just outside the top 100, whereas LMU has an offense efficiency almost in the 300s. San Fran also has a momentum ranking just outside the top 100. Not that impressive, but when you compare it to LMU’s ranking of 365th…oh look that’s dead last in the league. We just took Santa Clara to beat them on Saturday, and Santa Clara won by over 30. LMU has lost 6 straight and I have no reason to trust them. I feel good about this one, so give me San Fran to cover a -2.5 spread at a solid price.\n\nRemember to only bet what you can afford to lose, and BOL!",

Today we’re looking at the Argentine Reserve League, a market where the gap between the \"Big 5\" and the rest is often massive.\n\nRacing Club (Home): They have one of the most prestigious academies in Argentina. At home, they are incredibly disciplined, physical, and technical. They usually suffocate teams that don't have the same level of tactical training.\n     \nBarracas Central (Away): To put it bluntly, their youth setup is one of the weakest in the division. They simply don't have the infrastructure to compete with a giant like Racing. Their recent form is abysmal: **only 1 win in their last 10 matches.**\n* **The Play:** While Reserve games can sometimes be low-scoring or tricky, the quality difference here is too large to ignore.

SIGNOR TORTONI, our main market rival, has trialled the house down either side of its first up run, but that run was absolutely awful, finishing dead last. I can’t possibly trust that horse currently. CLEAR PROOF and KILBRANNAN are going well but they’re definitely not up to the class of our horse.

Enzo came through for us again in less sweaty fashion as he lands an SOT before halftime. Gotta love it!\n\nToday we've got the last semi final for the EFL Cup as Man City host Newcastle. City is already up 2-0 on aggregate here. This should be an even more open game as Newcastle need to score at least 2 goals. We have cashed Semenyo a few times in the soccer thread over the last few weeks and I like him here again today. His goal over the weekend was on a counter attack and I expect that to be City's main threat today. \n\nSemenyo has been on a tear since joining City, scoring a goal in 4 out of 5 games played. He has scored in two straight EPL games and also scored in this reverse fixture a few weeks back at Newcastle. I'm buying down the risk a bit here as ATGS is +190, since City have been moving towards a two pronged attack with Haaland and Semenyo up front.

He had a solid run in Australia, qualifying for AO and won his first match against Erhard, who has been playing well recently. He is currently number 117 in the world and meeting number 306 in the world. \n\nShelbayh made a good progression the last year but has not really shown a good form recently. Besides his match yesterday, he has not won a match since October last year and I believe this match is going to be a too big a mouthfull against a Maestrelli who has won 5 out of his 7 matches this year and played all matches on hard court (and one of the matches he lost was to Djokovic, which almost shouldn't count as a lost match in this statistic).\n\nI see a good value in this bet and good luck!\n\n\\_\n\nIf you follow my bets, I would appreciate a little tip - I spend a lot of time analyzing the bets day to day.

Taxes. Another Sparty donation?\n\nThere hasn’t been a lot of coin respecting going on when it comes to Michigan State as of late. That’s largely in part to some slow starts, as the team stumbled out of the gate in each of its two games last week against Rutgers and Michigan, trailing at the half by nine and 16 points respectively. But while a second-half surge helped the Spartans (19-3) outlast the Scarlet Knights in overtime, it was a case of too little, too late against the Wolverines. The loss snapped a seven-game win streak and dropped the team to 4th in the Big Ten standings.\n\nBut if there’s one thing head coach Tom Izzo knows how to do, it’s to bounce back: Michigan State is 31-13-2 ATS following a loss over the last five years.\n\nHowever, don’t expect Minnesota to make it easy. Despite a 3-8 mark in conference play—and having lost each of its last seven games—the Gophers (10-12) have been a tough out in the opening half of games. In fact, the team has either led or been tied at the half in four of its last six contests. That includes being knotted up at 34 against then-No. 13 Illinois and leading 36-30 against then-No. 7 Nebraska. Elite defense has been the name of the game, as Minnesota ranks 10th in first half scoring defense (29.7 PPGA).\n\nUnfortunately, that’s about the only positive the team can hang its hat on.\n\nAfter a 10-5 start to the season, it’s been all downhill for the Gophers. Through 22 games, the team ranks 125th in field-goal percentage (45.5%), 163rd in offensive efficiency (1.064), 242nd in three-point shooting (32.7%) and 245th in scoring (71.8 PPG). Not the kind of numbers you want to bring into a matchup with a Spartans defense that enters ranked 8th in opponent field-goal percentage (39.1%), 9th in scoring defense (64.4 PPGA), 11th in defensive efficiency (0.928) and 40th in opponent three-point shooting (30.4%). The last time the team came off a loss, the unit limited USC to just 17 first-half points and 51 for the game on just 33% shooting (18% from beyond the arc).\n\nThings don’t get any more promising on the defensive end.\n\nOn the year, the Minnesota defense can be described average at best, ranking 48th in scoring defense (68.8 PPGA), 97th in opponent field-goal percentage (42.9%), 102nd in defensive efficiency (1.020) and 195th in opponent three-point shooting (34.2%). However, over the last six games, the unit has been leaking water, conceding an average of 76.2 points on 46.2% shooting from the field (40.7% from long range). For a Michigan State offense that ranks 53rd in offensive efficiency, Wednesday night’s matchup could be like stealing candy from a baby. Especially with point guard Jeremy Fears Jr. (14.9 PPG, 8.8 APG) playing the way he has as of late.\n\nTrust Sparty to bounce back convincingly.\n\nBOL if tailing, and as always, please do so responsibly.

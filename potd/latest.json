Is that why Sens are odds-on to win this? They only managed to win against the two team that are bottom of the Eastern and Western conferences. Or because they play at home? There are plenty of Habs fans living on Ottawa and plenty are usually making the 2h trip from Montreal, so they would provide enough support in the arena.\n\nHabs have won 10 points more that the Sens so far (having played 2 games more). Sens have not resolved their goalie issues. Montreal are slight favourites in my book so I'll take them to win at these odds.",

Troyes have struggled to control matches against organized sides, and their defensive lapses tend to show once they’re forced to chase the game. Reims are disciplined, patient, and don’t need many chances to get on the scoresheet, which suits this matchup perfectly. Backing Reims to get the win offers solid value based on current form and matchup dynamics.\n\nGood Luck! ✌️",

At 9/10, the price underrates that gap. With Pafos at home on Wednesday, today is the must-win league game, so Chelsea should go stronger now and rotate more in Europe without compromising priorities.\n\nUnits: 3\n\n[Buy me a beer 🍺](https://www.paypal.com/ncp/payment/833MDWKA7GUVA)",

Tasmania have\nturned defense into a weapon over the last month. They're already the number one ranked scoring defense on the season, but over the last six rounds they've tightened the screws even further allowing just under 82 points per game.\nAnd in a league where scoring has gone up, that's elite. Melbourne, well, they're heading the other way. Since the FEA break they've gone from the best scoring team in the league down to sixth, and the defense has slipped badly as well. The perimeter shooting isn’t consistent, rotations look slow, and when games turn into grinds they're really struggling to find answers.\nThat's exactly the type of game Tasmania want, slow tempo, physical defense, forcing contested shots late in the clock.\nWe saw it again earlier this month when Tazzy held Melbourne to just 73 points. This\none doesn't feel like a bounceback spot for Melbourne either. Feels like Tazzy getting another choke hold on a team that's short on confidence.\nI feel Tasmania can cover the line and the total points to go under but for added safety I’ve gone with the alt TAS +2.5 & TT points under 180.5.\nAs an extra (not included in record) I like Josh bannon for 3+ assists.\n\nWARNING !\nI HAVE BAD LUCK",

They are on a 5 game unbeaten run (4 wins 1 draw). They had some rest during this busy month because one of their games got postponed. They are the second best performing home team in the league. They have only lost 1 home game all season (8 wins, 4 draws, 24 goals scored, 11 conceded). \n\nBalckburn has a long injury list. Several starters are out. They are near the bottom of the league. In their previous 11 games they only won 1 (4 losses, 7 draws). They are a decent road team: 5 wins, 3 draws and 4 losses (11 goals scored and 10 conceded). \n\nIpswich has odne well in the H2H: In their most recent 3 encounters (dating back to 2023) Ipswich won twice and drawed once. \n\nConsidering the long injury list, Ipswich's excellent form and the rest they had I see them edging it. I pick the DNB because Blackburn has shown to be a team that doesn't concede much on the road, so a sneaky draw could be lurking. \n\nLens has been in superb form and are the league leaders in France (above PSG!!!). They are on a 7 game winning streak and they have also won their previous 7 home games. All season they have only lost 1 home game (the first home game they played this season). Their stats at home are very good: they have scored 16 goals and only condeded 4 in 8 home matches. \n\nAuxerre is in a whole different situation. They are near the bottom of the league and they are the worst performing road team in the league. All season long they have not won a single road game: 2 draws, 6 losses, 4 goals scored, 16 goals conceded. Lens has a healthy squad, while Auxerre is missing some players due to suspensions and injuries. This should be a routine win for an in-form Lens.",

Jotko is clearly the more experienced fighter and has faced higher-level competition, but his style leans heavily toward wrestling and clinch control. While that approach has worked for him in oktagon so far, it often led to close rounds.\n\nKerim, on the other hand, is a wrestler himself.

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 3-1 \n\n**Last:** Joel Embiid u12.5 reb + ast (-138) FanDuel 1.5u ✅ \n\n**Event:** NBA: Celtics @ Hawks 7:40 PM EST \n\n**Today's POTD:** Jaylen Brown u38.5 pts + ast (-124) DraftKings 1.5u \n\n**Write-up:** To start things off, Payton Pritchard will not be playing in this game. Now, it might seem counterintuitive to take Jaylen's under here. Jaylen is a great player and is having a hell of a season, but he is the kind of player who plays down to his competition. It doesn't matter who he plays; he is getting 26 to 32 points per night. Jaylen has gone under 39 pts + ast in 28 out of 37 games this season. The Hawks are giving up the 3rd most points and assists to the SF position. As I said, Jaylen plays down to his competition. Against bottom defenses this season, he has gone under 38.5 pts + ast in 10 out of 13 games. Pritchard played in all of these games, but that is where Anfernee Simons comes in. \n\nIf you know ball, you know how good my guy was in Portland last year. Boston traded for him this year for his elite scoring capabilities. He hasn't really had the chance to show it off this year, since he comes off the bench, but boy did he last game, dropping 39 points. Simons has averaged about 24 minutes on 11 field goals attempted. In the last game, he played 34 minutes with 28 field goals attempted. For this game, he is in the starting lineup, and I see him getting a ton of looks and opportunities. The Hawks don't have the best defense, as they are a team that plays with more pace and focuses on offense. He is used to playing in high-paced games since Portland plays fast basketball as well. \n\nTo sum it up, I am banking on the fact that Simons is starting. I think he's getting an opportunity to show why he was brought to the Celtics. I think his usage will collide with Jaylen's tonight. Plus, with Jaylen already going under in the majority of games, I like the pick. This is kind of a double write-up as I am also taking Simons props, but for the sake of the thread, my POTD will be Jaylen’s under. \n\nAs always, good luck, fellas!🍀",

This is one of Chelsea's most strongest squads and with a new manager + playing at home this is the perfect start. Okay, if Chelsea was pounded by Arsenal I would not have taken this bet. They lost 2-3 though against arguably the best team at the moment. This is very good for the team morale.\n\nIve also read that there was a stat that Chelsea only won 1 game on the 1st game of a manager since Sarri left. This stat is skewed if we are looking at the games they had. So Chelsea won 1 out of 2 against mid table teams and in the game they won against a mid table team they had just a bit time for preperation like Liam Rosenior.\n\n4-0 (A) United w Lampard ❌️\n0-0 (H) Wolves w Tuchel, 3 days prior Lampard still in charge ❌️\n1-2 (A) Crystal Palace w Potter, had 1 game prior to this in the CL ✅️\n1-1 (H) Liverpool w Pochettino ❌️\n0-2 (H) City w Maresca ❌️\n\nAlthough Brentford are 6 games unbeaten, they are still one of the worst away teams being 15th and having a 3-0-7 record. And against these 6 teams none were top fixture games, all were mid/lower table teams.\n\nIn the H2H Chelsea are actually 3-4-3 but at Stamford Bridge Chelsea was on a 3 game losing steak until the most recent game where Chelsea dominated it heavily just scraping  2-1. At their stadium there was a winner in the last 9 games between the teams. \n\nNew manager + Home + Bad away team + Derby + No draws in last 9 meetings = W",

I like going with the Denver Broncos at home against the Buffalo Bills for a few reason. First off, this Denver defense is much better than the Buffalo defense as this Broncos rush defense ranks 2nd in the NFL in rushing yards allowed per game only allowing 91 yards on the ground to opponents per game which will be key to slowing down James Cook and in comparison this Bills rush defense is one of the worst in the league as they are ranked 28th in the NFL allowing over 135 rushing yards to opponents so I think RJ Harvey will have a strong showing in this one and I think Bo Nix will have success when he takes off and runs with the ball as well. The Broncos are also very well at keeping opponents out of the endzone as this Denver defense ranks 3rd in league in points allowed per game with only 18 points given up to opponents per game. Another reason I like going with the Broncos is because these Bills are getting thin at their wide receiver position with losing Gabe Davis and Tyrell Shavers in the wild card game due to injury. I think the Broncos keep this one a touchdown game at home in this one. I also like going with the San Francisco 49ers against the Seattle Seahawks as they split their two game regular game series with the 49ers winning the first contest 17-13 and the Seahawks taking the second one 13-3. I like how the 49ers rank higher than the Seahawks in overall offensive DVOA which they rank 2nd in the league in with 17.5% and 3rd in weighted offensive DVOA with 21.7%, 3rd offensive success rate with 48% and 6th in EPA per play. Also, Sam Darnold showed that he is prone to throwing interceptions in the regular season as he has the most interceptions thrown out of all of the quarterbacks in the playoffs so I wouldnt be suprised to see Darnold turn the ball over a time or two in this one. This wide receiving core for the 49ers is looking like its going to get some help as it looks like Ricky Pearsall will be good to go for this matchup so I see that helping out the 49ers out alot on offense. I dont see the 49ers losing this one by more than 2 touchdowns against Seattle.\n\nPrediction: 21-20 Bills, 26-19 49ers\n\nLast pick:🏀DePaul ML/Kansas ML💰Both teams got the job done we love a plus money POTD cash!!\n\nBest of luck to everyone tailing and remember to bet responsibly!

Today, I have my eyes on the two London teams, Tottenham and West Ham. Both clubs are performing quite poorly, and both managers are under heavy pressure from the fans due to bad results. This could lead to a very tough, duel-heavy match. In four of the last five meetings between these two teams, the number of cards went over this line, except for the most recent encounter.

Scraped it by the hair of the ball and we got our first push\n\nWriteup: Over 1.5 goals total goals in the first half just makes sense because PSV don’t like waiting around. They start games like they’re in a hurry, running fast, attacking a lot, and trying to score as soon as possible. Most games, they already have one goal early, and then they keep pushing for another. They don’t play slow or careful, they play like “let’s score now and worry later.”\n\nLately it’s been even crazier. In some recent games, there have already been more than three goals in the first half, not even just two. That shows how wild their starts can be. They come out flying, teams can’t handle the pressure, and goals just keep coming. When they score one early, they don’t relax, they smell blood and go for another right away.\n\nWhen they play Fortuna, it helps even more. Fortuna is okay at home, but when a really strong team comes, they usually get pushed back a lot. That means PSV is in their half all the time, shooting, crossing, and making chances. If PSV scores once, Fortuna has to come out a little, and that just makes it easier for PSV to score again because there’s more space.\n\nPSV has been winning a lot lately, and most of the time they don’t wait until the second half to do it. They like to finish the job early. Fortuna games also don’t stay boring in the first half, usually something happens, either they score or they get scored on. So it’s not the kind of game where everyone just stands around until halftime.",

They’re organized, disciplined, and rarely give teams easy looks. That said, Toluca brings an above-average attacking unit that, frankly, could easily compete in European football.\n\nI strongly see Toluca finding at least one goal in this matchup. Tigres’ home advantage is real, but it’s also priced into this line, which is why getting **Toluca 1 total goals at -130** stands out as value.\n\nIf Toluca scores first, this game can flip fast. They won’t be content sitting back, and their willingness to push forward gives this bet real upside.\n\nI’m trusting the attack to show up.\n\n!Vamos¡",

Again the Bills are on the road which is never easy this time of year. The broncos defense is among the most disruptive in the league and I think they’ll make it extremely hard for Josh to run the football. That limits Josh’s game and makes him dependent on his poor receiving core. Josh Allen would have to do unspeakable things in order for this team to win against the Broncos. Going a little lighter here with a 3u play because anything is possible with Allen. But he needs to be a hero in order for Buffalo to march out of Denver with a win.

Even with this, the number 27 in the world is without a doubt, the superior player between these two. She had a decent campaign in Brisbane, with two solid wins before losing to Pegula in 3 sets so that was a nice preparation for the Australian Open.\n\nRuse currently 79th in the world, got some wins in Adelaide but she usually struggles against players with raw firepower and that was seen against Kalinskaya in Adelaide and Kenin in Brisbane. We can argue that Yastremska is even more aggressive than these two and has evolved a lot as a player over the last 2 years.\n\nSince the start of 2024, Yastremska has a 6-2 record in 1st round matches at Grand Slam level, only losing at the US Open at this stage.

On the one hand, Walker is averaging almost 2 receptions per game all year. In the last 10 games, he's gone over this number 7/10 times. In the 2 games against the 49ers, hes had 3 and 4 receptions. So everything looks good from his end. \n\n\nNow on the 49ers side. They're giving up a whipping 5.9 receptions per game to running backs. Walker has 31 receptions to Charbonnet's 20 this year, so he should get the majority of those RB passes that the 49ers like to give up. \n\n\nFred Warner is out, Darnold is dinged up and might be more likely to throw some short check downs to his RB, so I just don't see any reasons why Walker would go below his average receptions (should be over) or why the 49ers would go below their average receptions conceded to running backs. \n\n\nWalker over 1.5 receptions. ",

I have ~10 matches I am interested in but this was the only one worthy of POTD. Especially at these odds \n\nFortuna Sittard are a tough home team. Scoring in 9/9 home games so far this season with a total of 16 goals in those 9 home games. \n\nThey look to be in decent form in their last matches including an impressive win vs AZ, 4-3. But in that game AZ managed an xG of 3.79 while Fortuna had an xG of 1.38. \n\nThis is where PSV comes in. They currently have an impeccable 9-0-0 away record with a 26-8 goal difference. Having BTTS in only 5/9 matches. \n\nEarlier this season PSV won 5-2 at home vs Fortuna. Exactly like I am predicting today. \n\nThe way I see this game going is that PSV will go up by 1 or more goals. Then they will give up chances, as they often do, on which Fortuna Sittard will capitalize. Not enough to win but to see both teams score. \n\nPSV have a huge game coming up in the CL against Newcastle away. They need to get a positive result there if they want to continue in the CL. \n\nThey have a 13 point lead in the league so that is currently less of a concern for them. \n\nI expect Fortuna to give up lots of chances like vs AZ. PSV will score a few goals and will then lose some intensity with the Newcastle game in the back of their heads \n\nThey will still win the game and Fortuna gets to score a goal and keep their streak of always scoring at home alive whilst PSV still take the 3 points home. \n\nBack to green, last 5 days have been pretty decent. Let's keep it up. \n\nFade or tail, BOL!",

Surprisingly the 2 wins were on back to back. However context matters here they are playing the second best defence in the League, the pistons. So being tired and playing against elite defence from the first and second string is a nightmare. Furthermore Cade Cunningham played horrible, but it was his first game back and he was definitely rusty missing a lot of crucial free throws in the last 2 minutes. Because of this and the DOG mentality, I expect these boys to destroy this Pacers team, but I think -12.5 and some books have moved it to -13.5 is a bit too much. \n\nWizards are on a back to back playing against the Nuggets. First off I like back to backs to the nuggets because of the altitude, also Murray, Gordon and Bruce are probable. This is important as Murray and Bruce are the main ball handlers and Gordon will be vital to destroying the paint and crashing boards. Believe it or not and I could be wrong here the main players being injured are actually good. A lot of these nuggets players can ball, but there are simply no opportunities to play due to the roster being established. I say this because for these guys this is life or death, it's their only opportunity to say I deserve minutes or I can fit this team or a different team. This can be seen with a lot of players. Jalen Pickett went from 4.5 PPG January  to 11.6 PPG in December. Currently this is an important time for bench players to start showing up. If you think what I said was a stretch, the win record currently is quite impressive. Beat the Raptors and beat the 76ers without Murray and the starters on the road. In their last three games they have beaten the Bucks at home against a healthy Bucks squad and Pelicans and Dallas on the road.",

Today I'm taking a prop that I'm very confident in and have been milking a lot lately, due to having Cairns' playstyle down packed. Andrews' assisting has been pivotal recently and has contributed to Cairns winning their last two. He is the primary ball handler and has been demanding the ball after every defensive rebound, as he wants to take the ball over half court into the offense. Statistically, he is over this line in his last 10/12 with McVeigh in the side, with two of those games in that period being against NZ where he recorded 9 AST twice. He has also recorded a season high 13 AST in his last two games, and had 6 AST in the 1Q alone last game. The current line for me is o8.5 (+125), but am choosing to play safer even though he'd still be over in his last 7/12 and 5/7 with McVeigh. This isn't going to stop me laddering him to 12 AST though.

      "text": "POTD Record: 211-161\n\nUnits Won: +105.18u\n\nLast Pick:VSM U 14.5 Kills Map 2 (-128)✅\n\nTodays Pick: **VSM U 15.5 Kills Map 1 (-122)** 5u\n\nTeams: paiN vs. HEROIC  \nTime: 6:00 AM EST.\n\n**Writeup:**\n\n* Yesterday's POTD went completely as expected in some ways, and completely unexpected in others. For starters, I thought paiN had no chance to win a blowout series 2-0, and I thought they were gonna struggle and drop their opening match, they proceeded to dominate 2-0, this team looks very legit. On the positive they did listen to me about piriajr and putting him in star roles as well as VSM also missing his line despite the map win.\n* I loved this pick at 14.5, and now because of the odds he is a kill higher and at an even better price. As expected VSM played more supportive roles yesterday, he struggled and was the lowest rated paiN player in the entire series despite the 2-0 win, and farming some stats at the end against pistols. He averaged a .58 KPR in a 2-0 win which is extremely low, this was as expected a massive drop from his .80 KPR, obviously a small sample but most people with a .58 KPR are being set at 12.5-13 kills for a map.\n* paiN pick map 1, this should be a no brainer Nuke pick as their map pick, it is their best map by far, they picked it today and dominated, I'd be shocked if we saw them pick anything other then Nuke. As stated VSM worst map in tier two as a pro was Nuke, where in 2025 he saw a -.10 KPR dip across the year from his normal average which is a significant drop. He also will start on T side which was his far worse side today. VSM actually ended up doing better on Nuke with a .71 KPR, but I can't stress enough that a lot of this was empty calorie stat padding at the end against pistols, paiN won the first half 9-3 and VSM had 6 kills, he got 6 kills in the next 3 rounds against pistols to inflate his numbers but overall not expecting this to continue\n* While we didn't get to see a lot of paiN CT defense, we did see what spots they put their new players in VSM and piairjr and it was about what was expected. Piairjr is playing as the star rifler on inner site, while VSM is playing ramp anchor, ramp anchor is by far the lowest rated position on CT side of Nuke, and is one of the lowest rated CT spots to play in CS2 in general, which is part of the reason why I love this pick so much\n* This pick feels like it has a lot of ways to cover, with VSM struggling on T side early and joining a new system + the worst spot on CT side, there are many various scenarios this line is just well too high, blowouts especially which I could easily see paiN repeating. This line is just 2-3 kills too high at minimum, one of my favorite plays of the year and would be shocked if VSM hit this without an overtime or some aces against pistols\n\nBest of Luck!",

It started off with Sean McVay finding out that Kyren Williams was the most bet prop of the weekend, then feeding his backup RB in Blake Corum who continued to get stuffed & averaged less yards per carry. Then the Bills HC Sean McDermott lied to us saying Dalton Kincaid was healthy & proceeded to only play him 28 snaps. Kincaid was in a walking boot after the game… after he was coming off a KNEE injury. Then the cherry on top was Aaron Rodgers putting up a historical game vs the Texans, ranking 283rd out of 283 QB’s in dropback success rate (21.2%) & EPA per dropback (-.76) amount QB’s who had 20+ pass attempts in a playoff game since 2013. But there was a positive from the horrible weekend… I had a ton of playoff film I was able to use. And boy did I use it. I’ve spent the entire week watching film on the 8 teams playing this weekend, as well as the CFB National Championship teams playing Monday night. Let’s go streaking. \n\nFor in the first time in NFL history, 2 teams are meeting in the postseason after facing each other in Week 1 & Week 18 in the same season. The 6 seed San Francisco 49ers head north to face the 1 seed Seattle Seahawks at Lumen Field on Saturday night in the NFC West Divisional Round matchup. The 49ers kicked off their season with a 17-13 win in Seattle, while the Seahawks finished their season with a 13-3 win in San Francisco to secure the top seed. __San Francisco will play on just 5 days rest compared to Seattle's 13. That is majorly significant as the 49ers have been plagued with injuries (49ers practice right next to a power substation… google it). They are now without stars TE George Kittle, LB Fred Warner, DE Nick Bosa, DE Mykel Williams, LB Nick Martin & several others that are banged up. They are now down to their 5th, 6th & 7th LB's.__ Who does that benefit the most? The Seahawks run game.\n\nThe 49ers defense is in complete disarray. At LB they are starting Garrett Wallow, a special teamer that was cut by the Broncos. Eric Kendricks, who was out of a job as of 4 weeks ago. Nick Bosa, one of the best DE’s in the league being out for the season is an obvious crushing blow, as well as LB Fred Warner being ruled out. But one of the biggest injuries has been Rookie 1st rounder, DE Mykel Williams. __With Mykel Williams on the field the 49ers allowed 3.99 yards per carry allowed & a 45.2% success rate. Without Mykel Williams, the 49ers are last in success rate against RB runs (49.4%), allowing 5.0 yards per carry (29th) & a run of 10+ yards on 11.3% of those attempts (23rd). They have allowed a first down or TD on 28% of those runs (31st). From Week 12 through the Wild Card Wound, San Francisco is LAST in run success rate allowed, 30th in explosive run rate allowed, & 27th in yards before contact allowed.__ But the numbers get even worse when it comes to the Seahawks play style. The Seahawks primarily run zone concept run schemes. They rank top 10 in the league in run zone usage. The 49ers have been destroyed by outside zone runs this season, especially in the background half of the year. __Since Week 9 & without Mykel Williams, the 49ers have allowed a league high 5.4 yards per carry & the highest success rate to outside zone.__ The 49ers had no answer for it vs the Seahawks in Week 18. Seattle ran 15 outside zone runs, averaging 5.4 yards per carry. Seahawks RB Kenneth Walker is the one of the best outside zone RB’s in the league. Walker had 16 carries for 97 yards vs the 49ers. __Walker had the 2nd highest explosive rate in outside zones in the NFL (12.3%). The 49ers are last in the NFL in explosive run rate allowed vs outside zone runs since Week 9 (9.7%). 38% of Walker’s runs are outside zone. 18% of those went for 10+ yards. The last time he played the Niners we saw him have rushes of 19 & 20 yards & he averaged 6.1 YPC on 16 rushes.__ Seattle has one of the best Offensive Line’s in the league that have dominated opposing DLine’s on outside runs, especially vs San Fran. They allowed Seattle’s RB’s to gain 50 yards before contact on outside zone runs alone. Seattle finished with 112 rush yards before contact, their most in a game since 2022 Week 18 when they had 131 against the Rams. They averaged 3.6 yards before contact each run. Giving Kenneth Walker yards BEFORE contact is a horrible recipe for disaster as he’s one of the best RN’s in the league in gaining yards AFTER contact. __Walker had the 2nd most missed tackles forced per run (0.28) this season behind only Bijan Robinson (0.3). Walker ranked 2nd in the NFL in tackles avoided per carry (27.6%). He finished the season with 18 breakaway runs (runs of 15+ yards). Only 2 RBs had more: De’Von Achane (24) & Derrick Henry (21). Among them, Walker has the highest missed tackle % & second lowest stuffed run rate. Walker was 5th in Explosive Run Rate in (9.95%).__ San Francisco also struggled with Seattle using motion on runs this season. Since week 11, the 49ers rank 27th in EPA allowed per designed runs that use motion. In Week 18 Seattle used motion on 20 of their 32 designed runs generating 0.06 EPA/run. Runs without motion only went for -0.05 EPA/run. Seahawks OT Abraham Lucas has been destroying DL on outside runs, & adding a tight end in motion to help block makes the run game even stronger. Their 2nd level blocking is incredible. LB’s have nowhere to go & they get squared up & destroyed. With the 49ers having a depleted LB core it only adds more value to Walker.\n\nThe Seahawks game plan is to maintain possession & keep Darnold from making mistakes. They completely shifted their strategy halfway through the season. Through the opening 11 games of the season, Darnold led the NFL with 9.3 yards per pass, averaging 9.0 air yards per pass (2nd) with 14.8% of his passes going 20+ yards (4th). Since then those numbers have dropped to 7.1 yards per pass (16th), 5.9 air yards per pass (30th) & a league low 5% of his passes going 20+ yards. He threw 27.4% of his passes 10+ yards over that stretch (27th) after a 39.3% rate before (2nd). It has worked well as the run game has finally gotten going & Darnold’s INT rate dropped to 2.2% (16th), down from 3.4% (31st). Against San Fran in Week 1, Darnold averaged 8.6 air yards per pass with a 13% deep target rate. In Week 18, he averaged 4.8 air yards per pass with a 3.8% deep throw rate. Seattle’s RB’s went from 22 carries in Week 1, to 33 in Week 18. They’re going to pound the ball down their throats & Walker is going to break free on a few runs. \n\nWalker is going to run all over this depleted defense.\n\n__Kenneth Walker o54.5 rushing yards__\n\nAppreciate the love!

Overall, I'm quite happy with my start to 2026, as I'm currently 7-2 (+3.86 units) in the new year. Now, I'll look to carry that form over to the Australian Open. Before someone says that this pick \"should go in tomorrow's thread,\" please note that Australian events can put POTD cappers in a tough predicament. The estimated start time for this match IS actually on Saturday in EST (Sunday Australia), and if I were to post it in the Sunday thread, people would only have a few hours to tail. Let me know what you all prefer, but I want to try to take advantage of the fact that daily schedules for Slams are available a day in advance. \n\nSebastian Korda enters the Australian Open in decent form, as he managed to stay healthy throughout the last few months of an injury-riddled 2025 and defeat Valentin Vacherot and Jiri Lehecka in Adelaide. Some people will make a big deal of him losing to a returning Kokkinakis in Adelaide, but Korda actually had a 7.92/10 performance rating in that match. Korda has a solid career record here in Melbourne, having never lost in the first round and made a QF in 2023. The American is one of the cleanest ballstrikers on tour, and it seems unlikely that the weather will disrupt his rhythm. The signature Australian heat isn't expected to arrive until next week, and rain and strong winds are also looking unlikely. Korda's main object in a best-of-5 tournament is always going to be his body, as he has been known to break down in long matches, but he's honestly looked okay this year, and I'm willing to take a shot given the level difference here.\n\nOn paper, Michael Zheng, last year's NCAA champion, seems like someone who could be primed for an upset. He made waves on the Challenger Tour last year, and looked decent in qualifying here, though he had to win back-to-back 2+ hour matches to do it. However, I also don't feel like Zheng really does anything better than Korda, which makes it tough for me to see how that upset could actually materialize. Similar to Sebi, Zheng is a solid baseliner who rarely breaks down, but he doesn't serve as effectively and just doesn't hit the ball quite as big off either wing. And as much as you can make a case for being concerned about Korda's long-match prospects, this will be Zheng's first time playing best-of-5 tennis. In fact, this will be Zheng's first time facing a top-100 player, and there's just a certain difference in weight of shot and experience that takes a bit of getting used to. Don't get me wrong: Zheng has practiced with top guys, and the Challenger Tour is filled with amazing prospects who will eventually crack that barrier, but expecting him to jump in and take one down on a show court feels premature. This isn't projected to be a serve-dominated battle, and so I would expect Korda to cover the handicap if he wins in four or fewer sets. Even in a five set battle, one lopsided set could be enough. -5.5 is also an option (I would take around +100).",

Everything went about as expected and honestly the game could have easily been 4-4 or even 5-5 with the misses chances. \n\nPremier League is back after a week off and we're revisiting a past play from a few weeks ago where we cashed a big +185. Odds are a bit lower here, but I like it all the same. After his 6 game goalscoring streak and winning Premier League player of December, DCL rested most of one match and then finally came back to Earth and failed to score in the next. But I really like him in this spot as he's coming off a match with another goal last weekend in their 4-3 loss at Newcastle, and he's well rested after not playing at all mid week in the FA Cup match. \n\nDCL has scored 8 goals in his last 9 matches. To reiterate some stats from my last play, what makes this so impressive is that he's scoring against top EPL teams and top EPL defenses, not bottom tier leaky defenses. He netted against Chelsea, Liverpool, Man City, and Palace in this stretch. Leeds have also found themselves in some shootouts recently, having scored 11 goals in their last 4 home matches (DCL scoring in 3 of those 4). They've been continuing to play in fast paced, high scoring games which helps us here as well.\n\nLets talk Fulham. Fulham play much better at home than they do away. They have only kept one clean sheet on the road this season (vs West Ham). They are a middly of the pack defensive team, but are bottom 5 on the road. 19 of their 28 goals conceded this season have been in their travels, an average of 1.8 goals conceded per away game (pretty much 2 if you exclude West Ham). \n\nAll signs point towards goals in this one and I'm backing Calvert Lewin to be one of the ones that find the back of the net. BOL as always and I hope you all have a great weekend!",

Ricky Pearsall is still dealing with injury concerns, and I like this bet whether he plays or not. Robinson’s snaps have increased with Pearsall limited or out — in Week 18 he logged his highest offensive snap share of the season (88%) filling in for Pearsall.\n\nIn his last three games, Robinson has seen 11 catchable targets and is averaging 9.20 yards per target. Over his last five games, he’s averaging 14.2 yards per reception and has recorded a 22+ yard catch in four of those five games.\n\nRobinson also profiles as a downfield option. He owns a 13.5 average depth of target, leading all active 49ers wide receivers. Over the last three games, he’s tied with Jake Tonges and Jauan Jennings in target share, and last week he led the team with a 38.89% first-read target share (Jennings/CMC at 16.67%).\n\nHe’s cashed the over 24.5 receiving yards in three of his last five games and appears to have built real rapport with Brock Purdy, asserting himself as a reliable and trusted option in the passing attack.

      "text": "**Record:** 38-18-1 (+20.32u) | L5: 4-1 (4W)\n\n**Last:** (CBB) Kansas -6.5 (1.5u) - ✅\n\n**POTD:** (CBB) Michigan State (-3.5) at Washington \n\n**Start Time:** 6:00 PM ET (BTN)\n\n**Odds:** -110 (DraftKings)\n\n**Units:** 1.5U\n\n**Reasoning:** There’s disrespect, then there’s making Michigan State just a -3.5-point favorite over Washington.\n\nYes, the Spartans (15-2) have only played two true-road games on the year. Sure, the team previously saw a 13-game win streak snapped by going 0-2 during a West Coast road trip last season. I know it, now you know it, and you can bet your damn ass that head coach Tom Izzo knows it. And if there’s one thing we can count on, it’s Izzo making all the necessary adjustments before Saturday’s contest. \n\nIt certainly helps that the Michigan State defense has taken up the mantle of road warriors. \n\nThrough 17 games, the unit finds itself among the nation’s elite, ranking 7th in opponent field-goal percentage (38.6%), 11th in scoring defense (64.2 PPGA), 13th in defensive efficiency (0.921) and 48th in opponent three-point shooting (30.4%). Believe it or not, the Spartans have taken that defensive intensity to an even higher level as of late, conceding just 58.7 points on a meager 36.2% shooting over their last four outings. But even more impressive is the fact that over the team’s four contests away from home, the defense ranks 2nd in scoring defense (63.3 PPGA), 2nd in defensive efficiency (0.906), 4th in opponent field-goal percentage (37.5%) and 61st in opponent three-point shooting (30.8%). That should make points difficult to come by for the Huskies (10-7), who enter this matchup ranking 75th in scoring (81.1 PPG), 81st in offensive efficiency (1.113), 154th in field-goal percentage (45.0%) and 269th in three-point shooting (31.5%). \n\nConversely, while the Michigan State offense might not wow you statistically, don’t make the mistake of underestimating the unit. \n\nThus far, the team ranks 61st in offensive efficiency (1.133), 85th in field-goal percentage (46.7%), 92nd in three-point shooting (35.5%) and 105th in scoring (79.0 PPG). And although the Spartans typically prefer to rely on their defense, the team’s offense has proven it can score in bunches when necessary. Just last time out against Indiana, Michigan State used a 20-0 run to break a 53-53 tie with just a little over 10 minutes to go to put the game out of reach. In the outing before that, the team put together a 48-point second half outburst to overcome an eight-point deficit against Northwestern. Fortunately, things should come a little easier against a reeling Washington defense that ranks 92nd in opponent three-point shooting (31.7%), 99th in defensive efficiency (1.011), 106th in opponent field-goal percentage (42.9%) and 148th in scoring defense (73.6).\n\nLook for rebounding to be the X factor on Saturday.\n\nNight in and night out, the Spartans have made a living dominating the glass. The team ranks 9th in defensive rebounding (27.3 per game), 9th in total rebounding (42.4) and 12th in offensive rebounding (12.2) while ranking 2nd in opponent total rebounds per game (28.4), 4th in opponent offensive rebounding (6.4) and 12th in opponent defensive rebounding (18.9). Although the Huskies hold their own in terms of their own rebounding—41st in offensive rebounding (11.2), 43rd in total rebounding (38.8) and 62nd in defensive rebounding (24.7)—the team has struggled to limit the opposition’s success on the glass, ranking just 108th in opponent total rebounding (33.9), 123rd in opponent defensive rebounding (21.7) and 187th in opponent offensive rebounding (9.1). \n\nWith the Seattle Seahawks hosting an NFL playoff game just two hours after tip-off, don’t expect home-court advantage to play much of a factor in this one. Trust Sparty to handle business comfortably. \n\nBOL if tailing, and as always, please do so respectfully. One bet should not have you crashing out all over Reddit.",

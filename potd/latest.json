Last game Raphael carried the ball 33 times and still managed to grab 5 receptions in the process.\n\nCal play a levelled offensive style, and give a lot of different looks - in a bowl setting I like Kendrick’s availability and consistency to get us our first over unit win.\n\nLast play review:\n\nELC: Arsenal - Crystal Palace, WDW Arsenal & o1.5 (-120) 1u ❌\n\n(Weird one, Arsenal dominated the match in large stretches, but it just simply wasn’t to be - own goal late, injury time equalizer, just an all around miss that was closer than it appeared on paper)\n\nBOL if you’re tailing, and if not BOL in general!",

A few key stats: (1) in its last two games, Sudan was able to only offer four shots on target (in total) against arguably lesser opponents (Bahrain and Iraq) than Algeria and (2) since the beginning of September, Sudan has only scored twice in nine games. I see Sudan having a tough time holding onto possession, limiting its opportunities to score a goal. \n\nBest of luck!",

This game starts at 10 AM ET. Now, I know nothing personally about either of these national teams. Sudan is pretty bad. They have not scored a single goal in their last 5 matches. Algeria have won their past 4 matches. Algeria has Mahrez, who is old but still good. Zidane's kid is their goalie, he plays in the Spanish second tier. Algeria is a strong side, they also have a player called Baghdad Bounedjah, who has contributed almost the same amount of goals to the team as Mahrez. Sudan has conceded at least one goal in 6 of their last 7 matches. Algeria has players who are experienced and generally much higher quality than what Sudan has to offer. They should score once or twice here. Would be very surprised looking at the match history and just generally considering how these matches go between quality sides and lower quality sides in these international tournaments if Algeria can't outscore this Sudan side. \n\nWho is Mohamed Amoura? I had no idea before going into this writeup, but apparently he's good. He plays for Wolfsburg, a respectable side in the German league. He scored 10 times for Algeria in World Cup qualifying. His attacking partners Mahrez and Bounedjah are older, Amoura is 25. He is clearly the top attacker of a team that should dominate the game. He will absolutely be going for goals here against a weak Sudan team.\n\nOnly 1u because I don't know any of this stuff personally, but this seems like a good pick by the numbers.

Really tough to predict these lineups and which teams will show up. Sorry friends, bad game to play. \n\nNot a ton of soccer on for Xmas Eve. I recommend taking it easy with your units and enjoying watching the games and spending time with family with your beverage of choice.\n\nThat said, while I do not watch a ton of Africa football, one of my favorite players is playing today in Mbuemo and I'm seeing good value in him today. Both of these teams are mixed bags. Cameroon does not have a ton of big names outside of our guy, but with their main striker out Mbuemo will be the most dangerous attacking threat, likely penalty taker, and the conduit for most of Cameron's offense. Gabon tends to either concede 4 goals or concede 0 goals, there is not much in between. \n\nTo clarify my pick, this is a push if he only gets 1 SOT, and a cash at 2+ SOT. I like him for 2 SOTs and my original pick was ATGS (+255), but those fall outside of the allowable POTD limits. If your book does not offer over 1, you are essentially splitting into two bets. Say your units are 100 for easy math, right now on DK that means 64 goes on 1+ SOT and 36 goes on 2+ SOT. The goal is to place your 1+ SOT bet to break even. \n\nBOL and hope everyone has a Merry Christmas!",

Algeria should cruise to a victory here. The better and more well balanced team in this matchup, plus the team in good form. Sudan is just not as developed as Algeria when it comes to any aspect of soccer. I knew I was going to play Algeria in some way, but the money line was a bit chalky so I decided to just group in the over 1.5, which I believe should be an easy mark for Algeria to hit. This is a pretty simple bet.\n\nOverall: Again, every bet I place will be to win 1u. This is for transparency reasons. Remember, bankroll management is key. Betting to win 5u usually means that someone has a small unit size in comparison to their bankroll, or that they should just increase their unit size in general. Everything should be played with the ability to lose. If you need a bet to win or else you lose a large chunk of your money, you probably have a unit size that oversized. Be smart with it.\n\nBet responsibly.",

But make no mistake, Equatorial Guinea aren’t just stubborn defensively - they’ve consistently made **AFCON group stages difficult for favourites**, going unbeaten in a number of crucial group games historically and even **scoring in five consecutive AFCON group matches** in past tournaments, thus proving they can absolutely be menacing in the final third. **Emilio Nsue** remains a **danger going forward**, he's very capable of producing decisive moments out of thin air, while midfielder **Omar Mascarell’s** presence adds **experience and composure in transition.** Initially, I was tempted to go with the 2.5 goals Under, but seeing how Burkina Faso managed to be involved in a few high-scoring games leading up to this meeting, I've decided to just back Equatorial Guinea. I don't mind taking the 2.5 Under line, and you could definitely use it to spice up the odds even further (or perhaps take 3.5 for extra padding), I just haven't picked it as my POTD. I'm very confident with this one so I'm going in with 4.5 units. We don't need dominance here, just discipline, and I believe Equatorial Guinea has enough quality to hold Burkina Faso to a draw, or even take all three points in what is going to be a tightly contested affair.

Doesn’t get any more sweaty than that but those wins always feel the best and hopefully we’ll start gaining more momentum heading into the new year as the recent form has been slightly better (it’s still not great).\n\nIt’s Christmas Eve and you know what Santa promised me this year? A win on the POTD reddit thread. Really let loose with my demand this year. Could the Christmas spirit get me two wins a row, let’s find out. Yes, we will be frantically watching some Chinese second division women’s volleyball on this day much to the family’s worry and I’ll just pretend like I actually support these teams (spoiler: it won’t work). Anyways this line is simply too low for this match in my opinion. We’re only 3 games into the season and Shanghai have the chance to go top of the division with a win here. Meanwhile, Liaoning are bottom with three losses to start the season off. Not off to the best start but 123.5 is very low for volleyball and the stats back it up. Lianoning didn’t have a great season last year either with a 7th place finish (out of 8), Shanghai were 2nd so the stats do reflect last year’s dynamic. Shanghai have cleared the line in 8 of their last 9 home matches (89%) and with an expectation of them winning, 17 of their last 18 home wins (94%). Liaoning meanwhile have covered the over in their last 10/10 away league matches and their last 27/27 total matches. With regards to H2H Shanghai have surprisingly really struggled against Liaoning losing their last three against the side and their matches have gone over in 13/14 of these fixtures in Shanghai’s back yard and 26/27 total fixtures which is great for the play. I would kind of take it with a pinch of salt considering these stats go back to 2014 plus I focus less on head to head due to numerous factors but it does show a trend. I am slightly more bullish on this one compared to yesterday’s pick simply because this is a case of top playing bottom but regardless no matter what way I see it the line is just too low here and I look to find an edge. Despite Liaoning’s bad form they hit the over against current leaders Shandong this season.

They tend to approach games with confidence and structure, managing tempo effectively and limiting opponents’ opportunities, while Equatorial Guinea have struggled to assert themselves, especially on the road. Burkina Faso’s ability to stay compact defensively and capitalise on key moments gives them the edge in what should be a disciplined and controlled performance. With momentum on their side and a clear difference in overall sharpness and composure, Burkina Faso are well positioned to take all three points.\n\nEdit: Added image of SOR, Weighted Form and FDR.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/5WAidsZ",

California at Hawaii , 8 pm ET 12/24/25\n\nRecord: 8-9\nNet Units: -3.97 Units\n\nExplanation: I think Cal can beat Hawaii tomorrow because Cal has been throwing the ball efficiently and creating a decent amount of negative plays on defense. \n\n Hawaii’s offense seems one dimensional to me.  Cal is a pass first team and their QB Sagapolutele has been having a great season with 3000+ passing yards. I don’t see Hawaii’s defense being able to consistently put pressure on Cal’s passing game.",

Even without VanVleet, Houston still have enough ball-handling and pace through **Amen Thompson**, while **Sengun** remains the offensive hub and a major mismatch inside.\n\nThe Clippers, on the other hand, are extremely short-handed. **Chris Paul and Zubac are out**, which leaves them thin in playmaking and interior defense. That puts a lot of responsibility on **Harden and Kawhi**, both of whom are being asked to carry heavy minutes on a struggling team with little margin for error.\n\nWithout Zubac, the Clippers have no reliable answer for Sengun in the paint, and Houston’s ability to score inside should force help defense and open up secondary scoring. Defensively, the Rockets are physical and disciplined enough to limit easy looks and force the Clippers into tough half-court possessions.\n\nGiven the gap in depth, interior matchup and current team trajectories, this sets up as a game where Houston can control the pace and gradually pull away. **-7,5 is a fair number and still offers value** in this spot.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/isg16qm9n19g1.png?width=932&format=png&auto=webp&s=a0252f012eea9db9675ef5de891ea70dc2c4ca9f",

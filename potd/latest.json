Their strength of schedule so far has been very weak. Their only impressive win was beating the bills earlier this season. Browns have a legit defense and are on a bit of a roll. I think the Browns at the very minimum keep this game close.",

Love is facing the 2nd worst pass defense in the NFL. For the other leg, going with the rushing yards leader, Jonathon Taylor. Taylor is up against the 29th ranked rush defense today and he has hit 80+ rushing yards in 72% of his games last season and 4/7 this year. Taylor is 2/2 on the over vs the Titans H2H in the past two seasons. With that being said… \n\n👇\n\nTake Jordan Love 175+ passing yards and Jonathan Taylor 80+ rushing yards today!",

From a extremely weak performance by the Vikings, to a AC Milan squad drawing at home against a recently promoted Pisa squad, to Elversberg going their first match of the season without scoring; it’s just been off.\n\nApologies to any of you who tailed.\n\nOn to the next💰\n\nSunday’s Pick\n\nNFL\n\nTampa Bay Bucs @ New Orleans Saints (3:06 PM CT) & Dallas Cowboys @ Denver Broncos (3:26 PM CT)\n\n2 Leg Parlay // Cade Otton 4+ Receptions & Jake Ferguson 4+ Receptions\n\n(-119 on Fanduel) - 5 units to win 4.2u\n\nI tried to get cheeky with it and paid the price. Nothing else to say except that it was a poor pick. My original 2-Leg NCAAF selection for saturday ended up hitting (albeit very sweaty), but I decided to try something new with it and missed. \n\nAll we can do is look ahead and keep doing our best. October 26th is a very special holiday in the NFL this Sunday. National Tight End Day is officially upon us. \n\nI am not going to go with a super long write up here because it seems that my more in depth analysis over the last few days hasn’t been to any benefit. The first leg I am going with is Cade Otton 4+ Receptions. The Buccaneers played like dog shit last week against the Lions and I believe they are ready to rebound against a much more manageable opponent in the New Orleans Saints. With Mike Evans early game injury, Cate Otton ended up with 7 recs for 65 yards. After a very slow start to the season hauling in 3 receptions in the first 3 games, Otton has reemerged in the last 4 games with 19 receptions. With Baker Mayfield missing a lot of throws last week, I would expect the Bucs to get Otton involved early with some shorter routes. Another key factor is that on national tight ends day last year, Otton recorded his highest number of receptions for the season (9 recs on 10 targets). Baker seems like the kinda QB to get Otton active for National Tight End Day.\n\nThe second leg I am going with is ol’ reliable Jake Ferguson 4+ Receptions. There has been a lot said about the Broncos defense this year but their season stats are slightly skewed. They beat the Titans at home in week 1, during Cam Ward’s first NFL game. They won that game by 8. Against the Titans. Then went on the road and lost to the Colts and Chargers, giving up 29 and 23 points respectively. Then they beat the Jake Browning led Bengals 28-3. Yeah Browning is bad. A crazy 4th quarter comeback (and absolute folding by the Eagles) was a key away win, where they only won by 4. They then beat the Jets by 2 and the Giants by 1. So they have beat the 2 rookie QBs (Ward, Dart), needed two massive 4th quarter comebacks (Eagles, Giants), beat Jake Browning and Justin Fields. I’m not sold.\n\nThe Cowboys offense has continued to look great and they are extremely well balanced with Ceedee and Pickens gelling well together. Javonte Williams has become a crucial component balancing this offense, and Ferguson has continued to be Dak’s safety blanket. The Broncos will be without their best linebacker in Dre Greenlaw so I’m expecting Ferg to be able to find even more room to operate. Let’s celebrate National Tight End Day and get back on track with a win here!\n\nI generally spend a couple hours a day combing through as much action as possible from across the world, in order to find value. I do have my own bankroll behind all my picks, but if you are feeling generous, any tips will just go towards enjoying a cold, 22 oz lager at the bar down the street (they're only $4.50 each during happy hour).\n\n[Sponsor a cold, 22 oz 🍺](https://buymeacoffee.com/ceaselessaction)",

According to game previews, this is a key bounce-back spot before their bye week.  \n\n- The New Orleans Saints are very much in “rebuild mode” at 1–6, with  Spencer Rattler holding a career record of 1-12 as a starter. ONE win. TWELVE losses. \n  \n- While the Saints have earned some praise for being “competitive” this season, the reality is their foundation is shaky—offensive line issues, young QB, limited depth—which suggests they’ll struggle to cover these seemingly generous spreads.\n\n- Head-to-head history also leans the Bucs’ way: Tampa has won five of the last six meetings, showing they match up well.\n————————————\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS: -3.5 feels like free money. -4.5 feels very generous. I think the Saints get routed, have a fire sale before the trade deadline to dump the older guys, and go maximum rebuild. \n\nBOL!\n\n☕️: https://buymeacoffee.com/pickwizard",

His lone misses have been against good run defenses (49ers last week 85.71 YPG allowed and Bucs week 1 78.43 YPG allowed). The dolphins are a far cry from that, allowing about 50 more yards per game. Bijan should run wild on them and hit 70 at least. Quinshon Judkins just scored 3 TDs vs the Dolphins last week. Robinson has scored in 4/6 games this season and should get at least one against this abysmal defense. The falcons are favored, so the game script should be favorable for getting carries, yards, and TD opportunities.\n\nMichael Penix Jr is unlikely to play, so Kirk Cousins will start. Teams generally rely more on their bell cow RBs when the starting QB is out, so it may help the bet a bit, but probably won’t impact it too much. Either way, I think Bijan will have a field day against this awful run defense.",

Twente at home have been consistent going forward all season — they average around 1.75 expected goals per match and play with width, fast overlaps, and a front line that moves the ball quickly through the half-spaces. They’ve scored in every home game so far.\n\nAjax are still what they’ve been all year: chaotic, entertaining, and fragile at the back. Their matches average 3.6 total goals, and they’ve hit Over 2.5 in 8 of their last 10. Defensively they remain inconsistent — their back four has changed multiple times in recent weeks.\n\nTwente also like to push numbers forward early, which fits perfectly against Ajax’s high line. Both sides rank top-4 in xG per 90 in the Eredivisie, and neither keeps many clean sheets.\n\nI’d price this total closer to 1.60, so with 1.67 still available it’s enough for me to get involved.

Holiday, Porzingis & Tatum are gone. So I have been looking for value on his lines, and think I’ve got one in a niche market. Now, this is not free throws attempted (FTA), but FTM - both markets lines are 1.5, just the odds of FTA are $1.57, a lot less than the $1.83 for the FTM, and he is a career 85% FT shooter. 26 cents on the dollar for that level of accuracy just shouts value to me - we’re going to have a higher chance of long-term profit by betting the FTM market. He’s currently in good FT shooting form, shooting 16/17 this season including pre-season, and covering this line in 4 of the 5 games. \n\nThe other factor that made me look here is the Pistons FT conceded. After giving up 32 to the Bulls, they went one better & gave up 48 to the Rockets!! 48! Only 2 out of 14 players across those 2 games with 10+ shots (in Pritchard territory of ball handling & shooting) have not shot 2+ FT. Between Cunningham, Duren, Holland, Thompson, Stewart, Robinson - they have a half dozen players who can put the Celtics in the bonus early in quarters, can swipe on an arm when in the paint, and they’re all in-your-face defenders so we’re a chance again at playing the hand tap rule on 3 point opportunities. \n\nThe other side of this bet is that it only takes 1 miss for him on 1 set of FT’s without returning to the line, and he still retains his career average due to a much larger sample size (volatility always an issue with these sorts of markets). He’s not as an aggressive a player as a Brown or White can be, so that may also hurt his chances as they could draw the fouls.",

This might be my favorite total on the board. I think this game has sneaky Cam Ward potential written all over it. I like the over.\n\nThe Colts are a machine right now. You feel like they’re good for thirty points every week. The total’s 46.5, and I really like it. What would it take to cash it? A 31–17 final? That’s right in line with the 14.5-point spread — and I’m not laying two touchdowns in the NFL.\n\nCould the Colts hang forty if they’re locked in? If Cam Ward tosses a pick-six? Yeah, it’s all sitting there for you. Jonathan Taylor’s good for a thirty-yard house call at any moment.\n\nAnd Tennessee? They were grotesque last week against the Raiders. But a nothing-to-lose attitude can cut both ways — you might get points by risk or by blunder. Any time the Titans are in the mix, there’s a chance you end up wearing the poop-emoji sticker on your forehead.\n\nCould it be 31–3 Colts and you’re sitting there going, “How the hell did we do that?” Absolutely.

Bit of a sweat, having to wait up until the 90th minute for West Ham to finally squeeze one through for us.*\n\n\n- I didn't post a pick yesterday as I didnt have full confidence in any of my picks.\n\n\n**Todays Pick:** Leverkusen - Freiburg **Over 2.5 Goals**\n\n\n**Odds:** $1.80\n\n\n**Wager:** 1 unit \n\n\n**When:** 6 hours from post\n\n\n**Why:**\n\n\nLeverkusen vs Freiburg has the vibe that there should be plenty of goals. Leverkusen score with ease right now, but they play like defense is optional, and to be fair, thats probably true, as they win games by outscoring their opponents. Freiburg aren’t exactly parking the bus either tho they usually find a way to grab a goal, or a couple, even if they end up losing. Between Leverkusen’s attack flying and Freiburg’s tendency to get involved in end to end games, it’s hard to picture this one being a snooze fest. Feels like one of those matches where you blink and it’s already 2-1.\n\n\nBacking that up, both teams have been consistent in games where goals flow freely, both teams have scored in 9 of Leverkusen’s last 10 Bundesliga matches, and in 13 of Freiburg’s last 16. That’s a strong indicator of open football and plenty of chances at both ends. Even though Leverkusen have won four of their last five, they’re not keeping many clean sheets on the way, they just tend to outscore whoever’s in front of them. When you put those stats together, the Over 2.5 pick feels like the obvious. It’s not just a hunch, the numbers fully support it.",

Not the desired result but better than a loss. Love my Asian Handicaps but sometimes pushes happen. \n\n▫️ Thoughts: Arsenal racked up a nice 4-0 win against Atletico Madrid at home. Gyokeres played great and found not only one but two goals, his first scored in quite sometime. Hopefully this will build his confidence. Arsenal has been playing great at home too with their worst result so far being a 1-1 against Man City. They got 5 goals against Leeds and 3 against Forest. They're also averaging 1.9 goals a game on average. Palace may have looked a bit relaxed in the conference league and they somehow managed to lose 0-1 against a Cypriot team at home (no hate on Cyprus) but in the Prem they've been pretty good. They're averaging 1.5 goals a game and have racked up 2 goals in many of their games. Arsenal and Crystal Palace are both london based teams, and they really show it when they play against one another. Arsenal last 4 games at home against Palace has resulted in this line being covered every time, and two of those results where 2-2 draws including the last game played in April of this year. Mateta has been on fire so far this season, and I feel that Eze will want to turn up big time against his former team. \n\n(All picks are 1 unit 💚)",

The script was spot on to my analysis and we cashed a no sweat fade pick. Wagner was clearly fatigued in this matchup, recording only 1-3pt FG attempt due to the Bulls lengthy defensive efforts that didn’t see the bottom of the net. Wagner was held to just 2 points in the 4th Q and finished with 17 points on 7-15 shooting (32% FG). Absolutely beautiful.\n\nNBA | MIL Bucks @ CLE Cavaliers | 6PM EST\n\nNext Pick: **Cole Anthony Under 11.5 Points** (-108 on Fanduel) Bet 1.5u to Win 1.39u\n\nCole Anthony was on a heater logging 23 points off the bench Friday against the Raps, but my analysis reveals a critical pattern that strongly favors the under here.\n\nThroughout last season Anthony’s next game following 20+ point outings saw a significant scoring decline. **Out of his major 20+ point performances last season, Anthony averaged just 13.5 PPG the following night, indicating a clear regression pattern.** This trend suggests we could expect a sharp drop off from his 23 point explosion. He is on a new team this season but within a similar role.\n\nThe Cavs ranked 8th in defensive rating last season, currently 7th this early season. When Anthony is on the court he’s likely to be guarded by Lonzo, in which he’s decent with defensive guard assignments.\n\nIf Kyle Kuzma is ruled out with an ankle injury, Anthony could see increased bench minutes. However even with extended playing time the Cavs perimeter defense should suppress his efficiency on top of my main thesis of his regression after a big night.\n\nIf tailing, only risk what you can afford to lose!

The Jets come into this game in a critical situation, winless on the season and missing several key players that heavily impact their performance. Their top wide receiver Garrett Wilson and star cornerback Sauce Gardner are both out, leaving the team without its main offensive weapon and best defensive player in coverage. Quarterback Justin Fields returns as the starter, but his performances have been inconsistent, marked by turnovers, sacks, and difficulty sustaining drives. Without his WR1 and behind a struggling offensive line, the Jets’ offense is very likely to stall again.\n\nOn the Bengals’ side, even though Joe Burrow remains out, the team reacted quickly by signing veteran quarterback Joe Flacco, who brings experience, defensive reading, and clock management. His presence stabilizes the offense and reduces the kind of mistakes that cost Cincinnati close games earlier in the season. The Bengals’ defense has also shown improvement, generating consistent pressure and establishing a more balanced attack with their running game, allowing them to control tempo and wear down opposing defenses.\n\nPlaying at home further strengthens Cincinnati’s edge. The Bengals have been significantly more efficient at home, and against a limited opponent like the Jets, their control of possession, yardage, and scoring should be evident. With New York’s defense weakened and its offense unable to consistently produce points, Cincinnati’s advantage in talent, quarterback stability, and overall form make the -6 spread a realistic and well-supported play. All indicators point toward a comfortable Bengals win by at least one full possession.",

Williams has cleared the 33.5 yard mark in three of his last five games completing passes for 37, 65, 29, 55, and 26. His deep ball accuracy has been better this season. Under offensive coordinator Ben Johnson, the Bears have leaned into a more vertical offense which better aligns with Caleb’s arm and mobility. He’s averaging 7.3 yards per attempt and ranks top 10 in air yards per throw, showing a clear willingness to push the ball downfield.\n\nThe matchup against Baltimore further boosts my favor of this prop hitting. The Ravens have allowed the second-most explosive pass plays (20+ yards) in the league through seven weeks and are giving up an average of 260.3 passing yards per game. Their cornerback unit has struggled with communication and blown coverages. Particularly on play action and off script scrambles - two areas where Williams thrives. With Rome Odunze and DJ Moore stretching the field and Caleb’s ability to extend plays, I like this setup for at least one deep shot to connect.\n\nExpected outcome: 42 yards Touchdown to DJ Moore (DJ Moore’s longest reception line is way lower at 17.5 longest but I like the idea of having Rome and Zaccheaus as insurance)",

With only scraping 1 win out of their last 5 (92nd minute winner), they aren't playing well at all.

Packers have been average just over 26 points per game with the Steelers averaging 25. Steelers have been giving up some major yardage this season. With deep threat Watson back, along with Kraft and Doubs who have been really shaping up this season, the Packers are looking good to get a few scores. On the flip side, Steelers have home advantage with Rodger playing his former team. WIth a tough run defense from the packers, Steelers will be using weapons like DK Metcalf who's been averaging nearly 70 yards a game, or screen passing to Gainwell. I could see this game going over 50, BOL everyone tailing.\n\n[http://buymeacoffee.com/Pefkov](http://buymeacoffee.com/Pefkov)",

I'll just preface this by saying I know I'm not the best capper in the world, but hey, a 1.2% ROI is still plus money at least.\n\n  \nLet's start with Dak. He's gone over in 4/7 games, missing the over in 1 game by 3 yards and hitting in back back. We all know he has great weapons in CD, Pickens, and Fergie, but what really excites me is this Broncos D. Yes they have Surtain, and yes, they're the 6th best in the league and only allowing 180 passing yards per game, but let's breakdown those 7 games:\n\nAgainst Bad QBs:  \nCam Ward - 112  \nJustin Fields - 45  \nJake Browning - 125\n\nAgainst Good QBs:  \nDaniel Jones - 316  \nJustin Herbert - 300  \nJalen Hurts - 280  \nJaxson Dart - 283\n\nAgainst bad QBs, they're averaging 94 passing yards given up versus 295 against good QBs with good QBs going over in all 4. This defense is getting gashed and Dak, the league's second leading passer, is a good QB. Take the over.\n\n  \nAnd what do I really have to say about Bijan? He leads the league in yards from scrimmage per game at 152 and is going up against the league's worst rushing defense in the Dolphins. I don't really care who's in at QB, I'm trusting the talent here.",

The tiny team from an even smaller town clinched the Swedish title away from home in their last match. \n\nMjallby have been great this season, going 20-6-1 in their 27 games so far. \n\nTheir performance has been on the back of their league-leading defence, having conceded only 17 goals in 27 games. While they're not at the top in clean sheets, they've only concealed more than a single goal twice this season (one was day one of the season, and the other was in May). So they are known to give little away. \n\nNow they go back home in their first game after being crowned champs and host 13th placed Norrkoping, who sit just outside the relegation spots in a 16-team league. \n\nNorrkoping obviously need points here to help secure their safety, but I think Mjallby will be too good at home. Especially when you consider Norrkoping have only won 3 away games all season, and two of those were early on.\n\nMotivation after winning the league is always an issue, but this will be the first home game since, and you want to celebrate with the fans.\n\nWhile I'm thinking almost everything points to a Mjallby win here, I'm not convinced it'll be a big score. Only 5 of Mjallby's 20 league wins this season have cleared the o3.5 goals threshold, and the last of those was early August. \n\nAnd only six of their 27 total league games this season have had more than 3.5 goals scored.... 3 of which were in their first 5 games this season. \n\nIf you want to be safer, you can find Mjallby outright at over $1.50 in most places, but I'm confident enough in the game going under 3.5 goals.",

He’s a decisive, one-cut runner—hit the landmark, stick your foot in the ground, and go. Against Dallas’ front, that cutback lane shows up a few times a game.*\n\n*The Cowboys’ run metrics are solid snap-to-snap, but they allow above-average yards after contact and have coughed up explosives when backs get through the first wave. That’s Dobbins’ wheelhouse.*\n\n*With a realistic 12–16 carries in a neutral script and the way Dallas has given up sporadic gashes to RBs, you’re live on every early-down touch.*\n\n*Dallas looks sturdier against zone than they do against man/gap concepts, where higher yards per carry and a bump in explosive rate is allowed. Dobbins favors in gap runs, having 59 carries there compared to the 44 zone carries.*\n\n*Dobbins is a perfect fit for those gap looks: downhill, decisive, and a strong finisher through the second level. One clean B-gap crease on GT counter or duo, and you’ve got the one play you need to clear 15.5.*",

As expected it was a battle between the two with Bencic coming out on top in three sets. 2 double faults in the first set followed by another 2 in the second necessitated none in the third from Kenin. Unfortunately she waited until the last game of the match at 5-2 to DF a fifth time. \n\nWe should be in for an entertaining game at the Emirates as this is a fixture that has historically brought goals aplenty, ending 2-2 and 1-5 last year. Arsenal are top of the league at the moment and have established themselves as the best defence in the world only conceding 3 all season. Meanwhile after a very promising start to the season, winning the Community Shield after the FA Cup last season, Palace are winless in their last three. Referee of the day Thomas Bramall is amongst the most lenient referees in the league averaging 4 booking points per match. Meanwhile, Palace have received an average of 2.25 yellows per match this season. What really amazed me while analysing this match is the fact that this line has been cleared in the last 22 matches between the two sides, dating back to 2014. That is honestly quite absurd and though doesn’t represent a whole lot of a deal, shows that despite being a “London derby” tensions usually remain low, which should help with decreasing bookings. Using all factors I get a mean of 1.90 bookings for Palace.\n\nThat gives this play an estimated 68% chance of winning. By building in the H2H I would give it closer to a 73% chance of winning (1.70 bookings). BOL !",

Arsenal have won every second half this season aside from 2. Their win against United earlier in the season had a second half with no goals and the wonder free kick Conceded against Liverpool from Szoboszlai. I actually see Arsenal winning both halves after a strong performance last time out against Atletico Madrid I think their form will be too strong and the fact they are a team that closes out games is a good sign, Crystal Palace form isn't too relevant here but they haven't been great recently, they do score goals but their 2nd half stats are far too inconsistent to hold any relevancy to me. Now onto the second part of the bet, Gyokeres has been a pretty average striker for majority of the season so far but he had a really good game against Atletico Madrid bagging 2 goals for himself. He has hit one shot on target in every game this season apart from 3. The game against city that ended 1-1, the loss against Liverpool previously mentioned and the opener against Man United. Every other game he has hit 1 shot on target if not more. I feel like he scores in this game but getting value for 1 shot on target is even better. Let's make it a winning return and 8 wins in a row. \n\nIf my picks help you and you'd like to show your appreciation a thumbs up is perfect, if you'd like to tip which is never expected but always appreciated and does help motivate me for the research here you go.

They are going up against the Tennessee Titans, who are probably a bottom 3 team in the NFL. The spread for this game is Colts -14.5, and I like the Colts with their points in a decisive victory. Over the course of the season, JT has been averaging 18.5 rush attempts and has only gone over this line twice. Over the last 5 weeks, Jonathan Taylor has been under this line 4 times. Those 4 games were ones where the Colts were up big by the 4th quarter, and they would pull JT to rest him in the 4th because he wasn't needed in order to win. The one time he went over this line, by 1 rush attempt, was against the Cardinals. This game was won by the Colts by only 4 points and came down to the wire - JT was needed all game. The second game where he went over was against the Broncos - another close game. You see the pattern? If we follow the trends here, JT and the Colts will have yet another effective game where JT will not need to run much, and he could once again get pulled early. There are still games in the 5 game stretch where he wasn't pulled and still stayed under this line, so don't worry about that. The last time the Colts played the Titans, JT only had 17 rush attempts. If the Titans defense manage to stop JT on the ground, this only helps us. The Colts are genuinely playing for the Super Bowl - if they can rest their stars, they will whenever they can. JT does not need to and will not go over 20.5 rush attempts in this game.\n\nRemember to only bet what you can afford, and BOL!",

Ajax have allowed a combined 11 goals in 3 CL games as well, so can't see Twente not scoring here, on the other hand, Twente have had pretty high scoring games at home, where they allowed multiple goals to weaker sides (2-1 vs Heracles, 3-2 vs Sittard, 2-2 vs Breda and also to stronger such as PSV 0-2).",

Max Caputo scored a double to put City up 2-0 within the first half, putting us in a comfortable position.\n\nThe game ended 4-0 with 2 long range efforts in the end to seal the bet and land a win at good odds. 💰\n\n-\n\n**Today's POTD:** Football - A-League - Brisbane Roar v Wellington Phoenix - Under 2.5 Goals - $1.90 - 1.0 Unit - *starting in roughly 2 hours..*\n\nBrisbane will travel to Wellington for their second game of the season. The catch is that Wellington have just gone to Perth and back (15 hours of flight time), so they are more likely to be affected if anything.\n\nBrisbane enjoyed a 1-0 win at home to Macarthur in their first game, and only registered 6 shots, creating 1 big chance, with 36% possession of the ball. But what’s impressive was their ability to shut them out as the Roar were playing with 10 men from the 58th minute onwards.\n\nWellington managed a 2-2 draw with Perth away from home. Perth conceded 4 to City yesterday and were looking quite amateur, so the Wellington result doesn’t read so well considering they only managed 0.78xG for their 2 goals.\n\nI believe Brisbane will take the safe approach here, as they don’t want to drop any points after a strong start. I expect them to have more ball than last game but Wellington may struggle to break them down resulting in a low scoring game. If Brisbane get a lead they will try to manage the game and inevitably park the bus.\n\nThis fixture has hit the under 2.5 goal line for the past 5 matches and the last time it produced more than 2 goals was back in 2023. They both lack natural goal scorers and only averaged just over a goal per game each last season.\n\nI do have a slight concern about their defensive records from last season, so I’m keeping it safe with a 1 unit play.\n\n-\n\n**13 wins in 17 bets,** well done to any followers. No pressure whatsoever, but if you are willing, any help will go a long way.\n\nBuy me a coffee! - https://www.paypal.com/ncp/payment/K4C6AK2VCT9EJ\n\n**Thanks, GL**",

They have a 100% first ban rate of Mirage, and last time they played SAW (Feb 2025), they banned Mirage first. SAW should ban Inferno, it is their worst map by far and one 3DMAX are dominant on\n* SAW have first pick in this series, I'd be really stunned to see them go anything but Nuke as their first pick. 3DMAX weren't known as a great Nuke team earlier in the year but recently have been red hot on the map. Their winrate has climbed and they have begun first picking the map with a 65% winrate on 17 maps played with most of these games being against tier one teams which is very impressive.\n* Despite this, SAW have a 92% winrate on Nuke and are on a 10 map winstreak on the map, they are so dominant and so good at this map that even teams that don't normally first ban Nuke have started to ban it against them. They first pick this map in 59% of their matches which is an insanely high amount and for good reason.\n* Ag1l leads SAW on Nuke, this is his best map by far on the roster. He is averaging a .85 KPR in the L3 months on Nuke (+.11 KPR) over a strong sample of rounds, and a .81 KPR in the L6 months on Nuke (+.10 KPR) on the map overall. Not only is it a GREAT map for KPR/his overall kills, but his headshot number is also fantastic on this map. His headshot % goes up to 58.7% in the L3 months (+7.4%) and 59.3% in the L6 months (+9% overall).\n* Ag1l is 14/16 hitrate on Nuke (both misses being at 6 headshots), needs \\~11-12 kills to hit this line with a kill line currently at 13.5/14.5",

The Bucs are 3.5-point favorites & the total is set at 46.5 points scored. The Saints give up a ton of points. __The Saints have trailed for 88.6% of their offensive snaps, highest rate in the league. They are allowing 2.45 points per drive (28th).__ This is going to lead to a ton passes from the Saints offense, especially since The Bucs are one of the most pass funnel defenses in the league.\n\n__The Bucs rank 4th in rushing success rate allowed & EPA per rush allowed.__ They have only allowed one 100 yard rusher this season & limited Saquon Barkley to 43 yards on 19 carries, Christian McCaffrey to 54 yards on 17 carries, & Bijan Robinson to 24 yards on 12 carries. In their last 3 games they’ve given up the 3rd most passing yards per game (284 ypg). Teams would much rather pass facing that elite run defense. Tampa also blitzes  a ton. __The Bucs blitz at the 6th highest rate defensively (36%) & they generating pressure on 53% of their plays (5th highest). Saints QB Spencer Rattler has actually done well when facing pressure, completing 58.1% of his pass attempts (5th) averaging 7.1 yards per attempt (8th). When facing a blitz, he has completed 70% of his throws (5th) for 7.3 yards per attempt (15th). The Bucs are allowing 7.7 yards per pass attempt (26th). Who has Rattler thrown to on blitzes? Saints star WR Chris Olave. Olave accounts for more than 50% of the team’s receiving yards, has a team-high 40% 1st read target rate, & averages 0.85 points per route run on blitzed dropbacks. Opposing offenses use play-action at the lowest rate in the NFL vs. TB (19% dropbacks). Which is significant because Chris Olave averages 0.46 points per route run with & without play action. Consistent production compared to the Saints WR Rashid Shaheed who averages 0.93 points per route run with play action and 0.26 without it.__ And by points I mean fantasy points, odd stat but I thought it was an interesting add. In the past few weeks Rattler & Olave have connected a ton. Olave has been used on some deeper routes. __After averaging under 10 yards per catch in every game over the first 5 weeks, over the past 2 weeks, he has had 98 receiving yards in consecutive games.__\n\n__Weeks 1-5: 1.4 Yards Per Route Run, 8.8 yards Average Depth of Target, 35% air yards, 36% endzone targets__\n\n__Weeks 6-7: 3.5 YPRR, 15.5 aDOT, 45% air yards, 100% endzone targets__\n\nThe cause of this has been Rattler is starting to air it out more. __In Weeks 1-5 Rattler had an aDOT of 7.4. Weeks 6-7 his aDOT has risen to 10.2 aDOT.__ This has led to a ton of utilization for Olave. __Olave ranks 2nd in the NFL in targets with 68 targets. In the last 2 weeks, Olave is the #4 WR in Fantasy Life’s Utilization Score for the season, No. 7 (83).\nAnd now this week he's going against the Bucs, who have been dominated by every mid-sized perimeter WR1 they've faced. Week 3 Garrett Wilson went 10/84/1 receiving on 13 targets, Week 5 JSN went for 8/132/1 receiving on 9 targets, & Week 6 Kendrick Bourne went for 5/142/0 receiving on 9 targets. Part of this is because the Bucs offense has done so well you have to pass to keep up. __The Buccaneers have turned the ball over on 5.2% of their drives, the 4th lowest rate in the league. Tampa Bay has scored 8 TD’s from outside of the red zone, 2nd in the league. Now they face the Saints that have allowed 6 TD outside of the red zone, most in the league.__ The Bucs defense allows I ton of explosive throws. __They given up 25 passes for 20+ yards (3rd most) & 4 passes for 40+ yards (7th most).__\n\nThe Saints have lost 2 pieces to their run game with Kendre Miller & Erik McCoy ruled out & they are dogs playing in a dome. Rattler has the potential to throw the most passes of his career, against a blitz heavy defense. Olave will eat.\n\n__Chris Olave o59.5 receiving yards__\n\nAppreciate the love!

Barcelona have big injury problems that will hurt them badly, missing key players like Raphinha, Dani Olmo and Robert Lewandowski. Furthermore, Barca manager Hansi Flick will not be at the touchline due to the red card in the last match and therefore cannot give instructions during the match. Real Madrid also have few injuries, but players including Trent Alexander-Arnold, Dani Carvajal and Hujisen will be available for the el classico, and their attack is deadly with Kylian Mbappé scoring in eight straight games before the Champions League and having 10 goals in 9 La Liga matches. \n\nThe both teams to score part is almost guaranteed because the last six El Clasico matches produced 33 total goals, and Barcelona have conceded in their last six matches including a 4-1 loss at Sevilla, while Real Madrid's defense is also weak without their main defenders. With both teams needing to attack and both having defensive problems due to injuries, this match should have plenty of goals from both sides while Real Madrid's home advantage makes it very unlikely they will lose.\n\n\nIf you found these picks helpful, tips or donations are greatly appreciated as they support the time and effort I put into creating them: [buy me a beer🍻](https://buymeacoffee.com/hercules.son.of.zeus)",

Our bet went through in the first half, 39 minutes was all it took. It ended up 3-2 to Brentford. On to the next one, with the biggest football match in the world, El Classico.\n\nTomorrow’s El Clásico at the Santiago Bernabéu is the best spectacle football has to offer, and this edition is loaded with narrative, stats and two teams desperate to attack from the outset. Real Madrid arrive as league leaders with 24 points in 9 matches, while Barcelona trail closely with 22 points, making this a true top-of-the-table clash where a win would create daylight in the La Liga race. The numbers behind this fixture are staggering: the last six El Clásicos have averaged over 4 goals per game, with both teams scoring in every clash, remarkably, none of those matches ended goalless at half or full-time. The “BTTS & Over 2.5 Goals” angle has landed repeatedly, and five of the last six encounters saw at least two goals after halftime as both teams emptied their tanks chasing results late on.\n\nRecent H2H backs this up: Barcelona triumphed 4-3 in their most recent league meeting, and also produced a 5-2 win and a 3-2 cup final thriller earlier this year, while Real have netted in 14 of their last 15 matches in all competitions. Kylian Mbappé, leading the scoring charts with 10 goals in just 9 league matches, is historically devastating in this fixture, scoring 11 times in 8 previous El Clásicos. Barcelona’s attack has also been rampant, under Hansi Flick, they average 3.3 goals per league match this term, and star men Lewandowski, Raphinha and Yamal (Lewandowski and Raphinha will not be playing this match due to injury) have each contributed over 10 league goals already.\n\nFor the pick: Both Teams To Score & Over 2.5 Goals & Over 1.5 Goals in the 2nd Half, paying 1.75 is exceptional value considering these performances. Only two of the last ten meetings have stayed under 3 goals, with the majority featuring a frantic second half as both sides chase the result. The refereeing tends to let the game flow and, crucially, attacking players on both rosters are in peak form. The quality of this rivalry demands a big show, and the stats almost guarantee it: goals, drama, and a fast, open game from start to finish. Backing this with odds at 1.75 stands out as a strong value bet for tomorrow’s main event.\n\nLet's cash it!\n\nPS: Glad to hear so many of you are enjoying the write-ups and making profits from the tips! If any of the picks have helped you out and you’d like to show some appreciation, feel free to drop me a small tip, it keeps the motivation and energy flowing for creating even better content.

Didn't even have to go to the second half to hit this one.\n\n[Henry Write UP](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/comments/1p49ox5/comment/nqacyzu/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\nEvent: MNF Panthers @ 49ers\n\n**POTD: McMillan Over 4.5 Receptions (-164) 3U play**\n\nMcMillan over 4.5 is driven by how often Bryce Young actually throws his way. He’s pulling almost **27% of Bryce Young’s targets**, **which is a true WR1 workload. McMillan is averaging 4.9 catches per game, and the 49ers are allowing a whopping 6.4 receptions avg to WR1s.** When Carolina gets behind, their pass rate spikes, and he’s the guy Young looks for on all the quick, easy stuff that keeps drives alive. San Francisco gives up a ton of underneath completions to WR1s, so his role actually lines up perfectly with what works against them. With that kind of usage and matchup, five catches is basically just his standard night.\n\nBOL\n\nIf you like the picks, throw a tip my way: [buymeacoffee.com/drripples](http://buymeacoffee.com/drripples)",

All picks 1 unit, unless stated otherwise.\n\n\nLast event: Soccer/Football, [Poland Ekstraklasa] Lech Poznan vs Radomiak Radom\nLast pick: BTTS + Over 2.5 goals @ 1.95 - 1.5 Units win\n\n\nEvent: Soccer/Football, [Denmark Superliga] Randers vs Odense\n\n\nPick:  BTTS + Over 2.5 goals @ 1.95\n\n\nWith 26 scored 36 allowed in 15 games Odense are the best matchup in the league for this line, good odds here because of Randers who have been failing to hit this line lately, they still have hit this in good matchups such as vs Viborg twice and they hit vs Odense in the reverse matchup in a 3-2 loss, with not a lot changing between then and today's match. Odense on the other hand hit this line in big majority of their games including in 4/5 games vs the top 4 teams currently who also have the top defences.",

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 7-3 (Avg Odds +114)\n\n**Previous Pick:** Declan Rice 1+ SOT (+135) ✅️\n\n**Today's Event:** English Premier League | Man United vs Everton (12:00 PM PST)\n\n**Pick:** Iliman Ndiaye 1+ SOT (+105) 1 unit to win 1.05 units\n\n**Write Up:** Gotta love a sweat free cash. Rice came through for us less than 3 minutes into the game, couldn't have drawn it up any better myself. A great weekend all around - I very much appreciate all the love and hearing about the wins!  \n\nToday we head back north to Manchester. Where we have 10th place Man United hosting 13th place Everton. A win here for Everton puts them at 10th and a win for Man U puts them all the way up to 5th in the table. Man U has really turned a corner over the last 5 matches, unbeaten in that stretch and winning 3 of 5. Interestingly enough though, they've only kept 1 clean sheet all season (Sunderland), tend to give up a lot of shots, and don't hold possession very well. \n\nEverton are a mixed bag, going 2-1-2 over their last 5 and sitting precariously near the bottom of the table. Pretty much all of their attacking goes through their wingers, Grealish and Ndiaye. With Ndiaye taking more shots on his own and Grealish looking for passes. Ndiaye has started every EPL match for Everton this season and tends to get most of the game, although a late sub is not uncommon. Everton gets a lot of Friday/Monday matches so I've seen a good bit of their play this year, snd stats aside Ndiaye has been the brighr spot of this team, the kid can ball. \n\nStat wise, Ndiaye has hit at least 1 SOT in 5 of his last 6 EPL matches, he picked up a bit of a knock before the break so this did not hit in his last match. He's back to 100% and I expect him to pick up where he left off - I love this play at plus money and don't hate a sprinkle on ATGS as well. \n\nBOL if tailing, have a great Monday!",

      "text": "Overall record 25W-12L\n\nUnits: +8.10 (All picks are 1 unit)\n\nLast pick: Ian Machado Garry by decision (-115) ✅\n\nWent pretty much as expected, Ian was able to defend every Belal takedown and keep the fight on the feet where he completely outclassed him and won by unanimous decision.\n\nToday's match: San Francisco 49ers vs Carolina Panthers (NFL)\n\nPick: 49ers -7 (-120, Fanatics)\n\nNow I know most primetime games have favored the underdog spread this year but I'm simply just not sold on the Panthers. Just two weeks ago their entire fanbase was ready to give up on Bryce Young after losing a crucial game to the Saints but then he just played the best game of his career vs the Falcons last Sunday and threw for 448 yards. I'm looking for him to come back down to earth this week and maybe its suddenly clicked for him but I am definitely not expecting anything near that in todays game.\n\nThe Panthers just simply don't look convincing to me on paper, they look like a team that is able to feed off the bottom of the league but as soon as they play anyone decent they start losing by wide margins. Their wins this year are against the Falcons (x2), Cowboys, Jets, Packers, and Dolphins. Now aside from the Packers all these teams that they've won against have negative records and sit near the bottom of their divisions, but even the Packers have not really been convincing this year outside of their win vs the Lions in week 1. The best teams the Panthers have played this year in their losses are the Patriots, Bills, and Jaguars and in those 3 games they lost by an average of 25.3 ppg. Riding with the 49ers at home coming off a convincing win vs the Cardinals last week with Brock Purdy back from injury. BOL and bet responsibly.",

Feldbausch doesn’t have an iota of indoors experience in comparison to Choinski. He also hasn’t played a single match in over 2 months since losing the finals in Biella; very odd but rust will be great for Choinski to expose.\n\nRide with the hottest capper in this subreddit and come see why they NVS🌟\n\n*If I’ve made you money and you want to tip*: [BMAC☕️](https://buymeacoffee.com/nvsbets) or [BTC](https://pastebin.com/0Lf0mHqu) [ETH](https://pastebin.com/D2QRi3Bx)",

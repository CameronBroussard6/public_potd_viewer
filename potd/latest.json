He clearly still knows how to read a field and make the throws he needs to.\n\nThe Jags run almost exclusively zone defense, and most decent QBs have had minimal trouble throwing for good yardage against them: Nix - 377, Brissett - 317, and Geno Smith - 284 to name a few.\n\nThe Jags defense has been better during the last month, but I believe that Rivers is the exact kind of QB that can exploit the soft spots in the zone. I believe Rivers can easily pass this relatively low line.\n\nI will also be in Indy for the game for an additional vibes bonus.",

If you watch how these two teams play, Ginebra is just a nightmare for Converge.\n\nConverge relies heavily on a \"run-and-gun,\" high-pace offense where they try to overwhelm you with speed and volume three-point shooting. The problem is, Ginebra is arguably the most disciplined half-court team in the league. They dictate the tempo better than anyone. They don't let you run; they force you to play their game, which is slower, physical, and executed through efficient set plays.\n\nDefensively, Ginebra has the length on the perimeter to bother Converge’s shooters, and they have the size advantage in the paint to control the boards. When the game slows down in the 4th quarter, Ginebra’s veteran composure usually takes over against a younger Converge squad that tends to panic when their shots aren't falling.\n\nYou also can't ignore the intangible factor of the \"Never Say Die\" crowd. It’s a Sunday game, and the Ginebra fanbase acts like a massive 6th man, especially when they have momentum. Between the crowd energy and Ginebra’s veteran composure in the 4th quarter, I trust Ginebra to control the pace, punish them inside, and cover this spread much more than a young Converge team trying to bounce back.\n\n\nBOL!",

Brutal loss, we move on.\n\nToday’s POTD: 🏈 Saints ML (-130). \n\nGame starts at 1pm EST. Bet 3.5u\n\nWriteup: Taking the best team currently in the NFC South to go on the road and get a win against the Tennessee Titans. \n\nThe New Orleans Saints are last in their division, and yet they are playing better than any other team in said division. They’ve won 3 straight games and have looked better on offense and defense each week. They are no longer tanking for next years draft picks as they are starting to see a lot of promise in their rookie QB Tyler Shough and the rest of the team. His connection with top WR Chris Olave is only growing each week. They go up against a lowly Titans team who have lost 8 of their last 10. Those two wins were against a Patrick Mahomes-less Chiefs, and the Browns. They are without their top WR option in Calvin Ridley and safety Xavier Woods.\n\nThis is simply a pick of taking the better team who want to prove themselves against a worse team who are still in the running for the #1 pick in the draft. \n\nRemember to only bet what you can afford to lose, and BOL!",

Benfica arrive far more compact and controlled than earlier in the season, showing a consistent ability to neutralise possession-heavy opponents — particularly relevant against a Braga side that leads the league in ball retention but often struggles to convert dominance into control against top opposition. Injury-wise, Benfica travel in a healthier state than in previous months, while Braga have been carefully managing key players with heavy minutes, a concern their coach has publicly acknowledged by stressing the need for “balance” over intensity. From a tactical standpoint, Mourinho has reinforced defensive spacing and transition coverage, allowing Benfica to absorb pressure without losing structure, which naturally reduces defeat risk away from home. Braga’s own coach has admitted that his team must reach an exceptional level to overcome Benfica, underlining the fine margins expected. With Benfica approaching this fixture as a must-not-lose match in the title race, their maturity, organisation and physical condition make avoiding defeat a logical and well-supported outcome rather than a speculative one.",

Bologna have developed into a consistent attacking side, regularly scoring while still allowing chances due to their high-tempo, forward-leaning approach. Sassuolo continue to profile as one of the league’s more reliable BTTS contributors, combining attacking intent with a defence that concedes frequently against teams willing to press and transition quickly. From a data perspective, both sides rank well for shots in the box, xG created, and goals conceded per match, creating a game state that naturally supports goals at both ends. Recent meetings and overall match profiles point toward open phases of play rather than sustained control from either side.",

The Saints have been playing strong along the later stretch of the season. Yes some games have been against weaker teams like the Jets, but those solid divisional wins against Bucs and Panthers (even though they’re not the best teams in the league) have solidified that they’re on somewhat of a hot stretch. Thus, there’s no reason to think they aren’t capable of beating the Titans, a very weak team.",

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 6-15-3 *Well, that fun sure was shortlived as I go back to default settings it seems. In a game of fine margins, it was Benin that came out on top, killing our hopes of a crazy winning run before they even really started. We go again though, and I'll try my best not to notch up 7 losses in a row this time around*\n\n**Last Five:** ❌❌❌✅❌\n\n**Event:** AFCON, Gabon v Mozambique, 7:30 am EST\n\n**POTD:** Mozambique Win or Draw + Under 3.5 goals +124, 3 units\n\n**Write Up:** Gabon might be the favourites on paper, but I feel like the teams are way more evenly matched than the odds suggest and there’s a bunch of reasons for backing Mozambique to get something out of this crucial Group F encounter. Both teams began their AFCON campaigns with narrow 1-0 defeats, with Gabon losing to Cameroon and Mozambique falling to the Ivory Coast.\n\nHistorically, *Gabon do admittedly hold a slight H2H edge, having won more of the previous seven meetings.* However, the numbers aren’t overwhelmingly lopsided and include **two wins for Mozambique and a draw**. That balance alone suggests this matchup isn’t as one-sided as the odds imply and I'm here to take full advantage of that.\n\nMozambique’s tactical setup and squad have strengths that make a win or draw plausible. Players like **Geny Catamo** and **Stanley Ratifo** provide real attacking threat, and the Mambas are likely to adopt a **compact, counter-attacking approach** that's meant to sustain any pressure Gabon might throw at them and even more, suffocate their build-up play before the danger can even occur. In their opening game, Mozambique showed discipline and resilience, completing a high number of passes on both halves of the field and limiting clear chances against the heavyweights in Ivory Coast. There are also question marks over **Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang** and **Mario Lemina's** starts - expect the odds to be tipped even more in Mozambique's favor **if they don't start.**\n\nGabon, while traditionally considered to be the stronger of the two, **struggled to convert their possession and 12 shots** against Cameroon into goals, highlighting an **ongoing finishing issue.** With **Gabon’s recent inconsistency** and Mozambique needing points urgently, I can absolutely sense a tight game with Mozambique holding firm for a draw or even grabbing the win from a counter or Gabon's defensive mishap. The Mambas’ resilience and tactical discipline could easily see them avoid defeat in a potential competitive, low-scoring affair, hence **adding a cheeky Under 3.5 goals** leg to sweeten the odds some more. If you want to lower the match goals to Under 2.5 or take the BTTS Yes instead, I don't mind that either, but ultimately, the pick I feel the most confident in is the one I went with. Feeling pretty good about this one after about an hour and a half's worth of research that primarily went into the underlying data, historical context and tactical configuration, so I'm stacking 3 units on this promising play. I feel like a win here could potentially mark a crucial turning point in my fortunes. BOL and let's have us some more unforgettable AFCON fun y'all ☘️",

The Buffalo defense is one of the worst defenses in the league against the run and Saquon has scored TDs in his last 3 games and has been averaging 4, 6, 3.5, and 6 YPC in his last 4 games. \n\nThe Eagles still have a chance at the 2 seed if they win out, so this is a game that matters for them. I wouldn’t be surprised to see a long run here from Saquon.\n\nFor the Bills, ignoring last week when Judkins got hurt, Trayveon had 148 and 2 TDs, Chase Brown had 2 TDs, and Jaylen Warren had a TD in their last 3 games.\n\nGood Luck",

He had quite a few chances and it's disappointing he didnt convert for us either way. Confused and maybe a touch frustrated, we move on. Sorry friends, we've gone cold. \n\nToday we have a match between two teams promoted this season, both of which have been pleasant surprises, as 7th place Sunderland host 16th place Leeds. Sunderland have picked up many of their points by playing a stingy defense and have actually conceded the 2nd fewest goals this season (tied with Man City). They are also incredibly tough at home, having gone unbeaten thus far with a record of 5-3-0. Theyve conceded 7 goals in these 8 home games as well. Despite all of this, I'm backing a Leeds player to net against them. Here's why:\n\nCalvert-Lewin, the ex-Everton striker, has been in the form of his life. He has scored in 5 consecutive match, scoring 6 goals in theses 5 games. What makes this extra impressive is that only one of these goals was a penalty kick. He also hasn't been scoring against bottom tier competition, he has scored against three of the top 5 teams in the EPL (Liverpool, City, Chelsea), and against three of the top 5 defenses in Palace (2 goals), Chelsea, and away at Man City. \n\nI've been backing Calvert-Lewin over in the soccer thread for the past 3 weeks while he has been on this tear. Our guy is finding the back of the net through any means necessary and I like him here again at good plus money, against a tough defense. I've been cold so tail with caution, BOL to everyone and have a great Sunday.",

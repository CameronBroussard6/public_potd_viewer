This team hasn’t lost two consecutive games at Allen fieldhouse since February of 2018. The tigers are coming off a hard fought loss at notre dame which was their first true  road test. Not to mention they have had the easiest cake walk of a schedule in all of college basketball. They shot extremely well from three in that game and fell short. Three point shooting has been one of their main strengths yet Kansas comes into this matchup holding their opponents to the 5th best three point percentage in the nation. My power ratings make this Kansas -8 regardless. This is a win.\n\nPackers: \nThe bears might just be the luckiest team in the NFL. They have a bottom 5 SOS. They barely beat the 6-6 Steelers by 3 points, they barely beat a 4-8 Vikings team by 2 points last minute. The 2-11 giants by 4 points. And allowed 42 points to the bengals. Lost to the 6-6 ravens by 14. Beat the 3-9 commanders by 1 point on a Game winning field goal. The 2-10 raiders by 1 point. And allowed 52 points and got their ass handed to them by the 7-5 lions and lost week 1 to that same Vikings team. The packers are top 5 in total defense and top 10 in total offense and have revenge from last years loss at home to the bears. Public is also all over the bears and they do not even have Odunze. This is also a win.\n\nLet’s get after it fellas. As always, cheers 🍻",

The weather is supposed to be atrocious tomorrow, with pouring rain throughout most of the game.\n\nThe Colts will be without DeForest Buckner as well, which hurts their rushing defense. The Jags have run well most of this year, despite last week's odd result. The Jags had very few long drives, opting instead for chunk plays and short fields.\n\nI think he easily hits this super low line, as he has most games this year with Brenton Strange on the field.",

      "text": "Apologies to those of you who have started following me over the last couple of weeks, it’s been really brutal. Gonna switch up my pick philosophy as my personal plays based on gut calls have been doing so so much better than these picks that I put way more research into. Pretty ironic, but it’s time to turn things around for the holiday season.\n\nRecord: 27-19 (+23.14u)\n\nLast 10:✖️✖️💰✖️✖️💰💰✖️✖️✖️\n\nLast POTD: 🏈 George Pickens longest reception over 25.5 yards ✖️\n\nWriteup: Pickens reminded us why the Steelers let him walk. Lackadaisical, low effort, out of it. Dak threw a perfect 30+ yard pass right to Pickens at the end of the game and he put in zero effort to get it and let it drop right by his feet.\n\nToday’s POTD: 🏈 Commanders ML (-124).\n\nGame starts at 1pm EST. Bet 3.25U\n\nWriteup: Welcome to day 1 of my new pick mentality. For this pick, give me my Commanders winning straight up against the Vikings. \n\nJayden Daniels had the greatest rookie QB season of all time last season, and finally has all of his wide receivers healthy for the first time this season. On the other side, J.J. McCarthy might be the worst starting QB in football. The Vikings have one of the best receiving cores in the league, but McCarthy has completely stifled any and all offensive momentum and playmaking for his players. \n\nOn defense, the Commanders defense has not been good, at all. However, Dan Quinn took over the defensive play calling a few weeks ago, and they look like a completely different defense. Still not great, but they are playing with a completely different energy. The Vikings have a much better defense on paper, especially in the pass game. However, these stats are completely skewed thanks to them getting to go up against the Bengals when Jake Browning was the starting QB. Take this game out, and the Vikings are the 22nd best defense in football. \n\nSo for arguments sake, we’ll call these 2 defenses pretty equal, and I’ll take this Jayden Daniels led defense over J.J. McCarthy any day of the week. Commanders win this one outright.\n\nRemember to only bet what you can afford to lose, and BOL! ",

Dortmund are third in the Bundesliga and are a strong attacking team at Signal Iduna Park, while Hoffenheim are fifth with 23 points and have had both teams score in five of their last seven games away from home, proving they will definitely have high chance of scoring. Dortmund have dominated this fixture historically, winning 8 of their last 10 meetings against Hoffenheim. Both teams are on unbeaten streaks in the league, with Dortmund unbeaten for almost two months and Hoffenheim unbeaten in six consecutive league matches, meaning both teams will attack and create chances instead of playing defensively. Hoffenheim are ranked second away from home in the entire Bundesliga and have scored 12 goals in their last five games, so they will come to Dortmund with confidence and attack-minded football, while Dortmund have scored 10 goals in their last five home games, meaning both teams have the quality to break through and score goals. The win or draw protection gives you safety in case Dortmund only draw, while the both teams to score requirement is almost guaranteed based on the last four to five meetings where both sides found the back of the net every single time. \n\n\nIf you found these picks helpful, tips or donations are greatly appreciated as they support the time and effort I put into creating them: [buy me a beer🍻](https://buymeacoffee.com/hercules.son.of.zeus)",

      "text": "Record 3-2 (+.64u)\n\n**Previous POTD:** NFL Bengals at Ravens 8pm EST Each team to score 1+ TD in each half (+100) 3 Units (L)\n\n**POTD:** NFL Bengals vs Bills 1:00pm EST - **Chase Brown + James Cook Over 150 yards Rushing (-138)** 3U \n\nOn first glance at this game you may think Burrow and Allen - O/U of 53 - its gonna be a shootout with tons of passing. While that may happen to some extent, a closer look at the data suggests a run-heavy script. \n\nBengals D: Yes they give up a lot of yards through the air (265/game - 6th most) but they are even worse defending the run (RB's rush for over 128/game against them- worst in the NFL).\n\nBills D: Is a funnel rush defense - giving up the third most rushing yards (113/game) while having the stingiest pass defense in the league (177/game - 1st) \n\nThis matches up well with where both offenses have been recently. The Bills have a receiver problem. Kincaid went down, Coleman had been a healthy scratch for weeks before they couldnt find anyone else to catch the ball, Gabe Davis sucks, and Shakir - their only decent wideout - had 1 catch for 5 yards last week against Pittsburgh. In fact the Bills overall had 125 total pass yards against the Steelers D which was second worst in the league against the pass (263/game). That same game James Cook, on the other hand, rushed **34 times** for 144 yards.          \n\nMeanwhile, Chase Brown has been on a roll. Over the past 6 weeks he has rushed for 108-73-37-99-77-108. Thats 2 - 100 games and only one game under 70. Over the same last 6 game span - James Cook has 4 games of over 100+ yards including one of 216. Asking these two to combine for 150 yards rushing against two of the worst run defenses in the league on a cold day in Buffalo doesnt seems like much.\n\nThis bet is under Rushing -> Combined Rushing Yards -> **Cook and Brown Over 150 (-138)** on Draftkings. If you dont have this bet - you can also find it under Head to Head Matchups - where their total over is at 155 (-114) BOL if Tailing!",

      "text": "**Record: 3-2**\n\n**Net Units: 0.3 units up**\n\n**ROI: 6.00%**\n\nLast Pick: Korpatsch vs Friedsam - Korpatsch ML @ 1.80 ✅️\n\nGreat performance by Korpatsch, a player who's certainly been improving the level of play as the tournament goes on. Clean straight sets win.\n\n**Tennis** | **Challenger Angers (Women)** | **9 AM (Eastern Time)**\n\n**Plays will always be shared as 1 unit for fair record purposes**\n\n**Pick:** **Korpatsch vs Rakhimova - Rakhimova ML @ 1.71**\n\nBoth players have been playing solid tennis. Korpatsch didn't drop a set in this tournament but faced two weak opponents in the first two rounds, before beating Parks, who played at a terrible level, and then Friedsam, who I was expecting to get knocked out after a really intense battle in the previous round against Sonmez.\n\nRakhimova had a much more difficult path to the final, where she faced Klimocicova and Ruzic, players who can certainly be dangerous on a good day. All her opponents in this tournament were solid from the baseline, and she was able to get the best of them, playing at a high level even when she needed to win in 3 sets.\n\nWhen it comes to playstyles, both players certainly play baseline tennis, but Korpatsch tends to be a lot more passive, and usually things don't go right for her when she's forced to be aggressive. Rakhimova, on the other hand, is much more efficient when turning defense into offense, and her backhand is certainly an advantage in this matchup.\n\nI believe that Parks and Friedsam, players who tend to make a lot of unforced errors, were not a good test for Korpatsch, and she will find a lot of contest from the baseline in this final. With this, I'm expecting Rakhimova to win this match. Their H2H record is 1-0 in favor of Rakhimova, where she won last year in the hard courts of Ningbo by 6-0/6-3.\n\nGood luck!",

Long time tailer and first time picker with this one.\n\nEvent - NFL, Cardinals/Rams, 2:25 MST\n\nPick - Michael Wilson O5.5 Receptions -106(currently at -148 on FD) 2.5U\n\nGoing to keep my first pick short and to the point.  The cardinals are having an abysmal season and are dealing with a ton of injuries.  Wilson averaged 12.5 receptions a game when MHJ missed 2 games earlier this season, and that was WITH Dorth and Dimercado playing(they are both injured and OUT for this game, Weaver is also questionable with a DNP yesterday, MHJ is OUT).  The card are playing one of the best offenses in the Rams, and i expect them to be playing from behind and throwing the ball a ton like they have all season against lesser offenses.  Someone has to catch the ball besides McBride!\n\nI wish the Sunday picks were up earlier as there has been massive line movement.  I'm laddering this up to 10 receptions personally.  BOL!",

Rodriguez has had 90% of the 1st Quarter RB carries in Washington’s last 2 games. Rodriguez has now had 10+ carries in 3 of his last 4 games, going for 41 yards, 79 yards, & 65 yards. His one miss was when he suffered a shoulder injury vs the Lions. Last week his 41 yard performance was against the Broncos who have a top 5 run defense, allowing just 93.1 rushing yards per game. Now he faces a Minnesota defense that ranks 23rd in rushing yards allowed per game (128.4) & ranks just 20th in EPA run defense. In their past 6 games they’ve allowed:\n\nWalker 13/56, Charbs 14/52\n\nJacob’s 28/107\n\nSwift 21/90\n\nHenry 20/75\n\nMonty 11/40\n\nVidal 23/117\n\nNow they face Washington who has turned to a run first approach offense in the past month. In the first 8 weeks of the season, the Washington’s RB’s averaged 17.4 runs per game. In their past 4 games that number has shot up to 24. This week Washington gets star QB Jayden Daniels back at QB from a dislocated elbow & their offense should be firing on full cylinders. The Commanders enter the game as favorites, vs a struggling Vikings offense that ranks LAST in points per game over their last 3 games averaging just 7.7 points per game. \tMinnesota has the league's worst turnover differential (-15) & ranks LAST in the NFL in EPA pass offense over the last 8 weeks (-67.0). Minnesota does have a great pass defense. Over the last 5 weeks, Minnesota has allowed a 59.6% completion rate (7th), 6.3 yards per pass attempt (9th), & a 2.1% TD rate (3rd). Minnesota leads the NFL in 2 high safety rate (64%), which helps them limit deep passing, allowing just the 4th fewest deep yards per game (21.3) over the past 6 weeks. Their 2 high approach also allows them to limit the sidelines & specifically deeper downfield passes (2nd fewest years per game allowed to 15+ yard targets on sidelines). \n\nWith Daniels coming back from injury, the run game heating up, & Minnesota sucking on offense, Rodriguez is in line for his busiest game of the season & Vegas has not awfully adjusted his rushing props.\n\n*More write-up incoming*\n\n__Chris Rodriguez o41.5 rushing yards__\n\nAppreciate the love!

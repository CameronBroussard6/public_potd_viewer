Leeds have conceded at least 3 goals this season 3 times, lost 0-5 away to Arsenal. City covered this line this season a couple of times - 4-1 vs Dortmund, 3-0 vs Liverpool, 3-1 vs Bournemouth, 5-1 vs Burnley, 3-0 vs Man United and a 4-0 win vs Wolves, so another bottom of the table team should be getting scored on plenty here.",

      "text": "Record: 1-0 (+2.00 units ROI)\n\nSoccer | Premier League 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿| Manchester City vs. Leeds United | 16:00 CET (Amsterdam)\nPick: Manchester City -2 Asian Handicap | 2 units\n\nWrite Up:\n\nWe kicked things off nicely yesterday with ADO Den Haag winning 0-3 at VVV Venlo, comfortably cashing the -1 Asian Handicap. A strong start to open the record.\n\nFor Saturday I’m going with Manchester City -2 on the Asian Handicap. City at home has been as reliable as it gets. They’ve won their last 5 out of 6home games in all competitions by at least two goals, and they’ve looked dominant doing it. Against Leverkusen we saw plenty of rotation and rested players, something I don’t expect at all against Leeds with Premier League points on the line.\n\nLeeds, on the other hand, have struggled badly away from home. In their last five matches they average only 0.8 goals, and they’ve lost every away game this season except their visit to Wolves, who sit at the bottom of the table with 2 points after 12 played. They also got blown out 5-0 at Arsenal, showing how vulnerable they are defensively against top opposition.\n\nCity should come out with full focus, full strength, and enough firepower to win this comfortably. Haaland, Foden, Cherki, Doku, Savinho, Reijnders are all big threats to the defence of Leeds. Also Haaland can get is 100th premier league goal which I think is a record for quickest if he gets at least one goal against Leeds, which is extra motivation for him. A 3-0 or 4-1 type of scoreline is very realistic as I just don’t see Leeds keeping it close, and the -2 line gives us a push if it lands exactly on two goals. \n\nManchester City -2 Asian Handicap for 2 units. Let’s try to make it two in a row.",

      "text": "Record:  **5-2**\n\nNet Units:  **+4.6U**\n\nLast Pick:  **Georgia -13.5 (-120) 1.2U (L)**\n\nWhat a terrible game from Georgia. Not being able to put up over 20 points, while keeping GT to just 9 is really unfortunate. Gunner Stockton did not look comfortable out there at all.. That miss is on me, but we're gonna bounce back today!\n\nEvent:  **NCAAF - Penn State @ Rutgers, 3:30PM ET**\n\nPOTD:  **Penn State -13.5 (-120) 1.2U**\n\nWrite-Up:\n\nThese past 2 weeks have been refreshing, when watching this Penn State team play. They are finally getting the job done, especially in the games they are supposed. Now they get a match up against a Rutgers team that has clearly been struggling this season. They should be able to continue with this momentum and completely roll Rutgers.\n\nThe main proponent of Penn State's success has been the re-emergence of the running game. They have 2 stud RBs in Kaytron Allen and Nick Singleton. This duo has over 200 rushing yards combined in their last 2 games. Rutgers is currently ranked as the 129th of 136 teams against the run. This will be the exact area that Penn State will look to exploit. I'm expecting another 200+ yard performance on the ground where the Nittany Lions are able to completely control the game clock.\n\nThe cherry on top is what Terry Smith has done in his little time as interim head coach. He has been a breath of fresh air, especially as Penn State needs to finish out this season strong. After the firing of James Franklin, they just about lost every single recruit from the 2026/2027 classes. Including 5-star RB, Kemon Spell. Finishing the season on a high note will give incoming recruits hope for the program moving forward. \n\nLet's start another streak here today!\n\n*As always, BOL!*  \n\n\n*Also, never feel obligated to tip, but I leave this here just in case:*  [BMAC](https://buymeacoffee.com/thooney_toons)",

Skinner got yanked after giving up four goals on eight shots, and the tandem is posting an .860 save percentage through 25 games, which is genuinely the worst in franchise history. Meanwhile Seattle's been solid at Climate Pledge Arena (6-2-3), Daccord has been steady with a .906 save percentage on the year, and they already beat this same Edmonton team 3-2 back in October despite getting outshot.",

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 9-5 (Avg Odds +122)\n\n**Previous Pick:** Donyell Malen 2+ SOT (+120) ✅️\n\n**Today's Event:** English Premier League | Everton vs Newcastle (9:30 AM PST)\n\n**Pick:** Nick Woltemade 2+ SOT (+245) 1 unit to win 2.45 units\n\n**Write Up:** Malen came through for us in 27', ending the first half with 2 goals and 3 SOT. Game played out much as expected and we wound up with a great sweat free holiday win! \n\nWe're back after a day off and headed to Everton as they host the Newcastle Magpies for a middle-of-the-table match. We are backing Newcastle's 6'6\" tall center forward to get 2 or more shots on target. I waffled a while over ATGS for worse odds, or even O1 SOT (push at 1 SOT), but I ended up going with my gut and the better odds of 2+ SOT. I actually think ATGS (while I like it) is the riskier pick even though the odds are lower, as Pickford is a tough keeper to beat. \n\nMy love for the lanky German (I do not think this is an official nickname, but I heard an announcer call him that during a match one time and it stuck with me), is no secret. He's a true center forwards' center forward. He's usually the tallest player on the pitch, always chases the long ball, and tries to head every cross. He's coming off of a 2+ SOT match against Man City and 3 goals in two games during the international break. He got most of the mid week UCL match off this week so I expect him to be fresh and play most of the match today. The man is on fire and I expect that to continue here. \n\nThe other reason I like this pick is that Everton does not handle big center forwards well. Comparing Woltemade to some similar style strikers against Everton - last match at United Zirkzee had 3 shots (2 SOT), Haaland had 5 shots (4 SOT, 2 goals), Matetta had 3 shots (2 SOT). They just don't have the height to deal with tall strikers and our lanky German has 2\"+ height on all three of those guys. \n\nBOL if you decide to tail, have a great Saturday!",

      "text": "POTD Record: 22-9 (+15.3U)\n\nLast Pick: Michigan State ML (-130) (2U)✅\n\n[MSU write up](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/s/yDIx0GgnVr)\n\nMSU is a top 5 team in the nation, argue with a wall, like I said that defense combined with the shots starting to fall is no good for any one of their opponents! That win brings us to a 4-1 record for our 2 unit hammer plays 😤\n\nEvent: Auburn vs Alabama “Iron bowl” (NCAAF) (6:30pm central)\n\nPOTD: Auburn +5.5 (-110) (1U)\n\n-everything is bet to win unit amount-\n\nWrite up: \n\nAuburn +5.5 is the right side in the Iron Bowl because the matchup, the history, and the motivation all point in their favor. Alabama’s offense has been far too one‑dimensional this season, leaning heavily on the passing game because the rushing attack has been ineffective. The Tide average just around 123 rushing yards per game and only 3.7 yards per carry, numbers that rank near the bottom of the SEC and expose their inability to control the line of scrimmage. That weakness plays directly into Auburn’s strength, as the Tigers boast one of the nation’s most formidable rush defenses, allowing under 95 yards per game and holding opponents to just 2.7 yards per carry. When Alabama is forced into predictable passing downs, Auburn’s defensive front can attack with pressure, which has been the formula for keeping games close against elite opponents all year.\n\nThe matchup against Oklahoma at home certainly reinforces these ideas. I believe OU plays very similar to Auburn and the tape is out on how to beat bama!\n\nHistory reinforces the value of the points. Alabama has won four straight in the series, but no team has ever won five in a row, and the last three meetings at Jordan–Hare have all been decided by three points or fewer, including Auburn’s 48–45 win in 2019. Rivalry dynamics consistently compress margins, and catching more than a field goal at home is a gift in this spot. Auburn enters at 5–6, needing a win to secure bowl eligibility, while Alabama must win to keep its playoff hopes alive. That double incentive guarantees maximum intensity from the Tigers, who would love nothing more than to end their rival’s season while extending their own.\n\nAuburn has also proven resilient all year, as none of their six losses have been by more than seven points, which makes catching +5.5 even more valuable. Betting trends add another layer: Alabama is just 2–5 ATS in its last seven SEC road games, while Auburn has covered in three of the last four Iron Bowls played at Jordan–Hare. With the spread sitting at 5.5 and the total around 46.5, oddsmakers are signaling a lower‑scoring, possession‑driven game — the exact environment where a home dog thrives.\n\nPut it all together: Alabama’s run game inefficiency, Auburn’s elite rush defense, the rivalry’s historical tightness, Auburn’s motivation for bowl eligibility, and their track record of keeping games within one score. The matchup, the number, and the context all align. The bet of the day is Auburn +5.5, and it’s backed by stats, history, and market logic. As always, cheers 🍻",

Away from home Fulham are tied last with Wolves, being 1-0-4 on their away trips. And Tottenham, well they are 1-2-3 at home but this can be explained. \n\nWhen looking at Spurs their opponents at home, they were United (D), Chelsea (L), Villa (L), Wolves (D), Bournemouth (L), Burnley (W). So against all teams which are above Spurs in the ladder, Tottenham lost. And the 2 draws could be considered good against United and somewhat unlucky against Wolves.\n\nOn the H2H side Tottenham are 11-5-2 against Fulham.\n\nWith Tottenham having a very bad home record and them being on a losing streak, this is the perfect game to gain momentum back with all the pressure on Spurs to get a good result in front of their fans.",

Therefore I’m not gonna count it on my record. Sorry about that.\n\nEvent: NHL Hockey Florida Panthers (6-6-1) @ LA Kings (6-4-4) 11/6 10:07PM EST\n\nPick: Total Match Goals Over 5.5 +100 (1 Unit)\n\nWrite up: Two teams with high scoring offenses and leaky defenses meet Tuesday night, setting us up for an intriguing match. Panthers games have typically been high scoring affairs this season, with 5 goals being scored in 9 of their first 13 games this season. Los Angeles has also taken part in their share of high scoring games this season, with 10 of their first 14 games featuring a combined 5 goals. \n\nFlorida has just 1 shutout win (3-0 vs Vegas) and a lone shutout loss (0-3 vs Buffalo) so far this season. Meanwhile the Kings have not been shut out so far this campaign, and they have a single shutout win so far (their most recent game being a 3-0 shutout win against Winnipeg).\n\nIn a matchup this close, the only thing I’m confident leaning on is the combined scoring prowess and defensive struggles of each team. I’m expecting a fun game full of goals. BOL to those tailing, let’s do some winning!",

Now, coming off a short week the Raiders travel to Mile High for an indivision game against the Broncos.\n\nBrock Bowers line is **WAYYY** too low. He looks back to form making some insane catches vs. the Jaguars under all sorts of coverages. Here's by I like this pick:\n\n**1.** The Broncos do have a top defense but not against Brock Bowers. Dalton Schultz last game against the Broncos had 6 receptions with 77 receiving yards.\n\n**2.** Brock Bowers was projected #1 TE by everyone for a reason. 65.5 is too low. He's looking healthy and nearly doubled that total last game.\n\n**3.** Jakobi Meyers got traded so Bowers will see a higher target share.\n\n**4.** Run game has not been working. Jeanty had 13 carries last game and 6 against the Chiefs the game prior. They will throw\n\n**5.** Raiders are 9.5 point underdogs. They will need to THROW to stay in this game.\n\n**6.** Pressure is coming from Denver. They lead the league is sacks by a mile. This means quick passes will go to Bowers.\n\n**7.** As of this edit, Draftkings has his O/U at 69.5. Fanatics + Fanduel have this MISPRICED. DK is usually sharper. Good value at 65.5 getting a 4 yard discount\n\nLet me know what you guys think about the pick! Feedbacks always appreciated. This is my first time posting the night before!",

Dobbins over 49.5 rush yds -110 Odds 4 units $400 to win $763.64**\n\n        Bo Nix at home against a Raiders defense that has given up over 200+ passing yds to Trevor Lawrence(220), Mahomes(286), Cam Ward(222), and Daniel Jones(212). \n      Nix in his last 5 games has thrown over 200 yds 3/5 games with exception he failed to get over 200 yds against Houston(173) and the New York Jets(174) both who have great Pass Defenses. In two division rival games the Raiders have not kept it close. The Chiefs smacked them 31-0 in Kansas City and the Chargers won 20-9 in Las Vegas. I expect Denver to be a tough place for the Raiders as well with the crowd and especially the high altitude. \n         As for our second leg, Dobbins has cleared over 50 yds rushing in 4/5 games with exception of 42 yds against the Jets. It should be noted that I don’t look at the jets game for much credibility because it was a London game and those games have been whack. So if we don’t even take into account the London debacle, Dobbins has been able to get atleast 50 yds every game even against the tough Houston defense, and Nix has only had trouble getting 200 vs the Houston d as well. \n       The Raiders have allowed Etienne,Pacheco,j Taylor to all go over 50 yds and only Pollard didn’t get over 50 yds and only ten carries with a dismal titans team that lost to the raiders. Denver should be able to have over 200 yds of passing and have at least 50 yds out of their great running back, let’s get 6 wins in a row. I normally worry about rival games but the raiders with their 0-2 record and very little fight don’t give me much worry, just stay away from whichever side Crosby is on Denver and you’ll be ok! best of luck everybody, let’s hopefully have very little to sweat. 😅",

Both teams have looked horrible in their own ways which I'll go into a bit more below, however one big note about tomorrow's match is AMKAL are currently only playing in this tournament for tomorrow so they have no other match to focus on, all of their prep/game plan should be going into this match, JiJieHao on the other hand have a playoff match at 7:30 EST. against GUN5 for CCT Series 10. This will almost certainly take higher priority for JiJiehao, as they are already in playoffs and CCT has a bigger prizepool overall meaning I don't think they will care about this match at all. (Not reason for pick, but think this is a factor)\n\n**JiJieHao:**\n\n* Their form has been extremely troubling as of late, things have been looking increasingly awful for this roster, they have lost 6 of their last 8 matches only beating Metizport (2x), while going 0-12 in maps in their losses. They haven't just lost but have gotten absolutely rocked in every match. In order of least to most recent, lost to Monte 13-3/13-9, lost to 1WIN 13-3/13-9, EYEBALLERRS 13-6/13-9, and Fire flux 13-7/13-5. In their last two matches they have subbed in sinnopsyy for ISSAA. These matches were played on 11/3 and 11/4 so I am expecting this to likely continue and sinnopsyy to play tomorrow. They have looked even worse with a sub if thats even possible losing to SINNERS 13-1/13-4 in a complete stomp and losing to SPARTA yesterday 13-5/13-10 both very one sided series\n\n**AMKAL:**\n\n* Won't spend too much time on them as they are bad too, but have their moments and on paper at least have a significantly better roster. They are 6-8 in the last month in matches overall, they are 0-2 at this tournament and also have a 0-4 record and lost mostly stomps, however this is a perfect match to get a much needed bounceback win. They have been in really rough form going 1-5 in their last 6 with a 5-10 record in maps overall, however I just have way more faith in a core roster of KaiR0n/mo0n/nafany/KENSI then I do of BOROS/m1n1/osamas/bibu.\n\n**Veto:**\n\n1. AMKAL ban Nuke, JiJieHao ban Overpass\n2. AMKAL pick Ancient/Inferno, JieJieHao pick Dust 2\n\n**Ancient Stats/Inferno Stats:**\n\n* AMKAL are 53% winrate on Ancient on 19 maps played in the L3 months, they are 4-4 in the last month\n* JiJieHao are 27% winrate on Ancient on 11 maps played in the L3 months, they are 0-3 in the last month\n* AMKAL are 56% winrate on Inferno on 9 maps played in the L3 months, they are 5-2 in the last month\n* JiJieHao are 22% winrate on Inferno on 18 maps played in the L3 months, they are 1-5 in the last month",

Hopefully, I can turn this around and get some positive returns going here.\n\nToday's TNF matchup is another interesting one that could be a defining moment for both teams moving forward for the rest of the season. The Raiders have done all but wave the white flag on the season and are teetering on the edge of completely falling out of the 2025 competition. With the Jakobi Meyers trade happening before the deadline, the Raiders will be looking to rely on Tre Tucker and Brock Bowers' production in the passing game even more than they have in prior weeks. With the combination of the Raiders' bottom 5 rushing attack, the Broncos banged up secondary and the expectation of them playing from behind for most, if not the entirety of the game, I believe these two players should clear these lines easily. Both Bowers and Tucker have cleared these lines in 4 of their last 5 appearances and I expect them to clear them tonight as well. If the Raiders want to have any chance of staying in this game they need to continue getting the ball into their two biggest threats through the air. \n\nTail or fade BOL to everyone and cheers! 🍻\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oxwyzx4gojzf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d582d1baae30f841b2a8ddc75c8a59e2a2f81e8",

      "text": "Record: 49-41\n\nIndykpol AZS Olsztyn - Trefl Gdańsk 🏐 Poland Plus Liga\n\nPick: Total Points Over (177.5) @ 1.55\n\nFirst of all, it's important to note that neither team is in a position to pull off a big victory. Olsztyn started the season with a tie-break loss to JSW, followed by a tie-break victory in Bełchatów (Skra), and a decisive 3-1 away win at Barkom on November 3rd. Trefl Gdańsk has added strength to their squad with strong summer signings (Piotr Nowakowski, Joseph Worsley, Tobias Brand, Damian Schulz, etc.). They beat Barkom 3-2 in the league opener, 3-0 against Ślepsk in Week 3, and lost 1-3 away to Resovia in Week 2. Total points of AZS Olsztyn in 3 matches in 2025/26: 2-3 against JSW (23-25, 25-19, 25-17, 18-25, 11-15) = 203; 3-2 against Skra (21-25, 25-18, 17-25, 25-19, 18-16) = 209; 3-1 against Barkom (21-25, 25-19, 27-25, 25-23) = 190. Trefl Gdańsk in 3 matches in 2025/26: 3-2 against Barkom (19-25, 25-20, 20-25, 25-19, 15-8) = 201; Resovia 2-3 (25-19, 23-25, 23-25, 25-23, 13-15) = 216; Ślepsk 3-0 (22-25, 23-25, 23-25) = 143. In the Barkom-Olsztyn match, Barkom made 32 unforced errors, Olsztyn 23; errors like these are a good sign for us to extend sets. I expect the match to go at least four sets, and I expect Trefl to not give up easily.",

      "text": "Record: 18-11\n\nLast Five Predictions (Old - New): ✅✅❌❌❌ \n\nNet Units: +15.44\n\nYesterday's Pick:  Inter (-2.0) vs Kairat Almaty AND Galatasaray (+1.0) vs Ajax. 3u @ 1.91\n\u000bAt this rate, I'm actually going to start selling my picks... if you want a team to underperform, message me and I'll put them in my POTD.  \u000b\u000bReally disappointing from Inter, who won 2-1. Gala dominated and won 3-0.\n\nToday's Pick:  Roma to win or draw vs Rangers and under 3.5 goals. 4u @ $1.61\n\nRoma travel to Ibrox to face a troubled Rangers side. \n\nRoma games have been incredibly low scoring so far. They've scored 10 league goals and have won 7 games with that.... Largely because they've only conceded five goals in that time. \n\nTheir results in Europe aren't great, with losses to Viktoria Plzen and Lille... However, these are both games where they dominated the numbers. Roma created 2.28 expected goals to Viktoria Plzen's 0.16, and lost 2-1. In the Lille game, Roma created 2.61 xG and Lille created 1.13, and Lille won 1-0. \n\nSo I'm not overly concerned about their European results, because their form is good. \n\nRangers have been horrible this season and have already sacked a coach. Now, I won't sit here and back Russell Martin as a great coach, but I'll say the issues at Rangers didn't start and stop with him. \n\nI can't see Rangers winning (settling for a draw is always an option with the new league format), and I can't this being a goal-fest either.",

      "text": "Record: 157-135, -1.44 units\n\nLast Pick: Jay Clarke ML vs Stefan Kozlov (-142, 1 unit): Win\n\nTennis | Helsinki Challenger | 10:30 AM EST (estimated)\n\nToday's Pick: Otto Virtanen vs Emil Ruusuvuori | **Virtanen ML at -137 (DK). 1 unit.**\n\nWrite-up: Clarke closed at -177, and ended up getting the win in an up-and-down three-set battle. \n\nThis should be a fun all-Finnish encounter in Helsinki, but it's also one where I believe one player holds a distinct advantage. Both of these players have risen from the ashes recently (Virtanen from an injury, Ruusuvuori from a mental health break). For that reason, the market has started to like them more and more, and you can see this in their falling odds against the same tier of player from the beginning of their comebacks to now. This makes it a bit tough to do odds analysis, since the magnitude of each player's rise is hard to quantify, and it's easy to make errors comparing prices from different tournaments. However, Virtanen's comeback has been especially impressive to me, as he made it through a decent draw in Roanne to capture the title in just his fourth tournament back. This is a great time of the season for Virtanen to make an impact, as indoor hard courts have consistently been his favorite surface throughout his career. His huge serve + 1 combination and generally aggressive game allow him to blow past opponents on the surface; in fact, 5 of Otto's 8 Challenger titles have come indoors. I will note that Helsinki plays a bit slower than most indoor hard courts, but the lack of wind and natural conditions are still beneficial for someone with a low-margin game. In his first round of this tournament, the market pushed Otto from -300 to -455 against Gauthier Onclin, showing the confidence it has in him in these conditions. He also went on to take the match in straight sets (7.18 performance rating). \n\nMeanwhile, Ruusuvuori got a solid first-round win as a sizable favorite over Lukas Neumayer, who tends to prefer clay courts (7.05 performance rating). There's no doubt that Emil enjoys these conditions as well, even if his game relies more on movement and clean ballstriking and less on power compared to Otto's. However, I can't quite say that he's had a breakthrough performance yet. A lot of people will rate the performance he put in against Mpetshi Perricard in Brussels highly, but it was kind of a lottery match in a way that a lot of GMP's matches tend to be. At the end of the day, I do think Virtanen's weapons should do more damage, and it's hard not to feel that he comes into this tournament with a bit more momentum. This isn't in 2-unit territory for me, but I would probably take it down to -145 or so. \n\nNote: The [POTD Capper Tracker](https://potd.lol), which you may remember from its Google Sheet days, is finally back in a cleaner, more robust website format!

Tom Ford was genuinely a stronger player and “casually” put together 3 frames before he was beat 6-3.

Surety’s been quietly putting together some really tidy stuff lately…that semi…final run at the World Open, his Crucible debut, and his recent victory over 6-3 victory over Neil Robertson… in the match today Surety won all his frame with DECIDING BREAKS. This shows he’s striking the ball sweetly and building confidence frame by frame. He’s knocking in tons more centuries than before, looks calm under pressure, and has won every deciding frame he’s played this season. That tells you he’s not just potting well but he’s holding his nerve when it really matters.\n\nMaguire’s always dangerous, but he’s still a bit hit-and-miss right now. To put a little psychological aspect, coming from a non-professional, HE SHAVED HIS FUCKING HEAD MID TOURNAMENT….Sure, he lifted the Championship League earlier this year, but in the longer format knockouts he hasn’t quite looked settled. In his match today vs Jiang Jun, if he was presented with every opportunity under the sun by Jun he wouldn’t have won. His cue changes and patchy form can open the door, and if Zak gets in early and finds his rhythm, he could easily dictate the pace. With the form he’s carrying, the heavier scoring, and that bit of confidence swagger, Surety’s got every chance to nick this one. \n\nFade if you’d like, since I believe I’m 1-3 with snooker picks but I believe this is the one I get back on track.\n\nLOW unit bet since he’s an underdog but 1.7U to win to win 2.2U seems like a solid look with lower risk.\n\nAs always BOL and believe everything you see",

Taking a look back at Feyenoord and their recent away games in Europe 12 out of 14 games have seen BTTS and with Stuttgart yet to blank at home this season I think the BTTS could be right on for us. Feyenoord are also in good scoring form, they've scored 18 goals in their last five games, Stuttgart have scored 8 in five.

      "text": "**Record:** 9-5\n\n**Net Units:** \\+3.13\n\n**Last Pick:**   Jacoby Brissett 250+ passing yards (-103 on DK) 1U to win .97U ✅\n\n**Todays Event**: 🏈 NFL Thursday Night Football Raiders @ Broncos 7:15pm CST 🏈\n\n**Todays pick**: Troy Franklin Any Time TD Scorer (+170 on DK) 1u to win 1.7u\n\n**Writeup:** Going a little riskier today. Franklin is top five in red zone targets throughout the league, and gets the most end zone targets on his team. He has high usage for bigger plays and is trusted to get the job done. This can be seen as he shares nearly 20% of his teams targets.  Franklin has been averaging 4.1 receptions and 7.1 targets, of which around 20% of his overall targets have been within the redzone\n\nRaiders are ranked 17th in red zone defense and 23rd in overall scoring defense. With the Broncos projected to score around 27 points, with 3 touchdowns. More so, Raiders give up the 10th most passing td's to the slot, Guess who's the main star for being the broncos slot WR? Two other teams on the top 5 passing td's to the slot also include the Cowboys and Giants, who Franklin scored against twice and once respectively. With a favorable matchup into the Raiders defense, there'll be more than a few chances for Franklin to be the one to bring one of em in.\n\nBroncos are coming off a game against the Texans who have one of if not the best defenses in the league. Going into an Thursday night divisional game, I'm sure the Broncos will try to get the ball rolling real quick leading to some early TDs.\n\nBOL to anyone tailing!\n\n[Tips Greatly Appreciated  ☕](https://buymeacoffee.com/pefpef)",

      "text": "POTD record: 29-18\n\nToday’s POTD: PSV vs Feyenoord - PSV ML(-150)\n\n8:30 AM EST, ESPN+\n\nI find this to be quite good value. PSV have been far and away the best team in the Netherlands for the last season and a half, and Feyenoord is a distant second. PSV has a 14 point lead on the table at this point, and a win tomorrow would essentially wrap the league up. Feyenoord have been in very poor form as of late(I'm a bit surprised their coach, one of my favorite former players Robin Van Persie hasn't been fired). PSV are winless in three(though two of which were very difficult UCL fixtures), after a blistering run of form, but Feyenoord have struggled to find any sort of consistent form since late October, since they lost to PSV at home. Since that match, Feyenoord has 5 wins, 2 draws, 10 losses. Very poor for their standards. PSV have also gotten the better of Feyenoord in their last four matches. PSV also has the best home record in the league(though not as good as their away record), a better offense and a better defense than Feyenoord. Feyenoord has struggled against top teams away from home. \n\nBOL!",

I’m all for civil discourse, but if you want to be negative under my posts take it elsewhere. Let the record show fading me isn’t smart. Thanks to those supporting, we keep moving. \n\nToday’s Pick: Illinois Vs Nebraska/ Over 148.5 (-155) 2u\n\nWrite up: I can’t get a read on either side of this game in terms of who’s gonna cover. But I do love the value we get with the total. The line opened at 152.5 and now it’s even at 150.5. Buying down 2 points at -155 is tremendous value. Illinois has been rolling with 8 straight victories while Nebraska is looking to bounce back. Illinois is battle tested and poised as we saw last week against Purdue. Nebraska is looking to create a bang in front of their home crowd. I don’t see a reason why either offense can’t explode for 75-80. We’re moving with caution so only sprinkle 2u, but I love this matchup. These two exploded for 163 last game and I don’t see that slowing down too much. Not to mention the potential for overtime and a chance for a plethora of late game free throws. Let’s take these two dawgs to score 149 points. Let me know if you’re riding with! Happy Sunday!\n\n\n\n\nIf you’d like to buy me a beer: [Venmo](https://venmo.com/u/Jay-Lawton-1) [CashApp](https://cash.app/$jaylaw930)",

Carlos is younger and probably has an easier time recovering from a match like that, but Djokovic has so much experience on tour, a good H2H against Carlos, and has never lost in the final here. \n\nHere is what I do know. Djokovic is undoubtedly the greatest serve returner of all time and he has had 3 or more breaks of serve in every match so far this tournament. Alcaraz hasn’t gotten broken too many times this tournament, but he has had a good amount of break points saved. Zverev 2/7 on break points. DeMinaur 2/7 on break points. Moutet 2/4. Hangman 1/7.\n\nI like Djokovic’s chances to get 3 or more breaks in this all timer of a match.\n\nGood Luck!",

Bet 2.25u\n\nWriteup: This game has teams of similar play styles, and it is typical for the better team to shine in this scenario. This better team would be Memphis, who has a top 50 defense against a Tulane offense outside the top 200. Beyond the defense, Memphis is simply better in every way besides slightly more consistent play from Tulane. Tulane could force some turnovers on defense, but their allowed field goal percentage is below 200th in the nation. On the flip side, Memphis’s allowed field goal percentage is top 30. This is simply the better team, and I expect the home crowd to back Memphis’s defensive play, who has the 18th best home effectiveness in NCAA basketball. Give me Memphis to show out for their fans and win by double digits.\n\nRemember to only bet what you can afford to lose, and BOL!",

In their first tournament with soulfly they struggled heavily bombing out to GamerLegion. So far this tournament they have improved a lot, beating GamerLegion in the opener, losing a close 2-1 to PARIVISION who might be the hottest team in the world right now, and beating paiN 2-0 yesterday.\n\n***Falcons:***\n\n* Falcons haven't played since BLAST where they went on a super impressive run without star rifler kyousuke which they got 2nd place upsetting Vitality, before losing 3-0 in the finals to PARIVISION. Kyousuke is back and they will be looking to start the year strong and get in title contention\n\n***Head to Head:***\n\n* These roster cores faced off 5 times in 2025, Aurora went 9-3 in overall maps against Falcons core, and beat them in 4/5 of the series overall taking at least a map in all of them\n* A lot of these matches are outdated in fairness, Aurora have gotten worse and Falcons got kyousuke. However. Aurora strategically have done well against Zonic and this matchup has been favorable\n\n***Veto:***\n\n* Aurora lower seed so Falcons gets selection, almost every team picked to veto 2nd with higher seed this tournament so far outside of Spirit being the one exception, expecting Falcons to do the same meaning Map 1 will be Aurora pick\n* Aurora ban Ancient, Falcons ban Overpass\n* Aurora pick Anubis\n\n**Anubis Stats:**\n\n* For those that don't know, Anubis was readded to the map pool to start 2026, it took the place of Train. There was no one happier about this then Aurora, these guys loved Anubis, they played it the most of any tier one team, they single handedly defined the Anubis meta and were for the entire time the map was out, the most dominant Anubis team in the world.\n* Falcons used to permanently ban Anubis, this was their old ban back when it was still in the map pool. Since it came back, it has not been their ban and they have been banning Overpass instead. Falcons for that reason have 0 maps played on Anubis as a core roster\n* Falcons played this map once since it was readded, they lost to Vitality 13-4 in brutal fashion looking quite poor throughout the series on the map.\n* Aurora as stated above are known for this map, in 2024 + 2025 combined this roster core went 40-13 while mostly playing top teams/tier one/1.5 teams on the map. A nearly 76% win rate on the map, they dominated every team on it and were so strong both tactically and with their rotations on the map\n* Aurora picked Anubis in their series against PARIVISION, they dominated on it 13-5 against one of the hottest teams in the world. That is the only time we have seen them play it as most teams are banning it against them",

He has hit this line in 7 out of 8 maps with average of 7.5 kills per game. He picked mostly Slardar, Earth spirit and Puck.

      "text": "**POTD Record:**  109 – 73 - 12\n\n**Previous:**  Chelsea -1 Asian Handicap - PUSH\n\n**Recap:**  Chelsea was down 2-0 at home vs West Ham and came back from the dead in the second half to win 3-2.  Heartbreak for West Ham, but at least we pushed. \n\n**New Event:**  Australian Open Final – Alcaraz vs Djokovic\n\n**Pick:**  Set 1 Over 8.5 Games & Over 3.5 Total Sets @ 1.85 (5 units)\n\nI love to watch quarter finals onwards for tennis slams and they never ever disappoint.  The bets may not always go as planned but the matches tend to be of great quality especially in the semis and finals.  These semis we just witnessed yesterday were perhaps the greatest semifinals I have ever seen, both going the distance to 5 sets with plenty of drama.  Alcaraz with cramps and vomiting, somehow surviving the last 3 sets in a 5+ hour match to beat Zverev, whom once again manages to implode and not close out the match.  In the other match, Djokovic managed to beat Sinner in a stunning 4+ hour upset.  I posted a pick for Djokovic to lose 3-0 and lost bad.  He was a 13 to 1 moneyline longshot to win.  Noone gave him a chance.  Yet he proved once again he is truly the GOAT.\n\nNow these two players go to the final of the Aussie Open but not without concerns.  Alcaraz was suffering from serious leg cramps and nausea and was unable to run for most of the 3^(rd) and 4^(th) sets.  Yes, he is only 22, and chances are he will recover quickly unless there is a more serious injury we do not know about.  While Zverev foolishly did not take advantage of his injured opponent, should this happen again to Alcaraz, Djokovic will be merciless.\n\nDjokovic, at 38 years of age, will be taking the court against the world’s number 1 ranked player less than 48 hours after his marathon victory.  He has been known to dig deep and has the strongest mental stamina ever seen on court.  However, this guy did not get any sleep until well after dawn yesterday and coming into play will not only be fatigue, recurring blisters he has been having and inadequate physical recovery time, but there are also questions whether he will be able to keep up with Alcaraz after long a 5-setter with Sinner. \n\nDjokovic is chasing his 25^(th) career Grand Slam title which would place him atop of all other tennis greats.  He has had it very easy until the semis of this tournament, and he may never get another chance to come into a final with such little exertion on the court overall.  Last year in the US Open he was toast by the time he got to the final, and had no energy left.  This time it is different, and he wants this one bad.  Beating Sinner and Alcaraz back to back would be a monumental accomplishment.  As far fetched as it sounds, if there is any man on the planet that can pull it off it is Djokovic.  I am definitely not betting against him anymore.\n\n**Leg 1 - Set 1 Over 8.5 Games**\n\nAlcaraz and Djokovic have played 10 previous H2H matches.  The only 2 matches that did not have at least 9 games were played on a Grass surface and Djokovic lost both as that is not his best surface to play.  The other 8 averaged at least 10 games.\n\n**Leg 2 - Over 3.5 Total Sets**\n\nGiven what may be perhaps the closest Djokovic may ever get to winning his 25^(th) title, and after the performance he put against the world’s #2 player, I just don’t think he will do down without a fight.  Meaning, even if Alcaraz wins it most likely will not be in straight sets.\n\nOn the flip side, if Djokovic manages to win this match, it would be even less likely that Alcaraz goes down in straight sets.  The kid is the #1 ranked player for a reason and up until his last match, he had not dropped a set the entire tournament.",

Oh well, I'll watch Barca get knocked out of something and make money out of their demise, if it's the last thing I do.

We know **Manchester City are totally out of form** and they were rocked back by some truly embarrassing defeats, for example, the recent schooling by Bodo/Glimt in the Champions League. Their **Premier League form doesn't look great** either as they've registered just **one measly win in their last 5 matches.** Nothing seems to work for the Citizens at the minute. Their gameplay is stale and consists of robotic passes back and forth, seemingly without any line breaking. Reijnders has been absolutely atrocious for them, not excelling at a single task (truthfully, he's barely average at anything), while Foden looks more like a passenger with each passing game. There's no sense of urgency and the team sits back and relaxes way too quickly when they're in front. Even the Norwegian robot, **Haaland is on a bit of a goal drought.** To make matters even worse, one of their few penetrative players, **Doku, is out** for this clash. On the other hand, *Spurs are on a bit of a roller coaster themselves with 0 wins in their last 5 Premier League outings,* but they did pick 3 hard fought draws in that time. And we all know, a draw is more than enough for us here.\n\nBased on the bogey team situation, the Doku absence, and general poor overall quality of City's gameplay, I'm backing the Spurs to get something out of today's game. BTTS Yes is also another good angle if you'd want to take that. BOL and let's watch another Premier League classic together ☘️🫡\n\n☘️ If I've made you some money via fades, please consider dropping a tip: [https://buymeacoffee.com/sigmabale](https://buymeacoffee.com/sigmabale)",

They're sitting 2nd in the table with **42 points from 19 games**, only one loss all season, and that +21 goal difference shows how solid they are at both ends. At home? Unbeaten ***7 wins, 2 draws from 9 matches***. The Yellow Wall is gonna be rocking, and that's not just hype; teams crumble there when BVB get on top early.\n\n\n‎BVB had a rough midweek in Europe (lost to Inter or whatever), but they always bounce back strong in the league. Their attack is clicking Guirassy and the boys are scoring for fun and Heidenheim's defense is basically an open door.\n\n‎**Ajax** are in decent nick this season, sitting 3rd with around **37 points from 20 games**, and their attack is firing on all cylinders ***39 goals scored so far***, averaging close to 2 per game overall. Away from home they've been leaky at the back sometimes (conceding 17 in 9), but up front? They've dropped 20 goals in those away matches alone, which is nuts , econd-most in the league for away scoring. Guys like Godts and the rest are clinical, and even if they're rotating after Europe or whatever, they still create chances like crazy against weaker sides.\n\n\n‎Excelsior?, their defense is a mess. They're down near the bottom, ***conceded 35 goals in 20 games (that's 1.75+ per match)*** , and it's worse away but home isn't much better they've shipped plenty at Woudestein too. They're struggling to keep clean sheets, only a handful all season, and against top teams they get opened up quick. Last time these two met earlier this year, Ajax won 2-1 (wait, no,actually Excelsior nicked a shock away win back then, but that was an outlier, historically Ajax smash them).\n\n\n‎",

That includes six victories by double-digits and all but two by eight or more points. To earn a 11th consecutive win on the road against a Top 10 foe will be no easy task, however, under head coach Brad Underwood, Illinois has earned six such victories over the last seven seasons—tied with Alabama for the most in the nation.\n\nAs for the Cornhuskers (20-1), they will rely on their stingy defense to bounce back after picking up their first loss of the season.\n\nThrough 21 games, Nebraska ranks 14th in the country in defensive efficiency (0.936). However, when the team has faced top offensive units—Illinois enters ranked first in the category (1.244)—the defense has struggled. In five contests against opponents that rank Top 40 in offensive efficiency, the Cornhuskers have conceded an average of 80.0 points on 47.8% shooting from the field (33.4% from beyond the arc). Furthermore, each opponent managed to shoot above 46% from the field and all but one topped 34% from long-range. That includes the Illini, who poured in 80 points on 48% shooting (34% from deep) in the previous meeting.\n\nThe X factor in this one is plain and simple: Keaton Wagler.\n\nThe freshman was pivotal in Illinois upset of then-No. 4 Purdue last week—46 points on 13-of-17 shooting—and he was equally as effective in the team’s 75-66 victory against Washington on Thursday, pouring in 22 points to go along with eight assists. The Illini will need hip to be on top of his game and get the rest of his teammates involved on Sunday.\n\nTrust Illinois to get revenge on the road.\n\nBOL if tailing, and as always, please do so responsibly.

I think the line was good given this is Leeds second game all season not scoring at home so not overly upset about it. \n\n**Event**: English Premier League: Tottenham vs. Manchester City 8:30am PST\n\n**POTD**: Manchester City ML (-143) 2u\n\n**Write up**:\n\nManchester city have had a rocky season so far, but since the additions of Guehi and Semenyo they have looked much stronger. Pep has been rotating to squad and it seems like the lineup is getting somewhat finalized currently, plus having Nunes back has made them look much more comfortable in the back. I will preface this pick by saying I am a City fan, so I watch every single game. If this match was a few weeks ago I would never make this pick, but these new signings have been incredible. I will also note that the Bodo game didn't include either of these players and city were missing a couple good pieces due to injury who are now back. \n\nWith Arsenal dropping points to United last week, City are still in this title race. A win against Spurs puts them only 4 points off the top (not to mention they will still play Arsenal at the Etihad later in the season). This is a must win for city, and I think they can come out on top. With Doku now out, this is a game for Foden and Marmoush to really prove themselves in this squad. Not to mention Haaland only scoring in 1 of their last 5 games. As someone that's seen City in this position the last few years, this is where the season turns around. \n\nSpurs have been extremely bad at home, sitting 19th in home record only winning 2 games all season. Recently losing at home to a squad like West Ham is further proof of how poor they've been. I've seen my team get railed by Spurs away a lot recently, but with the massive changes to their roster the past couple years, and the likes of Van De Ven and Porto out, I see city stealing this match. \n\n**FRIENDLY REMINDER**: for people who comment hate AFTER the picks don't hit, don't forget that you're coming to this thread looking for help because you aren't able to formulate your own picks. It's pretty pathetic seeing people comment on my post or other peoples posts AFTER picks don't hit. Do your own research and gamble responsibly.

I really enjoy late wins, I know some people dislike sweaty wins, but to me they make the game extra fun when you can win up until the last minute. Whatever side of that fence you're on, a big plus money win is a great way to start the weekend!\n\nToday we've got what should be a great matchup betwen 6th place Man United and 7th place Fulham. Two teams in great form - United are unbeaten in 7 matches and Fulham have only lost 1 match in their last 8. I'm giving United a slightly edge at home, but backing a Fulham player to land an SOT.\n\nChukwueze is a Nigerian winger on his first season with Fulham, having joined from AC Milan in the fall. He has only had a few matches with Fulham, having joined after the season started and being away at AFCON. That said, he has looked very promising when he has played. He scored 2 goals vs Man City back in December and hit a great equalizing goal as a sub in their last match against Brighton. I'm expecting him to get a start here and find an SOT against United. Keep in mind, he has only started a handful of games this season, so while I believe he will start based on form, there's always a chance he does not. \n\nBOL and happy Sunday!\n\n**EDIT - I found out after posting that his mother just passed recently, I did not realize prior to this pick.

Under Unai Emery, Villa’s wide pressing and forward-passing philosophy has been consistently emphasised in press conferences, with Emery explicitly stating his team must “drive forward, control the ball and create danger” rather than sit back when missing key players like Watkins, Tielemans, Kamara and McGinn. This approach inherently opens up transitional spaces, particularly when Villa are missing midfield shielding. Brentford boss Keith Andrews has also stressed his squad must attack with intent on the road and not just counter-attack, a mindset reflected in recent comments about taking the game to opponents even after narrow losses. Statistically, Villa average around 12.2 shots per game with Brentford averaging 10.1 shots per game in recent fixtures, and both teams often register shots on target figures near 4–5 per match, showing real offensive activity from both sides. Across H2H and recent meetings, combined matches frequently reach 20+ shots with balanced xG profiles, indicating that expected goals from both sides are healthy rather than one-sided. Historical match data also show xG totals often above \\~2.3 combined, meaning both teams create chances rather than hitting a single goal and sitting in. With Villa’s forward-driven set-ups and Brentford’s proactive intent — plus injuries that weaken defensive cohesion — the tactical scene, combined with shot and xG volume, makes BTTS Yes a compelling expectation rather than a marginal outcome.",

Free. Wake Forest didn't want that smoke. Down 18 at the half, and Williams ate for the Wolfpack. At least they beat the heavy snow accumulation. It's about all Wake can beat these days.*\n\nLet's start with the elephant in the room. This line is low, yes *low,* for two reasons, and their names are Devin Vanterpool and Kanaan Carlyle. All things being equal, I believe Florida Atlantic should be favored by north of 19 points. But things aren't equal. FAU is the vastly superior team, but it may take a vastly superior *team* effort to clear 11.5 points. Reason being: neither Vanterpool nor Carlyle played in the Owls' previous game - Thursday's 92-65 mollystomping at the hands of a .500 Memphis squad. They're currently listed as game-time-decisions for today's game against hapless East Carolina (6-15). Both these guys average 30+ minutes for FAU (14-8). Vanterpool leads the team in scoring (16.0) and rebounding (6.7). He also adds 2.6 assists and 1.6 steals per game, and makes 35.8 percent of his threes. To say the offense runs through him is an understatement. And Carlyle is no slouch, either. He's second on the team in scoring (14.7) and leads in assists (3.3). Both players have a higher than 56 true shooting percentage. If - and it's a big if - they can go today, this line *will* rise. That's why I'm grabbing it now. And if they can't play, I think FAU has enough in the tank to take care of an incredibly-poor East Carolina side that refuses to cover anything this season and cannot shoot their way out of a paper bag. Let's dive in...\n\nWe start with a recent common opponent. I played Rice at +2.5 against ECU on Jan. 28. Rice shot 42 percent from 3, held the Pirates to 4-of-19 shooting from beyond the arc, and finished with a six-point win on the road. This is the same Rice team that has lost six straight against FAU by an average margin of 12.8 points. After FAU's embarrassing display at Memphis, East Carolina - *at home* \\- presents the *perfect* get-right game as the Owls try to keep pace with Atlantic Athletic Conference-leading Charlotte. FAU is one game back in the standings, and they're looking to snap a two-game losing streak. I'm not saying they want to rush Vanterpool and Carlyle back to take care of bottom-feeding ECU, but there is *some* urgency here. FAU's next game is Tulsa, winners of five straight and currently sitting a half-game up on FAU. If Vanterpool and Carlyle can play, I believe they will get close-to-typical minutes to find a rhythm and prepare for Tulsa on Wednesday. The AAC is widely considered a two-bid conference. Right now, Charlotte is one, and third-place FAU might be on the outside looking in. They need to set things right against ECU and keep it going against Tulsa. Like I said, there's urgency here. Everyone will feel it. Hence, why 12 points feels low even without FAU's big two.\n\nNext, don't lose sight of the fact that ECU is bad. Real bad. They're 7-13 against the spread this season and 1-6 straight up on the road. They've never won in four games at Boca Raton, and they won't today. They're also allowing 90.2 points per game at FAU. Meanwhile, the Owls are 9-1 at home and winning games in friendly confines by an average margin of 20.9 points. Granted, this stat leans heavily on Vanterpool and Carlyle's contributions. When those two play, FAU covers 70 percent at home. When each plays and scores at least 15 points, FAU is 8-3 ATS. Basically, we are taking this bet and praying for a good injury report tomorrow. What makes me hopeful is that Carlyle was a late scratch for the Memphis game. However, he's dealing with a calf, which are ...tricky injuries for explosive guards. Vanterpool wasn't even listed on the injury report for Memphis, so his absence is particularly curious. We're going to know a LOT more around noon Sunday. I can see laddering this line up as it increases with good news. The contrarian play would be to take ECU at +12.5, +13.5, +14.5 if we learn that Vanterpool and/or Carlyle are definitely out.\n\nKenPom ranks FAU 106th and ECU 274th. The Owls have offensive and defensive rating in the 110s. Their adjusted tempo is 35th. ECU's offense (323), defense (168), and pace (106) simply can't hang with a healthy FAU. As of this writing, KenPom puts the spread at 13.5, which seems to incorporate the injuries. Bart Torvik has it as a 20-point win for FAU, which I would welcome, but that's all mental gymnastics if Vanterpool and Carlyle both sit.\n\nMy thesis (oh hell, call it my hope): Vanterpool and Carlyle are healthy enough to play, and they will as FAU tries to keep up in league play. If they do, this line is an absolute steal. If they don't, we're counting on ECU to continue to play terrible basketball. The Owls are 13-7 ATS this year, and they crushed the Pirates, 81-53, in their previous meeting last season. ECU is dead last in the NCAA in 3-point shooting percentage, so don't expect comeback power or offensive surges. They want a slugfest. They want a grind. FAU wants to run. The Owls are averaging 81.9 points to ECU's 68.3. FAU needs this. ECU is just happy to be somewhere that's not frozen with snow.\n\nGood luck and Godspeed!\n\nPOTD tracker: [https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/Seventh\\_\\_Place-z37cn7](https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/Seventh__Place-z37cn7)\n\nIf I've made you a few bucks through fades, it's just gonna ask you a few questions: [https://buymeacoffee.com/seventh\\_\\_place](https://buymeacoffee.com/seventh__place)",

      "text": "Record: 3-3\n\nUFC: Volkanovski vs Lopes $1.7 odds\n\n3pm AEDT\n\nAlexander Volkanovski should beat Diego Lopes because he’s the more complete, disciplined fighter with proven five-round cardio, elite fight IQ, and the ability to neutralise Lopes’ biggest weapon — explosive finishing. Volk’s constant pressure, feints, and volume striking force opponents to fight at his pace, while his wrestling defence and clinch control reduce the chaos Lopes relies on to create submissions or big moments. Over time, Volk’s consistency, experience in championship fights, and ability to make mid-fight adjustments should allow Alexander Volkanovski to outwork and outthink Diego Lopes, likely winning rounds through control, output, and composure rather than taking unnecessary risks. Additionally, Volk beat him in the last fight by unanimous decision.",

CST\n\nBacking this to be an incredibly exciting and close to even final. Alcaraz is looking to complete the career grand slam and Joker is looking for number 25. I expect this one to be tight and Alcaraz is probably in better form but what we saw from Joker last round was nothing short of incredible. We saw him playing insane defense and controlled aggression. He’s gonna have to do that again and no sense in not backing that. I expect Alcaraz to come out hot and Joker to settle in. IMO the crowd can push Joker to winning atleast 1 set here and who knows maybe even the whole thing. One of these players may 3-1 or 3-2, but I highly doubt a straight sets here\n\n[PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/micahpugh?locale.x=en_US)\n\n[Venmo](https://venmo.com/u/Micah-Pugh)",

Aston Villa at home have 8 wins, 1 draw and 2 losses (18:9 goal ratio), while Brentford away have 3 wins, 0 draws and 8 losses (12:20 goal ratio). Villa have some injuries but I don’t think they’ll lose or draw.\n\nVilla seems to be in a far superior position here.\n\nAlso keep in mind that I try not to overthink my picks. They mainly consists of taking a few minutes to look at stats, form and line ups and if I get that “hmm, looks good” feeling then I post it. It has worked out well so far.\n\nBOL!",

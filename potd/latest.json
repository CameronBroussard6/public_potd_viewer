Heat is ranked #1 in pace this season whilst Bulls are ranked 4th, expect a high speed high scoring game here which is golden for assist props. Cup game should mean starters playing more minutes with every point mattering, lost minutes last game due to foul trouble but should be in store for 30+ minutes here at least.\n\nWith 29+ minutes Davion is over in 7/10 games this season avg 8 assists per game & 13.6 potentials per game. Over in 3/3 H2H against the Bulls with those same filters Avg 8.3 assists per game.\n\nDavion is leading the Heat team in passes made per game, assists per game and potential assists per game, so expect Davion to keep facilitating and run the offense in what should be a great game.",

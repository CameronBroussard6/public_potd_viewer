The bookmakers themselves set the line at 3.5 goals for this match. I personally see it in the same range, around 3–4 goals, with Al-Nassr as the clear favorite.\n\nWhen it comes to goal distribution, Ronaldo will certainly be involved, but in my opinion his odds are not worth it. After the recent home defeat, I definitely see the edge here with the home team, who are also in good form. With winter in Europe, it definitely makes sense to take a look at the warmer region.\n\nGL!",

Liverpool have quality going forward, but they’ve shown vulnerability defensively this season, particularly when facing teams that attack with pace and width. I expect Arsenal to dominate large spells of the game, create more clear chances, and put Liverpool under constant pressure. With the current momentum and home advantage, a convincing win is very realistic, which makes the -1 line strong value here.\n\nGood Luck! ✌️",

This is the Trophee des Champions, but Ligue 1 stats are still relevant. Anyways. Last time these two teams mets, Marseille won 1-0. However, then, Marseille was at home (this one is at a neutral venue) and PSG had a lot of missing players, the squad is fuller now. Before that, PSG had won the last 5 H2H. I think PSG will pull this one through. \n\nArsenal is the top team in the premier league with 40 goals scored, Liverpool has conceded 28 goals. I just think Arsenal to score is a relatively safe odds booster. You can skip it if you feel better taking just PSG to win at 1.51. BOL!",

I expect avs to push hard early, expose the sens heavy legs and lead them before the first intermision.\n\ngolie matchup is the biggest reason this spread covers. wedgewood has been standing on his head for the avs with 2.17 gaa and .918 sv%, basically stealing games even when the avs top line take a shift off. meanwhile the sens are forced to roll out sogaard because merilainen got the start in utah. he has holes in his game. big holes. were talking a career 3.64 gaa and a .880 savve%. against the highest volume shooting team in the league (nearly 35 shots on net per night),  soggard is bound to get lit up like a christmas tree. the analytics on high danger save percentage for sogaard suggest that if colorado generates their average xg (expected goals), this is a 5-2 or 6-2 blowout waiting to happen. \n\nsens pk is absolute trash. dead last in the league at 71.4%. Even if avs PP isn't clicking to their max potential right now(its around 16%, 26th in the leaugue), they are gonna score on the worst PK if they have the chance. The 16% for avs team on the PP is an anomaly for that kind of team and its due for progression.  especially when sens PK  killers are slow to close gaps because of the travel fatigue. on the oither hand, avs pk is #1 in the league (85.7%), completely neutralizing the one weapon the sens actually have (their PP). mackinnon is angry and hungry right now. We could seen that in the last game against in tampa, in the last mintues where he was clearly frustrated with the result and his plays. and an angry natedogg is a terrifying thing for a visiting defense ( if anyone is gonna watch tonights game, youll see what i mean. that guy is just an absolute beast when he starts to get frustrated). hes gone two games without a point despite pumping  10 shots on net, which for a guy leading the rocket race means positive regression is coming. hes putting up 4.57 shots per game. plus with toews out, makar is playing massive minutes, basically quarterbacking the entire game from the back end. the sens defense allows way too many controlled entries and against the avs speed through the neutral zone. \n\nhistory shows that the avs have absolutely owned the sens, winning the last 9 matchups out of 10 and covering the puck line in 7 of them. Thius game is about favorable matchups across every single metric. we fade tired, traveling team with a third string golie in net against a rested juggernaut looking to bounce back from a loss to tampa. \n\nBet responsibly and good luck to yall! 🍀🍻",

      "text": "**Record 1-0**                             \n\n**POTD: Bam Adebayo over 13.5 Points, $1.72 Odds.**\n\nBam Adebayo to score Over 13.5 Points is a pick that had me on the fence, however im taking it due to the fact that his previous matchups were actually quite hard. Playing PF against the wolves meaning Gobert and Randle will lock you up. And the match before that being against the Pelicans was actually bait, as Zion was guarding Bam Adebayo, plus Norman Powell was popping off and he played below 30 minutes at 29 as it was somewhat of a blow out. However I think that Bam should get enough looks against the Bulls as their top 5 in Pace, as well as the fact that Matas Buzelis will be playing PF and is nowhere near strong enough to stop Bam Adebayo, due to height and size. Last time they played Bam had 18 Points and went to the charity stripe with 8-10 FTs. Matas only played 19 minutes and Patrick Williams likely went on to guard him and if it was Jalen Smith he was concussed recently and is questionable so even if he does play im not sure if he's 100 percent ready due to Zach being out. This was said due to the fact that with all the injuries its likely Matas will be forced to continue to play PF unless he moves to SF which is unlikely with Issac Okoro being healthy. But the Bulls are number 1 with allowing restricted area attempts at 31.3 attempts a game and it jumps to more as if it's within less than 8 feet it jumps to 41.3 attempts which is where Bam mainly does damage.\n\nThe only issues/con is ball distribution as Tyler Herro is back (most likely off the bench again tho) and potentially a blow out however I think with Bulls being at home and the Pace they play, we should see 30 minutes from Bam hopefully. Kel Ware could also end up being the one scoring.",

Neither are high scoring and neither have great underlying stats. But Cremonese are notable in that they are the biggest xG overperformers in Italy and that by the underlying stats, they should be rock bottom with zero wins. Contrasted with Cagliari who 'deserve' their 14th position. Creomonese may have hit a wall where the number start catching up with them as they have no goals in their last four while Cagliari have still been scoring and being competitive against bigger sides like Juve, Milan and Atalanta. I think the smart money is for Cagliari here as this match could go any way but the numbers have shown Cagliari to be the better team. Taking them DNB nulls a lot of the risk of this ending as a miserable draw.\n\n**Additional Thoughts**: What a win! What a way to say goodbye from Semenyo and we march on with another unit to our name. We've created a nice little buffer for ourselves already.",

Edmonton (2nd Pacific) comes in having shelled Nashville with 43 shots in a 6-2 win Tuesday, whereas Winnipeg (last NHL) just lost 4-3 in OT to Vegas, extending their winless streak to 10 games and mustering only 20 shots of their own. Edmonton also has the best power-play in the league at 33.9% to Winnipeg's 19th-ranked 18.8%. Furthermore, the Oilers have won the last 3 and 5 of the last 7 H2H.\n\nUltimately though, it's about trajectory. Edmonton is looking to keep pace in a competitive Pacific division going 6-4-0 L10 while Winnipeg is simply trying to figure out how to win a game. I certainly don't expect it to be a walk: this rivalry tends to bring a competitive edge and sandpaper that may help Winnipeg, but ultimately, they simply don't have the class to keep up with Connor McDavid and Co. The Over at 6.0 is also appealing as neither side has particularly good goaltending, but as with the Habs-Flames game today, goalies step-up when provincial pride is at stake.\n\n**Injuries**: Edmonton will be without Adam Henrique, placed on injured reserve Wednesday through the Olympics, and Jake Walman hasn't yet been cleared, should be back next week. Winnipeg D-man Haydn Fleury was stretchered off the ice Tuesday, but the injuries aren't as severe as initially believed, but he's out as well.\n\n**Prop Bonus:** McDavid had 3G and 10 SOG last game, and Leon Draisaitl is also hard to keep off the scoresheet. On the other end of the ice, Kyle Connor has 8pts (5G3A) over his last 7 games, only held off the scoresheet twice (though one of those was against these same Oilers). Jets captain Mark Scheifele was also held scoreless in that last Edmonton game, but has at least 1 point in his previous 9 matchups against the Oilers.\n\n**BoL and play responsibly. Comment if you tail or fade if that's your thing, or don't, I'm not your mom.**",

These two know each other inside out, but familiarity has never meant caution. When they meet, games tend to open up rather than tighten.\n\nThe last time they faced off, Atlético made a real statement, putting five past Real in a chaotic 5–2 win. It was one of those derbies where the structure disappeared early and both sides just kept attacking. That result alone shows how unpredictable and goal-heavy this matchup can be. Even beyond that game, recent derbies have consistently seen both teams on the scoresheet, with results like 2–1 and 1–1 cropping up regularly.\n\nReal Madrid have actually struggled to fully control this fixture in normal time over the past couple of seasons. Wins have been hard to come by, clean sheets even harder. Atlético always seem to find a way to score against them, whether it is through quick transitions, set pieces, or sheer pressure in big moments. On the other side, Real rarely fail to create chances in games of this magnitude, especially with the attacking quality they bring into finals and semi finals.\n\nWith both teams coming in confident and in strong form, it is hard to see either sitting back. A Super Cup semi final encourages risk, not caution, and history suggests this derby usually rewards that approach. Goals at both ends feel likely again, and with the tempo these games normally have, pushing past two and a half goals makes sense.\n\nBTTS and Over 2.5 goals is the way I am playing it.\n\nBest of luck.",

Neither side is in great form, but both are organised enough to suggest this could be another tight and cautious game. Cremonese have been good at keeping matches close, even when results haven’t gone their way. Four of their last five games have seen fewer than two goals, including narrow 1–0 losses to Fiorentina and Torino, and a goalless draw away at Lazio. This shows they are defensively solid, but they continue to struggle to create chances and score goals.\n\nAfter a promising start together, strike partners Jamie Vardy and Federico Bonazzoli have struggled to find the net, and Cremonese now risk going five straight Serie A matches without scoring for the first time. Results at home haven’t been great either, with three defeats in their last four matches in Cremona. That said, history does offer a small positive. Cremonese have won their last three top-flight home meetings against Cagliari, scoring eight goals along the way. While this comes from a different era and squad, it’s still a detail worth noting. Cagliari come into this match with mixed results, but they have shown slightly more attacking threat than Cremonese. They picked up a 2–1 away win at Torino and followed that with a 2–2 draw at home against Pisa. Those positives are balanced out by narrow losses to AC Milan and Atalanta, where they were beaten 1–0 and 2–1.\n\nAway from home, Cagliari often struggle to control games for long periods. They conceded twice against Atalanta and, even in their win at Torino, allowed the hosts plenty of space. Defensively, they have conceded 25 goals in 18 matches, which is among the weaker records in this part of the table. Still, they remain competitive as four of their last five games were either decided by a single goal or ended in a draw. That keeps them in matches, but it rarely allows them to set the pace.\n\nBoth teams are used to playing in low-scoring matches. Cremonese, in particular, have seen four of their last five games finish with very few goals, while Cagliari rarely get involved in open or high-tempo contests when playing away from home. Neither side shows the attacking volume or efficiency needed to turn games into goal-heavy affairs.\n\nThe numbers back this up. Over 2.5 goals hasn’t been seen in any of Cremonese’s last five matches, in most of their recent games overall, and in a large number of Cagliari’s matches as well. Everything points toward another tight and cautious contest, with both teams’ playing styles likely to keep chances and goals to a minimum. With home advantage, Cremonese should at least be able to avoid defeat here. This feels like a match that could easily end in a draw, but I’ll side with the home team to either edge a narrow win or, at the very least, come away with a point.\n\n**NOTE: Please only stake what you can afford to lose; know that no picks are 100% guaranteed to hit.

Both of these players are strong servers, and these indoor British courts are quite fast, but Monday only really needs one break to cover this. In general, the conditions should suit Monday's game better, as Gentzsch's best career results have come on clay. Gentzsch can pull off some nice shots off both wings, but I expect Monday's lefty forehand to be a huge factor here.",

On the other hand, it doesn't matter how good of a season they're having, once they face Barcelona, they play like they haven't seen a ball before. But they're up against Real Madrid today so we're good.\n\nReal Madrid arrive into this fixure in decent form, but their results don't show just how scrappy their wins truly were. Except for the Betis game, they looked pretty poor and struggled to break down defensive opponents, while being manhandled on the other end. They even struggled against 9-men Getafe. Atletico Madrid could cause them a lot of trouble with their compact defence and lots of physicality in the build-up play, as well as the final third (something the current Madrid defence seems to really struggle with). We saw how **they sailed to a 5-2 victory in their first clash this season,** and I really feel a similar showing from the Atleti today. Their **form** isn't stellar, but it's **good enough** not to give me any headaches ahead of this pick. I still fully trust them to get it done.\n\nHere are some fun stats for you: **Real Madrid have beaten Atletico in regulation time only once in their last seven meetings and have not kept a clean sheet against them since 2021.** Alongside **Kylian Mbappe,** Los Blancos will also be **missing** Eder Militao and Brahim Diaz, while Trent Alexander-Arnold and Dean Huijsen face late fitness tests. *Yes, Gonzalo balled out the last time he was trusted to start,* but this Atletico defence is built different and should keep him relatively quiet. Taking everything into consideration, this really gives me even more optimism for the pick at such odds. If you want to go down the BTTS Yes route, I don't mind that either, but I've gone for the match outcome pick. I think it's going to be a relatively low scoring game in which Atletico just about overcome their opponent, but just in case this goes into extra time, we have the DNB to bail us out. Going in with just the one standard unit to preserve my bankroll for the cup final, as well as the European club competitions once they're back. BOL and let's get ready for another banger ☘️🫡",

That reminded me exactly why I’d stopped with the overs on double faults and I’ll be doing the exact same this year. To put it into context, I’m 6-6 on the overs and 16-5 for the unders on this thread so I should’ve known. Despite it seeming that Sakkari couldn’t miss a first serve all match she was dominated by Gauff who even had her forehand firing all match. As a result it was a shorter match than anticipated which reduced double faults probabilities by quite a bit, ending on one which came in the final game of the match.\n\nWatching Badosa these days is really tough when you know just how good she can be as a player. The former world number 2 definitely has the level to be a top 5 player but her chronic back issues let her down time and time again so plays sporadically and often out of form. When she’s on though the Spaniard is unbelievable and showed it by reaching the AO semis last year. She’s facing the current number 5 Rybakina who is in the form of her life in my opinion, culminating in winning the WTA Finals last year. The former Wimbledon champ just seems unstoppable at the moment with her huge hitting being a real issue for opponents.\n\nAnyways this line is simply priced wrong when you consider the game line is 20.5. It feels like the market has just used the fact she df’d 13 times last round but it was a match that featured 31 games so the raw data by itself doesn’t mean much (and is just one match). Badosa has averaged a 6% double fault rate over the past year on hard courts. Using both players’ serving/returning + ELO stats I get an estimated 4.3 double faults from the Spaniard across the 21 games (67 service points). That gives this play an approximate 84% chance of winning hence the unit size. I am quite worried that Badosa will walkover if things aren’t going her way (especially as she withdrew in doubles) but at the worst it’ll be push. Also will flag that their matches have been competitive, mostly going the distance (4-4 H2H) but this should be routine for Elena considering their polar opposite forms.

Before today it was big, but with City dropping points for the third matchweek in a row, you can expect Arsenal to come absolutely guns blazing against Liverpool.**\n\nArsenal are currently unbeaten at home this season in all competitions, and anyone who has watched this side knows why. Whether it's immense pressure off the rip or an eventual set-piece goal that unlocks the floodgates at some point, this Arsenal side will put your Goalkeeper into probably the most stressful 10-15 minute span of their career. When you couple this with the fact that Arsenal lost to Liverpool earlier this season, tomorrow is going to be their biggest get back yet.\n\nThese big games are what Arsenal live for, looking at 3-1 Bayern, 4-1 Aston Villa, 4-1 Tottenham, 4-1 Atletico Madrid. I'm expecting a similar scoreline with the stakes being at the best they've been for this side. \n\n**Arsenal at home this season. 14 Games played**\n\n* **13 wins, 1 draw, 0 losses**\n* **Line has hit in 7/8 of their last Home games**\n* **Scored 37 goals across those games, with an Average of 2.64 Goals scored per Home game**\n* **Arsenal have covered this line in their last 3 Home games against Liverpool**\n\n**BOL**",

      "text": "16-7, +8.56u\n\n*Last 5:* ❌❌✅✅✅\n\n**CFP - Ole Miss vs Miami, 7:30 pm EST, ESPN**\n\n***Miami +7.5/Total u56.5 (-119) 1.5u***\n\nThe first of 5 football picks I’m firing on this week/weekend brings us to the Fiesta Bowl, as Miami takes on Ole Miss for a berth in the College Football Playoff final.\n\nMy combo prediction comes down to a trend I like that I expect to carry throughout the game. *Even though it’s manic to try and equate regular season college football to playoff college football*, finding the edge today comes down to finding what stands out the very most - and the **inconsistency in the Ole Miss coaching staff may end up their undoing**.\n\n*It was announced yesterday that Charlie Weis Jr. and running backs coach Kevin Smith will coach against Miami*, **however Tight ends coach Joe Cox and wide receivers coach George McDonald are out** - as much as this may not seem like a big deal, **losing specialty coaches at any point of the season is a deterrent to success**, especially when they’re on the offensive end in college football specifically.\n\nThe main characters are pretty balanced - Miami QB Carson Beck **completes passes at a nation leading 75% rate**, and Miami rush the ball at a standard 4.1 YPA. Ole Miss QB Trinidad Chambliss isn’t too bad himself - *he’s only thrown 3 INTs* to Becks 10 this season. Their rush attack is more pronged and slightly better at 4.6 YPA.\n\nNot many SEC teams have been able to stop Ole Miss, but they’ve not been able to keep most teams off the field, either. In fact, **Ole Miss allow opponents more time of possession, add that to the fact Miami average 33:32 of field time per game (5th in the country), in a playoff setting, this is where I lean** - Miami sets the tone: **Miami has hit the 1H Game Total Under in 13 of their last 14 games at 24.5 points**. The full game total we are playing here has **hit the under in all but 1 game** & **Miami have covered +7.5 in every game this season.**\n\nI believe Miami can stranglehold Ole Miss on both sides of the ball… Yes, *Ole Miss possess one of the most elite offensive units in college football*, but if they can’t get/stay on the field, it’ll be hard to show their cards, **especially if they end up in a situation where coaching matters**. Miami are way more comfortable in low scoring games as they’ve proven throughout the season, and especially the last couple of weeks.\n\nLast play review:\n\n**NHL - San Jose/Los Angeles, o5.5 Total Goals** ✅ \n\n(We’ve gotten some luck over the last 3 weeks but almost nothing compares to last night… 0-0 after 1, 1-1 after 2… then bam. 4 goals in the 3rd to send it to OT and cash us. I’m on a decent heater, but a lot of my wins are also drenched in a bit of good fortune. I will say - there should have been 6 goals in the first 2 periods alone so I’m glad this cashed)\n\nBOL if you’re tailing, and if not BOL in general.",

Worst case, Miami runs away with it should Chambliss get injured.",

They attempt the most field goals per game at 80.3, and make the most field goals per game at 34.6 which include a league high 12.5 3 pointers.\n\nThe recent return of Owen Foxwell to the lineup has also boosted this team's offense. He has scored 8 points (on minutes restriction), 17, 17, and 16 points since recovering from his thigh injury.\n\nOn the other hand, Illawara has been fairly inconsistent throughout this season, sitting at an 8-13 record. They managed to blow out a bottom of the league Cairns side but are 1-4 in their last away games. Stats wise Illawara are on the complete opposite spectrum as their counterparts ranking 6th in PPG, 10th in 3PA, and 9th in 3FGM. \n\nLooking at h2h, Illawara did manage to win a thriller at home against Melbourne where they scored 21 more 2-pointers than South East but only squeaked out a 4-point win. Their last away game vs Melbourne was a 116-76 blowout loss. \n\nAll in all, expect this South East wagon to continue rolling, once they get out to an early lead and shots start falling, I don't think they'll look back and will cruise to a comfortable win.\n\nBOL!",

Unfortunate that Chelsea had an early 22' red card that changed the game and really spoiled our chances. Enzo was looking promising before that as well. Nothing we can really do about that, we move onward. \n\nBig match today as Arsenal hosts Liverpool. Liverpool are unbeaten for 9 matches, Arsenal unbeaten in 7. There is a lot of drama/bad blood here as people are already crowning Arsenal the EPL champs, while Liverpool are obviously the defending champions. Szoboszlai had an interesting interview earlier in the week, essentially stating that Arsenal haven't won't anything yet and it's only January. Liverpool is going to come to play. \n\nSzoboszlai is a midfielder for Liverpool who has been shifting around positionally like many Liverpool players have lately. Since Salah left the starting lineup, he has taken penalties, played further forward, and looked really good for Liverpool. This has hit in 7 of his last 11 matches and he has had 9 SOTs in those 11 matches. Arsenal do not give up a lot of SOTs, but with Szoboszlai in his current form and the drama floating around this potential \"passing of the torch game\" I like him to show up and land an SOT today. He also scored a goal in the reverse fixture at the start of the season. \n\nBOL and happy Thursday!",

They now meet in the Semi’s with the winner facing Indiana/Oregon in the National Championship in Miami. #10 Miami (12-2) faced #6 Texas A&M (11-1) in the 1st rd, winning the game 10-3, after RB Mark Fletcher torched them for 172 rushing yards on 17 carries & their defense was also elite with 3 turnovers, allowing just 4.3 yards per play. They then faced defending champs #2 Ohio State (12-1) next rd & were once again dominant on defense. They intercepted OSU QB Julian Sayin twice, with a Pick 6 on the way to a 24-14 win. They made history as the 1st double digit seed to make the semi’s in the expanded playoff & now face a red hot Ole Miss team that is riding into the game on a 7 game win streak with just 1 loss this season. #6 Ole Miss took on #11 Tulane (11-2) at home, destroying them 41-10 despite giving up 421 yards. Next rd was a rematch with their only loss this season vs #3 UGA (12-1). Ole Miss came out on top after a game winning FG with 6 seconds left. Ole Miss has now won 2 games without their head coach Lane Kiffin, who left the school after the regular season for a new job at LSU. On his way to LSU he brought all his assistants. With the transfer portal in full swing they’ve been splitting time between LSU/Ole Miss despite the massive upcoming game vs Miami. It’s been confirmed that their OC Charlie Weiss Jr will be calling plays. But we do know Miami doesn’t have these problems & has a coaching staff fully committed to prepping for Ole Miss. A huge part of the game plan will be running the ball down Ole Miss’s throats. No one ran more times on Ole Miss than UGA did their first game this season, rushing 49 times for 221 yards. But the 2nd time, UGA OC Mike Bobo abandoned the run despite UGA RB Nate Frazier avg 5.7 ypc. It didn't work. Miami did the opposite in their 2 games. Miami controlled the clock for over 33 minutes vs OSU. Miami’s offense is built around a dominant beastly OL. They control possessions & pound opposing DL’s. The way to beat Ole Miss is on the ground, Miami spent the last 2 games showing they can do that.\n\nMiami RB Mark Fletcher has been an animal this playoffs. Fletcher has racked up 262 yards on 36 carries in 2 games. After rushing for 172 yards vs A&M in the 1st rd, he followed it up with 90 yards vs OSU, one of the best run defenses in the nation. He became the 1st player to run for 90 yards on OSU since 11/30/2024. OSU's defense ranked #4 in opponent adjusted yards after contact, #8 in explosive run defense, & top 5 in rushing yards allowed. Miami became the first team all season to score 16+ points on OSU. Now he faces an Ole Miss D that has given up 80+ rushing yards to 3 straight RB’s & 167 rushing ypg in their last 3. That’s more than DOUBLE what OSU allowed per game all season (84.1 ypg). Ole Miss ranks 132nd in EPA per rush, 130th in rushing success rate allowed, & 117th in explosive run rate allowed. They allow 3+ yards before contact to RB’s on 29% of attempts (ranked 94th). Their run D ranks 116th in yards before contact allowed. Fletcher is one of the hardest RB’s in the NCAA to tackle with a total of 50 missed tackles forced on the season & is coming off a game where he forced 5 missed tackles (2nd most this year) vs OSU who is one of the best tackling teams in the country. A ton of his success should be credited to Miami’s OL. They rank 1st in pass blocking & 16th in run blocking, & also #1 in the country in pressure rate allowed. Miami’s QB Carson Beck runs an offense that utilizes traditional dropbacks (3+ steps). Beck takes a traditional dropback 56% of the time. He gets rid of the football in 2.35 seconds, 3rd fastest in NCAA. Miami leads the nation in pressure rate allowed at just 25% in traditional dropbacks, while Ole Miss defense that ranks 46th by the same metric. Beck limits pressure by making quick passes. 57% of his passes go less than 5 yards (7th highest rate). On those Beck averages 6.7 yards per pass (7th). Ole Miss allows 5.5 yards per pass on throws under 5 yds, ranked 77th. Ole Miss also has a horrible problem tackling receivers. They allow a broken tackle once every 4.5 rec (109th). Miami WR’s rank 18th in missed tackles forced. The key to Miami winning this game will be to keep the ball in their hands & slow the tempo down. Miami ranks 98th in offensive plays per game. While Ole Miss runs the 6th most plays per game. Ole Miss has a high powered offense led by stud QB Trinidad Chambliss. The best way to defend him is to keep him on the sideline & run the ball.\n\nOle Miss OC Charlie Weis Jr. runs a fast paced, pass heavy offense. He’ll face a Miami D that has given up just 17 points in the playoffs to 2 teams that both ranked top 20 in ppg averaging 32+. Miami allows just 13.8 ppg (4th). Their defense has the best DL in the nation. In 2 Playoff games, they had 12 sacks & 16 tackles for loss, against 2 of the best OL’s. They generated an insane 50% pressure rate against OSU. They rank 2nd in pressure rate generated in the NCAA. Chambliss is an athletic QB suited for pressure. He ran circles around the UGA defense. Miami already faced an athletic playmaker this playoffs in A&M's Marcel Reed, sacking him 7 times. Ole Miss uses quick drop backs 56% of the time (6th highest). This is where UGA struggled as they ranked 106th in yards per pass vs quick dropbacks. Miami is much better allowing just 5.7 yards per pass against quick dropbacks (24th). Chambliss takes a traditional dropback on 36% of passes. Against traditionals, Miami is generating a 54% pressure rate (2nd), while Ole Miss allows a 38% pressure rate (30th). One of the ways to force Ole Miss into traditional dropbacks will be to force 3rd & longs as that’s when Chambliss’ traditional dropback rate jumps to 65%. Miami’s defense ranks 14th in the NCAA in forcing 3rd & longs. Only 26% of all drives against the Miami defense this season have gained a 1st down inside the Miami 40 or scored on an explosive play. As for their ground game, Miami is hard to run on which will be tough for Ole Miss star RB Kewan Lacy who is already coming into the game banged up. Miami has allowed just 83.4 rushing yards per game (4th) & just held Ohio State RB’s to 45 yards. Ole Miss has a 57.4 run blocking grade (85th) & they only average 1.6 yards before contact per carry. Miami ranks 13th in the country with only 1.1 rushing yards before contact allowed. Miami holds the advantages on offense & defense.\n\nMiami will run it down their throats & maintain possession. Fletcher will run for 90+ yards. \n\n__Mark Fletcher o88.5 rushing yards__\n\nAppreciate the love!

He has won two Q matches and decent Shapovalov in R1 here without losing a set. He played good against Shapovalov, made early breaks in both sets, but Canadian is know for his erratic tennis and is prone to errors. Collignon strong suit is his consistency, and when playing good tennis against, obviously, out of form Shapovalov, there is only one way it can end. However, Dimitrov is a different story. Dimitrov won easily against Carreno-Busta a couple days ago when we had him to cover spread, looked physically ready and playing solid tennis. He is able to cope with Collignons' depth and long rallies and if we consider pure tennis quality he is still miles ahead. As I said a couple days ago season has just started and if there is time Dimitrov shouldn't have too much problems with his body, it is now. Odds obviously take into consideration that Dimitrov didn't play a lot of tennis last months and Belgian has been solid in this period, but quality difference is still the main factor for me and it's wider than odds suggest.\n\n\n\n\n\nAny donations would be greatly appreciated:\n\n[https://buymeacoffee.com/kumpir](https://buymeacoffee.com/kumpir)",

Egbuka has gone over 50 rec yds 5/5. JSN of Seattle torched their division rivals in LA for 105 yds. \n\nBaker is returning to the team he came to 3 years ago and helped jump start his upward bound career. He plays with a chip on his shoulder and will be putting in work tonight to win this prime time game. He has thrown over 225 in 3/5 games and in games they lost he didn’t get that many pass yds. \n\nThe rams have a great team and will either be leading or having a shootout hopefully with quick scores and plenty of pass yds for baker and Rec yds for Egbuka! BOL everybody!",

Wanted to take the Pats on the spread originally (-7.5 feels criminal), but saw that another capper snagged that already so nice read there. Instead we're going with Drake Maye for o258.5 passing yards to keep the streak alive. This is overall a massive mismatch for these two teams. Bengals allow the second most passing yards in the NFL. Daijahn Anthony is out, this team is a mess. I'm pretty sure we'll see MVP contender Maye to go deep to Boutte at least a couple times to get things going early. Only risk here is an absolute blowout where we run the ball to stall later in the game. Maye has covered this line in 4 out of his last 5 games, and 8 out of 11 on the year. This line is right about average. I feel like the books could have inflated it a bit and still had most bets on the over, so I think it's really solid +EV. \n\nMan I really hate betting on the Patriots, but if the books are going to put lines like this out I can't turn my head.\n\n**Take Drake Maye o258.5 Passing Yards**\n\n*Please tail at your own risk and only ever wager what you can afford to lose.

Lions are heavily favored (-13.5) which favors less passing attempts and more rushing attempts for the Lions. As for the other leg, Jalen Hurts is facing the worst pass defense in the NFL (Dallas Cowboys). H2H, Hurts has surpassed 150 yards in both games vs the Cowboys since last year. Hurts should see plenty of opportunities as the Eagles are only (-3) favorites. With these favorable props today, let’s take Gibbs and Hurts for this high probability parlay. \n\n👇",

      "text": "6-6\n\n\nPlus 1 unit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### **\"Pick of the Day\"**\n\n\n**Game:** Indianapolis Colts at Kansas City Chiefs\n**Selection:** **Indianapolis Colts +3.5**\n**Time:** Sunday, 1:00 PM ET\n**Current Odds:** -110\n\n\n**1. The \"Dynasty Tax\" vs. The Efficiency Reality**\nThe betting public continues to price the Kansas City Chiefs like the juggernaut of 2022, ignoring the reality of their 2025 performance. The Chiefs are 5-5—their worst start in a decade—yet they are laying 3.5 points against an 8-2 team. The Super Model flags this as a \"Legacy Premium.\" You are paying a tax for the name \"Mahomes,\" even though the metrics show a team in decline.\n\n\n**2. The Rest Discrepancy**\nThe Indianapolis Colts are coming off a **Bye Week**. In the modern NFL, the rest advantage late in the season is one of the most predictive variables for covering the spread. Head Coach Shane Steichen has had 14 days to script his opening drives against Steve Spagnuolo’s defense. Conversely, the Chiefs are grinding through a short week of preparation after a physical divisional loss.\n\n\n**3. The Statistical Mismatch**\n* **Colts Offense:** Ranked #1 in the NFL in Total Offense (396.9 yards/game) and #1 in EPA/Play. Jonathan Taylor leads the league in rushing, allowing Indy to control the clock and keep Mahomes on the sideline.\n* **Chiefs Defense:** While solid (4th in points allowed), they have not faced an offensive line this dominant since Week 1. The model projects the Colts to win the time-of-possession battle by a 60/40 margin.\n\n\n**4. The \"Hook\" Math**\nThe most critical factor is the number. In NFL betting, the number **3** is king (the most common margin of victory). By getting **+3.5**, we hold a winning ticket if the Chiefs win by a field goal (e.g., 23-20). The model projects this game as a pure coin flip (50/50 outright win probability), which makes catching 3.5 points mathematically superior to any other spread on the board.\n\n\n**Model Prediction:** **Colts 27, Chiefs 24** (Colts win outright).",

However Merino plays a rouge sort of football where the guy somehow manages to find goals quite often. Saka, Trossard , and Martinelli have also been playing great this season too. Arsenal has skated by with a few 1-0 wins, but they're at home and this is a North London derby match. This win is vital for Arsenal, it would put them 6 points clear of Chelsea and 7 points above Man City. Of course a football team collecting their 3 points is always important, but after a stunning (and disappointing depending if you are an Arsenal fan or not) draw in stoppage time against Sunderland, I feel like the gunners will be even more motivated to retain their lead in the Premier League.\n\n(All picks are 1 unit 🔥)",

Because Inoue is not a knockout puncher, his clearest and most realistic path to victory is a decision. That aligns perfectly with the stylistic dynamics: Tenshin is difficult to hurt cleanly, but he can be out-boxed round by round by a veteran who sets traps, maintains distance, and forces exchanges on his terms. With the market overvaluing Tenshin’s hype and underestimating Takuma’s experience and ability.  Takuma has fought has the highest level in boxing, holding titles and has more overall championship experience. Takuma is super experienced in going the entire 12 full rounds. Tenshin may be up and coming however his gas tank has not yet been put to the test so hence I say Takuma ML.

Tampa Bay has dropped two straight, and with the division race tightening, they’re now neck and neck with the Panthers. Carolina has a brutal matchup against the 49ers this week, giving the Bucs a golden opportunity to regain control of the NFC South if they handle business.\n\nThe Rams walk into this game with real vulnerabilities. Their defense has been slipping, and they’ve gone back-to-back games without recording a single sack — a major problem against a Bucs offense that can get rolling when Baker Mayfield is kept clean. If Tampa’s O-line gives him time, L.A.’s defense has shown nothing lately that says they can stop it.\n\nChris Godwin is expected to return, injecting badly needed firepower into a hungry Buccaneers team that is downright starving for a victory.\n\nWith the division on the line, a struggling Rams defense, and reinforcements returning, today is the moment for Tampa Bay to punch back and get right. With these odds and the promise the Bucs & Mayfield have shown this year I have to back the dogs here in just a absolutely great spot. Give me Tampa.",

Against a struggling Aberdeen this season this is a train I'm hopping aboard on once again. They're already on 30 points after 12 matches and are looking to extend their lead.\n\nBesides last week's 0-0 draw against 6th place Motherwell, Aberdeen have not managed to gain any points against teams that are higher on the standings as them.

This team is playing its best at home, with 4 wins in 4 home matches. In this condition, the over 3.5 goals line hit in 2 out of their 4 home matches, with this team conceding a goal in this condition 3 out of 4 times. \n\nWerder Bremen is also in a solid position in the league, and they usually manage to score away from home, even when they lose. This team has scored in 4 out of their 5 away matches, and the over 3.5 goals line has also hit in 4 out of their 5 away matches. \n\nWith this, Bremen knows that they won't be able to keep up with Leipzig if they try to play defensively for the entire match, so I'm expecting them to risk a lot in counterattacks when possible. Leipzig, on the other hand, will always try to put constant pressure on Bremen. Leipzig has their full squad available for this match, so I'm expecting some goals, which is usually the norm with these teams in the current season.\n\nGood luck!",

Which means bookies expect a arsenal win to nil.  \n\nBut in there last 10 visits to Emirates ( arsenal home ground) in Prem league. Tottenham has scored 9 times.  If you go through there H2H history Tottenham has scored more often away then at home.  \n\nIts Tottenham. They show up when noone expects them and lose when everyone expects them to win.  \n\nAt +107 i would take the btts anyday.  \n\nAlthough i thought about going with just Tottenham to score at 1.84x on the off chance Arsenal fk up like liverpool did yesterday. But i would take the risk.  Its a rivalry from what I heard.  So yellow cards might have been a good bet but prem league is more technical football then physical football. So fouls and tackles are rare that's why I didn't pick that. \n\n\n\n\n\nDo whatever you think is best. \n\n\nBUT\n\n\nAlways bet responsibly .\n\n\nBOL if tailing \n\nBOL if fading",

Just look at Rams v Seahawks, which struggled against each other. \n\nAt every position match-up, the eagles are better or close to equal (QB, WR). \n\nIf the Eagles can stop the top offensive teams, how much more to the Cowboys. Not mentioning, they were against top defensive teams, which is the total opposite of the Cowboys. \n\nThis is a divisional match-up which i trust that the Eagles prepare better than the Cowboys. \n\nThe spread is one kick away.

New England Patriots.  \n\nWrite Up: Gonna change things up for today since it’s Monday Night Football. And as per usual, another day, another strange spread. From the few Bengals games I’ve actually watched, they have looked extremely volatile and lost. Joe Flacco has been really inconsistent, as demonstrated by his strong start to the season followed by a decline in quality, highlighted by his glaring performance last week against the Steelers. The only consistently good part about their offence would probably be their receivers, most notably Tee Higgins and Ja’Marr Chase, the latter sitting this game out due to a suspension for an incident with Jalen Ramsey against the Steelers. Now, time to address the elephant in the room, because the offence isn’t the worst part about the Bengals. Their defence is abysmal, ranking first in most defensive yards allowed and touchdowns allowed. And if things couldn’t get any worse, a portion of their defensive line is not playing this match due to injuries, somehow managing to dig a deeper hole for themselves (if it wasn’t deep enough already). On the other hand, the Patriots have been excellent this season, led by MVP candidate QB Drake ‘Drake Maye’ Maye and very solid offensive units like Stefon Diggs, Hunter Henry, and DeMario Douglas. They rank top 10 in both total yards made and passing yards made. Alongside their great offence, their defence has been nothing short of amazing, placing 7th in least amount of yards allowed. Not to mention, They have a perfect record on the road, going 5-0 in all their away games (Dolphins, Bills, Saints, Titans, Bucs). I expect them to exploit both the Bengals’ limited offence and garbage defence. Therefore, I’m taking the Patriots covering the 7 point margin.",

These two teams do not like each other to say the least and their stadiums are 25 minutes apart. Arsenal is the heavy favorite here as they play tough at home, but I'm staying away from ML as my main pick (as usual). This matchup is always unpredictable and fun to watch, we could see a 4-4 slugfest or a 1-0 defensive battle. \n\nI have to be honest, I really don't like rooting for Arsenal. Most of their players have big egos, flop frequently, and complain with flailing arms when things don't go their way (sorry Arsenal fans). But Declan Rice does not fit that mold - as he's a great guy on and off the pitch. I like this play because Rice has really been in shooting form recently. He has had 1+ SOT in his last 3 EPL matches and 4 of his last 5. He also found himself in the box a ton for England during the break, with 3 potential SOTs (two called back for borderline offsides). He again fits my mold of hard working midfielders that I love to back. He takes free kicks more often than not (and scores from them!) and has been playing much further forward in the box attacking over the last 5 matches. Keep in mind he does take corners from the left side, so not a lot of corner shot attempts from him. \n\nI like Rice here to maintain his shooting form and land a shot on target here.

Brentford with a disgraceful performance after scoring the opener through Igor’s penalty and were leading the corners 3-1 at that point. After that though they parked the bus. I will never understand why teams do that so early as it almost always leads to them losing their advantage with 60 minutes of pressure piled on. That pressure from Brighton paid off with Minteh especially wreaking havoc, getting an incredible assist for Welbeck before Hinshelwood sealed the deal not long after. The Seagulls had 80% 2H possession at that point (which is insane) and ended on 7 corners to the Bees 4. Igor missed a last minute penalty and Brighton got a very deserved win against a disorganised team.\n\nGoing to keep this short and sweet, Viking are neck-and-neck with Bodø/Glimt and a win today would take them top with a game remaining. Fredrikstad are a steady sixth, which is where they also finished last year. Viking has averaged 4.6 corners conceded over their last 20 away matches while Fredrikstad has won an average of 5 at home over the same time period. Using all the stats I have and including recent corner form I get an expected 4.9 corners for the home team. That gives me a 71% chance of the play winning. This same fixture produced 7 corners for them last season (and the reverse fixture saw 6 this year). Fredrikstad have covered the line in 15/20 and Viking’s opponents in 13/20 at home. Looking at opponent-specified data shows me 13/16 times the line covered when Viking faced top 10 opposition and 11/15 for their opponents so both are in line with my estimation.

I am not sure many people followed it but it was a winner! \n\nSticking with the rugby theme for Sunday. \n\nScotland playing Tonga at home to finish the internationals. The line is actually set at -38.5 which I think can easily be covered but is also quite high. Therefore I am going for the alternative spread of -29.5\n\nThis game should be a walk in the park for Scotland and they will be looking to correct their failure last time out against Argentina where they blew a 21-0 lead. Despite playing a low ranking  opponent they have named a very strong side and can see them easily scoring 50+ points. However, these games can flow weirdly when it is 1-sided, hence me going for the alternate handicap.\n\nPart 2 is England to win ML. Again the spread is tempting at -9.5 but Argentina are a good side and I expect it to be close , even tho it should cover. Probs gonna take a piece of the spread at lower units. \n\nEngland have won 10 in a row and are in their best form for years - beating New Zealand last week. They will be looking to round off the perfect autumn series with another win against Argentina. \n\nArgentina on the other hand showed their frailty going 21-0 down to Scotland last week , and against a stronger more consistent side in England - it is hard to see this not ending with a home win.\n\nI was shocked when I saw the odds for this was -122 hence the 3unit stake. \n\n(I hope this write up format is ok and happy to take any tips for useful info to include going forward!) \n\nLet me know if you join me ! 😁\n\n**Scotland win 56-0 and England hold on to win aswell!

I wouldn't let last week fool you. The Jaguars have been a bottom-5 unit against the pass this season, allowing an average of 237 passing yards per game, 253 per game if you remove last week's outlier. They are also going to be without Travon Walker this week, which will *severely* inhibit their ability to get pressure on the QB.\n\nJacoby Brissett has been **slinging** the ball in his starts this season, averaging 28 completions and 314 passing yards per game. He has thrown for *at least* 258 yards in every start this year, including his monster 452-yard performance last week. The Cardinals running attack has been poor most of this season due to injury, and this plays right into the Jaguars' top-5 running defense.\n\nThe Jags, of course, have also been famous for getting killed by backup QBs over the last few years (Jacoby may not *reallllly* be a backup, but he is technically). Jake Browning and Davis Mills had field days this season, and Brissett is the exact archetype of player that just shreds their pass defense.\n\nI really like this line and expect him to clear it, and it will not surprise me if the line continues to jump up by the time you read this post.",

Nico had 3 catches on 3 targets for 55 yards in the first half, then absolutely no looks in the second. One more catch (for his game average) would have been right at the 74 yard number. I should have known better to make my first pick on a Thursday night game, but I'm not gonna let it keep me down.\n\nEvent: Patriots @ Bengals 1:00 PM\n\nPOTD: **Hunter Henry over 39.5 yards receiving (-110) (2U)✅**\n\nHunter Henry is set to have a decent game because the Bengals are **literally the worst team in the league at defending tight ends**, giving up over 4 catches and almost 60 yards a game to TEs. Their linebackers and safeties keep losing underneath and over the middle, which is exactly where Henry eats. He’s efficient with the targets he does get, so it doesn't take much volume for him to put up solid yardage.\n\n(And as a bonus, he’s got a real shot to find the end zone too. He and Diggs basically split red-zone work evenly, and Cincinnati has been getting cooked by tight ends near the goal line all year. They have given up the most TDs to TEs as well. Henry ATTD is also a solid play at +180.)✅\n\nBOL\n\nTips are appreciated if you like my picks. [Buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/drripples)",

I like this line just as much this week at home in this divisional matchup vs. a middle of the pack Eagles pass defense. This season Pickens has cleared this yardage in 8/10 games and has hit this mark in his last 5. \n\nAt this point in the season Pickens has been a major contributor in the passing game and has become the greatest WR2 in the NFL. Pickens averages an impressive 8.3 targets average in games this year and ranks 7th in the league in yards average per catch (15.7).\n\nI believe Pickens will continue to have many opportunities to be involved in this high-powered and well orchestrated offense at home this week. The Cowboys have been very dominant in Jerry's world and average 282 yards per game through the air.\n\nEvery game moving forward will be a must win for Dallas. I believe they will be putting their best foot forward on offense this week and Pickens will continue his career year success in this high stakes clash.\n\nTail or fade BOL to everyone and cheers! 🍻",

      "text": "POTD Record: 20-7 (+14.3U)\n\nLast Pick: Standard 6.5 two team teaser (Oklahoma +1/ Under 49) (NCAAFB) (-120) (1U) ✅\n\n[Teaser write up](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/s/biOCloDgv3)\n\nThat game went exactly how we said it would, Oklahoma shut down Missouri’s entire run game and offense, they themselves struggled a bit offensively for stretches but they did enough to win the game like we thought and the total didn’t even come close to 49, thank y’all for the support once again it’s been a very fun last 10 days on POTD!\n\nEvent: Eagles @ Cowboys (NFL) (3:25pm central)/ South Carolina vs Northwestern (NCAAB) (4pm central)\n\nPOTD: Two team parlay (Eagles ML/Northwestern ML) (+110) (1U)\n\n-everything is bet to win unit amount-\n\n(Except here we are placing 1u to win 1.1u)\n\nWrite up: \n\nEagles:\n\nFor two weeks straight, the Eagles have been bombarded with criticism about their offense—questions about stagnation, lack of explosiveness, and whether Jalen Hurts can carry this team down the stretch. But the reality is that before their bye week, this offense was firing on all cylinders. In the two games leading into the break, Philadelphia averaged over 27 points per game, Hurts completed nearly 67% of his passes, and the rushing attack was balanced and efficient with Saquon Barkley pounding out chunk gains behind one of the league’s best offensive lines. The narrative of a “broken offense” simply doesn’t hold up when you look at the numbers in context.\n\nThe recent dip in production came against two of the NFL’s most suffocating defenses in brutal weather conditions. Detroit ranks 6th in the league in yards allowed per game, while Green Bay sits right behind them at 7th. Playing outdoors in freezing temperatures against those units is a completely different challenge than what awaits in Dallas. The Cowboys’ defense, despite a spirited showing against the Raiders, ranks near the bottom of the league in both points allowed and yards surrendered. That Raiders game was more about emotion than quality—the Raiders are bottom-tier in nearly every offensive and defensive metric, and Dallas fed off the atmosphere of a desperate opponent.\n\nNow the Cowboys return home on a short week, while the Eagles come in rested, healthier, and motivated to silence the noise. Playing inside the dome at AT&T Stadium eliminates the weather factor and sets up perfectly for Philadelphia’s offense to reassert itself. The Cowboys want this game to turn into a shootout, but that’s not how it will be decided. The Eagles dominate in the trenches, and that gives them multiple outs to win—whether it’s Barkley grinding down the defense, Hurts exploiting mismatches in the passing game, or their own defensive front collapsing Dak Prescott’s pocket. This is the perfect spot for the Eagles to prove the critics wrong and remind everyone why they remain one of the NFC’s most complete teams. Not to mention  the cowboys have given up the 9th highest rate of explosive plays and I wouldn’t be surprised to see saquon break one off to the house tomorrow. \n\nNorthwestern:\n\nAt the Greenbrier Tip-Off, both Northwestern and South Carolina are staring down the possibility of leaving 0-2. That desperation raises the stakes, but Northwestern has the clear edge. My power ratings make this game closer to -6.5, while the market sits at -5.5, giving us immediate value, however the pace by both teams might make this a little tighter in the end but I am not worried about northwestern, they will be getting the job done.\n\nThe Wildcats’ offense is built around Nick Martinelli, who has emerged as the best player on the floor in this matchup. His efficiency and ability to score at all three levels force defenses to collapse, opening opportunities for Arrinten Page and Jayden Reid. With Page providing a reliable interior presence and Reid distributing while scoring in double figures himself, Northwestern now has three legitimate scoring options. Their shooting splits reflect that balance: the Wildcats are hitting over 46% from the field and nearly 44% from deep, numbers that far outpace South Carolina’s streaky perimeter shooting. Carolina has meechie Johnson and really that’s about it, and they only shoot 45% from the field compared to northwesterns 51%. They simply don’t have as much continuity and fluid options in their offense to match martinelli and co and martinelli will be the best player on the court tomorrow, and he’s coming off a down game with just 8 points in a close loss to a solid Virginia team. \n\nRebounding has been Northwestern’s Achilles heel, highlighted by the lopsided 49-23 margin against Virginia. Yet even in that game, they led for stretches and lost by just five despite being +4.5 underdogs. That shows how dangerous their shooting can be when they’re clicking. Against South Carolina, the rebounding battle is far less intimidating. The Gamecocks average around 36 boards per game—similar to Northwestern—and were bullied on the glass by Butler. With Page and Martinelli anchoring the frontcourt, Northwestern actually holds a size advantage here, something they didn’t have against Virginia.\nSouth Carolina’s offense leans heavily on perimeter shooting, but they lack the efficiency and depth Northwestern brings. Combine that with the Wildcats’ superior shooting splits, their trio of scoring threats, and the fact that South Carolina has struggled to impose themselves physically, and the edge is clear. Northwestern has the tools to control this game, and with both teams desperate to avoid 0-2, the Wildcats’ balance and size should carry them to a win.\n\nIn summary:\n\nThe Eagles face a soft Dallas defense in ideal conditions after weeks of criticism, while Northwestern’s efficient offense and size give them the upper hand against South Carolina. At +110 odds, this is a plus-money play that I think puts us in excellent place to cash. As always, cheers 🍻",

They are literally on a winning streak the hottest team in the league right now and the bookies are still treating them like underdogs against a Chelsea side that has been super shaky at home. It is the perfect setup because Chelsea loves to push their defense way too high, which is exactly what Villa wants so they can feed Morgan Rogers and Watkins on the counter and just cook them with speed. Betting on the more disciplined team, with the better manager, in better form, getting 1.99 odds for a Double Chance on a team that hasn't lost in two months is basically insane value that I can't pass up.\n\nBOL!",

Three of us here had the same read and, while I think it was a good read, United went full bus park as soon as they scored their first goal. Cunha had one more great chance but scuffed the open shot. Definitely getting cold as these mid season matches are proving to be volatile. \n\nBut we keep trying. Declan Rice, my favorite Arsenal player to back, has all of the traits I look for in backing a player - he runs hard, crashes the box, likes to shoot from range, and chases everything. We've already cashed with Rice back in November at similar odds, and I really like him here again today. Arsenal are big favorites in this match, will have a lot of the ball, and will hopefully take a lot of shots. \n\nRice has had 1+ SOT in 7 of his last 9 EPL matches. Interestingly enough the two he missed were both away matches. This line has cleared in 5/5 of his last home EPL matches (7/7 if you include Champion's League and cup matches). He has been shooting more frequently lately, averaging over 2 shots per game. While he doesn't take a high volume of shots, he has a high percentage of his shots that hit the target. \n\nI expect Brighton to have a tough time here. They are not a team that parks the bus well and they will feel they need to get some shots in to take something from this game. They will be open to the counter, which is another angle where Rice can hurt them. \n\nBOL everyone, let's start the weekend strong!",

Newcastle dominated possession in the 2^(nd) half and had plenty of opportunity, but the ball just never went in.\n\n**New Event:** EPL – Nottingham Forrest vs Manchester City\n\n**Pick:**  Manchester City -1 @ 1.88 (Usual 3 units)\n\nThe day after Boxing Day just happens to fall on a Saturday which is hosting most of the post Christmas games. City visit Forrest in what could be a very significant match for the title race as City are just 2 points behind league leaders Arsenal and a win would put them in a favorable position for the time being. Forrest are 17^(th) in the league and trying to stay out of the dreaded relegation zone comprised of the 3 teams in 18-20^(th) places.\n\nCity will be missing Doku and a few others. However, as always their depth of squad on the bench is formidable. The projected starting lineup for midfield and forwards consists of : Reijnders, Nico, Silva; Foden, Cherki; Haaland. If you don't recognize these folks then don't bet. But if you do, that is all you need to know. City should win without any issues.",

The difference is quality between these squads is simply too much, and even with Josh Hart out, the Knicks have much more depth, with a bunch of their rotation guys (Kolek, Diawara, Clarkson) looking really good too. Some would argue this is a let-down spot after the emotional highs of the Christmas game, but I think this Knicks team is locked in, has had a day to rest, and is simply much deeper and stronger.\n\n \n\n*If you’ve enjoyed these picks, tips are always appreciated:* [Coffee Link](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/TheBrat)",

It's Emanuel Wilson time. Packers are still in the hunt for that 2nd seed, needing the bears to lose their next two and for Packers to win out. This week shouldn't be a struggle assuming that Lamar isn't in.\n\nWilson's been crushing it when he needs to, getting 82 yards last week against the bears, and putting up over 100 yards against the Vikings when Jacob's was out. His average is just below this line at 29.2 yards but I believe he's going to get more carries. Again, Josh Jacob's has been playing through injury and was less relied on in the 2nd half versus the bears. Meanwhile, Malik Wilis has been going through some shoulder issues. I'm sure he wouldn't be playing if Clayton Tune wasn't the backup, and if Clayton Tune is the one to start, he'll be heavily relying on his rbs, ala Jacob's n Wilson.\n\nWhile the line is only sitting at -3.5 for the Packers, it's a home game against a mediocre Ravens team with a backup qb. I expect a lot of rushing from both sides with Henry and Wilson being the stars. Can't guarantee this game will be pretty both playoffs are on the line for the Ravens and 2nd seed is on the line for the Packers. \n\nBoL everyone tailing we love some ugly Saturday night games, can't be worse than the Christmas game lineups!",

Opposing offenses only convert on 3rd down 29% of the time, which is top 10 in all of college.\n\n Penn State’s defense has been much more vulnerable on 3rd down. They let their opponents convert 42% of the time.\n\nI’m a big believer that carrying the momentum down the field and continuing your drives is one of the biggest factors to winning in football, and think this is gonna be a huge factor that decides the outcome of this game.",

Bet 2.5u\n\nWriteup: Betting on the first of the Saturday NFL games and taking Herbert under his passing prop. Frankly, I don’t understand this line at all to the point where I feel like Vegas knows something I don’t. Before looking at this line, I thought for sure this would be under 200 yards. In theory, I would put 5u or more on this, but we’ll lay down half of that for this one. Here’s the thought process.\n\nThe Chargers are coming into this one winning 4 of their last 5 and 7 of their last 8. They have already clinched a playoff spot and still have something to play for to improve their seeding. However, their one glaring weakness is their offensive line. With multiple starting tackles out due to injury, Justin Herbert is getting pressured at the 3rd highest rate in the league and has and has one of the lowest average times in the pocket before pressure in the league. Because of this, his top receiver has had under 45 yards in 5 straight games. \n\nNow let’s look at the opponent. The Houston Texans started off 0-3, but are since then 10-2 and are almost guaranteed a playoff spot. Much of their success has been due to their absolute shut-down defense, with their offense finally starting to string games together. Unfortunately for Justin Herbert, the Texans defense get pressures at top 5 rate in the league. \n\nWe have also already seen this matchup in the playoffs last year. Herbert had no time in the pocket, was sacked 4 times, threw 4 interceptions, and lost 32-12. Herbert did get over 211.5 yards in this game, but this was largely due to game script and having 2 deep bombs to a wide receiver. Besides this, Herbert had nothing.\n\nWith a low over/under of 39.5 and the Chargers still being slightly favored at home, I expect the Chargers to want to establish their run game against a Texans defense that will make Herbert’s life a living hell. This could get really ugly for Herbert, and I don’t see him getting over 212 passing yards in this one.\n\nRemember to only bet what you can afford to lose, and BOL!",

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 6-14-3 *We've finally done it! A rare winning POTD in what felt like forever, and it was a clean play at + odds that was never really in doubt. Zimbabwe looked great out there and if anything, deserved to win on the balance of play in the 2nd half. Big thanks to everyone who remained supportive during this atrocious run. Having said that, I'm definitely not getting ahead of myself - after all, a broken clock is still right twice a day, and my mission now is to prove that I'm not just a broken clock. We're sticking to AFCON for this one because surely we can't leave this beautiful tournament after it just served us a winning pick*\n\n**Last Five:** ❌❌❌❌✅\n\n**Event:** AFCON, Benin v Botswana, 7:30 am EST\n\n**POTD:** Botswana Win or Draw + Under 3.5 goals +130, 4 units\n\n**Write Up:** While Benin come into this group stage game as the more established side on paper, I think there are very real reasons to believe Botswana can spoil the party and win, **or at least take a point** from today's matchup. This is the first competitive meeting between the two nations, which immediately removes the usual head-to-head bias that often favors the bigger name. With no historical dominance to lean on, the game becomes far more about current form, match context, and tactical execution, which are all areas where Botswana quietly actually make a strong case.\n\nBotswana’s opening match result might not look encouraging at first glance, but context matters. Against tournament powerhouse Senegal, Botswana were under heavy fire for long periods at a time, yet still showed remarkable defensive resilience and structure. Their goalkeeper, **Goitseone Phoko,** delivered one of the standout individual performances of the tournament so far, notching up an astonishing **14 saves,** the highest tally recorded in a single AFCON match this edition. That performance alone suggests Botswana are capable of frustrating opponents who struggle to convert possession into goals. And here's where Benin's attacking struggles come into play, really making this pick stand out to me.\n\nBenin head to this fixture with **serious attacking concerns**. They've failed to score in **three consecutive matches** across all competitions and have looked anything but decisive in the final third. Even against weaker opposition, Benin have struggled to create clear scoring opportunities, often relying on hopeful crosses or isolated moments of brilliance rather than continuous structured attacking pressure or counter-pressing. Against a disciplined **Botswana side likely to sit deep and protect the box,** that lack of incision could once again be exposed.\n\nFrom a tactical standpoint, Botswana are expected to remain compact, prioritize defensive shape, invite pressure, all the while looking to exploit transitions with their quick runners, as well as utilizing set pieces. This feels exactly like the type of game that tends to unsettle Benin, a team struggling with breaking down low blocks. Players such as **Thabang Sesinyi** and **Tumisang Orebonye** offer physicality and directness with their insane running capabilities, giving Botswana an outlet when they regain possession, but they're also intelligent at covering the space, ensuring no holes are left between the thirds of the pitch that could be exploited by Benin's attack.\n\nCrucially, the **pressure is entirely on Benin**. After a disappointing start to the group, anything less than a win would be viewed as a catastrophic failure, and that expectation can quickly turn into impatience. Botswana, by contrast, have nothing to lose here. Given Benin’s scoring drought, Botswana’s defensive prowess and the psychological dynamics of a must-win AFCON group match, backing **Botswana to win or draw** feels like a well-reasoned value play. In a tournament defined by fine margins, Botswana have more than enough to stay competitive and possibly spring a surprise. Just like yesterday, I'm also sprinkling an Under 3.5 goals on this play *(feeling a cagey 0-0 or 1-1 draw here)* to make the odds even greater (coincidentally the same as yesterday - surely all the signs are there?). After another lengthy research I feel confident of going in with 4 whole units. BOL and let's get a winning streak going ☘️",

Chelsea are averaging 2.1 goals for (GF) per game while conceding 1.1 goals against (GA), underlining a side that scores reliably but rarely keeps opponents quiet. Aston Villa show a near-identical profile at 2.0 GF and 1.1 GA, and their recent form run has been driven by attacking efficiency rather than defensive control. From a matchup perspective, both teams generate high-quality chances and are comfortable committing numbers forward, which often leads to open game states. Recent head-to-head meetings support this angle as well, with scorelines such as 2-2, 2-1, and 3-0 frequently seeing both sides find the net. With both teams averaging over a goal conceded per match and possessing the attacking quality to capitalise, BTTS Yes at 1.75 represents strong value relative to the underlying numbers rather than a narrative-based play.",

I understand why the books have the line at 165.5 because CSUN plays fast (11th in tempo) and Stanford also plays relatively quick (top 100). The fact is that CSUN is a very bad shooting team, especially from 3 where they rank 271st in 3pt FG%. Stanford should have total control over this game. The fast tempo of this game will be slowed down because Stanford should consistently have a lead around 10 forcing them to slow the game down trying to hold their big lead. So to sum it up, 11th in tempo only matters when the game is close, they cannot shoot well enough to comeback. \n\n\n\nBOL",

Coventry grabbed their goal just before half-time and from that point on were the only side that looked like winning. They could easily have scored two or three but wasted a few good chances. Still, we move. **FT: Coventry 1-0 Swansea**\n\n**Write Up:** I was tempted to back Man City today as they face an inconsistent Nottingham Forest side at the City Ground, but that inconsistency is exactly the problem. Forest can get rolled by Brentford one week and then push the league leaders the next, especially at home. Not worth the risk.\n\nInstead, the focus shifts to the Premier League leaders Arsenal as they host 9th‑placed Brighton at the Emirates. Arsenal are unbeaten at home this season, **scoring 20 and conceding just 3** at their North London fortress. Mental defensive numbers and arguably the best in the world right now — especially with Saliba back in the side.\n\nOffensively, Arsenal are averaging **2.5 goals per game** at home while **conceding only 0.38**. Their only two losses this season came away to Liverpool at Anfield (when they still knew how to play football) and late on against Aston Villa at Villa Park (arguably the best team in the league at the moment). What I'm getting at is Arsenal look in excellent shape heading into 2026, and they’ll be determined to maintain their narrow lead over Manchester City and Aston Villa going into the new year.\n\nWhile goals have been a little harder to come by recently, their midweek EFL Cup performance against Crystal Palace was very encouraging—they could easily have scored three or four with better finishing. If they carry that momentum into today’s match, they should have no trouble creating chances against an inconsistent Brighton side. With key players like Rice, Saka, and Raya expected to return after being rested midweek, Arsenal should be close to full strength. Martinelli picked up a knock, but Trossard is more than capable of stepping in.\n\nBrighton, meanwhile, sit 9th and have been the definition of average this season. They’re not bad enough to be dragged into a relegation fight, but they’re also nowhere near showing the quality needed to push for Europe. They’re **winless in four**, and a trip to the Emirates is unlikely to change that. Combine Arsenal’s elite defensive record with Brighton’s modest attacking output—**1.13 goals scored and 1.5 conceded per away game**—and it’s hard to see the visitors causing many problems. Raya already has **nine clean sheets** this season, the most in the league, which shows the size of the task Brighton face. **Welbeck may return from injury, but that remains unconfirmed.**\n\nAs for the over 1.5 goals, the line has hit in **88% of Arsenal’s home matches** and **88% of Brighton’s games both away and overall**. If Arsenal create chances at anything close to their midweek level, this should be a comfortable win with goals on the board in the 3 or 4-0 range, maybe 3-1 if Brighton feel like having a bit of a go. Arsenal beat Brighton today and anything else is a major slip up by the Gunners.\n\nStill getting used to writing these, so feel free to drop any thoughts or suggestions in the comments. Always happy to learn—and best of luck if you decide to tail.\n\n*Edit: Added 'Todays' pick to stop confusion*",

Aston Villa have been in scintillating form with a record 10 wins in a row in all competitions. They are traveling to Stamford Bridge the home of the Blues in what should be a tense and closely fought contest. Chelsea have scored in every home game this season bar the opening fixture whilst Aston Villa have been scoring consistently in their win streak which includes a 2-1 win over league leaders Arsenal (just four matches back). What makes this bet more compelling is the defensive form of both teams - Aston Villa have conceded in each of their last five games whilst Chelsea have conceded in three of their last five and in their last fixture drew 2-2 with Newcastle. The oddsmakers favor Chelsea here but Aston Villa are very live for the upset - taking both teams to score here seems solid. Please bet responsibly.",

Honestly, I noticed this only because it popped up as a value play, and then I started to analyze it. Pinnacle opened up here with some 1.65. They adjusted to others, so it's higher now.\n\nI like the fact Nagasaki as a table leader has a 12-1 at home and 12-0 streak, Chiba is also a top team. They play in another conference and are also no1 at the table, 22-4 and 10-3 as guests.\n\nBasically, the bet is that Nagasaki has a big advantage through a home court advantage and that the original pinnacle assessment was correct.",

Chelsea’s push to stay in the top four has been a recurring theme in Maresca’s recent press conferences, where he has emphasised bravery in possession and quicker vertical play at home, even if that comes at the cost of defensive exposure — something already visible with Colwill and Lavia injured and James regularly stepping out of the double pivot. That aggressive 4-2-3-1 gives Palmer freedom between the lines and has improved their attacking output, but it also leaves space in transition, as seen at Newcastle. Aston Villa arrive with immense confidence and nothing to fear, and Emery has repeatedly stated that he will not abandon his narrow, attacking structure despite conceding chances. Villa have scored multiple goals in every recent match but have also conceded in all of them, a pattern reinforced by Mings’ absence, Martínez’s fitness concerns, and negative underlying xG numbers. With both managers prioritising attacking control over defensive conservatism, elite creators in Palmer and Rogers operating centrally, and key defensive absences limiting in-game containment, the tactical and motivational setup strongly points toward both teams finding the net.",

As we near the end of the 2025 season, both Houston and LAC have been performing towards the under in their respective seasons. So far the Texans have gone under in 64.3% of their games, and the Chargers 57.1%. With a combined average of 36.7 points per game allowed for the 2025 season, this game has the makings of a low scoring and grind it out affair. \n\nHouston's pass rush is elite, while LAC's pass blocking is bottom 5. This matchup alone will provide many problems for the Chargers ability to give Justin Herbert any possibility to take control of the game with his arm. Harbaugh will be forced to approach this game with a ground-and-pound style and attempt to control the tempo with long and methodical drives, something he as a coach excels at with a league leading time of possession per game.\n\nThe Chargers and Texans flex very impressive red zone defenses which will hold scoring touchdowns to a high premium. Through their last 3 games the Chargers have held teams to an average of 0.7 touchdowns in the red zone, while the Texans also boast an impressive 1.3 average over their last 3.\n \nI predict this game not to be as much of a QB deal between Herbert and Stroud than it is to be a kick-off between Fairbairn and Dicker. I believe the defenses will thrive in being able to keep the opposition out of striking distance and force each team to win the game with their legs.\n\nTail or fade BOL to everyone and cheers! 🍻",

Arsenal are at home against Brighton, and this is the type of game they usually handle well, especially when they’re in a title race and can’t afford to slip. At the Emirates they’re aggressive from the start and usually put teams under pressure early.\n\nCity are in full chase mode behind Arsenal and their form speaks for itself. They’re scoring freely, barely conceding, and even with a couple of absences they still have more than enough quality to beat Forest.\n\nNothing fancy here. Two top teams, both highly motivated, both expected to do their job. The price comes out nicely at +116, which feels fair for the spot.\n\nArsenal and Manchester City to win\nStake: 3 units\n\nHigh confidence, but always bet responsible.",

We’re moving to the biggest mismatch in pool play. Denmark is downright terrible. They just got thoroughly outplayed by a Finland team that historically doesn’t score much, got outshot by 20 and pretty clearly took their foot off the gas through the game. Denmarks first 3 games since they got to Minnesota have now seen them lose 6-1, 13-2 and 6-2. Every few years there’s a team that makes it into the top division and gets completely demolished game in and game out. Like last year with Kazakhstan and a few years ago with Austria, Denmark will need an absolute miracle to stay with the top dogs.\n\n\n\nThe Czechs on the other hand have brought what could possibly be their best team since they won back to back championships in the early 2000s. They've been a force in this tournament the last few years, they’re deep everywhere and play an up tempo style that focuses on play driving, rush attempts and puck possession. The complete opposite of a Finland team that still managed to put up 6. Just last year we got to see the Czechs put this on display when they played a horrific Kazakhstan team and beat them 14-2. The worst teams in the tournament usually try and limit the damage in these games, they know they have no shot at winning, they’re fine dropping into a trap and getting outshot by 30 as long as they don’t lose by 10. The biggest flaw to this strategy with a team like Denmark is they don’t have a goalie to help make those crucial saves. Expect a gigantic mismatch between two teams trending in different directions tomorrow, the Czechs never miss on an opportunity to pump a teams eyes shut.",

Against strong opponents such as Liverpool, Newcastle, and Everton, City averaged **2.4 goals per game**, demonstrating their ability to score consistently even against tough defenses.

The absence of **key players such as Ola Aina, Chris Wood, Ibrahim Sangaré, Willy Boly, Ryan Yates, and Dan Ndoye** significantly weakens both their defensive structure and attacking threat, reducing their chances of competing effectively against City’s potent attack.

Based on recent form, head-to-head history, and current team news, Manchester City has a **60–65% probability to cover −1 AH**, with a \\~20–25% chance of a push (1-goal win). Considering these factors, the **−1 AH line offers clear value**, making this a medium-risk, medium-reward pick. For added confidence, combining this with an **over 2.5 goals market** could also be considered, given City’s attacking trends and Forest’s defensive weaknesses.\n\n☕ If you enjoy these tips and want to support me, you can grab me a coffee here: [https://buymeacoffee.com/willjack](https://buymeacoffee.com/willjack)\n\nEdit: Please comment if you are tailing.

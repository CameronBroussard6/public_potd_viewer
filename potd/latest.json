Today, he's up against the Predators who are fifth worst in the league in assists allowed at 5.81/game. Of note is that Marner is slightly better on home ice with an assist in 13/19 games versus 9/18 in road games.",

When you include that the Bulls defense is utter trash and bottom half of the league in almost everything, this pick seems about as close to a lock as you can get. The OU in this game is 247 so scoring will be no issue.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9e1yayuvljag1.jpeg?width=1149&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a3e725a073f47767a19a92aaf9b714010c64baff",

Day 2 of the system and game 6 since De'Aaron Fox has made o1.5 steals. Its the longest drought this season so I expect that to come to an end today. Playing a competitive eastern conference team at home should be good for this prop to hit. The Spurs like to put top teams on notice. \n\nLast game saw Fox return after missing 1 game (adductor tightness) and he played a full 32 mins. I expect him to play hard today and line suggests that it will be semi-defensive from both teams. \n\nShould this bet not hit I will double the units and make it the next POTD again on Friday. Should that one miss I will no longer list it on my POTD posts but personally I will continue this system.\n\n**Previous Pick**: De'Aaron Fox o1.5 steals (Spurs vs Cavaliers) ❌\n\n***Track my sports betting picks on [POTD.LOL](https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/EthicalGambler-U6cnjV?utm_source=mdembed&utm_campaign=EthicalGambler) (since 09/01/25) to see how my previous systems have gone.***",

Ever since then the Bruins have lost 6 in a row and they scored 2 or less in 5 of them. Their offense is struggling with only the top line doing anything. Oilers meanwhile will play at home where they are 10-3-3, will have Connor Ingram back in net (still confident with Pickard but there's no way it's him again as Ingram has done well ever since he replaced Jarry) and have better depth offensively than Boston. Oilers have been playing sloppy ever since they came back from the Christmas break but I don't expect Draisatl or McDavid to have another quiet night like they did vs the Jets. And if it does happen again i'm betting more on the fact that Boston is the most penalized team in the league and the Oilers have the best powerplay in the league at 35% which should help them get goals tonight.\n\nConnor Ingram also has a 2-1 record vs the Bruins while Jeremy Swayman is 2-3-1 against the Oilers with a goals against average of 3.17 and a save percentage of .893. Boston also lost their last 3 road games with 2 of them hitting that -1.5 line. (The other being against the Flames who also struggle offensively)\n\nBOL!",

DONCIC o8.5pts (1Q) -130 (HRB) Wagered: 2.6u to win 2u Outcome- WIN Recap: Per usual, the NBA's leading scorer in the 1st qtr gave us his usual 12 + 1 more to finish the 1st qtr with 13pts (+4.5 over) & bring me back to an even record.\n\nTODAY'S P.O.T.D. - 3PM (EST) NBA: Orlando Magic at Indiana Pacers - A. BLACK o19.5 pts + o2.5 rebs + o2.5asts +145 (HRB)\n\nRISK/WAGER AMT: 3 UNITS\n\nREASONING/PROJ. ANALYSIS: First & foremost, why fix something that ain't broke? And while I realize I may be getting boring, let's just say that I far more prefer to be boring with pockets full of cash, then exciting as all hell & broke as all hell, too! So, that said, I'm playing essentially the same exact play which has cashed out for me all five of the five times I've submitted it as a bet this year, and most especially each of the two times which I've played it (& posted one of them on here) this week.  \nHowever, one difference I reckon some of y'all may have noticed with today's play is that rather than my taking the over for the usual combined PRA line (like I've been\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/smondpd4ziag1.jpeg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5735242743e7a5c3e400f4cb460897406778d941\n\ndoing), today I'm instead gonna opt to play it to the same effect, however in a slighltly different variation & my reason for doing thus is/was three-fold;\n\n1. Primarily, it's because it seems that those city-slickers over in Vegas are finally catching on and taking of his increased performance(s) nightly since after not touching or moving it one damn sprig for the first couple few months of the NBA season, they've now gone ahead &  adjadjusted it upwards twice in just the past week & so it has only very recently crept up from the original & forever unchanged 24.5 PRA's which is where it began from & stayed at most of this season to where I saw it at today which was at 28.5PRA's. Now, in all honestly, I'm truly doesn't matter because he is still averaging over 30 PRA's for each & every one of his last 7 games with every one of them finishing at 28+ or to be exact his last 7 games PRA's have totalled out at 33, 49, 31, 35, 28, 31 & 32 with only that 28 now being under tonight's combine line & wow I'm extremely confident that I'll have no problems for passing it again especially with all the extra minutes he's been getting with so many of the other Orlando starters either completely out of action and injured or just limited in minutes because of nagging injuries that they're playing less court time with, especially due to the impact that his performances have been delivering.\n2. From a sheet value & payout point, +145 is FAR, FAR better than -115 & when you add in the factor that the +145 is \"technically for less work\" requiring just o19.5pts, o2.5 rebs & o2.5 asts (22.5 total) vs the -120 asking for o28.5 PRA's (or 28.5 total).\n3. Lastly, one thing that he has proven with the additional minutes that he's been getting resulting in 30+ mins of on court playing time for him in each & every one of Orlando's last 10 games is not only that he is 1,000% a gamer who is getting more confidence and better with every nightly performance, but that also he's the type of guy who will insert himself into and on to every area of the stat sheet consistently night in and night out because along with the 20+ pts that he's now generating every game, his average rebounds and assists combined total has not decreased but increased in the same time as well. As for the one caviar, however, which a specifically wanted to look at before changing the structure of the bet was the likelihood of him having a game where he doesn't reach any of those numbers at least minimally and I'm happy to say that in the last 10 games he has neither had less than 20 points or less than three assists at any time and it's generally averaging much more in both of those categories. As for rebounds, in one of the last 10 games he had a two rebound game but this was first Denver in Denver on the second day of a back-to-back and it was also the day which he played the least of the minutes I was infallible trouble considerably for that game so I don't think it is a truly consistent variable to consider but rather an outlier & I'm confident he will pull down at least the 3 needed rebounds if not moreso towards his usual 5.4/game average.\n\nBEST OF LUCK TO ANY/ALL WHO TAIL & ALL THAT'S LEFT IS FOR ME TO SAY IS.. NOW, LET'S GO CASH THIS SHYTE OUT!!!\n\nY",

Let's try to get some money in the new year.  \n5th place Al Qadsiah travel to 15th place Al Shabab. Al Shabab were alright last year but they are having a bad patch. Just based on the roster quality, this should be an easy win for Qadsiah but weird things can happen in these games.  \nShabab have a 5-10 goal difference in their last 5 matches, Qadsiah have 9-8. Their last H2H was in February, that ended 2-3. I'm not really considering matches before that because there were lots of changes since then.  \nI was thinking about BTTS since it hit in most of their last games but it wouldn't surprise me if there was a blowout and Qadsiah won 0-3. If Shabab does score, Qadsiah will aim for 1-2 for sure. That's why I feel the O2.5 is safer.  \n\nKeep in my mind I'm a random nobody from reddit, so tail with caution. BOL",

      "text": "POTD Record: 0-0\n\nNet Units: +0.0u\n___\n\nI was trying to save my POTD debut for Milano Cortana Winter Olympics 2026 (tap in, it's gonna be a movie) but it's the end of the year and a test run can't hurt. \n\n___\n\nAction: 🏀 [NBA] New Orleans Pelicans @ Chicago Bulls\n\n**Pick: Nikola Vučević O 26.5 Points + Rebounds, FanDuel Odds (-122), 2.5u to win 2.05u**\n\n___\n\nThese two teams meet for the third time this season as the Pelicans have a 2-0 lead in the head-to-head matchup against the Bulls. This time...it's going to be even more of an uphill battle for Chicago again as both their #1 and #2 bucket getters, **Josh Giddey and Coby White, are sidelined this game due to injuries**. This situates Vucevic (whom some may argue is already the 2nd option over White) as **the primary offensive funnel for the Bulls**.\n\n######While this heavily implicates more shot selection from the 2x All Star, it's also worth mentioning that the backup center for the Bulls, Zach Collins, is also injured and maximizes the hefty minutes in their already stretched thin roster depth.\n\nAs for the addition of rebounds, there's not much to be said. Vuvevic is currently 10th in the league for total rebounds (15th: RPG, 7th: R/48). Him and Giddey lead the team in rebounding, so there *ought* to be some extra boards for him to grab.\n\nDespite Pelicans having the Bull's number in past encounters, they are still bottom 10 league-wide in both points and rebounds conceded to centers. And for what it's worth, Vooch only played in 1 of those 2 previous matchups, both White and Giddey were on the floor.\n\nThe underlying worry here could potentially be that there is going to be a lot of jockeying here with assistance from Tre Jones, Ayo Dosunmu and Matas Buzelis who can all, in theory, takeover at any given point if they get hot (It makes the Bulls' fun to watch as a spectator, but can be stressful if you're on the last leg of a lay). However, I think the value here is strong given the fact Vucevic has been a consistent element in the Bulls' impact.\n\nFinally, this is also a tumultuous time in the NBA because it is when trade rumors and negotiations start to dominate the airwaves all the way leading up into the deadline in February. Vooch is no stranger to these rumblings (last remaining core member of the DeRozan-Lavine-Vucevic experiment in Chicago). As a perceived bargaining chip to help a rebuilding Bulls franchise, he has vocalized a desire to stay in the Windy City therefore he may be motivated to prove he has some innate value as a first option when a superstar is unavailable.\n\n___\n\nOriginally the line was 25.5 when I opened FD. I was stuck between choosing this pick and getting the *Ayo Dosunmu O 16.5 Points* (for different reasons, but still a good value pick that you could consider if this one seems sus for whatever reason) and I was dangerously close to picking the latter which I may regret tomorrow when it most likely hits. When I went to finalize, the line had moved maybe it's the same for some other books, but I wish I got it lower.\n\nIf you decide to tail, BOL. Let's end the year on a win.",

      "text": "**POTD Record:**  102 – 66 - 11\n\n**Previous:**  Porto vs AVS - Both teams to score NO & Over 1.5 goals – WINNING!\n\n**Recap:**  Best team vs worst team in the table.  Results not surprising, a win to nil with more than 1 goal as expected.\n\n**New Event:**  Las Vegas Bowl - Nebraska vs Utah\n\n**Pick:**  Utah - Total Rushing Yards Over 207.5 @ 1.88  (Usual 3 units)\n\nSeveral aspects to take into consideration for this pick, but they all add up to a good chance for success.  While Utah’s head coach Whittingham has left to take over Michigan’s top job, their defensive coordinator, Scalley, will be Utah’s head coach next year and is taking the helm for this bowl game.  Their last game was over a month ago and both players and coaching staff have had plenty of time to prepare for this match and can look forward to coaching continuity for next year.\n\nThe thought process here is that Utah have a massive advantage at the line of scrimmage with the 2^(nd) best rushing offense in the country, while Nebraska’s offense is missing its starting QB and RB.  Unless Utah falls behind early and needs to desperately catch up, there will be no need to even attempt to pass the ball and the rushing yards will add up. \n\nAs we have seen in other bowl games so far, teams that have not played in 3 or 4 weeks are not having success with their passing game as much as rushing the ball.  This will certainly be the case in this match.\n\nA few bullet points to consider:\n\n* Nebraska’s Passing Defense ranks #2 in the country allowing an average of only 147 yards per game (ypg), while Utah’s Passing Offense is 91^(st), advantage Nebraska.\n* Nebraska’s Passing Offense ranks #79^(th) in the country while Utah’s Passing Defense is 14^(th) allowing only 179 ypg, advantage Utah.\n* Nebraska is dealing with numerous opt-outs and injuries most notably starting QB Raiola, and starting running back Emmett Johnson. \n* Nebraska will be starting freshman TJ Lateef at QB who has stepped up with mixed results the last few games of the season.  2 losses and a win when starting.\n* **Utah has the 2nd best rushing offense in the country and averages 270 rushing ypg, while Nebraska’s rush defense ranks 102nd** **allowing an average of 180 ypg.  Massive advantage for Utah.**\n* Additionally, Utah rush an average of 44 times per game, 67% of all plays and get over 6 yards per carry.  Nebraska have allowed an average of 5 yards per carry.\n* Utah’s QB Danpier was going to sit this game out, but has decided to play. He averages 62 yards per game rushing by himself.\n* Opt-outs and injuries exist for both sides, but seem quite significant for Nebraska.  Utah will be missing a couple of starting linemen, but their rushing prowess is not even close to being negated by Nebraska defense. \n\nThe Over/Under line for Utah’s total yards is at 415.5 while the line for rushing yards is 207.5.  For a team that rushes 67% of all their plays and gets 6+ yards per carry, 207.5 seems a bit light.\n\nAlmost forgot to mention, Utah is laying 14.5 so a beatdown is expected.  All I can see here is running the football down Nebraska’s throat all day.  Unless Nebraska has figured out how to stop a top rushing attack without playing a single snap in a month, this should hit. ",

This season, he has cleared this line 86% of the time. McBride is coming back from an ankle injury, but in his first game back vs the Pelicans, he grabbed 14 points (4-8 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 4-4 FT). Now, McBride should actually have an easier matchup against the Spurs, as they defend the PG position pretty weakly (30th) compared to the Pelicans (5th).\n\nMcBride loves shooting the three, which is good for us as the Spurs rank 26th in threes to opposing point guards. The Spurs also tend to defend the three worse at home (bottom 5) compared to the road (top 5)\n\nWhen Josh Hart is out, he has grabbed 8 points 6/7 times in the last two seasons and 2/2 this season. He also attempts more shots (9 FGA vs 12 FGA) and gets about an 11% boost in playing time. For reference, when Anunoby was out earlier this season, he also went 8/8 on this prop. Hopefully, he is cleared to play more minutes next game as they will likely need his scoring on the second unit. Two powerhouse teams - should be a fun game.\n\nBOL",

Dostal has struggled quite a bit since coming back from his injury and Mrazek has a .865 save percentage in his appearances. The Ducks have also struggled with their goalie problem.

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 6-18-3 *Officially three times as many losses as wins. Yikes. Villa sold us hopes and dreams in the first half before proceeding to get blown out by the ruthlessly clinical Arsenal side in the second half. Despite all this recent madness though, I'm more than positive I can end the year on a high note with this next pick. Let's get an early one out of the way*\n\n**Last Five:** ✅❌❌❌❌\n\n**Event:** A-League Men, Central Coast Mariners v Brisbane Roar, starts in 6 hours and 54 minutes\n\n**POTD:** Central Coast Mariners Win or Draw -125, 5 units\n\n**Write Up:** A quick glance at the league table might make this one seem fairly straightforward, while it's anything but. The margins are actually much smaller when you see the games played and **how close the Mariners are to climbing all the way into the midtable,** and for that reason I'm willing to back the hosts to win or secure a cheeky draw. *While Brisbane Roar currently sit 8 places higher in the league standings* and have the better recent form, **this H2H matchup's often been competitive and unpredictable.** Across their broader history, Central Coast have picked up plenty of positive results, including a series of wins against the Roar in the last few seasons, reminding us that this fixture often favours the underdog *(and make it known, the Mariners are barely an underdog here).* For example, they've **won 3 out of their last 5 meetings** and the 3 wins have all been very comfortable.\n\nCentral Coast haven’t collapsed even when struggling in the table, and they still **create chances at home, scoring at least once in most matches this season,** and having **scored more goals than their next opponents.** Their attack has shown it can trouble defences through its sheer technicality even when the results don’t go their way. Their only issue is really their leaky defence, which has **also seen some slight improvements in defensive organisation** and especially the ability to execute pressing correctly, which makes it harder for Brisbane to simply dominate from start to finish. Not to mention Brisbane Roar have been pretty dreadful in front of goal themselves, scoring just a measly goal per game.\n\nTaking into consideration the competitive historical clashes, Central Coast’s ability to score and keep themselves in games, and the fact that **this rivalry has produced its fair share of draws and Mariners wins**, I like the chances of **Central Coast Mariners getting a win or draw.** Sending it with 5 whole units and going to sleep soundly, knowing I'll wake up to almost double the pretty sizeable stake. BOL y'all, let's end the year with a bang and bring some better fortunes into 2026 ☘️🫡",

They've safely secured 3rd place, whereas Cameroon can choose to sit back and play more cautiously. In the group stage, this line cleared in both games with 4 corners, 29 shots for Mozambique vs Gabon and 3 corners, 19 shots vs Ivory coast who have some of the best defence. Cameroon also hit the shot line and allowed 5 and 7 corners to their opponents in both group games. Mozambique were amazing corner generators in the WC qualifiers, clearing in 8/10 games in the WC qualifiers with 7, 5, 5, 4, 5, 5, 8, 8 including games vs Uganda, Algeria, who are solid sides.\nOne last win for the year.\nEnjoy the new years eve and best of luck.",

I think the reasoning was pretty sound so we’ll take this win and move onto another rebound pick because those are sort of fun.\n\n\nGame: Kings @ Bulls 8:00pm EST\n\nPOTD: Josh Giddey u8.5 Rbs, +101, 1u -> 2.01u\n\nReasoning: Giddey has been leading the league in rebounds for guards. Against the Bulls Giddey had 14 assists, however, this is against the Hawks, a relatively poor rebounding team. The game against the kings I expect a brawl of rebounds between Sabonis and Vucevic, making offensive rebounds harder to come by as well as defensive rebounds. Giddey’s stats have been inflated by his game against the Hawks",

Surprisingly, these two have never matched up before.\n\nI think this line is insultingly low for a player of Berg's calibre. If this was clay or slow outdoor hard, I would understand, but not for fast indoor hard. Sinner is 5-0 on indoor hard this season, but only one of those matches has finished in under 17.5 games (against Altmaier). On average, Sinner's matches finished in 21 games. \n\nIn addition, Bergs is playing pretty well with a 6-2 indoor hard record this season. Looking at his recent losses, none of them were in less than 17.5 games, including a 21-game loss to Djokovic in Shanghai.\n\nSorry for the super last minute post. Feeling pretty good about this one. Lets get back in the win column!\n\n*Tail or fade, BOL!*",

MPJ has a different role in Nets obviously and has taken his passing role up a notch, 2+ assists in every game so far and 34.8 passes made per game where he’s avg 5.8 potentials.\n\nActivity on the glass is always there with him and with Claxton facing Porzingis I love this matchup for Porter Jr who should be in great positions for the rebounds, avg 5.5 rebounds per game on 10.3 rebound chances per game.\n\nGame should be closer tonight than the Rockets game and MPJ should be in for 30+ minutes, just need him to convert less half of those chances to stats to be green. \n\nNo lines available for me last night so I apologise for not getting this out earlier, 8.5 is okay with me too but not higher than that.",

Zach returns to Chicago and coming into this game he has exceeded this line in each of his 4 games this season. In fact he has gone over 30 in each of those games. It is a B2B for the Kings, but I think that favors Zach who is much fitter and younger than many of his teammates (scorers like Russ, DeMar). In a high scoring game with the total set to near 240, and Zach’s amazing form so far, and the dynamics of a B2B, I will make this my first 5U pick of the season.  I would potentially even sprinkle 1U on 25Pts. Blowouts, injuries, off-nights etc are always possible so be cautious.",

I only double checked this when I looked at the POTD tracker sheet yesterday and saw it had me at 4.12U, not 4.09U. For clarity, here are the results of my posted bets so far starting from most recent: \n\nEmbiid 1Q P +0.86U \nPritchard FTA +0.95U \nPritchard FTA +0.83U\nMaxey FTA +0.8U \nWemby P +0.86U \nGreen TO -1U \nThompson F +0.68U \nReaves FTA +1U \n\nAdding up to +4.98U. \n\nOnto today - the Pistons are giving up 34.8 free throws a game (2nd in the league), from 28.3 fouls a game (=1st in the league), which is enough on average to end every quarter in the bonus, allowing for easy free throw opportunities. In addition, the Magic are taking 35.8 free throws a game, a league high. Obviously small sample size, but it bodes well.\n\nSuggs saw a career high minutes per game last year, and averaged a career high FTA to go with it (3.1). He is a career shooter of around 77%. He finished the last 15 games he played last year averaging 3.5 FTA. He covered this line 23/35 times (65.7%) last year, and at these odds we would need him to cover 54% of the time to be a profit if we reliably bet him every game with same unit, same odds. He has been on a minutes restriction to start this year after knee surgery, but has slowly been building minutes - 17, 19, 21, and in the 21 minute game he shot 4 free throws, making 3. This is more what I’m expecting. \n\nThe Pistons foul issues I mentioned before - Holland, Cunningham & Thompson probably the key ones here with Suggs, but the likes of Duren & Harris will help put the Magic into the bonus and give us a chance. \n\nThe game is expected to be close, with the ML odds close to even & the line just -1.0, so there’s a reasonable possibility of deliberate late fouls for FT attempts. Additionally, the points line is 225 so can reasonably expect a score around 115-110 or closer, with the Magic averaging around 113 points per game. \n\nIssues here are that Suggs is still playing limited minutes, and Banchero is taking bulk of the FTs anyway. Banchero is a bit of a ball hog & can slow the game down I think - hopefully Suggs building minutes starts to change this. There’s a chance with around 20 minutes Suggs also doesn’t play too much of a playmaking & driving role, which are the plays that would give him the best opportunity to receive FTs. Some things to consider.",

Clear Milan night, 13 °C, dry pitch — perfect for quick passing and sharp transitions.\nThat means every misplaced press or lazy clearance has a good chance of turning into an immediate counter.\n\nWhat really tips this toward the Over though isn’t just the averages — it’s tempo rhythm.\nWhen Inter play at home, the ball spends an average of only 39 seconds per possession sequence before a shot or turnover occurs (Sofascore tempo data), which is one of the fastest in Serie A.\nFiorentina rank top 3 in “progressive runs per match” and have been involved in the most high-xG games (> 3.0) in the league this month.\n\nBoth sides are happy to trade shots if it means maintaining pressure.\nStatistically, in Serie A this season, matches with both teams above 1.5 xG per 90 produce goals in bunches — 73 % of those games go Over 2.5.\nThis one fits the bill perfectly.\n\nSo yeah, if it somehow ends 0-0, I’ll personally light a candle for every wasted expected goal in Milano.\nBut based on the data, flow, and chaos levels these two bring — this should be fast, frantic, and fun.\n\nI’m riding Over 2.5 Goals @ 1.75 for 1 unit.\nAnd if it cashes, I’ll raise an espresso to Serie A’s ongoing refusal to play boring football. No kidding, currently it’s the most fun league to watch for neutral football fans.\n\nBOL!",

This group along with the rest of the team has given up the most rebounds to opposing teams so far this season.

I expected Medvedev to probably win, but at +200 I felt that it was worth action at a low unit size because of the analysis I laid out. Munar was dreadful and Meddy played very well. He also injured his hand early on, needing a medical timeout for it, which might have contributed. Can’t predict that. On to the next—and I’ll focus on finding big plus odds plays that I’m more confident in being winners, like my first pick. It was only a bad pick in hindsight, but still, I can do better. \n\n**Pick** - Valentin Vacherot ML vs Arthur Rinderknech + over 22.5 games (+200) 2 units ✅\n\n**Paris Masters 6:00AM EST**\n\nThe highly anticipated rematch of the Shanghai Masters is here, with cousin battling cousin. Vacherot won the Shanghai Masters final against Rinderknech in 3 sets. \n\nThese two have been on a tear, both had incredible runs to the Shanghai final, beating top players as dogs in almost every round. Vacherot’s run to the final was a bit more impressive, considering he had to go through 2 rounds of qualifying and beat Djokovic, Rune, Bublik, Griekspoor, and others. Rinderknech also defeated an absolute gauntlet including Zverev, FAA, and Medvedev to reach the final.\n\nVacherot won (4-6, 6-3, 6-3) in the final. He served better winning 78% of his first serves and 74% of his second serves compared to 68% and 54% respectively for Rinderknech. Another stat that stood out to me was that Vacherot went 3/14 on break points while Rinderknech went only 1/1. Vacherot forced 14 BPs and could have won the match more convincingly if he’d been more efficient. Credit to Rinderknech for saving them though, but it shows that Vacherot was the better player.\n\nHere in Paris, both of them won their first-round match in straight sets, but it was Vacherot who was again more impressive, destroying Jiri Lehecka (6-1, 6-3). Just giving the world #18 no hope at all. Rinderknech required two tiebreakers to win his against the world #48 Marozsan. Still a good straight sets win though.\n\nRinderknech will want to avenge his loss in Shanghai, especially considering his familial relationship to his opponent, and he’ll have the home crowd support (Vacherot is from Monaco). It’ll be a boost, and why I think he won’t get rolled in two.\n\nI expect another great match — probably another 3 setter, but Vacherot is looking too powerful right now to not win again. He dismantled Lehecka, and his run of unreal form is clearly not over. Over 22.5 games covers the possibility of a (6-4, 7-6) etc… two setter win and a 3 set win ofc too. \n\nDon’t bet more than you can afford, and keep in mind that it is a long odds pick, although I like it quite a bit.",

      "text": "**POTD Record 36-33-1**\n\nWe’re coming off an easy Heat win, even with Norman Powell (Miami’s leading scorer) sidelined. That one was never really competitive past halftime and that’s how you know we’re seeing the board clearly right now.\n\nLike I said in my last post, I’m starting to feel a streak coming. The board’s starting to make a whole lot of sense. A lot of these early-season lines feel like they’re still built off last year’s data and outdated player/team evaluations. The sample size is small, and Vegas seems stuck in last spring. I’m not. My reads are part numbers, part watching way too much basketball and knowing how these rosters actually operate in real life. And tonight, that radar locked straight onto one game which yes, I’m Biased. But I’m Also Right (I hope)\n\n**Cavs –4**\n\nIf you’ve followed me for a minute, you know I’m a lifelong Cavs fan. So yeah, there’s bias baked in. But this pick isn’t blind faith, it’s conviction with backup.\n\nI mean did Vegas not watch what Cleveland just did to Detroit? They dismantled the Pistons 116-95 and looked every bit like the defensive powerhouse they’re supposed to be . Sure, they’re missing players, but this roster is loaded with size, length, and experience.\n\nJarrett Allen and Evan Mobley are about to have a field day against Boston’s bigs. Let’s be honest: Queta and Garza are solid G-League-plus guys, but going up against one of the league’s best frontcourts? No shot. Allen and Mobley should own the paint and the glass.\n\nLast season Cleveland posted the NBA’s top offensive efficiency (121 ORtg) . Through this young season, they’ve maintained a top-five defensive rating, holding teams like Detroit under 100. Boston, meanwhile, ranks near the bottom five in offensive metrics so far. \n\nCavs finished top-three in opponent three-point percentage last year, and it’s carried over. That matters because Boston’s only path to covering this is to get absurdly hot from deep  and the Cavs are built to choke that off. I am not going to lie, that part does scare me some, as I do not expect Boston to be this cold all season, but don't believe that trend will change tomorrow.\n\nCleveland averages 45+ rebounds per game , fifth in the league last season, with two elite rim protectors. Like I mentioned at the top, Boston has no interior presence whatsoever .\n\nDonovan Mitchell is in full heater mode at 31.3 PPG, while Mobley is averaging 18 and 9 . Boston’s leading scorer, Jaylen Brown, sits around 29 PPG, but with Tatum out all season , he’s getting blitzed on every possession, and will continue to be. \n\nBoston’s offense has been ugly to start the year around 105 PPG on 43% shooting and it’s not getting better against this Cavs defense. Cleveland ranks top-five in opponent effective field-goal percentage and just held Detroit under 95 points with pure physicality.\n\nEven without Garland (out all season so far) and Merrill (out tomorrow), the Cavs have Lonzo Ball returning (doesn't play back to backs), which helps stabilize the backcourt. He’s not the shooter those guys are, but he brings pace control and defense. When paired with Mitchell, it’s enough to keep the offense humming while locking down Boston’s guards.\n\nCleveland opened around –2.5, but sharp action quickly pushed it to –3.5/–4 . Roughly 80% of handle is backing the Cavs . Usually, I’d be cautious when the public piles on, but in this case, it’s aligned with the data. Boston’s simply overvalued here because of brand recognition not production. I have felt this way about a lot of Boston's games so far (1-3 ATS), and have to pounce on it tomorrow. \n\nI actually think Cleveland’s opening loss to New York might’ve been a blessing. That gut-check woke them up after last year’s disappointing playoff exit to Indy, and the year prior to the Knicks. They’ve been laser-focused since, and woke up the dog in them. \n\nBoston, meanwhile, still looks lost without its stars. You can see the chemistry gap passes off-timing, bad rotations, no half-court rhythm. Yes they have good players, so in no way am predicting a blowout, however I think there is a higher chance of that then Cleveland losing this game.\n\nIf Boston starts cold again from three (they’ve been shooting 30% from deep this year), this could get ugly fast.\n\nI expect a competitive first half, then the Cavs pull away when Boston’s bench inevitably collapses under the size and pressure. Mitchell will stay hot, Mobley and Allen will control the paint, and the Celtics’ offense will sputter out around 105.\n\nThe bias? Yeah, it’s there. But fuck it, let’s ride.\n\n**UPDATED RECORD - posted Cavs play the other day on an OLD POTD thread, rather than the one the day the game was played.

At 7.0 yards per carry, Owens only needs around 14 average touches to eclipse the 93.5-yard threshold. However I expect to see a few big chunk runs to help get past this line. Kejon has shown he can break tackles and create explosive plays, which is what you need when targeting a rushing prop in the 90 yard range.\n\nThe matchup against Missouri State favors Owens continuing his season production. Missouri State's defense is allowing 141 rushing yards per game this season, landing them as just an average run D. When you put a top-five national rusher against an average run defense, the numbers favor the offensive player. With the tight spread I expect both teams to stick to their game script this will allow Kejon to get his typical 18-20 carries.\n\nUnlike tonight with Alonza Barnett/JMU, FIU is not putting up big passing numbers, with quarterback Keyone Jenkins completing 127 of 201 passes for 1,255 yards, making it clear the offense runs through Owens. Game script works in his favor as FIU will establish the run early and often. Owens should post another big performance and exceed 93.5 yards against a Missouri State defense that has not shown the ability to contain most rushing attacks.\n\nPrediction: Kejon Owens: 20 carries, 126 yards, and 1 touchdown",

I will now go for something very safe.  Bologna have been excellent at home lately and continue to find the net with confidence. Their attack looks fluid, and their recent scoring form supports the idea that there will be at least two goals in this match. Torino, on the other hand, struggle to keep clean sheets away from home, often conceding under pressure. The head-to-head record between these two sides usually produces open games with chances at both ends, making over 1.5 goals a very reasonable expectation. Given Bologna’s home advantage and current rhythm, taking them on the double chance adds a strong safety net to your pick.\n\nThe nature of this fixture also leans toward physical, competitive football. Both teams like to press and disrupt play, which typically results in plenty of fouls and frustration building up through the game. Torino’s defensive style often forces them into late tackles, while Bologna’s midfield aggression ensures the contest doesn’t stay calm for long. That mix tends to bring out the cards, and surpassing 2.5 in total is a realistic outcome. Combining Bologna or draw, over 1.5 goals, and over 2.5 cards makes this a balanced, high-probability bet built on both form and matchup dynamics.\n\nBest of luck.",

      "text": "Record: 152-134, -5.58 units\n\nLast Pick: Rafael Jódar to win 2-0 vs Murphy Cassone (+125, 1 unit): Win \n\nTennis | Charlottesville Challenger | 11:30 AM EST (estimated)\n\nToday's Pick: Jay Clarke vs Dylan Dietrich | Dietrich ML at +135 (MGM). 1 unit. \n\nWrite-up: Jodar closed around -120. The match one was a bit more competitive than I expected, as Jodar was actually down a break for the majority of the second set (and even faced a break point at 1-3, but it felt like he was able to get his nose into all of Cassone's service games. For that reason, it wasn't a huge surprise to see him break back with Murphy serving for the set and roll from there.\n\nJodar might be an exceptional player, but he wasn't the only one behind Virginia's success (9-4 record in competitive conference and NCAA tournament QF appearance) last season. Today, I'm actually going with another strong Virginia player, Dylan Dietrich, to get a win on familiar grounds. Last year, Dietrich played at either #2 or #1 in the lineup depending on whether Jodar was available. He put together a really nice dual season (6-3 at No. 1, 12-2 at No. 2) that led to him being ranked at #9 in the ITA's preseason ranking for this year. He was especially strong at home, where he scored wins over ITA #2 Sebastian Gorzny, #11 Aidan Kim, and #6 Jay Friend. All of that is to say that his current ranking of #1172 in the world is in no way representative of his playing ability. \n\nDylan already got off to a strong start here in Charlottesville, defeating world No. 318 Alfredo Perez in straight sets (7.04 performance rating) after being pushed down to 2.20 from a 2.70 opening price. That match serves as a useful comparison, since he's being priced similarly to his closing odds here. Similar to Jodar, I feel that Dietrich has a very strong indoor game. He's definitely not as stable from the baseline from Rafa; however, he stands at 6'5\" and possesses a massive serve that produced 11 aces and a 9.0 shot quality rating in that match. \n\nMeanwhile, Jay Clarke had an absolutely horrific start to the season, but was able to rebuild his form by playing some ITFs. However, he's not really your average Brit in that his strongest career results (including this season) have come on clay, not fast indoor hard courts. He got a solid first-round win over Tyler Zink (7.12 performance rating); however, the fact that he was priced as a pick'em in that match isn't a great sign of the market's confidence in him (Zink had one big run in Tiburon, but his Challenger results haven't been too great outside of that). Going back to the Perez match, I feel that Clarke is the slightly weaker player compared to Alfredo, who has recently taken sets off guys like Abdullah Shelbayh and Michael Zheng. \n\nOverall, this match feels like a toss-up to me, so I like Dietrich at plus money. Clarke's biggest asset is his heavy topspin forehand, which doesn't work as well on this surface, and Dylan's game should be better suited to these conditions. Prices on this play vary quite a bit across books - I would take it down to +120/2.20 or so, but I don't think there's value beyond that. \n\nNote: The [POTD Capper Tracker](https://potd.lol), which you may remember from its Google Sheet days, is finally back in a cleaner, more robust website format!

Napoli had two quick corners around the 15th minute in a first half pretty poor of opportunities despite Lecce being incapable of keeping the ball. The Giallorossi then started the second half much better than their opponents winning two corners shortly and Camarda missed a penalty. Napoli then brought on their rested big guns in Mctominay and Hojlund to regain conrol, taking the lead shortly after through Anguissa. This coincided with the corner count ending 5-3 to the Napolitans with late heartbreak for those on the +2 handicap that the line moved to after they were afforded a 95th minute corner.\n\nMotherwell find themselves mid-table in 7th spot and defeated Livingston at the last minute in their previous match. They also are into the Scottish League Cup semis where they’ll face off against St.Mirren in a couple of days. Since Askou took over the club in June the steelemen have been playing some nice attacking football and have averaged just 1 card per match this season. On the other hand Dundee United are in fourth spot, ahead of Rangers in what has been a strange season where Hearts are well clear of Celtic and the Gers. They tend to be quite aggressive, averaging 3 cards per match this year. Those stats are in line with referee of the day Chris Graham who has averaged 3.9 cards over his career in Scotland (4.3 this season though the sample size is very small). Using all the stats I have I get a mean of 1.1 yellows for Motherwell.\n\nThat gives this play an estimated 72% chance of winning. Honestly I’m quite surprised at the odds as they’ve covered this line in 7/10 matches this season. Obviously it’s quite risky as a red card would kill the bet and in general there isn’t much lee-way but the value is too good to ignore for me so will assume the risk that comes with it.

Thun (-1.0 &-1.5) Asian Handicap. 3u @ $1.87 ✅ \n\nI'm writing this as the game goes on. So apologies for any tense jumping...\n\nThun started really well, scoring two goals within the first 36 minutes. However, three minutes after their second goal, they copped a straight red card, so they played 50+ minutes with 10 men. \n\nWinterthur dominated possession in the second half - but the shot count was pretty even. As the half went on, though, Thun dominated the xG stat, even though they had next to no possession—which is precisely what you want when you're a man down and in a winning position.... Give away limited decent chances, and hit them on the break when you do have the ball. \n\nThun even had a great chance in the 78th minute to make it 3-0, which would have given some breathing room. \n\nHowever, Thun then scored a couple of minutes later to make it 3-0 with under 10 minutes left.\n\nThun held out for the rest of the game to win 3-0. Was unsure how we'd go with this once the red card happened, but a good win for us. \n\nToday's Pick: Roma to beat Parma and u3.5 total goals. 3u @ $2.05\n\nPick: Off to Italy today as 15th-placed Parma travel to Rome to play 2nd-placed Roma.\n\nMost of the time, I would be all about the 2nd-place team comfortably beating the 15th-place team at home... And I'm not against that... But I like the u3.5 goals here. \n\nNow, you could say a lot of things against Gasperini's Atalanta, but you wouldn't say they played boring games. \n\nAt Roma, though, his side looks a little different. There are a hell of a lot fewer chances. Parma are not much different.\n\nBoth teams have played 8 games in Serie A this season. \n\nRoma matches have had 11 total goals.\n\nParma matches have had 10 total goals\n\nRoma have scored eight goals and won six games. Now, that's efficiency.\n\nIt's not like they've been smashing xG and missing goals either; they're 9th in the league for expected goals with an even 10 in 8 games. \n\nIt's their defensive work that's put them in second so far; they've conceded 3 goals this season off a league-beating 7.0 expected goals.\n\nParma games have been super tight, but very low scoring too. \n\nParma have only scored three goals in their games so far off their 6.6 expected goals. \n\nOn top of that, none of their goals scored have been away from home.\n\nHowever, they've only conceded seven goals themselves. Parma have the 7th best defence xG-wise with 8.3 expected goals against. \n\nParma have also played Como, Atalanta, and Juventus.... So it's not like they've had a super easy run.\n\nStill, I can't see Parma scoring enough to do anything.\n\nI was tossing up between this and the overall under 2.5 goals scored at $1.73. Obviously pros and cons for both. Putting half your stake on both of those results wouldn't be the worst idea - but it's not exactly a POTD if I do that! ",

Toledo got an early goal but it was the best thing for the game, it woke Sevilla up.

They come up against 16th place Lorient which in the French league is a relegation playoff spot. Lorient have played 3 teams in the current top 6. Monaco, Lille and Marsielle. Monaco had a first half red card so they actually lost to Lorient but Marsielle and Lille beat them 4-0 and 7-1 completely dominating them. So when Lorient come up against a good team they struggle. Psg haven't cleared this in every game they should in my opinion but I think that's because they haven't had PSG calibre line-ups most of the season. PSG have had some world class attackers return from injuries recently including Dembele which is huge for them. He has only been coming off the bench for 30 mins in the last couple of games but I feel like this would be the perfect game for him to come back in and start. Honestly I don't really see how PSG don't score 3 goals here, they have potentially their strongest line up coming up against a team that struggles that don't have a world class keeper that bails them out. I can see this being 4 or 5-0 \n\nIf my picks help you and you'd like to show your appreciation a thumbs up is perfect, if you'd like to tip which is never expected but always appreciated and does help motivate me for the research here you go.

There is an average of over 3 goals per game between these two with both averaging well over 1 goal per game conceded and scored.\n\nLe Havre have scored in their 4 home games this season tallying 7 goals, whilst Brest have managed to score in 3 out of 4 away games with 6 goals total.\n\nThe stats alone are enough to suggest BTTS and I just like the fact that it’s a Le Havre home fixture. I think both teams are likely to approach the game positively, and we may see some end to end football. I see the right value here.\n\n**14 wins in 19 bets,** well done to any followers. No pressure whatsoever, but if you are willing, any help will go a long way.\n\nBuy me a coffee! - [https://www.paypal.com/ncp/payment/K4C6AK2VCT9EJ](https://www.paypal.com/ncp/payment/K4C6AK2VCT9EJ)\n\n**Thanks, GL**",

Bayern have won 13 straight matches to start the season, which ties the all-time European record, and they will be looking to extend that run to be the record holders for the only team in top 5 league to have won 14 straight wins to start the season. Bayern have scored 47 goals in those 13 games while only letting in 8 goals, showing they are unstoppable in both attack and defense. Harry Kane is in incredible form with 20 goals already this season including 12 in the Bundesliga, and Bayern just destroyed Gladbach 3-0 away last Saturday showing they score lots of goals even on the road. \n\nBayern have not lost to Koln since 2011 and have won 18 of their last 20 meetings against them. Koln are struggling badly right now, losing 1-0 to Dortmund last weekend without managing a single shot on target, and they barely survived the first round of the cup needing two goals in the 95th minute to beat a third-division team. Bayern are very motivated to win the DFB Pokal because they have not won it since 2020, and their coach Vincent Kompany just got a contract extension and wants to win trophies. With Bayern scoring almost 4 goals per game this season and Koln's weak defense and terrible form, a scoreline like 3-0, 4-0, or 3-1 is very likely, making the -1.5 handicap one of the safest bets tonight.\n\nIf you found these picks helpful, tips or donations are greatly appreciated as they support the time and effort I put into creating them: [buy me a beer🍻](https://buymeacoffee.com/hercules.son.of.zeus)",

I don’t like betting against home dogs. Especially in less than a TD spread but this one is the exception to the rule. \n\nThe reason I’m breaking my rule is I think a run game travels, and boy can JVST run. They are third in the country in rush yards per game at 277. MTSU allows on average 142 a game putting them at 67th defensively. \n\nMTSU is also not a very good team offensively. They rank 125th in points scored per game, 60th in passing and 134th in rushing yards per game. \n\nAdded bonus, JVST is coming off a bye week so they should be fresh and fired up. \n\nSagarin has JVST at 118 and MTSU at 171. \nJVST 4-3 MTSU 1-6\n\nNot a transitive property of football believer but worth noting, \nMTSU lost to Delaware last week by 3\nJVST beat them by 13 2 weeks ago. \n\nTailer Beware: JVST is 1-5 ATS last 6. \n\n35-24 JVST",

The past 10 H2H matches have included seven Leverkusen wins along with three draws. Leverkusen is a much better team and has a +12 goal differential while Borussia has a -9 goal differential in the Bundesliga. If you took this yesterday it was +money. Good luck",

The only difference is this competition is in Australia so it is not neutral grounds, however once again New Zealand women are just so bloody good and with the form they have winning the last competition (beat Aus the next best team by far 36-7) I don’t see them losing.",

      "text": "**Alperen Sengün Double Double +110**\n\n• He's averaging 20.9 points this season, and 21.2 points against the Thunder.\n\n• He's averaging 9.4 rebounds this season, and 9.9 rebounds against the Thunder.\n\nWith the Thunder allowing a lot of rebounds and Sengün having a good double-double record against them, I really like this bet.\n\n**Naji Marshall o5.5 Rebounds -130**\n\n• He's averaging 7.0 rebounds in his last 10 games.\n\n•He has covered over 5.5 assists in games with 30+ minutes: 8, 7, 11, 6, 8, 8, and 6.\n\nNaji is on a roll. He has surpassed this line in 7 games, and in his most recent game against the Spurs, he surpassed it again. He faces them again today, and I have confidence in him to extend his streak to 8 games exceeding this line.\n\n**De'Aaron Fox over o6.5 Assists -112**\n\n•He is averaging 7.9 assists in his last 10 games.\n\n•In games with 30+ minutes, he frequently surpasses that line by 6.5, with 8/10 in his 10 games and his assist average against them at 6.5. I see a lot of value in this line.\n\n**Nikola Jokic Triple-Double +250**\n\n•Now he'll face the Chicago Bulls, who allow the sixth-most assists to opposing centers in the league. Now that Nikola Vucevic has gone to the Celtics, Nikola has an easy path to assists. With the Nuggets without Aaron Gordon and Peyton Watson also out, Jokic practically gets the rebounds most of the time. He's averaging 29.1 points this season and 25.3 against the Bulls, so we shouldn't worry about his points. He's coming off a 44-minute game, so we shouldn't worry about his minutes either, as they're back to normal.\n\n**Dillon Brooks o3.5 Rebounds -170**\n\n•He's averaging 3.7 rebounds this season, and 4.8 rebounds against the 76ers.\n\n•This line is perfectly normal for Dillon; there's not much to explain. In his last 10 games, he's 8/10, and in his most recent games, he's 2/2, achieving 6 rebounds in each.\n\n**Jaylon Tyson o2.5 Assists -110**\n\n•He's averaging 4.0 assists in his last 10 games, and 4.0 assists against the Kings.\n\n•This line is very normal for Dillon; there's not much to explain. In his last 10 games, he's 8/10, and 2/2 rebounds against the Kings. •I really like this line and I think he'll easily surpass it. He's 9/10, only missing against the Clippers, and he's projected 3 assists but only managed 1 actual assist in the game. But that doesn't mean I won't trust him. He'll probably surpass the line before halftime.\n\n**Malik Monk o1.5 3-pointers -175**\n\n•He's averaging 2.1 this season, and 2.6 against the Cavaliers.\n\n•Malik is doing very well with 8/10, surpassing this line. The only times he missed were against the same team, meaning WAS. He's coming off a 6-for-10 game and I think he'll continue to be on fire and could easily hit 4 more against the Cavaliers like he did in his last game.",

Really love the way Bautista has looked. Everybody was kind of giving him shit for the Aldo win, but he has some wins and fights against high-level fighters, like his last fight, versus Umar. Umar is considered the next Khabib/Islam and is destined to be king of Bantamweight (according to “experts” lol) with most of his fights being listed around -1000. He had Umar in a deep ankle crank early, and launched a knee that landed on Umar’s chin, but still ended up losing 30-27. If you watched that fight you understand it was fairly close and Mario had his chances. He is right there on the cusp of being ELITE. With this being a five-round fight, I have to side with Bautista. We are talking insane pacing and cardio … close to Merab levels, against Oliveira, who gasses pretty fast. He also has an extremely dangerous top game that he hasn’t had to rely on in recent fights. Early rounds will be scary for our boy, and I expect him to eat a few heavy shots. He doesn’t have knockout power, but I do think his Muay Thai striking will serve him well enough to stand his ground when Oliveira pressures forward. Once this fight gets into round three, I expect Bautista to start pulling away drastically and put on an elite display of takedowns, mixed with accurate striking and control time.",

Both teams have seen Both Teams To Score land in each of their last five matches, underlining a clear pattern of goals at both ends. The head-to-head also backs this up, with BTTS hitting in four consecutive meetings between these sides.\n\nFrom a squad perspective, Luzern arrive with no noteworthy absences, while Sion are only missing right-back Lavanchy, which shouldn’t heavily impact their attacking output. Recent performances show a similar picture for both teams: defensively shaky, but offensively reliable, consistently creating and converting chances.\n\nOn top of that, both clubs were knocked out of the cup during the week, so motivation should be high to bounce back with a strong league performance. With form, match-up history, and circumstances all aligning, BTTS stands out as a solid play here.\n\nRemember to gamble responsibly and only invest what you can afford to lose!\n\n\n\nBOL!",

I lowkey trust Stuttgart more to be fair.\n\nFor today we are having 4th placed Stuttgart against relegation battling St.Pauli (17th), whom are winless in 5 Bundesliga games. At home they are on a small 3 game unbeaten streak, but when looking at which games these were, not special at all. Stuttgart though, are on a 3 game winning streak on the road, where they won each one of them very convincingly. Gladbach (0-3), Leverkussen (1-4), Bremen (0-4).\n\nOn the H2H side Stuttgart are 8-1-1 against St Pauli and at St Pauili, Stuttgart have won 3 games in the Bundesliga in a row.",

As a starter, Diabate averages 9.9 rebounds/game. This would put him within the top 10 rebounds/game in the league.  \nThe Hawks give up a lot of rebounds. One of the Hawks biggest troubles was rebounding at the center position; at the trade deadline, they acquired Jock Landale which, in terms of rebounding, is definitely an upgrade over Porzingis. The thing is, even with starting his first game with the Hawks, Kyle Filipowski grabbed 17 rebounds which surprisingly isn't his career high (tied for second highest rebound count). The Jazz ran an eight man rotation, but it only took Filipowski 28 minutes to do that. To be fair though, Onyeka Okongwu was out and their backup bigs were Newell and Gueye.  \nI think the reason for bigs rebounding well against the Hawks (besides roster) is how fast they play. They are one of the league's leaders in pace. More possessions played means more rebounding opportunities for Diabate to capitalize on.  \nFor pace to be taken advantage in favor of defensive rebounding, the other team has to miss shots. The Hawks offense is built to shoot a lot of threes. They are ranked 10 in 3PA/game at 39.2. This year, and especially recently, the Hornets have been great at defending the three point line.\n\nI'm taking 9+ rebounds, but I really like o9.5 rebounds at plus odds too. I'm opting for the lower payout just because I missed on two in a row. Hopefully I get lucky with this one",

Mario Bautista is great on the ground but he doesn’t pose an insane submission threat early, so I don’t think he will finish Oliveira in the first 2 rounds. I think it could potentially go the distance with Mario Bautista winning a decision. Mario Bautista will be able to hold Oliveira down due to his inferior grappling. I believe that this should be an easy win for Bautista and he will either win a decision or submit Oliveira in the later rounds.\n\n￼​Take Mario Bautista ML & Over 2.5 Rounds!",

      "text": "**POTD Record**: 4-2-2 (+3.15u) [All 1 Unit Plays]\n\n**Event**: EFL Championship - Wrexham vs Millwall / Birmingham City vs Leicester - 15:00 GMT+0\n\n**Pick**: Wrexham to score **+** Birmingham City to score @1.55\n\n**Write Up**: We're targeting the promoted sides attacking threat here. Both teams have scored in every home game so far this season and will look to carry that form into the second half of the season if they aim to be promoted. Both sides have reinforced in the January with attacking talent. Wrexham with Bailey Cadarmateri and Davis Keillor-Dunn. While Birmingham have recruited Alaves star Carlos Vicente for £7m in LaLiga. With Brighton loanee Ibrahim Osman and Danish striker Priske. This is to compliment League One Transfer Record holder Jay Stansfield, German international Marvin Ducksch and Japanese international Kyogo Furuhashi. It is fair to say they are not light on firepower. Both sides have gotten over the 'adjustment period' so to speak and this is really where their season begins. Even through the chopping and changing they have both found themselves in the top half of the table. \n\n*Their opponents*:\n\nMillwall - Millwall are a very decent side and have themselves in fifth right now, just a place above Wrexham. They're not rock solid at the back and concede an average of 1.38 xG per game, 1.51 away from home. They ended up losing to Wrexham in the opposite fixture where Millwall had the advantage at home. No one major missing but they do have a new #1 in Anthony Patterson who got promoted with Sunderland last year.\n\nLeicester City - They are a mess. You may have seen they have sacked their manager recently and have been docked 6 points by the EFL for financial misconduct. They have 1 win in their last five and the last time they've kept a clean sheet was in September. 14 of their last 15 opponents have generated at least 1 xG against them so they are open at the back but still a decent threat going forward. Their new manager Andy King has had one game in charge, 2-0 home loss to 17th place Charlton. The thing to note is that even though they were down to 10 men for over half the game they still had 21 shots and created a decent amount where they could have came away with something. With main centre half Caleb Okoli suspended. They will either draft in youngster Olabade Aluko or new signing but possibly not match fit Jamaal Lascelles. The expected defensive line of Pereira - Aluko - Nelson - Thomas is not the strongest by any means, which is good for us!\n\nWrexham are decent xG generators of 1.38 xG which improves to 1.64 at home. Birmingham are great xG producers with an average of 1.51 improving to a massive 1.91 at home.\n\n**Additional Thoughts**: Fourth time is the charm.",

When the fight was first announced I naturally leaned Jailton since he’s a mainstay of the Heavyweight division and has a somewhat unique skillset in this division (relentless takedowns and grappling pressure). However a few people alerted me to Kuniev’s background as a grappler and that got me interested in diving into his tape. Kuniev is indeed highly proficient at grappling. Moreover he’s the natural heavyweight here - today he weighed in at 260+ lbs whilst Jailton typically weighs in 230+ however today he weighed in a career heaviest 240+ and looked in the worst physical shape I’ve seen him in for normally such an athletic specimen (he’s coming off the couch so what do you expect). Jailton is in big trouble here if he cannot get this fight to the mat early and often. Kuniev is a skilled striker and Jailton will be at constant danger on the feet so for every minute this fight is standing I believe Kuniev will be getting the better of the exchanges. I do expect Jailton to attempt and maybe even get a takedown early on but Kuniev will work back to his feet and the energy expenditure for Jailton will be massive. I think there’s a good chance Kuniev could dispatch Jailton inside of 2 rounds here and expose what we already knew about Jailton but that isn’t reflected in the line - he’s a one trick pony at HW and he’s just not fought a true HW grappler with hands (except Curtis Blaydes who finished him in one round).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y5i0bqe860ig1.jpeg?width=866&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=100777ab5c4199864a1b28c700e93519995e9d88",

With both being good defenses, I could see this being low scoring; however, both have enough shooters that if either teams gets hot and an early lead, it could be a track meet. Comparing Durant to Holmgren for the last eight games, Durant covers 3.5 in 8/9. I expect Chet gets 15-20 at most, meaning I just need Durant to get a minimum of 24, which he has done in 6/8.",

She just destroyed Daria Snigur, who is in red hot form, in 55 minutes.\n* She had a 2 hour battle with Potapova before that but a lot of that was drawn out games, not because it was tight on Cirstea's serve...she generated 21 BP opportunities against Potapova but only converted on 4 - a lot of games to deuce, advantage and back to deuce etc.\n* Raducanu has been dominant as well this tournament but pretty poor before that. At her best, she probably is the favourite here but given she's had soft opponents except for Oliynykova. Oliynykova beat Xinyu WAng and Bondar to get to the semis and I honestly thought she'd take Raducanu out too.\n* Raducanu generated 14 BP opportunities against Oliynykova but had to save 13 herself.

Despite the massive height difference between these two (Ball is 5’2”, Figueroa is 5’9”), height and reach won’t be an issue for Ball to overcome as Figueroa prefers to sacrifice his reach advantages to fight in the pocket.  This puts Ball in prime range to score rounds over Figueroa.  In addition, Ball throws punches that are more attractive/flashy to the judges as opposed to Figueroa, who despite throwing with high volume, throws many punches that get smothered.  Figueroa has one of if not the highest stat for being hit by his opponents’ power shots in the sport, so he is wide open for punishment at all times.  Figueroa has also never been knocked out and has an amazing chin which can take a lot of punishment, so I expect him to make it the full distance of the fight.  Ball has a knockout percentage of a little over 50%, which isn’t very high at all, so I do not expect him to be able to knock out one of the fighters with the best chin in the division.\n\nThe event is being hosted by Frank Warren and Queensberry Promotions, and is being held in the UK.  Frank Warren is on a roll with building up British fighters and getting them to world level, especially at heavyweight, so while I’m not claiming fraud or cheating to take place, I fully expect Frank Warren to have had some degree of influence in the choice of ref and choice of judges (see Ball vs Goodman, Wardley vs Parker) in order to secure a win for Nick Ball, who could potentially see a unification bout with Bruce Shu Shu Carrington in the future.",

He has had very poor laning stats, with a -750 GD/15 and a -6.3 CSD/15.\n* While Shifters haven't been great either, they have a big bright spot imo in Paduck, their adc who will be going h2h with Hazel in lane. Paduck is averaging the 5th most kills of any ADC in the LEC at 4.9, despite his team having the second lowest winrate overall, he also is averaging the most damage of any adc in the league at 32.8% over 1.5% above the next highest.\n* Hazel has hit this line in 1/9 maps this split so far, 1/8 in losses and 0/1 in wins overall. Taking out his anomaly game in a map loss, he is averaging 1.85 kills per map loss. Even going back to when he was playing in tier two much lower leagues/worse competition, he had only a 5/14 hitrate in Summer, and a 4/14 hitrate in Spring for a combined 9/28. Shifters have only won 3 maps but have limited the deaths more then most teams in their wins so far.\n\n***Baus U 3.5 Kills Map 1 (-263)*** (Teams: SK Gaming vs. Los Ratones)\n\n* Baus line seems like such a free square to me, pretty hard to state how much I love this line, Baus is averaging a league worst 1.2 kills per map as a top laner, this guy was previously a challenger streamer, and while I respect tf out of him for making the leap out of his comfort zone, he is nowhere near a pro level top laner.\n* He has been awful at this tournament so far, averaging a -1010 GD/15, -1062 XP/15, and -16.9 CSD/15, all the worst metrics in the league by far. He also gets next to no jungle help/resources because his team knows he is their weakest player so he is left on an island to soak resources and hopefully let the ex pro players Crownie/Nemeis carry games. Baus champ pool is mostly tanks/bruisers, he has shown next to no super strong champs outside of Gragas/poppy and decent team fights on Kled\n* Baus has a 1/9 hitrate this season so far, taking out the anomaly gragas game, he has put up 6 kills in the other 8 maps he has played averaging 0.75 kills per map, with only one game coming close to this line with 3, **every other game has been 1 or less kill**.\n* While tier two data isn't as relevant because they were winning >80% of their games so his stats got inflated and allowed him to play crazier and pick up more kills, he still had a low hit rate on this line, hitting it in 0/27 map losses in his pro career, while hitting in just 43/92 map wins, giving him just a 36% hit rate",

Both teams play slow, tend to go for late game, farm a lot and play really well from behind.\n\n\nGoing for map 1 because historically teams play cleaner and more careful in map 1 to not give the lead early on and delaying the game by farming, map 2 tends to be faster because the losing teams starts tilting or the winning team starts playing too comfortably and make mistakes that causes the game to finish faster, so I rather take map 1 over than map 2 .\n\nYou can follow my other bets in esports daily discussions feed, feel free to text me also. \n\nBOL!",

Andoni Iraola’s Bournemouth are built around an aggressive, high-intensity attacking identity — a hybrid press that consistently forces turnovers and drives rapid transitions into the final third — and this isn’t just hype: data analyses show Bournemouth rank among the Premier League’s most intense pressers, winning the ball high and creating opportunities directly from these turnovers, a pattern that regularly produces goals for and against them. Although injuries to key players like Tavernier, Brooks, Adams, Soler, Kluivert and Doak weaken Bournemouth’s depth and defensive balance, Iraola’s philosophy means the team still presses forward relentlessly, even without its full complement — which increases the likelihood of both scoring and conceding as space opens up.\n\n\\- On the away side, Unai Emery’s Aston Villa combine structure with attacking intent that regularly produces goals at both ends. Villa’s midfield creativity and direct transitions have seen them feature in high-scoring encounters far more than shutouts, and sportsbooks’ statistical models flag that Villa matches frequently hit over 2.5 goals and both teams score patterns. Emery has publicly emphasised his desire for a balanced yet forward-orientated setup, pushing his side to sustain pressure even when defensive lapses appear, and while he prioritises solidity, his pragmatic philosophy still leans toward creating chances rather than grinding out sterile draws — especially away from home.\n\n\\- Both squads are motivated to attack: Bournemouth are chasing European aspirations despite a growing injury list, and Villa are fighting for top-table positions with players like Ollie Watkins returning to fitness, giving them attacking breadth. Tactically, Bournemouth cannot sit deep given their style and personnel losses, and Villa’s structure often entices opposition into transitional spaces that lead to goal opportunities. With both sides inclined to take risks, concede chances, and press opponents high, the conditions strongly favour a match that exceeds 2.5 total goals.\n\n",

Today we've got the 19th place team in the league hosting the 18th place in the league. Burnley are statistically the worst defensive team in the league by most metrics, other than goals conceded which West Ham holds the honor of. Don't expect fantastic football here, but I do expect some offense. \n\nBurnley, as I alluded to above, concede the most SOTs in the EPL, averaging over 6 conceded per game. Matteus Fernandes plays in the same role as our favorite player to back Enzo. He is less of a box crasher and more of a fire from range kind of player. When he hits them he hits them. He had an absolute screamer for a goal vs Sunderland. Fernandes does not take a ton of shots, but he has been trending towards taking more shots the last few weeks and I think coach Nuno has been encouraging him to shoot more frequently. He has landed an SOT in both of their last two matches (Sunderland and Chelsea), and took 5 shots between those two games. I like him here against this Burnley side to continue the streak. \n\nBOL and happy Saturday!",

Japan is transitioning from a February - December schedule to a more  European fall-spring schedule. This has resulted in the *J-League 100 Year Vision League!* Which means the team has been split into two, the WEST and EAST division. This will run until the final in June.\n\nThere is a fair bit of money on the line if you are one of the smaller teams in the league, plus the winner of the EAST/WEST division meets in a final that rewards a spot in the ACL!\n\nThere is also another big difference from the normal league format, a draw = penalty shootout! \n\n* So a normal win = 3-points \n* A win in the penalty shootout = 2-points\n* Lose in the penalty shootout = 1-point\n\nAlso there is no relegation/promotion on stake until the season starts proper in August. It will be interesting to see how this tournament pans-out. A lot of teams seemingly want to use this tournament to give some younger players a chance, so there has been less transferactivity than what one might expect.  \n\n\\---\n\n**For the actuall game:**\n\nJEF United are one of the “Original 10”, but despite being one of the founding members of the J-League and spending 44 seasons in Japan's top division, they have spent the past 16 years in J2! So what better way to start their comeback in the top division with a game against regional rivals Urawa Reds.\n\nUrawa Reds with another disappointing performance in J1, if we can still say that after a disappointing 2024 and 2023 and 2022 and 2021 and so on and so on and so on… Urawa haven’t done any big business for this “Pre-season Thingamajig Cup”, but they have lost Marius Høibåten in the defence who has been very good for them in his time there. \n\nSo there is kinda no big reason to believe in them again… However, they do have a pretty decent squad with individuals that can do things on their own. I also believe Urawa will play some more young players in these games  which will introduce more “random” into the game.\n\nFor me, this is probably the most fun game we have from the J1 sides today. The atmosphere is going to be amazing, not only are they back in J1 after an eternity in J2, but they are also up against local rivals in Urawa Reds. 2-2 maybe?",

Of course Chelsea can turn up and put a higher gear here with bigger scores such as 0-3 or higher, but we will play it safer with only -1,5 handicap here. I’m not impressed by Wolves at all and never saw it coming this season. Chelsea on the other hand keep growing and only turning out better for each season as expected from their younger purchases.\n\n\n\nI also had other games in my mind to bet on, but they didn't impress me as much as this game. They were pretty similar in terms of odds and picking style as well. My goal is to have something around the 3x odds barrier or higher.

Houston is playing great ball, BYU is not - Although BYU has the edge at home, they are also 1-4 against ranked teams coming into this one - BYU hasn’t answered many questions this season, and although they do have the firepower, and they are home, I can’t put money on them quite yet - Houston has won 17 out of 19 games this season when they have been the moneyline favorite - In every Houston write-up, the first thing I talk about is their defense - they will be able to stop BYU’s 86.7PPG % - I think Houston’s defense will be able to slow their offense and Dybamtsa down just enough for them to cover our +7.5 - Truly, I think Houston wins this one here, but BYU is way overdue for a good showing and a win - I’m not completely sold on Wright III & Saunders yet either, if those two can put together production more consistently to help AJ out, this team will be very very dangerous - Houston’s defense averages 63 PPG, and it’s hard to not take them in any of their matchups strictly because of this - they grind out their opponents and capitalize on every mistake made \n\nPOTD History: [https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/SoggyDatabase2348-bvjHUn](https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/SoggyDatabase2348-bvjHUn)\n\nBOL!\n\n**POTD: 2 Pick Parlay: NCAAMB: UNC +10.5 vs Duke + Houston +7.5 vs BYU -132 (0.50U TO WIN 0.36U)**\n\nTips are greatly appreciated - Proceeds will be going towards my student loans and my morning cold brews.

Still, he was able to get the job done in a quarter to two hours. \n\nInteresting Paris qualifying matchup between two talents who aren't playing their best tennis right now. Comesana is one of those rare Argentinians who is actually as comfortable on hard courts as he is on clay, though his biggest upset of the season (a three-set scalp of Alexander Zverev in Rio) came out the dirt.  He doesn't have a ton of experience indoors, but he comes off two straight weeks playing in these conditions, in which he went 1-1 against David Goffin (who has been playing better tennis as of late) and lost a close match to a peaking Collignon. Comesana's Tennis Insights performance rating exceeded 6.5 in all of those matches, a sign that his level is reasonably high right now. \n\nIn comparison, Luca Van Assche, a 21-year-old who appeared at the Next Gen Finals has often been named as one of the top French prospects. However, his form has taken a bit of a nosedive this year, as injuries and inconsistency have sent him spiraling down to the Challenger Tour. He's not a bad indoor player, and seemed to be rounding into form recently with an Olbia Challenger title, but a recent loss to Sacha Gueymard Wayenburg in Brest (6.08 performance rating). means that I'm not too confident about his level coming into this match. Van Assche is a smart player who isn't afraid to take the ball early despite lacking heavyweight power. However, Comesana gets a lot more pop out of his serve, and tends to cause trouble to players who fall into orthodox patterns with the sheer variety of shots he can pull off. Finally, Teelo's AI model gives Comesa√±a a 65.2% chance of winning here (as compared to 50.0% implied here), which inspires further confidence that these odds don't make a ton of sense. Comesa√±a did get quickly pushed down from an opening price of around -140 to even money, which is why I wouldn't put a huge stake on this. However, I believe that buying the dip is worth a unit, as the opening price was fair in my eyes.  \n\nNote: The [POTD Capper Tracker](https://potd.lol), which you may remember from its Google Sheet days, is finally back in a cleaner, more robust website format!

Lyngby, meanwhile, are the division‚Äôs highest-scoring side (27 goals in 13 games) and very in-tune offensively, which points to plenty of attacking intent. With no major injuries or suspensions reported for either team, both sides should be near full strength and ready to push for goals. Additionally, their head-to-head history supports a high-scoring trend ‚Äî the last six meetings have all seen both teams score and at least three goals in total. Tactically, AaB will be under pressure at home and cannot sit deep, while Lyngby‚Äôs offensive style means the game is likely to open up. All of this builds a strong case for Over +2.50 goals.",

In terms of eye test he is even better than what the statistics make him out to be, during the NRL season his trys are nothing short of brilliant also winning try of the year he creates trys out of situations that seem unrealistic.   \n\nLastly this could play as a doubled edged sword which is the reason why I think the pick is a bit short leashed is that he is in a team with superstars in all positions who smell trys just as much as him like Walsh, Addo-Carr and Staggs however the reason why I still decided to back this pick for my debut is due to the playstyle of his teammates we saw from this season‚Äôs NRL that Reece Walsh loves to send deep balls past the centre straight to the winger for a try however not only that I can imagine the Kangaroos will constantly try capitalising on one of Mark Nawaqanitawse‚Äôs greatest strengths his vertical which I think he will be the main target of, which will come from the one and only Nathan Cleary.      \n\nWith his debut for the Kangaroos aswell as the amazing lineup he is surrounded by, I will gladly take my chances at Mark Nawaqanitawase to score a try. (Only using 2U to see how the game goes as this is a BO3)\n\n**Don‚Äôt tail brainlessly, if you do tail BOL!**",

It looked like we were cruising with the Bhoys applying more pressure to find an equaliser but it was all she wrote in the first half for corners. Celtic then got two corners within 3 minutes at the 61st (which they both scored from) and we finally won in the 75th, ending the match on 9 corners and a 2-1 win to the Hoops. BTW what a player Tounekti is, absolutely tormented Graz‚Äôs RB but has issues with end product yet will be on my watch list for sure.\n\nKenin has had a poor year all things considered, bowing out early in the majority of tournaments and except for a final in Charleston (+ a decent tournament in Dubai) hasn‚Äôt picked up many impressive wins. That was until the QF‚Äôs here in Tokyo where she fought back from 5-2 down in the third set against Alexandrova (saving MP‚Äôs in the process). Her backhand caught fire at the end and will give her confidence going into this match. Bencic has had a very successful return from maternity leave, winning Abu Dhabi and reaching Wimbledon semis to make it to world No.13. Despite this she‚Äôs had some pretty shocking exits at times which includes an absolute blow-out at the hands of Sofia in Charleston and will be made to work in this match-up. Kenin has averaged a 5.1% double faults rate on hard courts over the past year. Using both players‚Äô serving/returning + ELO stats I get an expected 3 double faults across 22 games from the American.\n\nThat gives this play an estimated 72% chance of winning. Their two matches cleared this line. BOL !\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gsnan5lmd5xf1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c08021ec5e17a4135090773fe498eb68877d7d77",

After a horrid start with a 3rd minute goal from a rebound it looked as if we were in for a tough bet from the get go. An early goal changes game plans and really was the worst possible scenario for our bet.\n\nThis was followed by a 15th minute goal from a corner before the game really had time to settle. This corner was 1 of 3 awarded roughly until the 60th minute mark. We stayed in the bet until the 90th minute as Leeds were stubborn for a long time and held out well to restore hope.\n\nHowever, West Ham managed an amazing last minute goal from Bowen's ball into Matheus Fernandes (an unlikely header of the ball) which killed our bet.\n\nI feel my judgement was okay here contrary to what people may believe. West Ham were pretty toothless once again and that extremely early goal really was a dagger. With around 2.0xg for the game in total, tbh I'd say we were hard done by.\n\nStill sitting at a 75% win rate and +units so hope I haven't turned too many off with recent form\n\n**-**\n\n**Today's POTD:** Football - A-League - Melbourne City vs Perth Glory - Melbourne City (-1.5) - $2.30 - 1.5 Units\n\nWell a 3rd harsh loss in a row will see me going for a bit of a riskier play here, but it's great value for the match after analysis. Game will start in 8 hours roughly.\n\nPerth Glory will travel to Melbourne for the second round of the A-League after a 2-2 draw with Wellington Pheonix (who had to travel 7 hours to get there). Perth only retained 29% possession in the game, opting for a counter attacking approach.\n\nThey are notoriously bad travellers, and only managed 4 wins from 26 games last year which was good enough for last place in the league. Comparatively, City finished 2nd on the table and were eventual Champions, defeating Victory in the Grand Final.\n\nCity managed a 1-1 draw away from home against Western Sydney in the opening round (who I think will be really strong this year). They also played midweek in the Asian Champions League managing a 2-1 come from behind victory against Thai side Buriram, showing good character in both games to be down and manage results.\n\nCity's defence should be too good for Perth. I can't see Perth getting more than a goal in this game, although I do worry a touch about veteran striker Adam Taggart who managed a goal last week but comparatively Max Caputo is in great form for City, scoring in the last 2 matches. The striker has just returned from the Under 20's World Cup with 2 goals to his name in the competition as well.\n\nI like the fact that City have a bit more game time in their legs having played more competitive games recently than Perth. Overall I think the class of City is too much for them, and they'll be hungry to get their first win on the board in the league against a starting 11 of aging players that managed 29% possession at home against a jet lagged Wellington.\n\n\\-\n\n**12 wins in 16 bets**, well done to any followers. No pressure whatsoever, but if you are willing, any help will go a long way.\n\nBuy me a coffee! - [https://www.paypal.com/ncp/payment/K4C6AK2VCT9EJ](https://www.paypal.com/ncp/payment/K4C6AK2VCT9EJ)\n\n**Thanks, GL**",

      "text": "POTD Record: 0-0 (0 units)\nLast Pick: Norman Powell o21.5 points -105 (TBD)\nPick: Aleksandar Rakic ML -112 (FanDuel)\nEvent: UFC 321 Main Card 2:00 PM EST.\nExplanation: I was between this and 3-4 other picks on UFC 321 but landed on Rakic for a number of reasons.\n\nI‚Äôll start with the negatives first. Rakic is on a 3 fight losing streak. He‚Äôs facing 15-0 undefeated Azamat Murzakanov. Rakic has been KO/TKO‚Äôd twice in those last 3 while Azamat has KO/TKO‚Äôd 4 of his 5 UFC opponents. Rakic is a bit chinny and Azamat has late round power that could steal the fight.\n\nHowever, if you look into the numbers you‚Äôll get a much fuller story. Rakic has lost 3 straight to 3 former titleholders in Jan Blachowicz, Jiri Prochazka and Magomed Ankalaev. Against Jan he was a win away from a title shot and had just dominated the 2nd round before his knee gave out early in the third, requiring him to take 2 years off. He came back last year to face Jiri in a fight in which he looked incredibly sharp in. Rakic dominated with leg kicks in round 1 and 2, hard enough to arguably fold any other fighter in the division but the insanely durable Jiri. He‚Äôd get caught late in the 2nd and TKO‚Äôd but looked great despite a 2 year layoff. He‚Äôd quickly turn around to face Ankalaev in another fight he‚Äôd look good in. He‚Äôd win a close round 1 before losing round 2 more decisively. If you remember his coaches were feeding him terrible information and he fought a solid but careful third round before losing 29-28 on all scorecards.\n\nRakic could‚Äôve won all 3 of those fights which is a big what if but shows his position as being closer to the elite of the light heavyweight division than being another can. \n\nRakic has a number of things in his favor. He‚Äôs massive compared to Azamat as he‚Äôll be around 6‚Äô4 230 on fight day compared to Murzakanov being closer to 5‚Äô10 220. His leg kicks are elite and should be a massive advantage against a guy who he has a big reach advantage on and an athleticism advantage. He‚Äôs also fully capable of fighting a boring, controlling fight where he mixes in wrestling and controls the range with his kicks and jabs.\n\nHow can he lose? Murzakanov has big time power. He‚Äôs aggressive and can walk through shots to get in range and bomb overhands through Rakic‚Äô guard. \n\nMy prediction is a decision win for Rakic. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be sweat free and there will probably be a moment where Rakic gets hit but I think he‚Äôs just much more talented as mixed martial artist. Rakic is desperate for his first win in over 4 years and has switched camps to his home country as opposed to the knuckleheads who might‚Äôve thrown his last fight. \n\nRakic could get a TKO/KO set up by leg kicks but I think the undefeated Murzakanov will be overwhelmed by the pressure as opposed to jumping into the fire. Expect a slow fight of mostly stand up, if Murzakanov gets into a clinch then you could see Rakic drop for a single leg and take him down, another strength of his. He should know that if he keeps the fight on his terms he‚Äôs winning 99/100 times and has the skill to keep it there for at least 2/3 rounds.",

They beat the hell out of a highly ranked Illinois team, 63-10 a few weeks back. They beat the hell out of Michigan State 38-13 (Which should have been a cover but Michigan State has some sneaky sneaky stuff going on over there in regards to spreads and head scratching late game decisions), and handedly dispatched their 2 other OOC opponents for an average win margin of 60+. The only team that scratched and clawed was Old Dominon in Week 1, which is a bit of an outlier.\n\n\n\nLast year at home they beat the hell out of UCLA at the Rose Bowl, and ran over every other team that was lesser than them all season long. Their insane point differential was one of the biggest reasons they made the playoffs last year in spite of their pretty sub-par SOS.\n\n\n\nUCLA is not good. If you‚Äôd like a full breakdown on my thoughts of UCLA‚Äôs recent success you can look at my pick from last week‚Äôs UCLA vs Maryland game. A lot of it still holds true, and they weren‚Äôt able to cover against Maryland at home, looking extremely vulnerable in the second half of that game.\n\n\n\nI‚Äôm keeping it simple. Curt Cignetti is fired up for this matchup against a Cinderella story UCLA team and is pretty excited to curb stomp them in front of 52,000 IU fans. UCLA doesn‚Äôt have the firepower to compete with Indiana, and they don‚Äôt have the ability to sneak up on them because they put themselves on alert with any teams that face them in the future by winning 3 straight. Indiana will take this game seriously and beat the piss out of UCLA. I like Indiana first half cover as well, removing the chance of a backdoor cover, which is always a possibility with a big spread like this. I think they come out strong early to set the tone.",

Ross Smith looks primed to take down him by a couple of legs tomorrow‚Ä¶his recent form and stats just stack up stronger across the board. Smith‚Äôs averaging around 97 this season, a few points higher than Gurney‚Äôs 93, and he‚Äôs been throwing heavier scores with far more 180s (0.36 per leg vs 0.24). Over a long best-of-19, that kind of power scoring builds real momentum. Add in a slightly sharper checkout rate (42.5% to Gurney‚Äôs 40.8%) and better accuracy on his doubles, and it‚Äôs easy to see how Smith can edge out the crucial legs that turn a tight game into a 10-8 or 10-7 type win.\n\nMomentum‚Äôs also firmly on Smith‚Äôs side‚Ä¶he‚Äôs fresh off a red-hot run in the Players Championships where he hit multiple nine-dart legs and looked full of confidence. Gurney‚Äôs got the experience, sure, but he‚Äôs not been as consistent lately, often dipping below his best under pressure. Across a long format where scoring power and rhythm matter most, Smith‚Äôs steady averages and knack for clutch finishing should let him break free late and close it out by a comfortable two-leg margin.\n\nSide note the only reason, IMO, that Gurney even is in round 2 is because Gerwyn Price couldn‚Äôt hit a fucking double to save his life. Price went fucking 3/17 on check out and average a, in this level, pathetic 91 average. GURNEY averaged LESS at 90, the checkout of 6/11 is the ONLY reason he won. Price had an off day and I don‚Äôt expect Gurney to come out of the boonies and win tomorrow.\n\nAs always, BOL, PLEASE DON‚ÄôT OVER BET THIS, I know I‚Äôm on a ‚Äúheater‚Äù ü§û we make it 8 in a row tomorrow, but there‚Äôs still plenty of darts in the season. Don‚Äôt think this sport isn‚Äôt subject to dumb shit because I lost big on Gurney beating Price yesterday‚Ä¶.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/64n8p28yz4xf1.jpeg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4905c0176b3e0f3e66422a4f7b34a6f91a9bbd0b",

They just destroyed Club Brugge 4-0 in the Champions League on Wednesday night, and before that beat Dortmund 2-1 in their last league match. Harry Kane is the main reason for their incredible goal-scoring form with 12 goals in just 7 Bundesliga games this season, and he has 20 goals in all competitions already, showing he scores in almost every single match. The team also has Luis D√≠az with 5 goals and Michael Olise with 4 goals supporting Kane, so goals can come from anywhere on the pitch.\n\nBorussia M√∂nchengladbach are sitting at the bottom of the table with the worst record in the league, having scored only 6 goals all season while letting in 15 goals in just 7 games. They have zero wins, lost 3-1 to Union Berlin last weekend, and their defense is so weak that Bayern should score multiple goals easily. Bayern have already hit over 2.5 goals in six of their seven Bundesliga matches this season with scores like 6-0, 5-0, 4-1, and 4-0, proving they almost always score at least three goals per game. With Gladbach's terrible defense and Bayern's unstoppable attack led by Kane, this match should easily finish with three or more goals from Bayern. \n\n\nIf you found these picks helpful, tips or donations are greatly appreciated as they support the time and effort I put into creating them: [buy me a beerüçª](https://buymeacoffee.com/hercules.son.of.zeus)",

I wasn't able to watch the match, so can't comment too much, but from the extent highlights I've watched, Victory looked rubbish. In hindsight, if there's no bet I like, I probably should just skip the day and save the record. \n\nWe move on.\n\nToday's Pick: Lillestrom to win v Ranheim IL and o2.5 goals. 5u @ 1.61\n\nPick: Today's Pick: I had a whole writeup for Coventry -0.75 but I'm basically going to milk this Lillestrom cow until it stops giving milk. \n\nThey're the best team in the Norwegian second division by a massive margin. They've got a 21-point lead on second place, and recently have just been demolishing teams. \n\nThey host 7th place Ranheim in this game. \n\nHere's the last 5 Lillestrom league games (most recent game first)\n7-1 win away \n5-1 win at home\n4-0 win at home\n5-1 win away\n4-1 win at home\n\nRanheim have been mid table in both home and away form this season. But honestly, I just think Lillestrom are a class above, and they show no signs of coasting through to the end of the season. I find it very unlikely that they don't win this at home, and as you can see from previous games, the o2.5 looks a play too. \n\nIn fact, you can even jump on them to score 5 or more for like $6.50, which considering their most recent form isn't crazy. I also found them to score in the 3-4 range for $2.40. So you can play around with those too. \n\nBut for me, POTD is the win and o2.5.",

      "text": "Record: 42-30\n\nLast Pick: Wade win vs De Decker\n\nToday‚Äôs Pick: Van Veen -2.5 win vs Searle \n\nSport: Darts, European Championship\n\nReasoning: Van Veen‚Äôs scoring and checkout stats this season (97 avg, -45 % finishing) consistently outperform Searle‚Äôs, giving him more control over long-format legs. Searle can explode with power scoring and tidy finishing when he‚Äôs in rhythm, but his tendency to drift mid-match makes Van Veen‚Äôs consistency the safer side to trust. Over a race to 10, that superiority should naturally stretch into at least a 3-leg margin.\n\nI think Noppert offers excellent value, especially with the +2.5 line. I also think Schindler will come through against Joyce.\n\nOdds: 5/6\n\nUnits: 1",

Against a team like Brighton, who drop players into the pockets between the lines and force you to break them down, United‚Äôs structure consistently falls apart. They won‚Äôt have the space to counter like they did vs Liverpool.\n\nBrighton are in good form, confident in possession, and have the exact attacking patterns that expose United‚Äôs defensive fragility and poor pressing. But Brighton themselves concede chances and United still have enough up top to score at Old Trafford.\n\nI am  expecting goals and both teams contributing.\n\nPrediction:  I dont think United will win this one and can see Brighton winning this. \n\nGood Luck on your bets",

If he doesn't perform today, they can also rely on creative 21-year old right-winger Felipe Augusto, he scored in their last 3 games.\n\nEyupspor are sitting 14th right now and with their matches not being the toughest they are not performing well. With one win against 11th placed Kasimpasa in their last 5 games I don't see them scraping even a point away from Trabzonspor.\n\n**M√∂nchengladbach v Munich**  \nSame recipe as earlier this week here because if it ain't broke don't fix it: Bayern have scored over 2,5 goals in 10/11 games this season, the one time they didn't was against Dortmund last weekend. They are just a scoring powerhouse, even without Musiala. Kane, Diaz and Olise upfront are straight up deadly. They managed to get a 3-0 lead by halftime against Brugge wednesday and gave players rest.\n\nM√∂nchengladbach has conceded over 3 goals or more 3 times already this season against Werder Bremen (4), Frankfurt (6), Union Berlin (3).

They cant afford to continue dropping games which they would usually win while being 1 point behind Marseille on the table. With Dembele back, a convincing 7-2 thumping of Leverkusen in UCL, and leading the H2H with 9 wins and 1 draw in the last 10 matches vs Brest I can't really see them losing.\n\nNow onto our next leg we move to the UFC heavyweight division. Tom Aspinall is a great fighter but the heavyweight division lacks good prospects. Tom has basically been inactive for a year because the last fight to make at heavyweight was him vs Jon Jones but Jones ended up retiring and vacating the belt and is now left to fight Ciryl Gane because there's not really anyone else. Aspinall is notorious for his quick finishes, across 18 fights his average fight time has been 2 minutes and 2 seconds which is the shortest in UFC history. Admittedly we haven't seen Tom go past the second round and this will be a 5 round fight but regardless I do not see this going all 5 rounds. Ciryl Gane is a high level striker but this will be his third title fight and he lost the first two which were to Francis Ngannou and Jon Jones. Takedown defense was an issue in both of those fights as Ngannou was able to secure 4/5 takedowns on him that fight to a unanimous decision and Jones was able to secure a submission victory and Tom can definitely take advantage of this as well as match him on the feet with his freakish athleticism and power. Trusting in both PSG and Aspinall to come through for us tomorrow BOL and bet responsibly.",

Liverpool come in off a confidence-boosting 5-1 win over Frankfurt, and even with some injuries, their attack is clicking, scoring 1.7 goals a game, and Gakp and Ekitik√© are all contributing regularly.\n\nDefensively, both teams are conceding around 1.5‚Äì1.6 goals per match, which supports a high-scoring scenario. Liverpool's last five head-to-heads against Brentford have seen BTTS land in three of them and over 2.5 land in four, with their last meeting at this ground ending 2-0 to Liverpool but generally open games between these two. Team news sees Liverpool missing key defenders but still possessing plenty of attacking firepower, while Brentford remain solid at home, losing just once in their last four at Gtech Community Stadium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPS: Glad to hear so many of you are enjoying the write-ups and making profits from the tips!

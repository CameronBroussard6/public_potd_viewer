He’s gone over in 5 straight games against the 76ers including 1/1 against them this season where he had 6 on 11 rebound chances. Some of those overs against the Sixers were with Tatum aswell so without him he should get even more chances to get it done.\n\nFeels like I’m repeating myself but with how opposing teams guards Embiid and with how he plays, he draws the bigs out leaving tons of weak side rebound opportunities for the wings where Jaylen should eat.\n\nHas gone over in 3 straight games against Embiid with 6, 6 and 7 boards, Tatum played in two of those games. Without him there’s even more responsibility for JB to fight for the rebounds.",

Solidifying the o53.5 before heading into the 4th quarter felt good. For Friday's pick, I'm looking at the College Football lineups and will be targeting the C-USA matchup between Sam Houston and LA Tech.\n\nNeither of these teams boast a great record in conference play, especially with Sam Houston sitting last in conference with an 0-7 overall record. Evaluating scores; Sam Houston averages 14 offensive points per game on the road while their defense allows 43 points per game. Compared to LA Tech, who averages 31 offensive points per game at home while their defense allows just 14 points per game.\n\nLouisiana Tech lost 28-27 in Overtime to Western Kentucky in their last home game. Despite the offense having little issues moving the ball and staying neutral in the turnover margins for the game, the team came up short. The Bulldogs starting Kicker DNP in Tuesday's game and the Bulldogs likely wished he had. They ended up missing two field goals in the duration of the game, the last one being the game winner. Drew Henderson will be back in action for Friday's game, and LA Tech is going to be looking to bounce back with a win before heading on the road again. I'm taking the Over in this match up.\n\n**The Event:** **Sam Houston @ Louisiana Tech | 08:00 PM EST | College Football**\n\n**Today's Pick:** **Totals Over 45.5 (-150) |** 3u to win 5u",

They took the lead just before the half through Maswanhise and doubled it towards the end of the match with Watt scoring. On the cards front Hendry picked up a booking in the 63rd with nothing after that with only 9 fouls conceded.\n\nAfter two very mixed seasons (for their standards) where they finished outside the top 3, Dortmund are slowly rediscovering some consistency under Kovac and are playing some nice transitional football. They defeated Frankfurt on penalties in the DFB-Pokal a few days ago and are 4th in the league - 2 points off second after some tricky opening fixtures to start the season. On the other hand Augsburg finished 12th last season, comfortably avoiding relegation  but find themselves in 15th spot right now after a poor start to the season. Under former Bayern player Wagner they have developed a counter-attacking style similar to Dortmund. At home, Augsburg have averaged 5.2 corners won over their last ten with 3.8 conceded whilst on the road BVB have averaged 4.1 won over the same period. That gives me 4.2 corners for Dortmund even by applying pressure as they are the better team.\n\nThat gives this play a 75% chance of winning with some very good value at stake. This line cleared in last year’s fixture and in 9/10 of both BVB’s last 10 away matches and for Augsburg’s opponents at the WWK Arena.

PSV’s attack has been strong recently, with three of their last six games going over 3.5 goals. They dominate possession and create plenty of scoring chances, especially at home. Fortuna can sometimes defend deep but also struggle against fast, attacking teams like PSV. If PSV start well and take control early, the game could see several goals again. Over 3.5 goals looks possible considering both sides’ recent trends and PSV’s attacking form.",

Over 3.5 Goals AND KuPS to win v Gnistan. 3u @ $2.20 ❌\n\nAnnoyed at myself for this one. Bangkok won 7-0 so that over was easy. \n\nKuPS were winning at half time and looked good for it, but gave away a bad penalty with a tad over 10 minutes to go. Match ended 1-1. \n\nToday's Pick: Coventry to win at Wrexham. 4u @ $1.86\n\nPick: Larger write-up coming...   \n  \nThis is a pick for a few different reasons. But it boils down to two things that compound into one another. \n\n1. I think bookies have really struggled with what to make of Coventry so far. I feel like odds have been off for a while - which is fair to a degree, this has been pretty unexpected. It's tightened a bit in the last few weeks, but still some caution. \n\n2. Wrexham, imo, have been overrated in the odds in a large percentage of games. \n\nAdd these two together, and you get pretty good odds. It was at $1.91 but it changed in literally the ten minutes it took me to write this up. It might shorten again.",

They have one of the best attacking records in the league and strong home performances. Theyve been in great form lately, creating chances nonstop and usually finding the net at least twice in most games especially at home.\n\nAl Shabab’s defense hasn’t exactly been solid either, so unless they suddenly tighten up, Al Hilal should have enough quality to put in a couple of goals.\n\nOnto next pick I think the over 2.5 goals in PSV vs Sittard has a good shot. PSV almost always play attacking football, especially at home , they press high, create a ton of chances, and usually score two or three on their own.\n\nSittard might not be a top team, but they can sneak in a goal if PSV relax a bit at the back. So even if PSV run away with it, something like 3-0 or 3-1 feels pretty realistic.",

Trefl should be the favorites, even slightly. This is because the balance of strength currently favors Trefl Gdańsk. They started the season with a 3-2 win over Barkom Lwów, with MVP Tobias Brand (New Transfer) scoring 23 points. In week 2, they lost 2-3 away to Asseco Resovia in Rzeszów, making it 1 win and 1 loss in the first two matches. The on-field backbone (setter, hitter, and libero) is more established, and there's more depth. The transfer window was a productive one for Trefl. High-level \"winning profile\" additions: Experienced/effective players like Tobias Brand and Piotr Nowakowski directly boosted the quality. Aliaksei Nasevich (OPP): He sprained his ankle in a league match on October 26th and was substituted. It's uncertain whether he'll be ready for the away game against Suwałki.\n\nŚlepsk Malow Suwałki lost 1-3 at home to Resovia and 0-3 away to Jastrzębski Węgiel in Week 2; they opened the season 0-2. The long, 33-31 victory in the third set came in the Jastrzębie match. A major summer overhaul: two new setters (Kamil Droszyński, Karol Jankiewicz), midfield reinforcements (American David Smith, Jan Nowakowski). Captain Bartosz Filipiak has been extended; he remains the team's primary scoring option.\n\nTrefl has looked competitive and productive in two matches, while Ślepsk struggled to create sets against two strong opponents. Trefl's core is ready for the season opener. Trefl's wing/backline is capable of holding sets inside and will give their all to win this match.",

Technically still made .34 units off of it even with the void so we'll just count it as a win, unfortunate though because it was looking like a good fight.\n\nToday's match: LA Tech vs Sam Houston State (CFB) \n\nPick: LA Tech -14 Alternate Spread (-142, Fanatics)\n\nIf your book does not have whole number spreads you must calculate it yourself using a run line calculator with -14.5 and -13.5  (https://zcodesystem.com/runline\\_calc/)\n\nBack to fading my favorite team today, Sam Houston State is still winless in 7 games and they are coming off a bye week so the last time they played was the last time we faded them against UTEP. If we take a look at similar opponents these two teams have faced this year we can see that there is a clear talent gap here because LA Tech is actually blowing out the teams that are blowing out Sam Houston.\n\nSam Houston vs WKU 24-41 Loss\n\nSam Houston vs NM State 10-37 Loss\n\nSam Houston vs UTEP 17-35 Loss\n\nLA Tech vs WKU 27-28 Loss\n\nLA Tech vs NM State 49-14 Win\n\nLA Tech vs UTEP 30-11 Win\n\nAs you can see LA Tech has covered the  spread against all teams who covered the spread against Sam Houston except against WKU. Admittedly LA Tech has not been in good form, they closed against Kennesaw State as a -5.5 favorite and against WKU as a -6 favorite and lost to both outright. They got destroyed by Kennesaw State 35-7 but performed much better in their loss against WKU in the second half which I'm hoping carries over to today. They were trailing WKU 20-7 but then held WKU scoreless in the second half and was able to force OT which they lost. I think this is a good bounce back spot for LA Tech who are basically the better team everywhere compared to Sam Houston, personally taking -14 for a two touchdown cushion which would be a push but I also like -16.5.

The jags gave away tank bigsby and ended up drafting this guy in the 4th round with the pick. Clearly they want him in the mix. With Jacksonville a decent favorite in this game you have to think they’ll be playing ahead most of the game and rushing the ball a lot. Hes averaging about 8-9 carries a game which should translate to this line being too low added with the implied game script against Tennessee. Tuten was a menace at Virginia tech and the jags are looking to get more of that out of him and he should be able to hit this line easily if he gets 8 or 9 carries. There’s not much to think about. I got the line at 26.5 and Ive got it upwards of 30-35 easily. It’s moving fast, get it as quick as you can. ✌️",

Fulham is a sleeper pick to give teams a rough time IMO.\n\nSport: English Premier League - Crystal Palace vs. Manchester United @ 7:00am EST\n\nPick: Tie or Man Utd + BTTS = +140 (5 units)\n\nWrite Up: This is very similar to my previous pick, is Crystal Palace a bounce back team? I think not. While this too is a home game for CP, they just played and lost to Strasbourg in France as of two days ago and now have a quick turnaround game against Manchester United. While CP is one of the best coached and managed teams in England, they’re not used to playing in Europe and the Prem. Manchester United is a wild card, they’ve shown flashes of progress, only to take a step back again. I do believe there is a sense of belief within ManU, they’ve proven to themselves they can play well and win. I think with more time off than CP, they’ll be more prepared. They also have the added benefit of only needing to focus on the Prem, ManU can win this. To manage a bit of risk, I’ve selected Tie OR Win for ManU, as well as BTTS. I think ManU will score, I also think they’re shaky enough to let in a goal.\n\nI’ll update based on lineup announcement.\n\nBOL!!",

While Yakult Brothers are a decent squad, Execration has historically performed well in high-pressure elimination series like this one. Their aggressive playstyle and individual skill ceiling often overwhelm Chinese opponents in this format. This match is win-or-go-home, and we expect Execration to step up, utilize their momentum, and secure the victory to keep their tournament hopes alive.\n\nBOL!",

Here’s the bounce back pick.\n\nEvent: Chelsea vs Arsenal @11:30 AM EST\n\nPick: BTTS -128 (FD) \n\nI’m an Arsenal fan and as much as I would like to put our moneyline, Stamford bridge is a difficult place to play at. Chelsea just beat a talented Barcelona team in Champions League 3-0. The last time Arsenal failed to score was August 31st against Liverpool, the last time Chelsea failed to score was August 17th against palace, a defensively sound team. I anticipate seeing a 1-1, or 2-1 to either team as this matchup always provides a good watch.",

City made it sweaty but got the job done. We cash and move.\n\nTodays Event: Wolves at Aston Villa / Brighton at Forest (EPL) @9:05am EST \n\nToday’s Pick: Aston Villa ML + o1.5 goals in Brighton vs Wolves (-110) \n\nWrite Up: Aston Villa has sneakily stacked up to 5th in the table. They have lost one prem game since August which was away at Anfield. They have been solid at home. In all comps they have won five straight at home. As well as their last four in a row in the prem. Wolves. Nothing to be said. One goal away from home all season. No wins all year. I can’t help but continue to fade them. \n\nBrighton and Forest feels like a tricky matchup. I debated with a second leg for this potd but ended up here. Two goals. In a tricky toss up game. I like it. This o1.5 has hit in 11/12 prem games for Forest. As well as 12/12 for Brighton. Both teams combined only have 3 clean sheets all season. Expecting both teams to have many chances to score. Ideally we see a first half goal and we are in business.\n\nBOL. Let’s go get another one.",

Over the last couple weeks he’s been trending up in both usage and snap share, and this matchup sets up nicely for him to rack up chunk yards on the ground and through dump-offs.\n\nHe’s basically the “oh crap nothing’s open” button for this offense right now, and that alone gives him R+R upside. If he gets anywhere near his recent touch share, this line feels soft and the movement from 49.5 to 50.5 shows the books agreeing.\n\nMay my perfect record continue its historic run.

Going into their BYE week the Chargers got absolutely embarrassed against Jacksonville. Los Angeles has had two weeks to prepare for this game and will be fully rested to go up against this weak Las Vegas pass defense and get themselves back on track.\n\nWith Omarion Hampton ruled out for presumably one more week, and with the Raiders competent run defense, it will be up to Justin Herbert and his wide receivers to get the yards LA needs through the air. Since entering the league, Keenan Allen has been consistently Justin Herbert's favorite target and his go to guy in big spots when they need it most.\n\nThrough 11 games Keenan Allen has averaged 7.8 targets per game and has cleared this line in 9/11 games this season. The Raiders are ranked 28th in receptions allowed to wide receivers with 12.9 per game and Allen cleared this line previously against Vegas in week 2 with 5 receptions.\n\nTail or fade BOL to everyone and cheers! 🍻",

NBA can be unpredictable with player injuries, minute restrictions, and all. But corners in soccer won't stop due to a single player's injury. My belief is corners are often driven by game script and the team's eagerness to create chances.  \nChelsea and Arsenal are the leaders in corners taken in the EPL right now, with 80 and 79 corners respectively so far in their 12 games.  \nI do not have to worry about Chelsea or Arsenal leading the game; both are capable of creating double-digit corners.  \nBoth teams have an average of 6 corners per game. If either of the teams scores in 1st half, the corner will start to burst from the other team, or if neither of the teams is able to score, corners will still burst from both teams. Both teams have players active in the roster who are on top of the leaderboard with the most final third passes as well. Generally speaking, I like this bet.  \nSorry I cannot give more stats this time since this bet is more of a situational bet, and situations/game-script are in our favor.

      "text": "**Record:** 4-0\n\n\n**Previous Pick:** Jacoby Brissett o243.5 passing yards ✅️ \n\n\n**Game:** NFL - Jaguars @ Titans, 12pm CDT\n\n\n**POTD:** Travis Etienne o63.5 rushing yards (-114 on FD) \n\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n\nTravis Etienne has been a solid rusher this season, averaging 74 rushing yards per game. He has hit this line in 6 of 11 games this year, with most of the misses coming in games where the Jags were trailing heavily (Rams, Seahawks) or against an elite defense (Texans). Another consideration is last week's return of Brenton Strange. Strange has been very important to the Jags' run game, and the splits make this clear. *With* Strange playing, Etienne averages 96 rushing yards per game. *Without* Strange, that drops to just 43.3. Last week he toted the ball 15 times for 86 yards, and Strange was a contributor to that.\n\n\nOn the Titans' side of things, they come into this week surrendering 108 RB rushing yards per game. Their opponents' RB1 has only not hit this line twice. Once was against the Texans, whose rushing attack has been spread out and mediocre, and the other was against the Chargers, who have had similar issues. They also give up 20.5 running back carries per game.\n\n\nDivisional games are always shifty, and I expect the Jaguars to lean on their rushing attack to try and open up the play-action game and control this incredibly important matchup.",

      "text": "**POTD Record:** 10-5 (Avg Odds +130)\n\n**Previous Pick:** Nick Woltemade 2+ SOT (+245) ✅️\n\n**Today's Event:** English Premier League | Chelsea vs. Arsenal  (8:30AM PST)\n\n**Pick:** Enzo Fernandez 1+ SOT (+140) 1 unit to win 1.40 units\n\n**Write Up:** Our lanky German Woltemade came through for us with a late 1st half goal and a 2nd shot in the 58th minute. Great to see many of you cashed with both the 1+ SOT and 2+. Lets try for a long weekend sweep today!\n\nOff we go to London for the match of the weekend - where 3rd place Chelsea host 1st place Arsenal. You guys are probably sick of hearing me talking about Enzo Fernandez, but guys they're giving us his SOT line at plus money again. After cashing this play 3 different times so far, I'm not overthinking it. Sorry if you all are sick of this pick, but it looks too good to pass up. I also think this might be our last clear play on this line. Let's talk about that.\n\nI've always based this play on the simple fact that Enzo plays further forward, takes penalties, and take free kicks with Cole Palmer out. This has now hit in 9/9 of his last matches in all comps, averaging over 3 shots and just about 2 SOTs per game. Enzo has been arguably Chelsea's best player this season. Chelsea coach Maresca has said Palmer is ready to come back from injury, but has been very cryptic about his role. I think Palmer will suit up for the match, but I don't think he starts. If he does start, I doubt he will be playing the whole match. All of that said, I don't suspect Enzo's role will change overnight here and expect he will get at least a half without Palmer.\n\n**To be clear, I like this play whether Palmer starts or not.** It does change the team dynamic, but Enzo has been balling and I don't see him slowing down. This is a massive match with title implications - big players show up for big games.\n\nBOL if tailing, have a great Sunday!",

The Commanders will once again be without star QB Jayden Daniels who remains out with an elbow injury, as Marcus Mariota continues to start in his place. Washington has now suffered 6 losses in a row & are trending in the opposite direction as their opponent this week. The Broncos are coming into the game looking to extend an 8 game winning streak, with the 2nd best win % in the NFL. With one of the best, if not the best, defense in the NFL, their offense gets a juicy matchup vs a vulnerable Washington defense.\n\nDenver’s offense has been solid lately, but Washington’s defense has been HORRIBLE lately. __Washington is 31st in defensive EPA since Week 6 (-76.1). They have allowed a league high 7.0 yards per play since then.__ Not only have they been just bad, they have been specifically bad against the pass. __Washington’s pass defense is the worst in the NFL in dropback success rate (51.4%) & dropback EPA allowed (0.266). Those are even worse in the last 4 weeks. Their 63.6% success rate & 0.515 EPA allowed on dropbacks are both at the bottom of the NFL. They have allowed the 2nd most receiving yards per game to WR’s (170.3).__ Their biggest issue has been giving up deep passes to opposing receivers. __Washington is allowing a league high 13 yards per reception & a league-high 6.7% touchdown rate. They have also allowed a league high 59.6% completion rate & a 120.0 QB rating (31st) on throws 10+ yards downfield.__ Here is how opposing pass catchers have fared for their longest receptions vs Washington, starting with the most recent:\n\nWaddle 31 yards, Achane 22 yards\n\nWilliams 41\n\nWhite 60, JSN 26, Arroyo 26, Horton 25\n\nKelce 38, Worthy 27, Rice 25, Juju 24\n\nLamb 74, Pickens 44\n\nSwift 55, Burden 37, Monangai 25, Odunze 21\n\nAllen 29, Conklin 21\n\nBijan 69, London 43, Pitts 26\n\nTucker 61, Meyers 45\n\nKraft 57, Heath 37, Musgrave 23\n\nThey’ve been crushed every single game. __Washington has allowed the 7th most 20+ yard receptions (38) & the 2nd most 40+ yard receptions (10).__ Now they face the Broncos who have a QB/WR tandem that have an elite 20+ yard reception connection in QB Bo Nix & WR Courtland Sutton. __Sutton had 17 catches of 20+ yards last year & has had 12 20+ yard catches in 11 games this season. Sutton has had a longest reception for 21+ yards in 8 of 11 games this season, including 4 of his last 5, with the 3 of those going for 30+ yards.__ The schematic matchup also works in Sutton’s favor. Sutton plays the X receiver in this Broncos offense. Washington’s defense plays a ton of man coverage & single high on the outside, with a banged up cornerback room. Those are the looks where you typically target the X receiver & this team allows the most yards per dropback in single high coverage this season. __Washington The Commanders play man coverage at the 9th highest rate in the NFL (31.5%). Sutton has put up 29% targets per route run & 3.29 yards per route run versus man coverage.__ That is more than double his yards vs zone. Another reason we will see Sutton get his share of targets is Denver’s run game. Since Broncos RB JK Dobbins went down with a foot injury in Week 10, 2nd round Rookie RB RJ Harvey has taken over the Denver backfield. He has been somewhat underwhelming for this offense forcing them to lean on the pass more. __Harvey has a 26.2% success rate as a runner this year, ranking 53rd of 54 RB’s with 50+ runs. He has gained 10+ yards on just 3.3% of his runs, also 53rd.__ So with the lack of rushing success combined with Washington’s severely decrepit pass defense, we should see Bo Nix dice up this secondary & pepper Sutton with targets. \n\nSutton is going to feast, he’ll get at least 1 long one.\n\n__Courtland Sutton longest reception o20.5 yards__\n\nAppreciate the love!

But in defence it's just so easy to cut them apart, Van Djik has been poor and Konate has been pathetic, his body language so poor he doesn't even seem to care anymore.\n\nLiverpool have conceded 10 goals in their last 3 games, and **away from home they have just 1 clean sheet all season** against Burnley\n\nOf course Liverpool still have the better team partially in attack. The goals will eventually come particularly when playing a poor defense like West Ham, however West Ham will smell blood on this wounded Liverpool team.\nThis game has the potential for a lot of goals and I can't pass up this bet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoffee's always appreciated if you have found my write ups and bets useful ☕\n\nhttps://buymeacoffee.com/willo777\n\n\n**BOL and only bet what you can afford to lose!**",

      "text": "Overall record 27W-12L\n\nUnits: +9.81 (All picks are 1 unit)\n\nLast pick: Alabama -12.5 (-114) ✅\n\nPretty much expected from Alabama they did the same thing they did vs UNLV to Maryland and won very convincingly.\n\nToday's match: Carolina Panthers vs Los Angeles Rams (NFL)\n\nPick: LA Rams -8.5 Alternate Spread (-135, Fanatics)\n\nWon't be too long of a write up simply because we took the 49ers on Monday night on the spread vs the Panthers and everything in my writeup there can apply here. I think the Panthers are bottom feeders and Bryce Young is still not good. The Panthers 6 losses this season have been by an avg of 17 points a game and they have lost by 10+ in all of them except vs the Cardinals. The Panthers now face their toughest opponent of the year in the Rams with Matthew Stafford leading the MVP race being levels above Bryce Young. If the Panthers could not put up double digits in crucial game to take the lead in their division vs a 49ers team that had given up 22+ in 7 of their last 8 games then I fail to see them do better against this Rams team who are not only much better offensively but also defensively. This Panthers defense is also banged up missing their star corner in Jaycee Horn who was responsible for picking off Purdy twice on Monday night. BOL and bet responsibly.",

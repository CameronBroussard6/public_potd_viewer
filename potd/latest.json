In September, he won the title at the ITA's Battle in the Bay Classic without dropping a set, and followed that up with a strong performance as the No. 2 seed at the ITA All-American Championships. He then scored a big win over ATP #251 Clement Chidekh at an ITF in Montreal, and has already gotten off to a great start here in Drummondville, as he just defeated a really solid indoor player in Antoine Ghibaudo in straight sets (7.18 performance rating)>\n\nMeanwhile, Gabi Boitan is a solid player, but he plays most of his tennis on clay courts. The market hasn't exactly been loving him here in Drummondville, as he was pushed from +125 to +290 in the opening round and from +135 to +200 in the second round. Sure, he got through both of those matches in straight sets, but he didn't necessarily put in an amazing performance in either of them (6.95 and 6.87). In particular, I felt that he was starting to struggle physically in his second match against Ilagan, but got bailed out by his serve and a few poor points by Ilagan in the second-set tiebreaker. Looking at how Boitan was priced in that match, Ilagan closed at almost the same odds against Nicholas Arsenault in R1; however, I believe that Chan is playing at a slightly higher level than Arsenault right now. In addition, Chan closed at around +160 vs Ghibaudo, but I would honestly put Ghibaudo pretty close to even money in a match against Ilagan. \n\nOverall, my analysis of each player's form and recent market pricing makes this a 50/50 match to me. Both players are baseline grinders, but I feel that Chan brings a bit more variety to the table with his slice. Duncan was also hitting his returns with interest against a pretty big server in Ghibaudo, and I feel like that should help him against Boitan, who utilizes a heavy serve as one of his main weapons in these conditions. For those reasons, this is a 1-unit play for me.\n\n\nNote: The [POTD Capper Tracker](https://potd.lol), which you may remember from its Google Sheet days, is finally back in a cleaner, more robust website format!

That makes it 4 wins in a row betting on an away team favorite to cover their spread. For a change, I will go with the home team spread here, still betting on a favorite though.\n\n \n\nNext Pick: **Miami Heat vs New York Knicks -4.5 @ 1.95**. 3U play.\n\nThe Knicks had high expectations coming into this season, and while they started off rough, they got into a nice groove recently winning 5 in a row (both SU and ATS). They did lose their last game (Magic) but I’m willing to cut them some slack since it was the second half of a B2B. The Heat have been fairly good, but without Bam, their offense does seem to rely on Norm Powell (who I like) more than it should. In their last game, they also lost to a Cavs team that rested multiple starters, so I think some of the weaknesses of this squad are being exposed. I expect OG or Mikal to focus on Norm to reduce his threat, and with Mitchell Robinson/KAT they should be able to limit easy looks for Ware. I’m happy to back the better team at home to cover this line.   ",

You could look at him dropping deep being the reason he wasn't involved but his team just weren't looking for him when they were in and around the box. For anyone else who played this bet on Bet365 congratulations we cashed full value because Phil Foden was subbed on for Harry Kane and got the assist for the second goal and on Bet365 sub on play on is a thing where you still get 90mins value when they are subbed out for someone else. To anyone that's on a different book, I'm assuming it's a loss unless they have something similar. The POTD is down as a loss either way and that ends the 4-0 streak 🥀🥀 Let's try our hardest to bounce back right away!! 👩‍🍳*\n\n***POTD6***  \n***-*** *France U21 Asian Handicap -1.0*  \n***-*** *England U21 to win*  \n***Odds:*** *2.41*  \n***Units:*** *5*  \n  \n***Sport:*** *Soccer ⚽*  \n***Teams:*** France U21 v Switzerland U21, England U21 v Ireland U21  \n***⏰:*** 5:45AM AEST (16 hours and 40 minutes from time of posting)\n\n***Reasoning:***  \n***-*** *France U21 have played two games in Euro U21 qualifiers, winning both with scores of 6-0 and 6-1*  \n***-*** *France U21 have quality of players no other side in their group has, this is because France football has too much depth so players that are good and U21 have to settle for U21 football.

They brought in the 7th ranked Transfer Portal class, and return a starting Senior who was a 10ppg scorer last season.\n\nUSC has covered the spread in both games so far this season, winning by 30 and 31. They draw a great matchup imo with Illinois State. USC is a lot bigger across the board and their opponent Illinois State’s top 2 scorers are 5’11 and 6’2. I expect USC’s height across the board to bother them.\n\nUSC’s shortest starter is 6’5 and the others are taller. They currently rank 11th in the country at Offensive rebound percentage at 44%. Last game they grabbed 24 offensive boards.\n\nNot only the size advantage, the talent USC brought in is top-notch in my opinion. \n\nThe 3 best starting transfers are Chad Baker-Mazara was one of Final4 Auburns top players last year, R. Rice was one of Sweet16 Maryland’s top scorers, and Ausar who avg’d 12.5ppg for Utah. \n\nTake USC -16.5",

I traveled to Iowa City to go watch that game and completely forgot to post it, but I looked a lot at Oregon and how they operate.\n\nThe numbers will point towards Oregon pretty considerably in every aspect so I’m not even going to acknowledge them. Oregon is a 25.5 point favorite for a reason.\n\nI watch a lot of Big 10 football and I’ve had this theory over the past 2 years since the addition of the west coast teams that they get pretty flustered when playing against the old Big 10 west. This is showcased when the king of the old Big 10 west (Iowa) covers the +6.5 against one of the best teams in the conference in Oregon and almost beats them, Wisconsin kinda hangs around Oregon until the 4th quarter, and teams like Washington get the doors blown off by teams like Michigan, Iowa last year, lose to a bad Wisconsin team this year. There’s something about playing against these gross midwestern farm teams that they have the ability to drag you down into the mud and make games competitive that really shouldn’t be.\n\nOregon notably did not cover against their past 2 matchups, Wisconsin and Iowa. Minnesota is cut from the same cloth as both of those teams, and they employ a similar style of gross football. \n\nOregon is missing it’s 4 best pass catchers this week to injury, and will rely on running the ball through the heart of Minnesota at home in another cold and rainy Oregon climate. Oregon is also coming off of a massive emotional spot in beating Iowa at Kinnick with 3 seconds left in the game, and is in a look-ahead sandwich spot after getting hyped up for their biggest test of the year at Iowa City, and going to play USC after Minnesota. They are also on a short week.\n\nOregon got into a war with Iowa. PJ Fleck wishes he could be Iowa’s Kirk Ferentz, and plays a lot of the same style of football as Iowa. I expect a low scoring matchup where Oregon wins by 2 touchdowns, but doesn’t quite get over that 25.5 marker. Oregon will run the ball at will, burn clock, and start preparing early for USC. Minnesota will slowly drive the field with their very good QB in Drake Lindsey, get a touchdown or 2 and cover the spread.",

After looking at Oregon's last two games most people probably think this line is too big. They only beat Iowa by 2 and lowly Wisconsin by 14, not covering their spread in either game. So why would we think they are able to cover this week??\n\nMinnesota is actually having a decent year; they secured bowl eligibility early, don't have any terrible losses, and picked up a quality win against a ranked Nebraska team. The two huge blemishes on Minnesota's resume are their outings against Ohio State and Iowa. In both of these games Minnesota only managed to score 3 points. They tallied 162 total yards against Ohio State and 133 total yards against Iowa. What do Ohio State and Iowa have in common? Well, not much...other then they both have elite defenses. Who else is in that club? Oregon.\n\nOhio State and Iowa rank top 4 in both Scoring Defense and Total Defense. Right there with them sits Oregon at #3 in total defense, allowing 239ypg and #7 in scoring defense, allowing 13.78ppg. Minnesota has faced elite defenses before and has nothing to show for it, now they have to travel 2 time zones west and try to muster up some points on the road. I just don't see it happening. \n\nOregon should put up some points here like they have all season long, and now we are at the point of the year where style points come in to play as well. The committee is watching games and puts their rankings out each week, Oregon is currently on the outside looking in when it comes to the Big Ten's auto bid, so they are going to have to earn an at large bid. This is a Friday night game on Fox, and they will have all eyes on them, the perfect opportunity to run it up against a conference opponent. \n\nOregon Total Offense: #13 (472 ypg)     Minnesota Total Offense: #118 (313 ypg)\n\nOregon Scoring Offense: #9 (38.7 ppg)     Minnesota Scoring Offense: #95 (23.8 ppg)\n\nOregon Total Defense: #3 (239 yards allowed per game)     Minnesota Total Defense: #21 (312 yards allowed per game)\n\nOregon Scoring Defense: #7 (13.78 points allowed per game)     Minnesota Scoring Defense: #39 (21.56 points allowed per game)\n\nOregon: 5-4 ATS (3-2 at home)     Minnesota: 2-6 ATS (0-3 on the road)\n\n  \nOregon does have some key offensive injuries with their coach being coy about their possible returns during his press conference this week, I suspect some are back, some still out. But they were without them at Iowa and still managed to move the ball in a monsoon against one of the country's best defenses. Weather looks great for game night, and I think they will still be running smooth on offense even without a couple of their dependable weapons. \n\n  \nI see Minnesota struggling to get anything going and Oregon utilizing their balanced attack to run up the score early and often. Go Ducks! 🦆",

Anderson had a few good opportunities, but unfortunately they were all blocked before reaching the keeper. We move on. \n\nWe're coming back swinging after our loss with what I see as a high value-high pick. I really like this match today where we see 1st place in the group Netherlands visiting 2nd place Poland. Netherlands comes into the match carrying a 3 point lead, so a win or a draw here secures their place in the world cup next summer. Poland equally are battling for 2nd place and a loss here makes their match in Malta on Monday a spicy one. I fully expect Netherlands to win this game and dominate possession, however I see some value on the other side.\n\nMatty Cash plays right back. With Poland typically lining up with a back 3 in a 5-4-1 or something comparable, Cash tends to play pretty far forward. He also (if you can sense a theme) loves to shoot from distance. But not only does he shoot from distance, he can score from distance with some absolute screamers (2 weeks ago against Man City, for example). \n\nNow onto data. Cash has had at least 1 SOT in his last 3 club matches as well as in his last 4 country matches. In his last 4 matches for Poland, he's averaging 3 shots per match and 1.5 SOTs. This includes a goal in the reverse fixture at Netherlands in September. I see Cash continuing his streak and landing a shot on target here. \n\nBOL!",

Fading Zverev in a high stake match (choker ptsd) against an inform *RECOVERED* *lol iNjUrY* Felix on favourable conditions and boasting a 78% win rate on IHC’s in 2025. He gets a set *more* than 61.4% of the time in this spot; back the leaf🇨🇦 \nWhatever the opposite of *tldr* is: Only two logical matches to look at between these two. Their 2024 Miami member was on historically slow courts (35.5 CPI ((lowest of all HC 1000’s that year)). These conditions were way more favourable for Zverev. *However* Zverev also delivered an immaculate performance winning 93% of FS and a jaw dropping *100%* of SS. He of course didn’t face a single break point and delivered an impressive 11 winners to only 6 unforced errors (great numbers on such slow courts). Godly performance. Onto the next. \nJust over 2 month since their last meeting at the US Open. I couldn’t find the CPI but it’s much faster than 2024 Miami lol. Felix showed improvements and came through as a +275 underdog from a set down. Felix brought an aggressive game to Sascha blasting 50 winners to 35 UE’s. He found success with his serve +1 going 24/27 at the net. I think tomorrows match will play out similarly if Felix plays aggressive, rushes Zverev’s forehand and ends points quickly.",

Both teams have been looking incredibly shaky. Vitality who were most dominant run in recent time have really fallen off in level as of late. They have looked way weaker/less dominant, map pool has gotten worse, and they have struggled against much worse teams they previously would've dominated.\n* Spirit on the other hand despite a fire power upgrade in adding tN1R have also struggled, their calling/overall strat book is just non existent. Watching them on some of their best maps is horrendous how all they can do is send donk to get a multi kill and if he can't, they can't do anything in rounds.\n* Vitality are 3-0 in matches against Spirit and 7-1 in maps in 2025, however all of these games came from the first half of 2025 when Vitality was much more dominant. While I still favor Vitality, they are definitely in worse form then they were back then but I think on paper this is still a really good matchup for them\n\n**Veto:**\n\n* Spirit ban Inferno, Vitality ban Ancient\n* Spirit pick Mirage (chance of Train/Dust 2)\n\n**Mirage Stats:**\n\n* Spirit are 64% winrate on 11 maps of Mirage L3 months\n* Vitality are 64% winrate on 11 maps of Mirage L3 months\n\n**Player Stats:**\n\n* Zywoo is averaging a .80 KPR L3 months\n* Sh1ro is averaging a .80 KPR L3 months\n* Both guys are AWPers, while they are both capable and strong on riflers especially Zywoo, their is a big advantage for AWPers on CT side (Defense) as it is the much better side in general for sniping/using the AWP. Since Map 1 is Spirit's map pick, Zywoo will start on CT side\n* Zywoo is averaging a .91 KPR L3 months on Mirage for Vitality with a .87 KPR in 2025. This is his best/strongest map. Since its Spirit's map pick, Zywoo would start on CT side, he is averaging a .95 KPR on CT side of Mirage while averaging 1.18 kills per round win for Vitality\n* Sh1ro is averaging a .80 KPR L3 months on Mirage for Vitality with a .78 KPR in 2025. This is an average/slightly lower map for him compared to some others in the pool. Sh1ro would start on T side which is much worse for AWPers. He averages a .67 KPR on T side on Mirage\n* Zywoo is 7-1 in the h2h against Sh1ro in their h2h matches out fragging him 161-113 in h2h matches in 2025. Zywoo is 3-0 on Mirage h2h against Sh1ro beating him by an average of 6 kills per Mirage map they have played, and 1-0 on Dust 2, beating him by 8 kills on Dust 2",

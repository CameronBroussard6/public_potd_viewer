Team Scoffin actually looked pretty good in their first match, despite the lop-sided result against the tournament favourite, Team Einarson. Horvey in particular was really good with her guard placement. This is a team that prefers to play an open style but we're forced into a more precise game in draw one due to their competition and the score. They should be able to peel and simplify the game against Team Kaufman. Team Kaufman, on the other hand, did not look good in their loss against Team Armstrong last night. They struggled quite a bit with guard placement and anytime they needed to play a raise. Kaufman doesn't have a great runback game which will hurt the team at this event. Skauge also has a weak takeout game. We've got great value on Team Scoffin tonight.",

They’re struggling at the bottom of the table. Nuno Espírito Santo is a great manager and starting to get some results from squad. They have 2 wins in their last 3 matches but more importantly, 5 goals in those 3 matches. \n\nThey’re up against a better Sunderland squad who could actually move in to the top 4 at least temporarily with a win today. Sunderland do have a solid defense, but don’t manage to keep a clean sheet as often as their goals allow would suggest (2 clean sheets in last 15 matches). They’re also without Xhaka in the middle of the field. He’s the captain and heartbeat of the team. They’ll miss his presence on the field. \n\nI think Sunderland still gets the win, but I don’t think they’re doing it with a clean sheet. \n\nBOL",

This season, Pastrnak has an assist in 14/23 home games, and seven of the last ten games overall. Additionally, this is the third time these two teams are meeting this season, and Pastrnak had an assist in both prior games, with three total.",

This one will be on the road so it will be even harder but I do think they are the better team. \n\nMercer is in good form winning against the spread in 7 straight games. Also scoring nearly 86 PPG. Wofford has not been as hot and is 2-2 in the last four games. (Both against the spread and straight up) \n \nIn close games teams look to put the ball in the hands of their top scorers. In this case Okojie(Mercer) and Holmes(Wofford). Difference between the two? Okojie is an 83% ft shooter while Holmes is 70%. If this is a close game decided at the line, Mercer is who you want to side with. \n\nLastly, Mercers interior defense has stepped up big time on the road and is ranked 87th for points in the paint allowed. \n\n\nBOL!

This new job is making it almost impossible to contribute to the community with any sort of genuine research, as is evidenced by my last two picks being rushed. \n\n*I emphasis to all of you guys who are new here tracking*: **DON’T RUSH A PICK,** ***JUST TO RUSH A PICK.***\n\nSo, without further ado, a pick with the bare minimal research: Fulham hosts Brighton in the Premier League, and we think both teams will find the back of the net.\n\n**Fulham have had both teams score in 4/5 and 9/13, meanwhile Brighton have done the same in 5/6. H2H they’ve both scored 3 in a row and 4/5, including a 1-1 draw earlier this season**.\n\nThe parity of the Premier League makes this an intriguing one: it’s 11th vs 12th, but both teams could finish the day as high as 6th in a European place. **I expect both teams to go for it.**\n\n**Brighton have scored twice in 3 of their last 6 away games**, showing a purpose to get forward on the road. **At home Fulham have scored & are unbeaten in 4, but more importantly they’ve conceded in 5/6 at home**. They’re getting results but with leaky defense.\n\nThere’s some goal scoring form as well. On Fulham’s end **Harry Wilson has 3 goals and an assist in his last 4 matches, meanwhile Brighton’s last 7 goals were scored by different players**, showing everyone has an eye for goal.\n\nIt’s not the most gaudy form, but it’s enough form, with enough on the line, to have a goal fest on our hands.\n\nLast play review:\n\nRichmond -2.5 (-110) 1u ❌\n\n(One of those college basketball games: the better team doesn’t find the shots they need when it matters most. I actually has to take a break after this one, Richmond did everything they could to throw that game away)\n\nBOL if you’re tailing, and if not BOL in general",

The POTD hit easily, and all my parlay ladders hit. (The parlay ladders were Inter O 0.5 cards, Pisa O1.5 corners + Inter win, then another parlay with the same but O1.5 goals added, then another with all the same but also O2.5 cards added).\n\nNow for today..\n\nPick: Rayo Vallecano vs Osasuna - Rayo O4.5 corners & Rayo O3.5 Shots on goal @ 1.78\n\nWrite Up: We're again going to get some help from the notepad guy. Shoutout to u/Annual_Series_4124.\n\nRayo is hosting Osasuna today. According to the notepad guy stats, Rayo has O4.5 corners in last 16/18 matches at home, and O4.5 SOG in last 14/16 at home. Osasuna has conceded in 14/15 away games, indicating they tend to let teams play around in their side of the match.\n\nLooking at the current seasons averages, Rayo has an avg of 4.5 shots on goal per game and 6.1 corners per game. \n\nSome recent Rayo stats: 3 corners & 4 SOG against Getafe, 5 corners & 8 SOG against Elche, 8 corners and 7 SOG against Betis, 6 corners & 5 SOG against Mallorca, 7 corners & 3 SOG against Celta.\n\nLooking at Osasuna, they seem to tend to concede corners and SOGs, conceding 6 corners and 5 SOGs in their last match which was against Oviedo.\n\nThe POTD only allows 2 parlay pieces, but I will be adding Rayo to score as a side bet for 2.25 and then play around a bit with some Rayo corner & SOG ladders.\n\nBOL!",

      "text": "Pick of the day record 0-0 \n\nFirst time posting.\n\nPick: Song Yadong +3.5 -145 3 Unit bet\n\nNot usually a fan of spreads in mma due to questionable judges but this price is too great to pass up on. O’Malleys a great lengthy striker who’s known as a sniper. I think most people see this as a great win position to get O’Malley back into contention which I agree with. What I disagree with is people looking at Yadong as a complete walk over. Although hes struggled with top level comp so far hes shown signs of belonging with Cory or Petr and even beat Cejudo. Yadongs never been knocked out in the UFC which makes me feel better about this going to decision. I think the 3.5 spread is super favorable because of the first round honestly. Yadongs won 8/10 of his last 10 first rounds losing 2 to Petr and Kyler Phillips. Most mma media gave Yadong that round over Petr and Kyler Phillips is a notorious one round Andy. I think Song can come out maybe land a takedown or ever get the better of some exchanges before Sean gets his timing down and cruises to a win. Seans rhythm must be very off considering his last 2 fights were Merab so those camps could neutralize the striking a bit. BOL everyone",

In his last 8 games vs the Bruins, he went over the line 7 times(5 game streak with a goal vs Boston btw). The game will also be in Boston which Caufield loves to play at as an American player.

The team I picked to have a clean sheet won in a shootout 6-2. Terrible pick in hindsight but I stand by the pick for values sake, the closing line was +190 and the goals Inter conceded should not have been scored (1 from a corner and 1 from a goalkeeper blunder) and PSG had over 2 xG on 16 Shots and 5 Big Chances. IDC if that's a cope because it is lol.\n\n\nSoccer + Tennis | Serie A + Australian Open | Como v Torino / 09:00 EST + Osaka v Inglis 05:00 EST (~1hr from now)\n\n\nPick: Nico Paz 3+ Shots + Osaka v Inglis o17.5 Total Games (-119 DK)\n\n\n5u to Win 4.2u\n\n\nWrite up: Paz has hit this in 6/6 of his last 6 Serie A games as a starter. He will hit this again. I have laddered him up to 5 Shots today as I usually do. Torino play a low block and look to counter. Paz is a phenomenal high presser and is a great shooter from distance; I expect him to have at least 1 SOT from outside the box due to how low Torino sit. If you don't pay attention to tennis and/or don't trust my judgement play Como ML with Paz 3+ Shots as they have been in great form recently. (Torino are decent off the counter though, and recently beat Roma 3-2 in the Coppa Italia and Como just lost to AC Milan 3-1 who implemented a similar counterattacking style.) As for Inglis v Osaka both have gone to 3 Sets in both of their Aussie open games so far, I expect this one to as well. Inglis is an Aussie and Osaka has been flustered, especially in her last game. This will easily go over 2 sets, or at least it should. If it doesn't Inglis shouldn't lose worse than 6-,3, 6-3. These are both relatively free picks IMO, take Paz 4+ Shots + Inglis to Win a Set for better value but I wouldn't bet more than 2u on it.\n\n\nBOL!",

People like to say he hasn’t fought anybody, or he doesn’t have power or this and that…same thing different fighter. Justin has an impressive resume, but he has said himself that this could very well be his last fight, or the coming to an end, and we know how those fights usually go. Paddy is absolutely huge come fight night. He is younger and will be able to take more punishment. Now I do believe Justin is a better boxer and I do expect him to hit Paddy with a few clean shots. Justin throws very hard leg kicks to the calf, and I suspect he will use that to time Paddies entries. He should throw some heat behind wide hooks or overhands. Paddy throws good kicks to the body along with the head. I think he can create his own opportunities and land a few clean shots himself, leading to a takedown. I suspect Paddy having a bit of trouble getting Justin down, but he will be levels above Justin on the mat. Paddy is a black belt in BJJ and Justin is a newb. Justin does have better wrestling. Anyhow, I see Paddy winning this fight ITD by submission. Five rounds to do it. \n\n**Natalia Silva vs Rose Namajunas**\n\nNatalia Silva will be champion very soon. She is an extremely skilled flyweight. Her arsenal of legs kicks will overwhelm Rose in this fight. She has some of the best footwork I’ve seen inside women’s MMA. Silva controls space very well. These two have very similar styles tbh. They both like to play at distance and set traps / counter punch. It’s just that Silva is a few years younger and does it better. Thug Rose has been fighting for quite some time now, and her move up to 125 (flyweight) has her looking sluggish. It should still be a competitive fight, I just see Rose wearing the damage more as the fight lingers. She is tough as nails and will be an extremely hard out, type of fighter that dies on her shield. I see Silva winning this fight by control and prolonged damage for a decision win.\n\nSo happy UFC is back! BOL if tailing! Let’s get it 🥃.",

Let’s keep it going. UFC IS BACK! Sean O’Malley takes on Song Yadong on the Co-Main fight of the Event. Sean O’Malley is finally fighting again after coming off of back to back losses to Previous champion Merab Dvalishvili. Those losses were tough as Merab was able to hold him down and outlast him with his cardio but that’s not what we’re here to talk about. Sean O’Malley is taking a big drop in competition here fighting Song Yadong, as Song has only fought once a year for the past 3 years and his last fight was a pretty controversial one over Henry Cejudo who should have been retired a long time ago. Song’s last loss was to current champion Petr Yan where he got beat 2-1 in rounds and just got outstruck pretty easily. Sean O’Malley had a great fight against current champion Petr Yan a couple years ago, where he did get the decision win, although it was a very close fight and could’ve went either way. Sean O’Malley’s reach advantage and ability to go in and out of the pocket will give him a huge advantage as Song is more of a throw haymakers and pray guy. Sean O’Malley will be able to land many punches in volume and get out of the way and will likely play it safe as he just wants to secure a win by any means necessary. Given Song Yadong’s power, Sean probably won’t risk going for a big knockout as it could risk him getting knocked out himself. Even if Sean O’Malley goes out guns blazing beating Yadong up looking like he will get a knockout, I think it will still end up going to a decision, as Yadong is very tough, he’s never been knocked out in his UFC career. I believe Sean will be able to land a ton of strikes on Song Yadong, stay out of the way of his power, and he won’t have to worry about the wrestling takedown threat that caused him to lose to Merab Dvalishvili.\n\nTake Sean O’Malley By Decision!",

Just six months ago, he was the reigning champion, the vibrant \"Suga\" that everyone couldn't wait to watch. But then, he lost his title, and suddenly, the highlight reels were all about someone else. In the cutthroat world of the UFC, you can go from being a superstar to an afterthought in the blink of an eye.\n\nNow, his comeback isn't just another fight; it's the beginning of a new chapter in his story. His opponent, Song Yadong, is a fierce competitor, but this matchup seems tailor-made for O'Malley's redemption. Yadong is known for his aggressive style, charging forward and trading blows, which is exactly what O'Malley thrives on with his pinpoint accuracy and significant reach advantage. The pressure is squarely on O'Malley; he’s the one who needs to prove himself.\n\nI’m going with O'Malley to win here; this fight is a huge moment in his career. I believe Sean’s sharp counter-striking will give him the edge over Yadong’s aggressive style.\n\n\nJean Silva is an incredibly dynamic striker, known for his loose and creative style. Watching him play is a real treat, even if it sometimes leads him into some tricky situations. He keeps things interesting by switching from a tight guard to having his hands down, and he does this often enough to keep opponents guessing. Arnold Allen is going to be the toughest striker Silva has faced yet, but I still believe Silva will come out on top. I think his creativity, combined with his relentless pressure and the fact that Allen has had some time off, will really work in his favor. Arnold Allen will be the best striker that Jean Silva has fought, but I still think Silva wins. i thin his creativity combined with his pressure and Allen's layoff will work well for him.",

But if the odds are better on Novak to win in straight sets take it. The price was slightly better when I wrote my write-up (@1.73) but this is where they currently are and I’d consider a fair price to be around 1.50 so there’s still a lot of value in this in my opinion.\n\nDjokovic absolutely cruised past his first two rounds 3,2,2 and though were against fairly weak opposition in Martinez and Maestrelli he looked better than last year, where he reached the semis of all slams. His serving has been very strong but it’s his returning that has truly gone up a notch in my opinion after a drop in his return game last year that  caused matches to go one longer than thy should have. Limiting a big server like Maestrelli to just 55% first serves won is impressive and it seems like he’s found that groove that has seen him be the best returner of all time. In terms of conditioning which is often an issue at 38 years old, but he isn’t your average old man and has looked in great form, unlike US Open last year, still moving like the elite baseliner that he is. It’s obvious that this is one of his last chances to reach the elusive 25 grand slams, the hunger is present as always, and I expect him to sail through the tournament until reaching the big two of Alcaraz and Sinner. As a result, Djokovic knows he’ll need to be in top form to have a chance at defeating them so don’t expect him to drag out matches but instead expect a ruthless Novak to limit time spent on the court.\n\nVDZ has also had a good tournament so far, dropping just a set in victories over Nakashima and Shang. However, the No. 75 is the epitome of inconsistency plus this represents a bad match-up for the Dutchman. Botic is going to need his first serve percentage to be unrealistically high to hold regularly as the 45% second serves points won against Shang aren’t going to cut it against Novak. Against the Serb who is an elite returner is going to cause longer rallies with deep returns quite regularly. In this scenario Djokovic will have the upper hand more often than not as VDZ’s game is more focused around keeping points shorter from the baseline before the errors start to creep in when rallies get longer and more pressure is applied which Nole is the master at. I struggle to see just where Van de Zandschulp keeps it competitive enough to win a set except maybe scamming a tiebreak but he should be getting overwhelmed in all sectors of the game for another routine Novak win on his march to the title.

It was really frustrating when I originally had Midtjylland DNB instead of the Under. \n\n**Today's Event:** Premier League | Burnley vs Tottenham (16:00 GMT+2)\n\n**Pick:** Cristian Romero Over 0.5 shots@1.76 (7Red) | **Stake: 5u**\n\n**Write Up:** \n\n* Romero has had at least one shots in 9 of his last 11 games\n* Romero has had exactly 3 shots in his last three games (Which you can get 13x+ on)\n* Burnley Averages 19 shots against at home \n* He did not take a shot in the opening game of the season when Spurs won 3-0, but in the past games against them he has managed so: *2(Both on target), 1(Scored), 2*.\n\nThe guy has been playing even more “aggressive” than usual and I’m not just talking about his tacking, but also about how many attacking runs he makes. He is even on back to back games with goals! Burnley is also averaging the 2nd most corners against, which suits Romero nicely.\n\nBurnley are winless in 13 league games and they have conceded eight from their last four league games, but it could quickly have been way more with the chances Manchester United and Liverpool had in their last two games, where they combined gave up 61 shots! \n\nSpurs are not super hot at the moment either and the manager has been booed off a lot recently, it’s a  small surprise he hasn't been sacked yet. But they did beat Dortmund 2-0 at home on Wednesday and a lot of the players had good performances in that game, which has helped the situation a bit coming into this one.\n\nFor me this is crazy value! He almost has to go off injured in the first 10 minutes for him not to have a shot in this game with the way he plays at the moment. \n\nAlternatively you can try him to have a shot on target for 5x and up at most places. ",

Everything lined up just perfectly, but this Villarreal game will be different as they're **defensively sound** and playing at home.

Happy to help\n* Teams/Time: Falcons vs. Vitality (CS2) | 10:00 AM EST.\n\nWriteup:\n\n* NucleonZ is called up on short notice from Falcons academy team to replace their star rifler kyousuke due to visa issues. He had very limited notice and has very little experience as a pro so far with only 160 rounds lifetime on HLTV. In academy so far he was the standout player for Falcons Academy but was mostly playing low tier two/tier three competition.\n* Falcons are decent underdogs and should be bigger than this in my opinion. Vitality are on fire recently looking back to dominant form, this team without kyousuke is really going to struggle in my opinion to be competitive with such a hot Falcons team.\n* Vitality projected to pick their map first, very likely that they pick Inferno as their map choice in this series. If they don't go for Inferno then I think Dust 2 makes the most sense but Inferno is a no brainer.\n* Vitality were 5-2 h2h against Falcons in 2025 on Inferno, winning in rounds 87-69 in that time. Vitality are on a 4 map win streak on Inferno beating B8, NAVI, FaZe and GamerLegion on the map, a very impressive run of form. Inferno as said in previous write-ups has by far the least kills of any map in CS2 at the moment. Their is a ton of saving and this leads to much less kills then a normal CS2 map overall making it a great spot to target under.\n* NucleonZ has one series on Falcons so far, in that series they won 2-0 against Liquid but looked very shaky overall. NucleonZ averaged a .55 KPR the lowest on the entire team despite the win. He also was taking anchor roles and playing bad spots on CT side which you can see with his .50 KPR on CT side. With a .55/.6 KPR that gives him between 11-13 kills in an average map and that is assuming they win it which I think Vitality will blow them out of the water on Inferno\n* This line is set entirely off of his tier three/tier 2.5 stats against much weaker teams where he is the star on the team. This line is off by 3-4 kills in my opinion from where it should be on both maps, specifically going for map 1 though as he has 0 official games on Inferno as a pro, and of the two maps he has played on Falcons so far, Dust 2 was his weakest game, averaging a .48 KPR and dropping 10 kills in 21 rounds, despite Falcons winning 13-8\n\nNote: Would ladder this if you have that option, 13.5 and 12.5 are very worth playing as well!",

TOUCHDOWN $1.85 - WIN                                  \n**Write Up:** Today’s pick TOUCHDOWN comes here of a slight freshen and hence we come back in trip 200m to the 1600m. The reason for this is due to fires that ripped through their facilities, luckily causing no harm to the horses, however it means we missed a run the other week and have to shift back to this one.    \n     \nRegardless of this slight setback, TOUCHDOWN has still jumped out in between runs and did so very impressively, indicating he is going to pick up right where he left off tearing through the grades.    \n    \nThe stable are very bullish about his chances and have likened him to MR BRIGHTSIDE, one of Australia’s best recent horses, and so far their high opinion has been right.     \n     \nThis horse is extremely adaptable tactics wise, and can settle anywhere in the run and still be a major player. From barrier 4 I envision us either outside lead, or 1 out 1 back, both very advantageous positions on the Caulfield track.    \n     \nOur main danger YES I KNOW comes off 2 defeats to a horse called FIORENOT, a horse we comfortably handled a few runs back. YES I KNOW also backs up here after 7 days from a brutally run race, which is not a set up I like to follow.     \n      \nAll in all I think TOUCHDOWN is better than this grade of race, and I don’t think the slight setback is enough to worry us here against limited opposition, especially since we ourselves are still very much untapped in terms of a ceiling.

There were quite a few opportunities for both sides, but we end 0-0. This one is on me, bad play, on we move. \n\nBack to our SOT plays as we see West Ham host Sunderland in the early match of the day. The books have finally caught on to center back SOTs against West Ham, as I was expecting this to be closer to +200, but we're playing it anyways. West Ham concede the 2nd most SoTs in the league, behind Burnley. They also concede the most corners in the league, which allows our defenders to come forward. Last week they conceded a goal on three shots to Romero (Tottenham Center back), an SOT to Murillo (Forest Center Back) the previous week, and an SOT to all 4 Wolves defenders the week prior. They love to concede SOTs to defenders as they are not great in the air on defense. \n\nBallard is a 6'2\" defender for Sunderland, he is one of their main targets on set pieces, and has had a great season. He is coming off a 2 SOT match vs Palace last weekend. He also scored a goal on 4 shots with 2 SOTs in the reverse fixture earlier in the season. While Sunderland plays significantly better at home, I like them to make this a tough match for struggling West Ham. \n\nShop around, you might be able to find better value here.

But if it’s Auburn doing the serving, don’t be surprised if it’s a dish that gets sent back. \n\nWhile the Tigers (12-7) would love to get payback on Florida for last year’s heartbreaking loss in the Final Four, the team is simply lacking of many of the necessary ingredients. Not only is Auburn just 3-3 in SEC play, but the team is just 1-5 against teams currently ranked inside the Top 25. Furthermore, the team is just 1-3 in true road games and has lost 15 straight games in Gainesville dating back to 1996.\n\nAs for the Gators (14-5), it’s been quite the reverse of fortunes as of late. \n\nFollowing a 77-73 loss to then-No. 5 UConn, Florida fell to a surprising 5-4 through nine games. Suddenly, talks of a championship repeat were replaced with that of a championship hangover. Those murmurs only got louder when the team dropped its SEC opener to Missouri, 76-74, as 7.5-point favorites. \n\nSince then, flashes of last year’s squad that cut down the nets have been very much evident. \n\nWinning five straight in SEC play is already a tall task. But doing so against five Quad 1 opponents—including four ranked inside the NET ranking Top 50—is downright impressive. Not surprisingly, since Jan. 4, the Gators rank 2nd in the Barthag power ratings, per Torvik. It also certainly helps that the team has won 16 consecutive home games and 38 of its last 40 at the Stephen C. O’Connell Center over the last three years. \n\nOn Saturday, expect Florida’s sizzling offense to lead the way. \n\nThrough 19 games, the unit ranks 22nd in scoring (86.1 PPG), 40th in offensive efficiency (1.157), 100th in field-goal percentage (46.3%) and 348th in three-point shooting (28.6%). Over the team’s five-game win streak, those number have only increased, rising to 91 points per game on 49% shooting from the field (32.9% from beyond the mark) while ranking 2nd in adjusted offensive efficiency (133.8). That hot shooting should only continue against a Tigers defense that hasn’t played well all season—195th in opponent field-goal percentage (44.9%), 212th in defensive efficiency (1.065), 239th in opponent three-point shooting (35.0%) and 258th in scoring defense (78.0 PPGA)—and struggles even more on the road, conceding 83.9 points per game on a whopping 47.7% shooting (36.2% from deep). Not to mention, Auburn also ranks dead last in the SEC in opponent three-point shooting, allowing foes to connect on 38.8% of their opportunities from range in conference play. \n\nOn the other end of the court, look for home court advantage to have a major impact.\n\nOn the year, the Gators defense has been solid, ranking 39th in defensive efficiency (0.968), 53rd in opponent field-goal percentage (41.6%), 102nd in scoring defense (72.1 PPGA) and 155th in opponent three-point shooting (33.4%). However, the unit takes its play to a whole different level in front of the home fans, ranking 16th in defensive efficiency (0.871), 22nd in opponent field-goal percentage (38.0%) and 50th in scoring defense (64.8 PPGA). That should present some difficulties for a Tigers offense that can hold its own—27th in scoring (85.4 PPG), 33rd in offensive efficiency (1.166), 82nd in field-goal percentage (46.7%) and 235th in three-point shooting (32.6%)—but takes a step back when playing away from home, averaging just 78.5 points per game on 42.0% shooting (29.4% from beyond the arc). Add to that, the team has converted just 10-of-57 (17.5%) opportunities from long range over its last three outings. \n\nThe battle on the glass should be an X factor on Saturday evening. \n\nIf Auburn has one strength, it’s the team’s ability to come away with offensive rebounds, ranking 13th with 12.1 per game. Unfortunately, Florida just so happens to arguably be the best rebounding team in the nation, ranking 1st in rebounding margin (+18), 1st in offensive rebounding (15.3), 1st in total rebounding (46.5) and 5th in defensive rebounding (28.1) while ranking 12th in opponent offensive rebounding (7.3), 13th in opponent total rebounding (30.7) and 21st in opponent defensive rebounding (19.5). The team put that on full display last time out, out rebounding LSU to the tune of 50-30, including a 24-7 advantage on the offensive glass that resulted in 21 second-chance points. Not surprisingly, the Gators lead the nation in second-chance points (17.5 PPG; 100th percentile). That could spell disaster for the Tigers, considering they rank 283rd in opponent second-chance points (12.2 PPG; 24th percentile). \n\nExpect Florida to romp in the Swamp.\n\nBOL if tailing, and as always, please do so respectfully. One bet should not be enough to make you crash out all over Reddit.",

Hell no, he smashed his phone over this and wanted to continue being a Maverick. His last three games prove that his first game was 19 points, 15 boards and 12 assists but keep in mind that was when he was on an absolute stinker dropping below 20 points against Hornets and Jazz. The next two games when he was more established he dropped 45 and 35 points against Dallas.\n\nI like this a lot because against the Clippers the Lakers showed a lot of heart and they lost, meaning they are in the zone. The opposite can be said for the Mavericks they are way over their head imo beating the Jazz twice without Lauri Markenen which is very impactful as they have only won once with him out and that was a 15 point comeback, beat the Knicks when they were going through their slump which they could still be in (knicks were so bad Brunson called for a players only meeting and trade talks began about KAT). And now they beat GSW without Jimmy Butler who is just as valuable as Steph due to the rotations, plus Kuminga got injured in 9 minutes and had 10 points. \n\nAlso I want to say I think this because put in polite terms Max Christie is saying they cant guard me, players screaming and one and the fact they are very very active on the bench screaming.\n\nThe point is what happens a lot is teams develop an ego and gain confidence which is great, but they tend to relax and put their feet on the pedal. The opposite usually happens with a team that is hungry.\n\nKeep in mind this could all be a stretch as these guys are roleplayers and young players who are hungry for it. (Brandon Willians, Ryan Nembhard,  etc). Also another reason this could be a stretch is due to the circumstances, Cooper Flagg wants to show up to say I am the new face of the franchise and Max Christie definitely wants to show up.\n\nBut tbh I feel like home court advantage isn't really a factor here either, I expect a lot of cheers and Doncic Jerseys in this crowd as well. And remember this is one of the best scorers of all time, the only issue is whether he decides to assist instead but he can do both.",

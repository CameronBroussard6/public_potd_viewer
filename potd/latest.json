That was terrifying yet so much fun to watch. Never a doubt right? I was looking at the board for tomorrow and these two games really jumped out at me. I’m a big Bradley Basketball fan and know the MVC inside and out. This Belmont Bruins team is the cream of the crop this year in The Valley. The way they run their offense, move the ball, get open looks; it’s truly a thing of beauty. Casey Alexander has a good thing going down in Nashville and I don’t see the team from Richmond slowing them down whatsoever. Tyler Lundblade in my opinion is the best shooter in the country and it’s not even close. Remember the name. \n\nBelmont comes into this game 8-0 on the year and has honestly decimated every team they have faced. Don’t get me wrong this Richmond team is good and they are very well coached. But they lack so much on the defensive end that they simply won’t be able to keep pace with the efficiency of Belmont. \n\nBelmont effective offensive FG % sits at 4th in the country and their defensive effective FG% is 15th in the country. Meanwhile Richmond is 49th in offensive effective FG% and this is the big difference they are 143rd in defensive effective FG%. \n\nRichmond won’t be able to stop the Belmont train. I’m a fan of this team and that’s coming from a Bradley fan. I don’t look forward to playing them this year. \n\nTake Belmont ML.\n\nNow for the Texas Longhorns. I actually really like the build out of this team. They are the 5th oldest team in the country and have two blemishes on their record. A 15 point loss to Duke which nobody has been able to keep close with them and a 1 point heartbreaking loss to Arizona State. That ASU team I’m higher on than a lot of people. Both those losses are going to be great losses come selection time. Coming off a great win against the Will Wade NC State squad this Texas team is going to be coming home looking for another statement win. \n\nThis Virginia team on the other hand hasn’t really beat anyone. Northwestern is an okay win but I don’t see Northwestern getting out of the bottom half of the Big Ten. They also lost to Butler who’s mid at best. The one thing I do like is how they crash the offensive boards. Virginia is big. But they aren’t athletic. At least not as athletic as their opponent. \n\nI truly think we see the experience and veteran led Texas squad show up and take this game by 5 or more points. Tramon Mark and Jordan Pope have this uncanny ability to make timely shots over and over again and I think we see them show up and show out big time. \n\nTake Texas ML\n\nI personally handicapped Belmont as -7.5 favorites and Texas as -5.5 favorites. Belmont/Texas +140 is a beaut. \n\nLet’s make it 3 days in a row why don’t we. \n\nGood luck and let’s keep it going. \n\nBC",

      "text": "POTD Record: 5-1  \n\nNet Units: +23.76  \n\nLast Pick Thoughts: When I saw the score was 0-0 at half, I got a little nervous. I find it difficult to bet / predict on both Tottenham and Newcastle games. However, they both can score and that thought pulled through.  \n\nSport: English Premier League - Chelsea vs. Leeds @ 3:15pm EST  \n\nPick: Chelsea win + Over 1 goal = +110  \n\nWrite Up: I usually like taking the other side when one team (Chelsea) has a much busier and more competitive schedule than the other (Leeds). However, Chelsea seems to be “sharpening their tools,” lately and really finding their confidence and form. It appears to me that Neto and Estevao are really coming into their own in Chelsea uniforms, Enzo is incredible, Palmer is back (apparently). My only hope is that they don’t take their foot off the gas now that they’re against an easier opponent. A draw a man down to Arsenal is a huge result, now they have the opportunity to make a big early step in the title fight. I am concerned about the number of games they’ve played recently and Caicedo being suspended for this game. No team in the prem is a cakewalk (other than Wolves), but Chelsea, for being such a young team, already has quite a bit of experience under their belts competing for the top and they also have little “pressure” from the media to be winning the league, I think that benefits them. Maresca is also a fantastic manager at balancing workload and getting results.   \n\nSide Note: Surprise surprise, I’ve created a BuyMeACoffee. If you find my analysis useful, please feel free to donate:\n\n[https://buymeacoffee.com/5c2y4cxvy5e]\n\nDon’t bet more than you’re willing to lose. 5-1 is a great start, I suspect there will be an averaging out at some point.\n\nBOL!",

Vejmelka played poorly against the Sharks on Monday, so you may see their backup Vanecek.\n\nOn the other hand, the Ducks are onto their 3rd string goalie Ville Husso (maybe could argue 2nd string) as they’re out Dostal and Mrazek. Husso had a pretty good game on Monday against STL but STL missed a bunch of golden opportunities to score (like wide open nets bad).\n\nGood luck!",

Arsenal won 9 out of 10 home games and they scored 25 in 13 matches, conceded 7. They averaged almost two goals per game. Brentford scored 21 and conceded 20. They are good at home, weaker at away. But they might create some trouble for the hosts. Over 1.5 is my best option here.\n\n*  Leeds is number 18 at point table hosting Chelsea(3) today. Chelsea is unbeaten in their last 7 games in all competition, has the third best attacking record scoring 24 goals. While Leeds has the second worst attacking record scoring 13 goals. Leeds might create some chances, but I think Chelsea will at least manage to draw.\n\nI always try to be at the safe side. But, in sports betting; anything can happen. \n\nSo, Bet responsibly.

Hansi Flick’s trademark offside trap gave Atletico a chance to score the first goal of the game. Then shortly after, the two guys I highlighted in my writeup (Pedri/Raphina) managed to connect and respond. It was cookies from there. Another great read. \n\nEvent: Chelsea at Leeds (EPL) u/3:15pm EST\n\nPOTD: Chelsea to Win (-120)\n\nRead: Chelsea have really been getting themselves together as of late. They are coming off a hard fought draw as they hosted the league leaders Arsenal last time out. In a game including a first half red card which they played through, scored, and salvaged a point. Chelsea have only dropped points in two away games all season. One of which they drew 2-2 with Brentford back in September and then the next prem match that followed they lost 2-1 to Man United with a red card five minutes into the match. (I don't see them conceding two goals in this spot) Since then, they have won three away games in a row and have not conceded a single goal in any of them. Their defense has stepped up lately. Caicedo will not be available because of suspension. Cole Palmer is in the mix to play and potentially even start which is very positive.\n\nLeeds have conceded 25 goals and have only scored 13 of their own during this season through thirteen total games. At home they have been noticeably better defensively. Only conceding 7 goals in six games. Compared to conceding 18 goals in seven games away from home. This is my only worry in this game besides the Caicedo absence. Leeds are significantly better at home. They are also due unfortunately. Truth be told though Leeds are 2-1-7 in their last ten matches. They sit 18th in the table fighting to get out of the relegation zone. \n\nYes. Leeds have shown signs of life at home but, Chelsea is flying and with their form recently they will not be stopped here. Trust the boys in blue. \n\nBOL.",

Union Berlin did hold Bayern to a 2-2 draw just three weeks ago and have been the only team to take points off Bayern in the Bundesliga, but Bayern have both scored and conceded in their last five consecutive matches, meaning goals are guaranteed in both directions. Bayern lost 3-1 to Arsenal in the Champions League last week but bounced back with a 3-1 win over St. Pauli, proving they respond well to defeats. For Bayern, the pokal match is very important game as they would be aiming to win the whole thing. It's no surprise Bayern want to lift the cup since it's been lot of years since they last lifted it. Bayern's main 11 will play today against Union, and therefore Bayern should win this with score line of 2-1, 3-1, or 3-0.\n\n\nIf you found these picks helpful, tips or donations are greatly appreciated as they support the time and effort I put into creating them: [buy me a beer🍻](https://buymeacoffee.com/hercules.son.of.zeus)",

Their recent 3–1 win and consistent goal-scoring at home suggest an attacking approach from the EfB coaching staff, who know that their best chance lies in using the energy of Blue Water Arena to put pressure on FCK. Copenhagen arrive in a more fragile state, with head coach Jacob Neestrup openly admitting that the team has lacked “power and energy” after several poor away performances, yet he recently chose to highlight the side’s offensive strengths and stated that he wants to build on that rather than tighten defensively. The combination of Esbjerg’s motivation and confidence, FCK’s defensive vulnerability, and a coach who publicly prioritises attacking play despite setbacks creates the conditions for an open match with tempo, space, and chances at both ends — strongly supporting a bet on Over 2.5 goals.",

Most recently, she was able to beat Eva Lys, a top-40 player, on this surface (Indoor Hard).\n\nWith this, the skill gap should be huge, and I'm expecting Sonmez to win in straight sets.",

What a match that was, we were treated to a real spectacle. Bummer that Wilson didn't look to shoot much of the game and his teammates didnt pick out his runs in the box. 9 goals were scored and our guy wound up with one assist and no shots. We move on, sorry we lost, but thankful for a great game. I've mentioned this before, but my plays are intended to boost the enjoyment of watching some great matches. Giving us something to root for. We won't hit them all, but we try to hit as many as possible. \n\nWe stay in London today where 1st Place Arsenal hosts 11th place Brentford. These mid-week matches are always tricky, as coaches will want to rotate without losing synergy and giving up points. I think Arsenal will be looking towards the weekend where they play at Villa and try to rotate as much as possible. Brentford on the other hand will want to play spoiler as they are not playing in Europe this season and I expect most of their 1st team. \n\nI was shocked to see this line at even money and wouldn't be surprised if this moves quickly. Thiago has had a fantastic start to the season, filling the void for Brentford left by the parting of Mbuemo and Wissa. He's got 11 goals and is a striker in form. He's averaging over 2 SOTs per match, and has only failed a SOT in 3 matches making him 10/13. \n\nArsenal has a great defense, but we also bet against it over the weekend with success. I expect Arsenal to rotate their already injured backline even more here. I love this play because Thiago has hit SOTs against the big teams all season, landing 3 SOTs on Liverpool and 1 on Man City. He's also hit 3-2-2 SOTs in his last 3 matches. Arsenal should win this match, but I'll gladly take Thiago to get 1 SOT at even money!\n\nBOL!",

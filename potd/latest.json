      "text": "7-6\nPlus 3 units\n\n\n### The Pick: Texas A&M Aggies (Money Line -130) Bet 2 units\n\n\n**Game:** #3 Texas A&M (11-0) vs. #16 Texas (8-3)\n**When:** Today (Friday) at 4:30 PM PST\n**Where:** DKR-Texas Memorial Stadium (Austin, TX)\n**TV:** ABC\n\n\nHere is the breakdown of why the Aggies are the smart play to ruin Texas's night in Austin.\n\n\n### 1. The Mismatch in the Trenches\nThe biggest reason A&M stays undefeated tonight is their defensive front. The Aggies rank **2nd in the nation in sacks and tackles for loss**. They wreak havoc in the backfield.\n* **Texas's Weakness:** The Longhorns' offensive line has been \"leaky\" and inconsistent all season.\n* **The Result:** Texas QB Arch Manning has struggled when pressured, making decision errors and taking sacks. A&M’s pass rush will force him off his spot early and often, killing drives before they start.\n\n\n### 2. Quarterback Dynamics: Reed vs. Manning\n* **Texas A&M (Marcel Reed):** Reed has been a revelation. He is a dynamic dual-threat who extends plays with his legs. In rivalry games where emotions run high and plays break down, a QB who can scramble for a first down is the ultimate equalizer. He adds a rushing dimension that the Texas defense has historically struggled to contain.\n* **Texas (Arch Manning):** While talented, Manning is still young and prone to \"rookie\" mistakes, especially against elite defenses. He has thrown 7 interceptions this year, and A&M’s defense is designed to bait inexperienced QBs into bad throws.\n\n\n### 3. Momentum and \"The Spread\"\n* **Texas A&M** is a wagon right now. They are **11-0** and playing with the confidence of a team destined for the College Football Playoff. They have learned how to win close games (like the comeback against South Carolina).\n* **Texas** is 8-3 and just **3-8 Against The Spread (ATS)** this season. They are consistently overvalued by Vegas because of the brand name \"Texas.\" They have failed to cover in their last 3 games as underdogs.\n\n\n### 4. The Stakes\nTexas A&M is playing for a guaranteed spot in the SEC Championship and a potential #1 overall seed. Texas is effectively playing for pride. While \"spoiler\" motivation is real, the Aggies have everything to lose, which usually translates to a sharper, more disciplined performance from a Mike Elko-coached team.\n\n\n**Bottom Line:** You are getting an **11-0** team at nearly even money against an **8-3** team just because the game is on the road. Don't overthink it. Back the better defense and the better record.\n\n\n**Prediction:** Texas A&M 31, Texas 24.",

[Here is the new document which started tracking 09/01/25](https://www.potd.lol/today?utm_source=redditpost).*\n\n**My Record:** 69-61-3 (-2.00u)\n\n**Today’s Pick:** Jonas Valanciunas o7.5 points (Spurs vs Nuggets)\n\n**Odds:** -110\n\n**Units:** 2.4u\n\nTip off is 6:10pm PST. I am staying with my Valanciunas points system today as planned. The line for this match is 237.5 with Spurs center Victor Wembanyama sidelined due to injury (calf). Its the forth match for these teams in the NBA Cup and both the Nuggets and Spurs are sitting at 2-1 in the same group, with the Nuggets at a +3 point differential. So a lot of parity if the Spurs had a healthy Wemby. \n\nEven without Wemby this should be a night with a lot of buckets. Valanciunas has hit this line 2 out of the 3 NBA Cup matches this season. Should this game become lopsided in favour of the Nuggets I could see Jokic's minutes reduced like it happened NBA Cup match on 11/07. A match where Warriors star Steph Curry was inactive. The spread is currently -8.5 and in that 11/07 match the spread was -9.5. \n\n**Previous Pick**: Jonas Valanciunas o7.5 points (Nuggets vs Grizzlies) ❌\n\n***Track my sports betting picks on [POTD.LOL](https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/EthicalGambler-U6cnjV?utm_source=mdembed&utm_campaign=EthicalGambler) (since 09/01/25).***",

[Bo3.gg+1](https://bo3.gg/matches/eternal-fire-vs-sparta-28-11-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* The general prediction sentiment (e.g. some community polls/odds) still heavily favor EF.

      "text": "POTD Record: 2-1\n\n2 wins in a row!\n\nVegas Golden Knights vs Montreal Canadiens (Hockey/NHL) at 4pm EST\n\nOver 5.5 goals (-135)\n\nWrite-up:\n\nCanadiens average 3.43 goals per game this season\n\nGolden Knights average 3.09 goals per game this season\n\n\nCanadiens have hit that line 10 times in their last 10 games. The team either score a lot or give up a lot of goals. Vegas has also hit that line in their last 3 games and 5 in their last 10 but all their other games finished with 5 goals and never less. Reason why I'm confident in this pick is because Montembeault is in net for the Canadiens and he's been atrocious. Both teams have back to back the next day so I expect Vegas to play their backup goalie. Carl Lindbom should be starting for Vegas with a .872(not good for an NHL goalie) save percentage and he gives up 3.16 goals on average this season. Even if it's Akira Schmidt starting I would go for over 5.5 because of Montembeault who gives up a lot of goals. Montembeault is supposed to be Montreal's #1 but he's been playing pretty bad this season and is quickly losing his spot as #1. He has a .852(very bad for an NHL goalie) save percentage and gives up 3.71 goals on average this season. Mark Stone is also back for Vegas so more firepower for them and he is also a Canadiens killer (23 points in 27 games played vs the Canadiens). Jack Eichel also loves to put up points vs the Habs (24 points in 24 games). Same thing for some of the Canadiens players versus Vegas : Suzuki has 10 points in 10 games versus them and Caufield has 5 points in 5 games. All in all I expect both teams to score a lot!\n\n\nBOL!",

The Bucks are on a downward spiral and simply haven't looked good, while the Knicks are building positive momentum and are just playing a better, more cohesive brand of basketball right now.\n\nI'm backing the Knicks to cover at home in a spot I love. This is a quick revenge game after the Knicks lost in Milwaukee 121-111 earlier in the season, and now they get to host at Madison Square Garden. Beyond the revenge narrative, this game is critical for the NBA Cup standings, and point differential is a key tiebreaker. I expect the Knicks to be fully motivated not just to win, but to win by a margin.\n\nAnd I like this play regardless of Giannis Antetokounmpo's status. The Knicks' current form and the situational spot are strong enough for me to believe they would cover.\n\nI'll be honest, I had a hard time deciding between this spread, Jalen Brunson over 29.5 points, and Cade Cunningham over 29.5 points—both of those player props were my other favorite plays of the day. However, the Knicks spread ultimately checks a couple more boxes for me, so that's the official pick.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x4g0vtlafz3g1.png?width=341&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6d1cae8dcc6975739b7d0978cee5a4687e93ffe\n\nLet's try to make it three in a row.

Sonderjyske is at 5th in the table with 7W4D5L and 26 goals scored vs 23 conceded. Viborg is at 6th place with 7W1D8L and 26 goals scored vs 24 conceded. Sonderjyske has BTTS in their last 8/10, O2.5 last 5/6 and no clean sheet in last four, while Viborg has BTTS in their last 6/10 and O2.5 in last 8/9. BTTS has hit in their last 8/10 H2H and O2.5 has hit in the last 4/5 H2H.\n\nThis seems like a goal fest, so I'm taking a relatively safe BTTS at 1.56 for my POTD. You can add BTTS + O2.5 goals for 1.8 odds if you want. Viborg hasn't lost in their last 12 H2H so you can even do Viborg/draw + BTTS + O2.5 for 3.25 if you are a degen. 3.6 if you add O6.5 corners (they average about 8 and 9 corners per game). Would not really recommend this 4 leg parlay tho lol.",

It is Friday evening at the game time, perfect for a full house.\n\nThe players on the list are actually decent, 3-4 played Eurobasket, and others are experienced club players.\n\nNetherlands has a few interesting names, but they lack the height and are going to be too dependent on their threes shooting. Latvia, too, but Latvia has better options under the basket, so they should get plenty of second chances. \n\nTo put spread at 7 is a bit too low, I expect 15+ for Latvia.",

Soccer and tennis are the sports I watch the most and am the most knowledgeable about so if this goes well expect my contributions to be made in those sports.\n\nFor our first pick I’ve chosen Como to win at home. Not only are they undefeated in their last 11 they are undefeated at home since May. I’ve been riding this team with some great picks since last season and they have only upped their level under manager (and retired legend) Cesc Fabregas. Most recently, they won away from home against Torino. That game they were priced at +125 and won comfortably in a game that ended 5-1.\n\nComo boasts a solid core with in form defenders Jacobo Ramon and Diego Carlos as well as attacking prowess with Nico Paz and Jayden Addai who’s bagged 3 goals in his last 2 games.\n\nOn the opposite side we have Sassuolo who have been pretty consistently middle of the pack for a few seasons now. Their most recently game was a 2-2 draw with 16th place Pisa who have been struggling. Of note is that they are undefeated away from home in their last four but these results have come against similarly middle of the pack teams or struggling sides. \n\nOverall, Como has conceded only 7 goals in 12 games as compared to Sassuolo’s 14. Expect Como to control the pace of the game and come out on top.",

That being said, there were a few options I was looking at, but we travel to the second level in England for today's pick, specifically: Oxford.\n\nAnd it isn't the home side we are supporting today, because Oxford's season has not been close to what they would have liked: They are caught up in a relegation battle whilst sitting in 21st. Now let's look at their most recent form: If we rank the table purely on results in their last 5 they are also sitting 21st, only getting 3 points out of 5 matches. It's not like there's a big difference in home or away games as they've only picked up 7 points in their 8 home matches this season, scoring only 8 times and conceding 12 times. Cameron Brannagan, one of Oxford's topscorers with (only) 4 goals is out of the running with an injury and missed Tuesday's matchup against Norwich (23rd) that ended in a 1-1 draw. Oxford got away with a point there because of a 95th minute winner, against a relegation side..\n\nNow let's take a look at Ipswich. After being relegated from the Prem last season they are desperately trying to get back up. They are currently sitting in a playoff spot (4th) after a bad start to the season. They haven't lost in their last 5 matches and dominantly dealt with Hull on Tuesday. They have 4 players available that sit on 5 or more goal contributions, compared to Oxford who only have 20-year old Will Lankshear.\n\nAnyone can win against anyone is what people always say about the Championship, but I don't see Oxford winning against Ipswich today.\n\n**Best of luck if tailing!** 🍀\n\n**PS:** If you want you can check my record and units won on [https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/OliveCritical5134-qXXxJZ](https://www.potd.lol/handicapper/OliveCritical5134-qXXxJZ)\n\nIf you're enjoying the picks and write ups and are looking to support me you could do so here: [buymeacoffee.com/olivecritical5134](http://buymeacoffee.com/olivecritical5134)",

Dunstone's draws were incredibly precise in the semis and it looks like he's shaken whatever was holding him back earlier in the week after getting a nearly miraculous berth into the semis. Lott is also looking very strong and this final will be a very tightly fought battle. The line on this matchup is a huge overreaction to recent results. Team Dunstone are ranked ahead of Team Jacobs everywhere you look for this season so to get +1.5 with the number two team in the world is huge. Before this event, Dunstone had beaten Jacobs in four straight matchups. I think Dunstone has the better lineup in front of him and each of these final matches should remain very close, regardless of who wins.",

That brought me to **9 wins in a row**, and I'm looking to make it 10 with today's pick! \n\nI don't have a super long write-up for this play, as I had limited time and odds are dropping fast. However, I don't believe that Mejia should be this big an underdog in these conditions. He loves playing on altitude clay (look at my Mejia pick from earlier in the week for more details about that), and has breezed through his opening two matches in straight sets. Juan Pablo Varillas has been slowly building up some momentum after coming back from injury, but he might be low on stamina after making it all the way to the final in Guayaquil last week. Both players have earned similar performance ratings in their opening two matches, and I believe that Mejia's backhand and serve are stable enough to keep up with Varillas's firepower. There isn't quite enough value for this to be a 2-unit play considering the risk involved, but I believe that a fair price for Mejia would be around +110.\n\nNote: The [POTD Capper Tracker](https://potd.lol), which you may remember from its Google Sheet days, is finally back in a cleaner, more robust website format!

On the other hand, I would still rate the Strikers a pretty decent team & they need to win this to cement their run to the playoffs.

For some Black Friday football action well be going with a SEC rivalry showdown between the Texas A&M Aggies (11-0) and the Texas Longhorns (8-3). The Aggies come into this one with a perfect record so far and they have played well on the road this year with road wins over Missouri, LSU, Arkansas and a very impressive road win in South Bend against Notre Dame. Although having an 11-0 record the Aggies have not clinched a spot in the SEC Championship game yet so they wont be letting off the gas at all in this one. Texas comes into this one with 8 wins and three losses against Ohio State, Georgia, and an embarrassing loss to a poor Florida team. In the Longhorns last game against Arkansas despite winning that game they showed their fatal flaw that has been a problem for them all year which is struggling to stop the quarterback run as Arkansas quarterback Taylen Green averaged over 9 yards a rush before exiting the game with injury so I think the Aggies and Marcel Reed will exploit this weakness as he is an explosive dual threat quarterback and averages over 5 yards a rush and has 6 rushing touchdowns on the year so I see him using his legs against the Longhorns in this one. This Aggies offense is a balanced offense having success in the run and the pass this year, averaging 270 passing yards per game and almost 200 rushing yards per game. They are 10th out of 136 FBS schools in points scored per game with over 38 points scored per game and they face a Texas defense that also has weaknesses in their secondary allowing over 240 passing yards per game but they are good at forcing turnovers. If the Aggies can limit turnovers in this one I see them coming out of Texas Memorial Stadium with a win to solidify a perfect 12-0 regular season. Texas A&M Defense:\n\n* 3,321 total opponent yards (301.9 YPG)\n* 236 points allowed (21.5 PPG),\n* 39 sacks (3.5 per game)\n* 3 INTs (0.3 per game).\n* A&M’s pass rush is elite (top-5 in sack rate at 11.9%), forcing negative plays on 12% of rushes and collapsing pockets quickly.\n* They’ve limited opponents to 183 passing YPG (best in SEC). Weakness: Secondary struggles in coverage without pressure (allowing 6.1 YPA when sacks are missed), leading to just 3 picks despite 56.5% opponent completion rate allowed. Texas Defense:\n* 3,691 total opponent yards (335.6 YPG)\n* 220 points allowed (20.0 PPG)\n* 37 sacks (3.4 per game)\n* 11 INTs (1.0 per game).\n* Texas leads the nation in turnover margin (+8 from INTs alone),\n* They’ve held 7 of 11 opponents under 300 total yards, excelling vs. the run (allowing 3.9 YPC). Weakness: Vulnerable to mobile QBs. Opponents average 85 rushing YPG). Marcel Reed is an elite mobile QB.\n\nPrediction: 30-24 Aggies\n\nLast pick:🏈Chiefs -3💩Whenever the Cheifs needed a stop they just couldnt get one.\n\nBest of luck to everyone tailing and remember to bet responsibly! Super stoked with my first collab play with the college football king u/amphetaphene in this one, hope everyone has a great Black Friday!!🍀💜🐉\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jh40w6sr9x3g1.jpeg?width=1088&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=79891daff5f0edc05896bf56e1139e742aa95ddc",

I knew all they needed was a first-half goal push.\n\nToday's Pick: **Josh Hart RA Over 12.5 @ 1.74 2U** (Bet365)\n\n**NBA | Bucks @ Knicks** \n\nJ Hart has been quite consistent with playmaking and rebounding when he is given 30+ minutes. And this game will be quite important for the Knicks to clinch the group stage of the NBA Cup. So there will be a lot of playmaking. Knicks also have a good FG% in their last 10 games, with almost 50% of the attempts being on the basket(good for assists). Now analysing Hart stats without OG Anunoby (Should increase his usage and rebound):  \nvs MIA: 5R+9A (14 RA)  \nvs DAL: 10R + 5A (15RA)  \nvs ORL: 5R + 2A (7RA)  \nvs BKN: 12R + 7A (19RA)  \nvs CHA: 8R + 7A (15RA)  \nHit 4/5 of the O12.5 RA\n\nI was originally planning on taking KAT's rebound over, but it is too inflated. Hart has the second-best defensive rebounding record in the Knicks.  Bucks are among the top teams to allow rebounds, so that's an extra information to make the probability of this bet more hittable.

He also performs significantly better on the road, averaging 15 points away from home if you exclude the Minnesota game, where he struggled in limited minutes. \n\nLast season, he scored 10 and 11 points in his two matchups against the Lakers, so if you prefer a safer option, you can take his line at 10+ points for a smaller payout.\n\nTo sum it up: he has scored at least 9 points in every game this season except one, he’s in a strong matchup, he tends to play better on the road, and he’s going up against his former team. To me, this looks like an easy over, the books are simply undervaluing Max Christie.",

Bet 3U\n\nWriteup: For the Black Friday game, we have the Philadelphia Eagles hosting the Chicago Bears. In all honestly, I’m all in on the Bears on this one. I think they have a real shot to win this game. I love Bears +7 in this spot, but we are going to deviate slightly with the same thought process as the market is pretty split on the spread, but there is massive support on the total under. \n\nThe Bears offense looks as good as it has all season. They are firing on all cylinders and looks like the have a legitimate game plan and vision, both with the run and the pass. With that being said, the Eagles defense also looks as good as it has all season. This is going to be a huge battle, strength on strength.\n\nThe big difference will be the Eagles offense against the Bears defense. The Eagles offense has no vision, no cohesion, no identity. The fact that Saquon Barkley has shown such little explosion this season is insane. With this, the Eagles WRs, who have a top 3 1-2 punch at the position in the league, have been wildly inconsistent to the point that Devonta Smith is taking over as the WR1 in recent weeks. To top it off, Jalen Hurts has not been playing good football. Put all that together and add on the fact that the Bears are getting back their top defender in Jaylon Johnson, and this spells trouble. \n\nGame script is going to be huge in this one. The Eagles are going to need to find a way to play while having the lead and start running out the clock in the 4th in order to feel even somewhat comfortable. If they start playing from behind, it may start to spiral out of control. In either scenario, I think the Bears defense, who has been top 10 all season, keeps the Eagles in check throughout the game and limit them under 26.5 points. \n\nRemember to only bet what you can afford to lose, and BOL!",

Taking the over 5 Asian line for safety, where 5 corners from Newcastle guarantees money back. Lets hope we hit this.\n\n*Personally, I am trying a ladder till \\~7 corners for Newcastle.*\n\nHope we get the W & BoL",

For example, at the Australian Open she caused Anisimova quite a few problems, in a match where she could have won the first set. Here, in her opening match, she cruised past Arango, only facing some difficulty in the second set when her serve dropped below her usual standard. However, she possesses one of the best serves in the world, and I don’t think she will concede breaks easily today.\n\n\nElena Rybakina comes into this match after winning the Australian Open title, where she defeated Sabalenka in the final. She is an exceptional athlete, but I expect a slight dip in her level. Often, after winning a Grand Slam trophy, players tend to be more relaxed at the next tournament and somewhat less motivated. I believe this could be the case here as well, leading to a more modest performance.\n\n\nTherefore, I believe Wang will not lose by more than a 5-game margin, and my prediction is based on this idea.",

ManU are going for their 5th straight win and currently sit in 4th in the premier league standings. They will be motivated to keep this streak going. After this match tomorrow, they will be off until 2/23, so they have a bit of a break coming up after this one. \n\nSince coming back from injury, Bruno has been outstanding. In their 6 matches played in 2026, he has scored or assisted in all of those games.\n\nWest Ham have actually played pretty well as of late and are also equally motivated to get out of the relegation zone. These two teams played in December at Old Trafford and they drew 1-1. With that being said, ManU controlled a lot of that game and I think it’s safe to say this team is currently playing with a different confidence level than they were in December.\n\nGood Luck!",

Got a touch sweaty as Malen had a bunch of shots blocked, but he came through for us again. Appreciate the love friends, and good to see a lot of you cashed yesterday! Let's see if we can start a streak. \n\nWe're playing back one of our favorite plays today and backing Enzo Fernandez to land a shot on target. Enzo, as many of you know, is one of my favorite players to back and fits the style of player I love to back to a T. He's always working hard, chases every fast break, takes free kicks frequently, crashes the box well, and isn't afraid to shoot from distance. This is lower odds than I usually like to take him, but I absolutely love this spot for him so we're not going to overthink it. \n\nLeeds sit 16th in the table and sit right at 16th defensively as well. They just conceded 6 SOTs at home to Forest and 9 SOTs at home to Arsenal. The reverse fixture at Leeds ended 3-1 in favor of Leeds, and while Enzo didnt have an SOT he did have 3 shots which is rare for him to not find the target. \n\nEnzo has been on a tear lately and is in the running (maybe favorite?) for midfielder of the year in the EPL. He has scored 4 goals in his last 7 matches, and landed an SOT in each of his last 3 matches. I expect Chelsea to dominate the ball here at home and im turn get their shots in. I'm also thinking there's a chance Palmer is rested in this game and Enzo will play further forward where he has thrived this season. Even if he plays further back, I still see him getting his shots in. \n\nBOL!",

Both sides rely heavily on crosses, set pieces and constant pressure in the final third. Recent matches for both clubs have regularly produced high corner counts due to their aggressive styles and open games. With plenty of attacking talent on the pitch, this contest should see many goalmouth situations. Over 10.5 corners @ 2.38 looks excellent value.",

Great Britain won 9-6 in the round robin when these two teams played and I expect something similar in the bronze medal match.",

Their forwards seem to be in great form, with the always incredible **Bowen scoring 3 goals in the last 5 games against Man United,** while **Summerville's scored in 5 games on the bounce in all competitions.** In contrast, while Manchester's attack certainly isn't looking too shabby at the moment, they still have **issues fitting the likes of Sesko into their system.** Here's an even better stat though: **Manchester United have lost all of their last 3 games at West Ham's ground.**\n\nThis pick is essentially **West Ham to win or draw,** but my book offers slightly higher odds on the Asian handicap versus the +105 on the double chance.
